<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the United Party are annoyed because they have nothing to complain about as far as this Budget is concerned. They are annoyed because the public is glad. If the public had been annoyed, they would have been pleased! They thought that in view of the fact that they would be given a terrible trouncing in this House if they confined themselves to a debate on the Budget, they should introduce another subject to steal the thunder in this debate. They then came along and violated every tradition that exists in South Africa with reference to Budget debates by getting the seconder, the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), to make a speech here on a subject which is dynamite in the present political situation, namely the Poqo movement. But then they dropped it like a hot brick and referred to financial matters. But what happened there was precisely what we felt would happen. Sir, when one searches the newspapers of Tuesday for a report on the speeches of members of the United Party with regard to finance, one does find a report about the speech of the hon. member for Constantia although he made little reference to financial matters. He discussed many matters which have nothing to do with the Budget as such. In the <i>Cape Times</i> of yesterday morning one does not even find a brief report to the effect that &#x201C;Mr. Plewman also spoke&#x201D; or that &#x201C;Mr. Moore also spoke&#x201D; or that &#x201C;Mr. Emdin also spoke&#x201D;. They only gave a little publicity to the hon. member for Pinetown because he had also had something to say about Poqo.</p>

<p>I hope hon. members have learnt their lesson from what has happened on this occasion and that it will not happen again in the future. The <i>Cape Argus</i> was unable to conceal its wrath with regard to this matter, and this is what they said about the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It may be traditional, as Mr. Percy Plewman reminded the Assembly last night, to confine speeches on the first day of the Budget debate to matters fiscal, but it is doubtful whether it is sound debating practice for parliamentary Opposition to adhere to tradition once one of its own frontbenchers has tossed a subject Like Poqo into the discussions, and yet this is exactly what the United Party did yesterday.</block>

<p>Have you not had enough yet?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) that I will pay him the compliment of taking more notice of him than of either the <i>Cape Times</i> or the <i>Cape Argus,</i> not that he deserves it, but I shall nevertheless do so. Hon. members opposite carried on in this debate with their Poqo stories and they did ultimately come to the question of finance in a completely oblique way. The public is not even aware of the fact that they discussed financial matters, and when they did discuss financial matters we heard divergent points of view and a number of conflicting statements from the other side. I just want to mention a few of the hon. members concerned. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) revealed his typical bookkeeper&#x2019;s mentality here. He only wants the profit and loss account to balance. He does not know that a Budget is something in which the whole of the country&#x2019;s financial and economic planning is set out. Then we come to the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) who sought to compare incomparable things. He says that in 1960-2 there was a surplus of R 10,000,000 more than the Minister anticipated; that for that reason the anticipated surplus for this year is also greater and that the surplus for 1963-4 will also be greater than the Minister tells us. Sir, I cannot understand the hon. member&#x2019;s logic. Here we are dealing with three separate years, and the results achieved in one year have little to do with the results in other years. His logic is like that of a person who studied logic and who failed his examination because he had written: &#x201C;Some dogs are white; my dog is a white dog, therefore my dog is some dog.&#x201D; The hon. member went on to say that we should follow the American example in our budgetary policy, namely their policy of so-called deficit budgeting on the lines of the Budget that they are about to introduce and many other budgets that they have introduced before. Does the hon. member not know that in America there is not a separate Loan Account and a separate Revenue Account? No separate accounts are kept and if America has a surplus, then her revenue exceeds her capital expenditure plus her current expenditure. On that basis South Africa has never had a surplus budget either; on that basis we have always had a deficit budget throughout all the years since 1910. Then I want to remind the hon. member that people in America are being warned from day to day that this new Kennedy budgetary policy is going to lead to inflation and to an increase in the price of gold, something which we would welcome, of course, but about which the Americans go into a frenzy. Mr. Speaker, if we strip the argument of the United Party with regard to this Budget of all these little <span class="col_3509-3510" refersTo="page_0329"/>trimmings, their criticism boils down to two points, or rather one point together with another point that flows from the first. The one is that we are overtaxing the people and that we have systematically overtaxed them for a number of years, and the second is that the economy of the country is not being stimulated sufficiently. I shall come back to that point later on.</p>

<p>First of all I just want to say to the Minister that we want to congratulate him and the Government on a very fine and balanced Budget which serves its purpose excellently, and that is to stimulate private consumption and to combat cost inflation. This Budget is realistic and fully meets the requirements of present-day circumstances in South Africa. The Budget has been received very well in all circles except one and that is in the parliamentary front of the United Party, but their own constituents are highly satisfied with this Budget. I have numbers of quotations here from which I could prove that, but I do not propose to detain the House long by reading out quotations. I want to refer just briefly to one and that is Reuter&#x2019;s financial editor, in London, who says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">So far as it goes, the South African Budget seems to have everything. None of its changes are sweeping, but all of them are in the direction that should help South African business and the taxpayer. The key is the Finance Minister&#x2019;s remark that stimulation of consumer demand is desirable, particularly as the balance of payments and the foreign reserves are so strong that any resultant increase in imports can be easily absorbed.</block>

<p>I still have a great deal of other comment here on the Budget, but I leave it at that for the moment. Before I go on to deal with the United Party&#x2019;s specific criticism I just want to add this. Financially South Africa is very strong. To some extent we are practically what one might call an oasis in the financial desert of the Western world. We have gold reserves amounting to 77 per cent and but for the fact that money is deliberately being sent out of this country to help along our short-term market and that other measures have been taken by the Reserve Bank to assist the shor-tterm market, this 77 per cent might very well have been 95 per cent or more, while in the Western world the average is only between 12 and 13 per cent. The fact that we are in this position to-day is a tremendous achievement. In the United States, for example, they only have 16,000,000,000 dollars in gold reserves as against foreign obligations amounting to 21,500,000,000,000 dollars. Actually it is a miracle that a country such as the U.S.A. which finds itself in this precarious position should be able to dictate to the whole of the Western world in matters such as the price of gold, for example, and I hope that at some time or other the world will be able to shake off the hold which the U.S.A. has on it. In passing I just want to ask the Minister if any attention has ever been given to the question of selling our gold here ourselves. Would it not pay us better to build up own own gold market here? Does our gold turnover hot justify such a step?</p>

<p>I have said that the United Party&#x2019;s criticism amounts to two main points and a few subsidiary points. I want to summarize their criticism as follows: Their criticism in the first place is that in the present financial year revenue was deliberately underestimated in order to be able to show this surplus of R28,000,000; the second criticism is that revenue has again been underestimated for 1963-4 and that there will again be a big surplus, and the third is that in these circumstances much greater tax concessions should have been made because the concessions which in fact have been made will not stimulate our economy sufficiently. Let us consider these three points separately: As far as their first objection is concerned, namely that taxpayers have been overtaxed in the present financial year and that is why there is a surplus of R28,000,000; assuming that this figure is quite correct, it only represents a variation of less than 3 per cent in relation to the total budget. The hon. member for Constantia has levelled the reproach against us that we are unable to budget accurately enough, but when the United Party was in power the difference was as much as 10 per cent or higher. The estimates of the United Party Government were out by as much as 10 per cent both with regard to revenue and with regard to expenditure. It was a mixed up affair and nobody knew, even approximately, what the country&#x2019;s revenue or expenditure was going to be. Hon. members of the United Party conveniently forget that for the year 1962-3 we budgeted for a total expenditure of R824,300,000, on which there was a saving of R26,349,000. When this amount is deducted from the surplus, practically no surplus remains. On Loan Account the saving was R21,300,000, and over and above that the Minister, in order to cope with the surplus on the short-term money market, caused more Treasury bills to be sold than it was necessary to do, and that is why we have a surplus.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to worry about the Loan Account at this stage; I want to refer more particularly to the current account. Instead of criticizing this surplus of R28,000000 hon. members ought to congratulate the Government and the various Departments on having saved R26,000,000 on Current Account. The hon. member for Parktown says that if money is given to Government Departments they are inclined to spend all of it. Here the contrary is proved. The officials had the power to spend R26,000,000 more than they did spend, but they did not do so, and this amount is being re-deposited into the Treasury. That is why we have this surplus of R28,000,000 this year. Sir, the hon. member for Constantia and other members of the Opposition have been serving with me for many years on the Public Accounts Select Committee and they know just as well as I do that no Minister of Finance is able to work out his Budget <span class="col_3511-3512" refersTo="page_0330"/>precisely, because in every department there are certain factors every year which result in their spending either more or less than the amount voted. They give an account of it before the Select Committee every year, and the reasons advanced by them are usually acceptable. How can hon. members expect the Minister to know 12 months in advance about all these unknown factors that may arise in the course of the year? Every cent of the R824,000,000 that was voted was approved of unanimously by this House, and hon. members on that side cannot come and tell us now that more money was voted than they regarded as necessary. And if they thought that we were voting too much, since they now allege that R26,000,000, which it has been possible to save, should never have been voted, then I say that they were guilty of neglect of duty in not opposing it when the Estimates were before the House last year. No, neither the Government nor the Opposition is able to foresee precisely what is going to happen in the next financial year, just as little as they were able to foresee a year ago what happened in the past year. They cannot level their reproach against the Government therefore. No business undertaking that I know of is able to estimate precisely a year in advance what its income and its expenditure will be. How can one expect that from the State which handles much more money than an ordinary business undertaking? But let us assume the unreasonable; let us assume that the Minister ought to have known that there would be such a big saving. What is the actual revenue position? The estimate of revenue for 1962-3 was R790,000,000; the actual revenue, according to the Budget submitted to us by the Minister, was R809,000,000, a difference of R19,000,000. Hon. members opposite now raise a hullabaloo and say that the surplus was deliberately estimated on the low side. But how is this amount made up? The first item that has to be deducted from it immediately is the sum of R5,500,000, which represents an increase in departmental receipts which were in the nature of a windfall and which are of a non-recurrent nature. That leaves R 13,700,000 that has to be accounted for.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, last year the national product rose by an average of 7 per cent. The Minister, however, could not base his estimate on that because when he introduced his Budget, the rise in the national product was no more than 5 per cent at that stage. It was only in the second half of the year and in the first few months of this year that there was increase with the result that the average rose to 7 per cent. In other words, in the second half of the year the national product rose by more than 9 per cent in comparison with the previous year, and that is something which the Minister could not foresee when he framed his Budget a year ago, and if he had speculated on this rise he would have been extremely irresponsible. No. he based his Budget on the rise in the national product that he was able to foresee last year, namely 5 per cent, and it was because of this great increase in the second half of the year that a certain amount of revenue flowed to the Treasury which it would not otherwise have received&#x2014; and I want to mention those sources of revenue. I say that we still have to account for R13,700,000. Unemployment, as hon. members are aware, decreased considerably in the second half of last year and in the first few months of this year, with the result that to-day the position is practically normal. That is a factor which is immediately reflected in items such as the consumption of beer, the consumption of cigarettes and tobacco and the purchase of motor-cars. The excise on beer is up by R1,000,000; on cigarettes and tobacco it is up by R2,000,000, and on motor-cars it is up by R3,400,000. It is only human nature for people to treat themselves to these little pleasures when they have the money to do so, and that is what happened in this case. Here we already have a total sum of R6,400,000. As far as income-tax is concerned, there was an increase of R3,900,000. The Minister could not foresee a year ago that in the last half of this financial year there would be such a great upsurge. He could not foresee that there would be a 9 per cent increase in the national product in comparison with the previous year. He could not speculate on the expectation that fewer people would ask for an extension of time to pay their income-tax, but that is precisely what happened. In the first place far fewer people asked for an extension of time for the payment of their income-tax, and in the second place taxpayers were assessed more quickly by the Receiver of Revenue in a special attempt to clear their desks before the commencement of the P.A.Y.E. system at the end of this month, and their effort in that connection met with greater success than it was possible to foresee a year ago. That accounts for the additional R3,900,000 that was derived from income-tax. To that must be added the increase of R3,000,000 in stamp duties and transfer dues because of the upsurge in the property market.</p>

<p>Under these few heads I have accounted for the total increase of R 19,000,000. I want to ask hon. members opposite whether it is reasonable to expect that the Minister should have foreseen these things in advance. It would be extremely unreasonable on their part to expect that. The Minister would have been an adventurer and a gambler if he had speculated on this type of revenue a year in advance.</p>

<p>Now I come to the financial year of 1963-4. The Opposition say that there will again be a big surplus. Mr. Speaker, the Government has at its disposal the expert advice of public servants in the various Government Departments who advise it as to the likely trend of events during the next 12 months, and it is on that basis that the Minister&#x2019;s estimates are framed. He has at his disposal the experts of the Departments and he can also consult the Reserve Bank which practically holds the reins in the whole of our financial system. These are all people who not only advise him but who practically help him to frame the estimates. <span class="col_3513-3514" refersTo="page_0331"/>But the Opposition suggest that they know better than those experts. I wonder whose advice they followed when they were in power in framing their Budgets. I wonder whether the fact that their estimates differed so materially from the actual figures is not due to the fact that they refused to listen to their departmental experts.</p>

<p>Let us look at the actual position. The Revenue Account for the forthcoming financial year stands at R26,000,000 higher than the figure for the present financial year based on the scales of taxation that applied before the introduction of this new Budget. The Minister is budgeting for an increase of R26,000,000. There are certain factors that I can see immediately which hon. members opposite deliberately refuse to see and which would make it dangerous to budget for an unduly high increase. The first factor that I want to mention is the crippling drought which, in the Northern Transvaal particularly, is assuming disastrous proportions, with the result that people who were taxpayers in the past will perhaps have to be given a great deal of assistance by the State this year. We noticed that after the Budget had already been drafted but before it was introduced, the figure at which the maize crop had been estimated a month or two earlier was suddenly reduced by 20,000,000 bags as the result of droughts, and the maize crop may even be smaller than the present estimate. A third factor, which the Minister also mentioned in his Budget speech, is the uncertainty with regard to the collection of taxes under the P.A.Y.E. system. If all goes well with the collection of taxes, then the revenue derived from income-tax may be a good deal more than the estimated figure, but if things do not go well it may be considerably lower than the amount budgeted for. The Minister cannot take the risk of gambling that the maximum that can be collected will be collected. We know that the people who work in the offices of the Receiver of Revenue are only human; they are not perfect, and what disturbs us particularly is the fact that the very people who, according to the United Party, are mainly represented by them, are not complying with the requirements of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. They are not registering and they are not submitting their returns, and this may still cause a great deal of trouble before the new system operates smoothly. Let the United Party rather encourage their supporters to see that they comply with the requirements of the law and the requirements of the office of the Receiver of Revenue; the position may be very much better then. We cannot gamble with this experiment and that is why the Minister has to be conservative in framing his estimates.</p>

<p>Then there is another factor. The gold-mining industry expanded enormously in recent years, but at the moment there is a decline in the rate of expansion, and in the future we can no longer expect our revenue to be augmented to the same extent from this source. Perhaps I might just say this in passing: Hon. members on that side had a great deal to say about gold mines which should have been assisted and which are getting very little out of this Budget. I notice that four new gold mines will start operations as the result of last week&#x2019;s Budget. A fifth factor is that as a direct result of this prosperity, some of our richest people will have a smaller income. I refer to those who live on their interest. Rates of interest have dropped. The result is that the tax collected from them will be much less than it used to be.</p>

<p>I say that any Government that framed a Budget without taking these factors into account would indeed be shortsighted and would gamble with our finances, and I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has taken into account at least these factors and perhaps a good many others which I have not mentioned here. It is very easy for the United Party to criticize. They do not care what happens; if things go wrong, it is the Government&#x2019;s responsibility. They want the Minister to count his chickens before they are hatched and that is simply not the way the Nationalist Party does things. It does not count its chickens before they are hatched.</p>

<p>We are satisfied that taking everything into consideration the Minister&#x2019;s estimate of revenue is fair and reasonable. The public is also satisfied. The only people who are not satisfied with it are the members of the United Party. It has been their ardent desire for 15 years to lead us into a trap in connection with our budgeting, but they will not succeed in doing so, because we know what the reaction of the electorate would be if we came along with a policy of deficit budgeting. The cry would immediately be raised that the country is going insolvent; that the Government is ruining the country economically, and that is what the United Party would like to do. But none of their prophecies of doom has ever proved true. You will recall, Mr. Speaker, that they have come here year after year over the past 15 years with all sorts of prophecies of doom. This is the first year that they say that we are going to have prosperity. In June 1961 they made dire prophecies to the effect that we were going to ruin the country and that devaluation would practically be unavoidable. As usual, however, their vociferous predictions all collapsed like a pack of cards. Three months later we had a general election, and even United Party supporters took so little notice of their party&#x2019;s dire prophecies as to how badly we were going to fare in this country, that 50 of us sitting here were not even opposed and we were returned to power with a greater majority than ever before.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have said that it is easy for the United Party to criticize. If the United Party is so certain that the Minister has underestimated his revenue and that there is again going to be a big surplus, I challenge them to mention the relevant heads where they contend that our estimate is too low, and to give us their own estimates under those heads together with their reasons. We shall then be able to test <span class="col_3515-3516" refersTo="page_0332"/>the position in a year&#x2019;s time in the light of the actual facts. It takes us no further just to prophesy generally that we shall find that we have underestimated revenue. We are not prepared to take any notice of that sort of thing. I shall be only too grateful if the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s revenue proves to be R30,000,000 or R40,000,000 more than the amount for which he is budgeting, because that will mean that the effect of this Budget in promoting prosperity will be much greater than even we are able to foresee at the moment and that this Budget will create greater prosperity than the Minister himself anticipates at this stage. It will also contradict the United Party&#x2019;s own argument that this Budget will not stimulate our economy sufficiently. If the revenue exceeds the amount for which we are budgeting by R 30,000,000 or R40,000,000, we shall be pleased, of course, and so will the United Party, but they cannot predict on the one hand that revenue is going to be higher and then say on the other hand that this Budget is not going to stimulate our economy sufficiently. I am convinced that even if the Minister had been able to foresee at this stage that revenue is going to be R30,000,000 or R40,000,000 higher, he would not have given this money back to the taxpayers in the form of reduced taxation. I think it would have been irresponsible to do so because it would have promoted inflation. I want to ask the hon. the Minister at this stage already, if he does have the surplus which the United Party predicts and which we hope we will have, to deposit that money into the Loan Account to compensate for the services which are now being transferred from Revenue Account to Loan Account. Mr. Speaker, a Budget must have the necessary elasticity. This Budget has elasticity and we welcome that fact. We feel that if within the limits of this elasticity the Minister is able to strengthen the Loan Account then he should do so. I hope therefore that if the Minister gets the extra revenue prophesied by the United Party, he will deposit it into Loan Account towards the end of the financial year which commences on 1 April.</p>

<p>Thanks to this Government, our unproductive debt has been wiped out entirely over the past 15 years during which we have been in power. We welcome that very much, but I just want to point out to the House that our public debt is still very high. Our public debt stands at R2,700,000,000, and we are still paying out R13,000,000 per annum more in interest than we receive by way of interest and dividends. We still have a number of Government investments which do not pay, investments for which we do have assets, but not revenue-producing assets. I feel, therefore, that hon. members should not view this matter with such equanimity and adopt the attitude that we have sufficient money in our Loan Account and that we can play about with it. Our public debt is high and we should make use of every opportunity that presents itself to reduce this burden on posterity. I am convinced that what I have predicted here in connection with next year&#x2019;s Budget will prove to be true if we have the necessary surplus. Our attitude in the Nationalist Party in this connection is perfectly clear and we make no apology for it; our attitude is that we should build up permanent assets which in due course can replace wasting assets such as the gold mines.</p>

<p>That brings me to the third point of criticism of the United Party, and that is that there should have been a greater reduction of taxation because, in their opinion, this Budget does not stimulate our economy sufficiently. It is altogether untrue that only R 13,400,000 is being handed back to the public. There is also the R20,000,000 which is being given to railwaymen by way of wage increases; there is an increase of R24,000,000 in the amount which is going to be devoted to the Public Service, of which approximately R10,000,000 is going to be paid in the form of increased salaries. In the fourth place there is the repayment of the loan levy amounting to almost R20,000,000, a total therefore of R73,000,000 that will go into the pockets of the consumers. But that is not all. On Loan Account the expenditure is being increased by R81,000,000, and on Revenue Account, apart from what goes into the pockets of the public servants, there is a further increase of R30,000,000. This sum of R110,000,000 is not going to be locked in a glass case; it will go into circulation, and it will have an enormous cumulative effect on both production and consumption in this country. But even that is not all; a very important factor is that, as a result of salary increases in the Public Service and in the Railway Service, the whole private sector of the economy is revising salaries in an upward direction. I am directly concerned with businesses which feel that they are obliged to do so. I am in a position to state that this is taking place on such a scale that it is practically spreading like wild-fire throughout the country. Many extra millions of rand are going to be paid out in salaries because of these increases, and the cumulative effect of that, although we cannot determine it precisely, will be enormous. I say that the cumulative effect of all these factors taken together is going to be so enormous that we run a very grave risk of getting inflation. This Budget is going to reveal inflationary trends, and I hope that the Government will be wide awake in guarding against inflation. What the United Party is asking for here is nothing but deliberate inflation. If we have made a number of additional concessions, as asked for by them, we would undoubtedly have set in motion an inflationary process which we would not have been able to check. We would have regretted such a step because it would have brought about instability, a state of prosperity on paper, where people would have had to pay so much more for their requirements that they would have lost all the benefits that they derive from their increased salaries, and even much more than that. A number of our gold mines would have had to close, and our exports of South African products, which have to compete on the world <span class="col_3517-3518" refersTo="page_0333"/>market to-day and which are of vital importance to us, would have been dealt a deathblow.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite talk so glibly about this, but I have just read a magazine from America in which the American Government is warned against the inflation that they are creating with their budgetary policy. This morning I read an article in the <i>Statist,</i> in which the British Government is warned about the budget which is to be introduced next week. The British Government is warned that if they grant tax concessions amounting to &#x00A3;400,000,000 as advocated, they are going to promote inflation to such an extent that they are going to make a mess of things in England.</p>

<p>They can look after their own affairs. I am merely mentioning what thinking people say about these matters. I am talking about people overseas who make a study of this type of thing. I am not mentioning the people of our own country as an example in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it is an extremely irresponsible proposal on the part of the United Party that we should have placed so many millions more in the hands of the private sector so as to stimulate consumption and production, more particularly consumption. They put forward these proposals because they know that the responsibility is not theirs. If their proposals led to inflation, the Government would be blamed, and the people who would make the greatest fuss would be the United Party. They would say immediately: &#x201C;Look at the way they govern; look at the inflation that they are causing; our gold mines have to close; our export trade is being ruined!&#x201D; That is what they would say, in spite of all their clever talk to-day. They have been trying to do this for 15 years; for 15 years we have had to tell them that our economy is a planned economy; that we always have to guard against inflation. We always have to guard against inflation if we want to stimulate our economy. Unless that is done, the country is going to lose much more eventually than it stands to gain.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that if the Minister anticipates an increase in his revenue, in view of what I have just said, there is only one thing that he can do. If he finds at the end of the financial year that he has more revenue than he budgeted for, that amount should be deposited into Loan Account. I want to point out to hon. members that their criticism of the Budget, their allegation that it is a weak Budget, and that it allegedly gives little to the public, was published in all the newspapers of the United Party. The financial correspondent of the <i>Cape Argus</i> realized that these people were on the wrong track. He went even further than I have gone. He says that he was convinced that the Budget had inflationary tendencies. This is his considered comment on the Budget in the <i>Argus</i> of Saturday evening&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. D&#x00F6;nges has set out to stimulate consumption, and his Budget will certainly do that. In one way or another he is putting R 10,000,000 into people&#x2019;s pockets through concessions. Repayment of loan levies and the stimulus to industrial activity given by defence expenditure, wage increases and the big public sector projects will further increase spending power.</block>

<p>Some critics think that Dr. D&#x00F6;nges has not gone far enough. I am inclined to think that he has probably gone too far, that the Budget may later this year turn out to be inflationary, to have encouraged attempts to expand the limits of the country&#x2019;s resources of skilled labour, and that the authorities may then have to apply a damper.</p>

<p>Here we have the opinion of a person who is certainly not a Nationalist, but he knows that he has a responsibility towards his readers who make investments and who may rely on his opinion in doing so. He therefore gives a responsible opinion. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the wine industry, I want to convey our very hearty thanks to the hon. the Minister of Finance this afternoon for the concession which he has made in regard to excise duties. If the hon. Minister will imagine himself for a moment in the role of a mixed farmer and not only that of a gardener, I should like to take his analogy further and tell him that he will very soon discover that this little extra feed that he has given to the goose that lays the golden eggs will not have been in vain. He will find that it will lay more golden eggs. We need have no qualms therefore about having given it a little extra feed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, economically South Africa is faring very well, notwithstanding all the tales of woe that we so often hear from the other side of the House. As the hon. the Minister indicated in a short r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; of his Budget, things are going particularly well in many sectors of our economic life. I want to refer to a few of them in particular. There has been an increase of 5.9 per cent over the past year in factory production and there has also been an increase in our exports to a new record level of R944,000,000. I still recall very vividly that two years ago as well as last year the other side of the House derived a certain amount of malicious pleasure from saying that as a result of our policy more and more countries in the world wanted to boycott us. But thanks to the vigilance of this Government and thanks to the steps taken by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs in sending three economic missions overseas 18 months ago our exports have risen to a new record level of R 944,000,000. Our unemployment figure has also fallen sharply. In the case of Whites, Asiatics and Coloureds, it has fallen by 34 per cent over the past 12 months. In the case of Whites alone the number of unemployed fell <span class="col_3519-3520" refersTo="page_0334"/>from 16,095 in December 1961 to 9,390 in December 1962, which is a tremendous improvement.</p>

<p>But the most sensitive barometer of our economy still remains the stock market. It is also a very sensitive barometer as far as the political position in the country is concerned. We know of the steep rise which has taken place in share price indices over the past year and I want to mention a few of them to show that this very sensitive barometer in our economy does indicate that things are going very well in this country. Industrial shares rose from 98.2 to 151.5 from January 1962 to January 1963 (taking 100 for the figure for the year 1952-3). Commercial shares rose from 118.5 to 181.5 during the same period of 12 months. Gold shares rose from 97.0 to 110.4. I could go on quoting a whole series of indices but I think the few that I have mentioned will suffice to indicate that economically we are doing very well.</p>

<p>At the same time the gap between share prices on the London Market and the Johannesburg Market has also closed considerably over the past few months. For example, the difference between the prices of gold shares in London and Johannesburg, which a few months ago was still 20 per cent, has closed to between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. This gap may even disappear altogether within a short time. I notice from overseas financial periodicals that the Americans are buying more and more gold shares as a sort of protective measure against the possibility of dollar and sterling devaluation. Unfortunately, I also notice that the picture that is being screened on the television network in Britain (&#x201C; Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;) has already had an adverse effect on gold share prices on the London Market but I expect this to be merely of a temporary nature. The investor in Britain has sources of information at his disposal other than this television picture.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this more buoyant economy has not come about of its own accord. It has not come about by chance. It is the direct result of economic planning by this Government. Here I want to pay particular tribute to the hon. the Prime Minister whose Economic Planning Council has already had such a very good effect upon the economy of our country. When private enterprise in South Africa was left completely in the lurch after Sharpeville, it was this Government which again showed its confidence in the future of our country by immediately announcing plans for a vast expansion of State and semi-State institutions such as Iscor with its R600,000,000 expansion plan over ten years, the Electricity Supply Commission with its expansion plans totalling R400,000,000, Sasol with its R75,000,000 plans and Phalaborwa with its R70,000,000 plan, besides the Orange River Scheme and other irrigation projects. These projects all stimulate our economy and they serve as examples to the private sector of the confidence that the Government has in the future of the economy of our country.</p>

<p>Our Minister of Finance has shown every year over the past five years that by way of tax concessions and economic and financial planning and a wise fiscal policy he has been able to stimulate our economy where stimulation is needed most. For example, in 1959 he announced a 2 per cent per annum depreciation allowance on factory buildings. The initial reduction on machinery was raised from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. In 1960 a further 10 per cent cost allowance was granted in respect of factory buildings; machinery allowances were further increased from 20 per cent to 35 per cent. He also included hotels in this category with the result that the hotel trade which seemed to be struggling to keep its head above water was stimulated. In 1961 the investment allowance and the initial allowance were extended to service industries such as dry-cleaners in order to give them the necessary stimulus. In 1962 and 1963 there was a further extension of the periods during which this investment allowance would be applicable.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) referred contemptuously to the fact that this was the fifth year in which the hon. the Minister of Finance has tried to stimulate our economy in this way, but without success. What the hon. Minister of Finance did succeed in doing was to maintain the very delicate balance between inflation on the one hand and stagnation or retrogression on the other hand. It is very easy, as the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van der Heever) indicated, to give a great boost to our economy by way of very large taxation concessions, but that is a direct cause of inflation. In my opinion this Minister has been very successful in maintaining this very delicate balance and we are very grateful to him in this regard. Mr. Speaker, is the rate of growth of our economy as slow as hon. members on that side of the House seek to suggest? We find that in the United States of America factory production has increased by 20 per cent over the past six years, while here, according to the latest figures, it has increased by 29.8 per cent over the last five years. For the last quarter of 1962 this figure was even 40 per cent higher than it was in 1957. When I see this increase in our factory production I have no reason to feel concerned that our economy is being stimulated sufficiently.</p>

<p>A wise financial policy encourages and promotes our economy. Our economy is also stimulated by direct intervention. I have already mentioned examples of this&#x2014;Iscor, Escom, Sasol and so forth. That is why I have no reason to be concerned about the further expansion of our economy.</p>

<p>As I see it there is one bottle-neck that limits further expansion and I want to ask the hon. the Minister of Finance to give his kind attention to this matter. The bottle-neck to which I refer is the shortage of trained manpower. Dr. Frikkie Meyer of Iscor said recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is being managed at present&#x2014;and her future is being determined&#x2014;by <span class="col_3521-3522" refersTo="page_0335"/>no more than 6,000 to 10,000 people in executive positions. In a modern country of our size and level of development, there ought to be 550,000 experienced, capable and efficient managers and executive officials.</block>

<p>There is a very great disproportion between skilled labour particularly in regard to supervisors, organizers, managers and technicians on the one hand and unskilled labour on the other hand. Experience teaches us that as a country develops economically the percentage of supervisors and organizers always grows. I see for example in the latest annual report of the Dutch Chemical Industry Farkenfabriken Bayer that after they had made an analysis of the numbers and groups of their employees over the 10-year period from 1951 to 1961, they found that over that period the number of daily-paid employees had increased by 73 per cent in that growing organization. In contrast to this, however, the number of their salaried employees had increased by 121 per cent. Official figures of the American Government indicate that between 1947 and 1957 the total number of production workers in the manufacturing industries of the U.S.A. only rose by 1 per cent. During that same period the non-producing workers, the manager class and so forth, rose by 55 per cent as against 1 per cent in the case of daily-paid workers. In South Africa only about 9 per cent of our economically active people are classified as employers, administrative employees, managers, professionals, semi-professionals and technical employees. The corresponding figure in the U.S.A. is 23 per cent. Besides this we have the very serious problem that so many of our promising young students who go overseas to study are snatched up there by overseas institutions and are thus lost to South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if South Africa is faced with a crisis, it is a technical manpower crisis. Indeed, this is the problem of all industrial countries in this age of mechanization and automation. For example, the number of factory workers dropped by 1,000,000 in the United States of America over the past six years, while production increased by 20 per cent. But this is small comfort to us, Sir. It merely emphasizes the fact that we cannot recruit that technical and scientific staff overseas and that we are compelled to train our own industrial leaders.</p>

<p>Here I want to return to the hon. the Minister of Finance who has already come forward with so many bright ideas to encourage and stimulate our economy. He will also have a number of good ideas for the training of industrial leaders. Indeed, he put forward a very good idea in 1960 when he exempted donations to universities for scientific and technical research from tax. He has now extended the period of the grant. If we want to avoid this crisis we will have to take more drastic action. We will have to make radical plans to make it possible for our promising young men and women to qualify as industrial leaders. One method is to allow study expenses to be deducted for income-tax purposes. This is only one method, Mr. Speaker, which I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister for Finance for his consideration. It is noticeable that so many of our brilliant men come from homes in our middle and lower income groups. The families in these groups are usually larger and it is difficult for the parents to bear the expense of giving their children the necessary higher education. It may well happen that one of these promising young men may find himself in a clerical position where he will virtually be lost to South Africa. This matter is of the most vital importance. If we do not make it possible for our clever young men and women to be trained as industrial leaders, we are inevitably heading for a manpower crisis in South Africa. We dare not continue in this way. The higher education of our promising young men and women must be regarded as a long-term investment.</p>

<p>About 10 years ago Sir Ewart Smith referred Britain to the proportion which exists in any country between the rate of increase in productivity and the rate of increase in the number of trained persons produced. This proportion was accepted in a White Paper in 1956 and a minimum was at the same time laid down for the future in respect of both figures if Britain wished to avoid ruin as an industrial nation. From time to time we are told that Russia is already training more than 50,000 engineers, scientists and technicians each year while the United States of America only produces 30,000 and Britain not quite 20,000. We in South Africa have made it our aim to produce 1,500 but we have not even reached that goal yet. And in any case this figure is still hopelessly inadequate.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say that we should follow the Russian method of making higher education free to all. I just want to advocate that we must consider it as a long-term investment, a necessary and indispensable investment, and that we should therefore deal with it as other capital expenditure is already being dealt with by the hon. the Minister of Finance. I want to point out respectfully that from the point of view of the hon. the Minister of Finance and his Budget, this will also be an investment. I want to refer to a study that was made recently by the American Department of Commerce in which they tried to ascertain how various groups of heads of families fared in economic life according to their academic training. They discovered the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Average family income, the study shows, tends to rise as the educational attainment of the family head increases. Families headed by elementary school graduates had an average income of 4,800 dollars in 1961; secondary school graduates, 6,300 dollars; college graduates, 9,300 dollars.</block>

<p>In this sphere, too, the hon. the Minister of Finance will discover that if he feeds this goose better, if he feeds it very much better, it will lay golden eggs for him.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from><span class="col_3523-3524" refersTo="page_0336"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) covered a lot of ground most of which, I believe, will be dealt with by my colleagues following me. He did say that this Budget reflected that there had been planning of the whole economic structure of the country and that it was a complete success. I will show how in one instance at least the planning has been bad. He also mentioned, so did the previous speaker, the question of the increase in our foreign exchange reserves and in the normal manner congratulated the Minister on his great success in this respect. I should just like to point out to these hon. members that if you refuse to allow your people to spend money and if you produce gold which is the means of exchange and the measure of value, you must of necessity increase your reserves. That is automatic and no cleverness or ability is needed to attain that increase. I would prefer to see that increase come from a real increase in productivity and an increase in the businesses established in this country. But for this Government we would not have had to worry about the causes of this increase in our reserves.</p>

<p>During this Session I put certain questions to the Minister of Finance. One was: &#x201C;Whether the American South African Investment Trust Company has repatriated any of its capital under its special agreement with the Government? (2) What amount in respect of this company is at present covered under Reserve Bank guarantee in regard to repatriation of capital?&#x201D; The reply was: &#x201C;No, it had not repatriated any of its capital.&#x201D; And (2) &#x201C;The Reserve Bank guarantee is R35,000,000 at present.&#x201D; The <i>Financial Mail</i> of 1 February says that the guarantee of the Reserve Bank covers up to R42,000,000. On the same day I asked the hon. the Minister from what amount of tax on its share dealings has the American South African Investment Trust Company been exempted, and the reply was that he could not give the information, and he hid behind the preservation of secrecy clause in the Income Tax Act. A few days earlier I had asked whether any companies, other than the American South African Investment Trust Company had applied for exemptions from taxation on income received from buying and selling shares, and (2) whether exemption had been granted to any other company. The answer in each instance was &#x201C;No&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now I want to take the House back to the Budget speech delivered in 1958, and I am quoting from it. The then Minister of Finance said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I propose to exempt from normal income-tax, profits made on the sale by companies whose shareholders are resident outside the Union of shares and gold acquired in the Union with funds remitted from overseas to the Union for this purpose.</block>

<p>He went on to say later&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At present a company buying and selling shares on behalf of its shareholders may be subject to the ordinary company tax on profits resulting from such activities.</block>

<p>Still later on he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposal to exempt such companies from taxation if all their shareholders are resident overseas is designed to attract foreign, and more particularly American, capital to the Union.</block>

<p>He went on later&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be the policy of the company to secure the shares as a long-term investment and it will not seek to repatriate its capital within five years. The exemption will also cover capital profits on the gold which the company intends to acquire and hold in the Union.</block>

<p>We told the hon. the Minister at the time that this was a most ill-conceived concession. The hon. Minister admits that the scheme has failed to bring any more American capital to our country, but he refuses to divulge what tax has been lost to the country. Now this company, as the Minister knows, would be paying tax only on interest received on any idle capital that it put away for a little while. Most of its money was intended to be invested in shares and is invested in shares, or will be invested in gold if they see the chance of gold increasing in price. Had it been a similar company, not falling under this special provision, the tax it would have paid would have been approximately R6,600,000. It brought in R20,000,000, and now has the right to take out R42,000,000. They can only exercise that right if they have made the profits and the money or the assets are available for conversion into gold&#x2014;they have the right to buy gold&#x2014;and remove it from the country. So they have had a present of over R6,000,000.</p>

<p>I want to compare this gift of R6,600,000 with the niggardly concessions&#x2014;I can call them nothing else&#x2014;made to taxpayers this year by the hon. the Minister, niggardly concessions that have been greeted with such acclamation from his own supporters. He has given the gold mines R200,000. He has given the farmers R 100,000. I am not a farmer, but my information is that the farmers in many districts are in dire distress. He increased the social pensions by R4,100,000, and he gave us back half of the 10 per cent extra tax he took from us last year, this amounts to R5,000,000 in respect of individual taxation. Now to get this miserable R20,000,000&#x2014;one cannot call it anything else&#x2014;he has given away R6,600,000 in taxation. I appreciate that a bargain was struck and the promise must be kept; the company must be allowed to repatriate its funds in any manner, even in gold, as promised. With this I have no quarrel. But the hon. the Minister must admit that the scheme has failed, that this special concession of freedom from taxation paid by every other normal company in the same line of business in this country, has failed to bring the American capital which he expected would <span class="col_3525-3526" refersTo="page_0337"/>come in. I say, and I am sure the hon. the Minister will listen to my plea, that after due notice&#x2014;you cannot cancel it at a moment&#x2019;s notice&#x2014;this concession must be cancelled, and then the Minister, I hope, will find himself in the position to add something considerable to the pensions of the aged and others who need it so badly. Mr. Speaker, South Africa is not Cuba. We are not a tuppenny h&#x2019;penny state. We do not have to buy money at rates like this. The Minister thought that our standing at that time was so poor that it was essential to buy R20,000,000 worth of foreign currency at this price. Things have changed now. Through the Reserve Bank he has allowed the banks to invest R60,000,000 outside this country, three times as much as this American South African Investment Trust Company has brought in. We have sent the money out&#x2014;I do not know what it is earning elsewhere, but being bank investments they will not be earning very much&#x2014;and here we are giving this company this extraordinarily generous treatment. I want to compare the treatment given in respect of this R20,000,000 brought into this country with the treatment meted out to our gold-mining industry.</p>

<p>In this recent Budget statement, the Minister say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has been calculated that an increase of 25c in the average production costs would mean the loss of 11,500,000 oz. of gold of a value of R287,500,000.</block>

<p>That would be lost if costs increased a miserable 25c per ton milled. He also said that the Government had appointed a Cabinet subcommittee to examine the problem of extending the life of gold mines having reserves of gold-bearing ore but working at a slender profit or even at a loss. I repeat, concessions to this great industry are going to cost R200,000 under this Budget. Here you have R287,500,000 worth of gold which is in jeopardy as far as the production of this amount is concerned.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have spoken year after year about a round-table conference which sat in 1956 to consider the problem of the low-grade mines, which is one of the greatest problems facing us. We brought this matter up every year under the Mines Vote and we have got nowhere. I want to give a few figures from the Report of the Round-Table Conference, a very fine report, and I quote this paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If all the measures of relief suggested above were adopted, the total savings on average for the five mines concerned would be of the following order &#x2026;</block>

<p>I will not give them in detail, they can be found in Hansard 98, Col. 3021, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will have that round-table conference report dug out from under the heaps of dust covering it and give it to the Cabinet sub-committee that has been appointed. In that report there is some talk of help being given to low-grade mines through pneumoconiosis charges. Well, that is no concession on the part of the Government. The pneumoconiosis money was contributed by the industry. In any event that has been dealt with and has gone back to the industiy. But while this round-table conference was sitting to consider this problem of the low-grade mines, railway rates were increased in 1957, and in the one case, one mine I know of, it meant an increase in costs of 1.9d. per ton; and, again, whilst this conference was sitting the Electricity Supply Commission increased its charges to these mines by 6&#x00BD; per cent, and this increase meant a rise in cost by .4d. to 2d. per ton, with an average of 1.4d. per ton. You see how easy it is, if this problem is not taken in hand, for the process of attrition to take place, gradually to erode and remove every chance of carrying on these low-grade mines. In Canada they subsidize these mines, but of course subsidization is a very wide question. I take it this is a question that will be considered by the committee. I want to quote to the hon. Minister certain figures which I have in my possession relating to two low-grade mines on the Reef. I have used these figures before. In the one case the increasing railage on coal from 1958 to 1962 has amounted to R7,476 a year; the railage on lime has increased by R2,350, a total increase in railage costs for that mine being R9,700, and it is making practically no profit. I have another example here in which the rail transport charges increased from 9.4d. per ton milled to 12.7d. per ton milled from 1958 to 1961, although as far as this particular mine is concerned the tonnage milled dropped from 1,000,035 tons to 854,000 tons. I am giving these figures because I want to stress the tremendous importance of the task that will have to be undertaken by the sub-committee to be appointed. During the last few years, as I said, we hammered away on this question on the Vote of various Ministers of Mines, and we got no further. We gave them details and details of the danger in which this very valuable portion of our valuable mining industry stood and we got nowhere. We battled and battled, and this year we switched our attack <span class="col_3527-3528" refersTo="page_0338"/>deliberately to the Minister of Transport. He admitted the problem. At last we got an admission, but he said: &#x201C;This is not my pigeon; this is a Cabinet matter,&#x201D; and we know from that has arisen the appointment of this Cabinet sub-committee. I want to stress that this problem is urgent. This sub-committee will have the round-table conference to work on. The report of that conference is a masterpiece as far as the industry is concerned; it represents the views of the Department, the unions, the industry; it has gone into the matter thoroughly, and it will not be necessary to spend months on new investigations because they have a ready-made report on which to work; there is no need for delay; quick decisions are demanded.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the American South African Investment Trust Company for a moment and I want to repeat that we sacrificed R6,600,000 in taxation to get R20,000,000 in foreign currency. I want to repeat that an increase&#x2014;and I think it is an underestimate&#x2014; of 25c in cost will jeopardize R287,500,000 in gold, as the Minister has stated, and that gold is convertible to any currency. And I also want to remind you again, Mr. Speaker, that the estimated cost of the concessions to the gold-mining industry this year amount to R200,000.</p>

<p>The Minister says that it is a problem and not an easy one. I admit that it is not easy, but it is certainly not insuperable. But we have got to remember that the heads of the gold-mining industry have stated publicly&#x2014;they have no axe to grind in this; they are working in the interest of the country as well of the industry&#x2014;that the production of gold will start to dwindle from 1971. We therefore find ourselves in the position, as was mentioned by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) that, unless we can replace our gold-mining industry by other industries in due course, our future is certainly bleak. Owing to the policies of this Government, our natural markets, the countries to the north of us, are now closed to us, and because of that we have to nurse our gold-mining industry to the limit. I want to remind the Minister of one thing: When the Steyn Commission was appointed to go into the Income Tax Act some years ago, the commission was told by the late Mr. Havenga, the then Minister of Finance, that they were not to give any consideration to taxation on the gold-mining industry, as he intended to have a special investigation into that to see what should be done. I can remember that in 1932, when there was a big increase in the price of gold, debates were held and arguments were used in regard to the new method of taxation that was brought in by the late Mr. Havenga&#x2014;the new method of taxation for gold mines. The formula as it was then encouraged the mining of low-grade ore; the lower the grade of ore, the lower the rate of taxation. In my opinion, in spite of much having been said against it, that was a sound principle. But it is 30 years ago since we went off gold in 1932, and much has happened. The importance of the industry to the country has not dwindled, and it has become more necessary than ever at this stage to look after it. Thirty years is a long time, and something has got to be done urgently. The hon. Minister has made certain concessions in his Budget in regard to prospecting expenses and deep-level costs, but I repeat that they are niggardly. There is no shadow of doubt that if the rates on mining taxation are eased, that will be a far better inducement for people to spend money on prospecting than simply to say that all the prospecting costs are chargeable under certain conditions, in this manner and the other manner. You do not prospect just for the sake of prospecting. You prospect with the idea of finding a proposition that will give a profit later, and the question of taxation on the profit you make subsequently counts more with you than an allowance in respect of taxation on the immediate prospecting costs.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. Minister will listen to this plea of mine. It is a plea. I deliberately chose the American South African Investment Trust Company to show how things can go wrong. It was brought in in all fairness, after due consideration. We did not think the proposal would work, and we said so, and it did not work. I brought this up to show that it does not make sense to encourage people to bring money into the country on conditions like that when you will not go flat out to encourage the industry which produces gold, which, after all, is the complete backbone of your economy. I ask the Minister, too, to extend the duties of this Cabinet sub-committee beyond the question of investigating the cost of low-grade mines, to include an investigation of the system and methods of taxation on the gold-mining industry. I must support the amendment.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) started the financial debate this afternoon, a great sigh of relief arose from the members of the United Party. I have never realized how popular the financial speakers on this side of the House have been since last Monday because, since the hon. the Minister of Justice replied to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), we have been approached repeatedly to try and get us to participate in the financial debate. It was a great relief to the United Party when we brought the debate into the financial sphere, but I hope it will be a lesson to the United Party not to depart from the traditional, established practice of confining ourselves to purely financial matters on the first day of the Budget debate.</p>

<p>Hon. members wanted to set a trap for us last Monday. They thought that if the hon. member for Springs seconded the amendment and spoke about Poqo, we would reply to him by putting up one of our <span class="col_3529-3530" refersTo="page_0339"/>financial speakers. We are too experienced in politics to fall into such an obvious trap, and I hope that this action of the United Party will be a sound lesson to them.</p>

<p>In connection with what the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) said, I must say that he hopped from one branch to another like a cock robin, pecked here and fluttered there and raised so many matters that, with the best will in the world, in the time at my disposal I will not be able to deal with all the points that he raised. Other speakers opposite also branded this Budget as a &#x201C;haphazard Budget&#x201D; and as &#x201C;patch-work&#x201D;, and the hon. member for Benoni spoke about &#x201C;niggardly concessions to taxpayers I will come to this later. I do not know whether I understood him correctly, but it appeared to me that he was asking for a further increase in pensions. May I remind the hon. member that since the present Minister of Finance took over this portfolio he has made an additional amount of more than R 17,000,000 available for pensions per annum. I believe that the hon. the Minister has done more for pensions than any other Minister before him.</p>

<p>We are, of course, just as concerned as the hon. member about the marginal mines. We, who are the representatives of the Witwatersrand, know what a serious problem this is. I do not think that it will be worth while to carry on a debate on this point, in view of the fact that the hon. the Minister stated in his Budget speech that a special committee was going to be entrusted with the task of investigating this important matter. I cannot at all agree with the hon. member in his criticism of the concessions made in respect of prospecting for mines. As has been announced everywhere in the Press, this concession has been very well received. It is precisely in this sphere that we must stimulate the development of the industry&#x2014;the sphere of further prospecting.</p>

<p>I want to start by saying that the criticism that we have experienced from the United Party thus far both in the House, as well as through the medium of statements which they have made, has clearly indicated that the United Party do not have the interests of our general economy at heart, but are still striving to gain some small political advantage. I cannot get away from this impression. This was the case in the past, and it has again been apparent. May I remind you that not so very long ago&#x2014;in March 1961&#x2014;our reserves reached a new low. The reserves then stood at about R170,000,000, a considerable amount of which consisted of short-term loans. The position was very critical indeed. This amount was scarcely adequate to cover imports for one month. Because of that critical position we had to resort to drastic measures and, on 16 June 1961, the hon. the Minister introduced his currency control measures. The reaction of the United Party immediately we discussed the Appropriation Bill in June 1961 was to protest vociferously against these measures and, like prophets of doom, they predicted that this would be the end of our economic upsurge in South Africa.</p>

<p>Even after this, when the hon. the Minister gave us some relief in this regard, they were still not satisfied, and they still adopt the viewpoint to-day that these measures must be removed completely, when, so they say, capital will flow into the country. The policy that the Government followed was a sound policy which contributed in no small way towards creating stability, but in their view these measures should be suspended for a doubtful and imaginary profit, and they want to subject our entire economy to the whims of international politics and to the advantage of the speculator. The interests of our whole country, as far as economy is concerned, must be sacrificed for a small amount of doubtful popularity which may perhaps be gained abroad in this regard. That is why I say that their criticism is not aimed at the promotion of our national economy, but at temporary political profit.</p>

<p>Let me mention another example. Since 1948 we have followed the deliberate policy of financing Loan Account from Revenue. I will come back to this shortly, because this is one of the important points of criticism on the part of the United Party. They have consistently accused us of putting our hands deep into the pockets of the taxpayers and of overtaxing the people. A letter recently appeared in the <i>Argus</i> from a person who asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wonder how much this and former Nationalist Governments have taken out of us unnecessarily by means of over-taxation, direct and indirect? Could you publish the figures please?<br/>Can we wretched taxpayers not insist on less of this misbudgeting? If any of us managed our affairs in this erratic manner, we would all be in the soup. It is time we called a halt to these phoney estimates.</block>

<p>With undoubted pleasure the <i>Argus</i> then supplied the full list&#x2014;astronomical figures. I did not have an adding machine with me so I could not add up the surpluses budgeted for and the actual surpluses from 1948 to 1962. I say that we make no apology for the policy that we have followed because we know that in this way we have made our economy very sound indeed and we know that the electorate certainly support that policy because in the successive elections which have taken place since 1948, we have won with steadily increasing majorities. The public realizes that through our efforts we have made ourselves less dependent upon foreign capital. That is what the United Party does not want. I do not say that we have become completely independent of foreign capital but we have become less dependent upon it. To my mind, however, there is an even more important aspect in this regard and that is the fact that by this policy which we have followed over the years, we have made ourselves less dependent upon foreign capital and we are now enjoying the fruits of this policy. We can imagine the tremendous pressure that would be brought to bear upon us in the financial sphere under the present world conditions <span class="col_3531-3532" refersTo="page_0340"/>of hostility towards South Africa if we owed vast sums of money to foreign countries. I say that this policy was a very far-sighted policy and if we had not followed this policy we would perhaps have run the risk of having one of our strongest assets, our sound economy, destroyed. We are in the fortunate position today where we can cover all our foreign debts with less than four months&#x2019; gold production and our national debt is only R175 <i>per capita</i> in comparison with R964 in America. But we are also enjoying the fruits of that policy because of what the hon. the Minister did this year of partially financing the Defence programme from Loan Account, as well as part of the Bantu development programme which is justified as a result of the enormous amounts which were made available to Loan Account from Revenue in the past. I say that this year we are plucking the fruits of this policy. I do not think that I am going too far when I say that the hon. the Minister could perhaps have taken a far larger amount from Loan Account for the local manufacture of arms. But we still have the criticism of the United Party that this policy is one of over-taxation. The important aim that we set ourselves&#x2014;of protecting ourselves for the future and making ourselves less dependent on foreign capital and saving the interest on the very big loans&#x2014;is completely rejected by them and their criticism is overtaxation and once more taxation. This is only aimed at one thing&#x2014;to try to collect a few votes by means of this criticism. Can you blame me if I come to the conclusion that their criticism is not aimed at the promotion of our economy but that it is aimed at petty party political gain?</p>

<p>I want now to make a few remarks about the accusations that were hurled at us in the statement which they issued after the Budget&#x2014;the statement in regard to underestimating and the resultant over-taxation. In this case it was of course aimed at the surplus of R28,000,000. When I listen to them, I cannot but be strongly impressed by the fact that my hon. friends on the other side are very disappointed that we have had a surplus. They would have rejoiced if there had been a deficit, but the fact that we have a surplus sticks in their crop. And what is their reaction to it? In their official criticism which they have announced to the world they state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the surplus of R28,000,000 obtained by over-taxation last year, he is now making concessions worth R 13,600,000, or less than half of the over-taxation.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member still says &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; Let us see whether he will still say &#x201C;Hear, hear!&#x201D; when we go further. Apart from increased allowances to pensioners costing R4,700,000, the repayment of the loan levy of 1958-9 costing R 19,900,000, the reduction in taxation costing R 13,600,000 and the increase in the salaries of public servants and the Railway officials amounting to R31,000,000, the United Party still want the difference between the reduction in taxation of R13,600,000 and the surplus of R28,000,000, an amount of no less than R 14,400,000, to be spent, and this we must do in the light of reports that we read in the <i>Financial Times</i> in which it is stated most clearly that we must also combat inflation here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa the Government seems to be drifting into inflation.</block>

<p>It appears to me that notwithstanding the fact that we are more prone to inflation than perhaps any other country because of our gold-mining industry, hon. members still do not appreciate the dangers of inflation because over and above all these concessions that I have mentioned, still to advocate the expenditure of R 14,400,000 and say that this is a sound financial policy is something we cannot understand.</p>

<p>But where is this leading to? It is the same old idea; not the economy as a whole or the national economy as a whole, but that petty political gain that they may perhaps derive in this way by getting the vote of persons like the person who wrote here under the pseudonym of &#x201C;Fleeced&#x201D;&#x2014;by means of criticism of this nature. In their statement they do not state this clearly. They hide their purpose with these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After rightly pointing out the necessity for giving inducements which would promote economic growth, he (the Minister) fails to provide adequate inducements.</block>

<p>And then we have the statement from the great propagandist of the United Party who has suddenly emerged as the financial critic of the party in the article that he wrote last Friday evening the in <i>Argus,</i> &#x201C;Patchwork Budget&#x201D;, which ends with the words that this whole amount of R28,000,000 should be spent. Propaganda, yes, for petty political gain, but that is certainly not the financial policy for a sound economy. I think that this was adequately replied to by the financial editor of the <i>Argus,</i> the article which was quoted by my colleague, in which he stated most clearly that the Minister was accused of not having gone far enough but that in his view (the editor&#x2019;s) the Minister was going too far because later we might have to deal with inflationary tendencies during the year; and he based that argument on one point&#x2014;the possible shortage of skilled labour and technicians and managers. I want to associate myself with that criticism and I also want to associate myself with what the hon. member for Paarl (Mr.W. C. Malan) said. I think that it will be the task, particularly of our universities, to see to this. It is not necessary for me to emphasize this point. Dr. Meyer, the chairman of the National Development Foundation, has repeatedly mentioned the figures of people who are still required in our industries. But our universities must establish commercial courses that are of a more practical nature and less academic. Not that I object to theoretical training <span class="col_3533-3534" refersTo="page_0341"/>because it is necessary, but there must be something more skilled on the lines of the Harvard Business School where a large and important part of the training of those managers of the future in the industrial and financial world is practical training. I associate myself completely in that respect with the leading article in the latest issue of <i>Volkshandel</i> in which this particular point is emphasized. Whether the Central Government can do anything in this direction I do not know, but I believe that if there is one direction in which we in South Africa must develop in order to maintain the rate of our development and in order to adequately absorb the increase in our population in our economy, it is that from now on we have to give the closest attention to the training of technicians and artisans, but particularly to the training of capable managers who will have to perform this necessary task in our country in future.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding this sound view of the financial editor of the <i>Argus,</i> the United Party still advocates, over and above all the concessions that have been made, all of which I have not even mentioned, further spending of R 14,400,000. Where this will stop I do not know, but the people of South Africa do not allow their votes to be bought. The people of South Africa are obsessed with one thing and that is their survival in this country and the defence of our White civilization. This is the test which they set in respect of any party and the United Party will not win one seat from us by means of this cheap propaganda.</p>

<p>I want now to go a little further in regard to the so-called underestimating of Revenue. I must do so because one gains the impression that when the United Party talks about the underestimating of Revenue, they have a suspicion at the back of their mind that everything is not above board and that by this means we are doing nothing else but taking money out of the pockets of the taxpayers. That is why we must reply to these points, because that is not so. In his reply to the little budget, the hon. the Minister pointed out&#x2014;and my hon. friend repeated it this afternoon&#x2014;that if mention is made of underestimating as far as the Budget is concerned, then the United Party were actually master underestimators when they were in power. I do not want to take this argument any further. I just want to go further with this underestimate which has so far produced a surplus of R28,000,000.</p>

<p>We must remember that we still had a period of uncertainty in the business world last year. A rate of growth of 4 per cent was allowed for and I do not think that this was in any way unreasonable. In last year&#x2019;s Budget, revenue amounted to R769,000,000, and revenue of R797,000,000 was estimated for the year 1962-3. But in reality there was a stronger upsurge in the property market, more motor vehicles were assembled and placed on the market and the profits of companies increased considerably. These factors all contributed to the fact that there was an underestimate but the United Party do not take these facts into consideration. They simply want to create the impression outside that we have no system and that we deliberately try to underestimate in order by so doing to pull a rabbit out of a hat when the Budget comes round and so that we can show a very big surplus.</p>

<p>We now come to the next aspect in regard to which the United Party states that the Minister should have made larger concessions last year. The chief propagandist of the United Party says in the article that I have already mentioned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This year&#x2019;s Budget is a tacit admission that last year&#x2019;s was ill-conceived and mistaken. Under the very sluggish conditions of the economy last year, the United Party told the Minister that he should cut taxes and pump more purchasing power into the economy.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;and the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) also supports this view&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He has therefore in this Budget accepted some of the criticisms of the United Party last year, and to a moderate extent he has reduced taxes.</block>

<p>It will certainly be a fateful day for us if we accept any suggestion from the United Party in regard to our economy. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These are steps in the right direction, but if they are necessary now, they were all the more necessary last year when the Minister rejected them.</block>

<p>They find a strong point of agreement in the criticism of the hon. the Minister expressed by the Economic Planning Council in August of last year and they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the opinion expressed by the Council during the meeting in October 1961, the Government nevertheless saw fit to increase certain taxes in the last Budget.</block>

<p>That is their point of contact and then they say in the introduction of their published criticism that the hon. the Minister took no notice of the Planning Council and increased certain taxes last year. The hon. the Minister made it very clear in the face of that criticism of the Planning Council why he did not make any tax concessions last year. This runs from page 10 to page 12 and up to page 15. I cannot deal with it here in the short time at my disposal but the Minister pointed out that the loan levy had to be repaid and that there would be a tax-free period on the introduction of the P.A.Y.E. system. But apart from the fact that the hon. the Minister mentioned, we still have the following facts. There can be no doubt that personal incomes increased last year. Statistics prove this. In 1959 personal income amounted to R3,928,000,000. In 1960 it <span class="col_3535-3536" refersTo="page_0342"/>amounted to R4,138,000,000. In 1961 it amounted to R4,298,000,000 and in 1962 it amounted to R4,630,000,000. Personal income has risen year after year but now we have a most important fact, and that is that personal consumption has not risen but has fallen. In the Budget the hon. the Minister states clearly that &#x201C;it is estimated that the real consumption per head in 1962 was not higher than in 1959 for the whole population&#x201D;. Only now have we again reached that stage. Personal consumption has not increased but income has increased.</p>

<p>The other aspect in this connection that we must mention is the fact that more was saved in that period. Savings increased. In 1960 savings amounted to R263,000,000; in 1961 to R454,000,000 and in 1962 to R598,000,000. In other words, income went into savings and not into consumption. What reason have we for assuming that if the hon. the Minister had made tax concessions last year, as the United Party suggested, those concessions would also not have gone into savings? If the hon. the Minister had made concessions amounting to R28,000,000 last year, it should be obvious that he would not be able to do the same thing again this year. But now comes the point that the Opposition cannot see and that is that where he is making concessions this year they have this effect that at the moment there is a more optimistic spirit generally and therefore the tax relief this year is being given at a more suitable time. There is an increase in consumption at this stage. If I may be permitted to use a metaphor of the hon. the Minister, I would like to say that this little seed of personal consumption that has now started to germinate would not have been there if he had made these tax concessions last year. Personal consumption increased from R3,606,000,000 in 1961 to R3,812,000,000 in 1962, and it is therefore to be understood, based on these facts of the increase in consumption, that the concessions which have been made this year will stimulate consumption, as was the aim of the hon. the Minister with this Budget. The United Party was completely wrong in saying that the hon. the Minister should have made these tax concessions last year. This would have had a fatal result and it would not have had the effect that we envisaged of generally boosting our economy.</p>

<p>We must also not forget that we had a great deal of unemployment last year and that this was a factor which caused the population as a whole to save more than they consumed. But the unemployment problem has been solved by means of greater production and greater investments and to-day&#x2014;and we are grateful for it&#x2014;we are experiencing a period of full employment. It is for this reason that I say that psychologically the right time to come along with tax concessions is this year and it would have been completely wrong to have made these concessions last year.</p>

<p>I can mention another factor to prove this point. An important reason for the slow rate of investment was that we had over-capacity last year. We dealt with this last year in the Budget. But all the indications are that that over-capacity is now disappearing. But the slowness of investment&#x2014;and I want to direct this particularly to the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje)&#x2014;is certainly not due to poor profit yields. Capital income increased from 40.4 per cent in 1958-9 to 42.4 in 1962. Generally speaking we are not opposed to profits, but the question arises as to whether one cannot make the best contribution towards increased consumption in the private sector by lowering profit margins which in its turn will ensure greater consumption, increased production, more investment and eventually larger profits.</p>

<p>I come now to the next point of criticism of the United Party. The hon. member for Constantia emphasized this point very strongly. It is that we made no concessions in respect of mining taxation this year, and the hon. member said that if we wanted to stimulate our economic growth which would increase consumption, we should have lowered mining taxation. Let me point out in the first place that there is no question of there being any lack of profits in regard to companies. The facts prove this. Commercial manufacturing profits increased by 6.1 per cent in the short period of one year and if one takes manufacturing profits alone, there was an increase of 7.8 per cent. The profits on food products rose by 30 per cent, by 29 per cent in regard to clothing and textiles and by 13 per cent in regard to paper and packaging. But what is of importance to remember is that the profits of companies distributed by means of dividends go chiefly to the richer section of the population, and if one increases their income by means of higher dividends and reduced taxation, one does not succeed in stimulating consumption at all. It is clear therefore that this plea of the United Party that at this stage we should have reduced mining taxation would not at all have had the effect of stimulating consumption. They said that we should stimulate it more. The headlines in their newspapers were: &#x201C;To little, too late&#x201D;. But as the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) has already indicated, in choosing the third of the three directions we could follow which are powerful injections, less powerful injections, and perhaps a little less injection still, we have done so because we realize that in a country like South Africa we must be continually on our guard against the dangers of inflation.

<p>Mr. Speaker, 1963 will probably be recorded in the history of South Africa as the year in which this Government presented its best and finest Budget but it will also go down in the annals of our history as the year of the greatest stampede in the history of the United Party. It is tragic that the hon. member for Benoni should stand up each time to plead for the marginal mines. All of us who know the Witwatersrand are concerned about the closing of the marginal mines but I want to put this question to the hon. <span class="col_3537-3538" refersTo="page_0343"/>member in all seriousness. Has he been successful in achieving anything in his parliamentary career up to the present by carrying on a debate across the floor of this House? Has much more not been done for the marginal mines on the East Rand or the Witwatersrand by means of negotiations with the Minister? [Interjection.] Let us leave this matter, which is a serious matter, in the hands of the Cabinet. Let us leave it in the hands of the hon. the Minister of Mines and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs in co-operation with the Cabinet. I am convinced of the fact that neither the hon. member for Benoni nor I will be disappointed at the results achieved. But we will not achieve anything in this way. We are only sowing suspicion and we are only making our own people in our own constituency despondent and causing distrust by making a political football of the marginal mines. We are grateful to the hon. the Minister of Finance for the concessions that he has made regarding propecting. We are grateful for the concessions that he has made with regard to deep-level mining. We appreciate the value of it because we who represent the Witwatersrand and who are dependent upon the mines know what the value of deep-level mining is, and we are convinced that research has never been done in this connection. We hope and trust that research will be done into deep-level mining and that we will very soon enjoy the benefits of that research. But there is another matter that worries me much more. We find that mines are closing down in the Witwatersrand-Pretoria-Vereeniging complex to-day. There is another important matter that worries me. We find that a far greater problem has arisen in that area and that is the tremendous Black stream that has flowed to our cities. When we look at the census of 1960, we find that the influx of Natives into that area has increased to such an extent that to-day there are 1,115,000 Natives in our cities. We find that the vast majority of these non-Whites are concentrated in this complex. When we notice that some mines are closing down, we ask ourselves why the Natives are not removed from that area. These Natives are in our White area to-day because of the implementation of the policy of National Party Government, to give them better housing and better health services. The result is that they are attracted to our industrial complex to a very large extent.</p>

<p>It is certainly a very good thing to stimulate our industry but it holds a very great danger for the future of our country, the future of White South Africa, and that is why I want to raise this matter very earnestly to-day. Sneering references have been made here to-day to the Western Cape, from which we are removing the Natives but I want to ask that the test and the methods that are applied here in the Western Cape should also be applied in the Witwatersand complex. The Western Cape has set us an example how to keep South Africa White but we cannot keep South Africa White if we do not have the co-operation of all the bodies concerned. I want to ask to-day that the Government should give us that co-operation. Since we have that large concentration of non-Whites on the Witwatersrand, we cannot expect them to be removed systematically to the Bantu homelands, nor can we expect them all to be removed to the border areas, and I want to ask to-day that that Black stream which is flowing so strongly to our cities to-day should be halted and that these Bantu should be returned to their homelands.

<p>Yes, we have a solution to every problem in this country and the solution that I want to suggest is this: We find that all our State institutions and semi-State institutions are in Pretoria which is our administrative capital. We have the Police College there; we have our Army Headquarters there; we have all the various State Departments there. We cannot expect only the East Rand or the West Rand or the Witwatersrand or the Port Elizabeth complex or Durban or the Western Cape to make the sacrifices which are called for in terms of our policy to establish industries in the border areas. I am in favour of the proposition that industries which use only Native labour should be moved to the border areas, but I also want to ask the Government to-day not to concentrate all the State institutions at Pretoria. I want to ask the Government to take the lead in moving some of those State institutions to our smaller towns. Why, for example, should the Police College and Police Headquarters not be established at Brakpan?</p>

<p>As far as Parliament is concerned I want to make myself very clear. One does not change one&#x2019;s family doctor or attorney or bank every day and the same thing holds good for Parliament. Cape Town is our mother city and Cape Town has conducted herself with dignity. One does not discard one&#x2019;s mother every day, and as far as I am concerned Parliament can stay in Cape Town indefinitely. But I want to go further: If Parliament does remain here, a better attitude should be adopted towards us as members of Parliament by the Cape Town City Council. I come back to my plea that the State Departments should not all be concentrated in Pretoria. Why should all the State Departments be in the Pretoria complex? Why should the Meat Board be in Pretoria? Why should the Meat Board not be established in Pietersburg or Vryburg?</p>

<p>Yes, as far as I am concerned Natal can have the Banana Board. Hon. members on the other side are merely trying to make political capital out of this matter once again. The matter that I am advocating to-day is a very serious one. When we think of decentralization, we should also consider the question of decentralization of our White population; we must not group them all together. Pretoria is the only city in the Republic today where there are more Whites than non-Whites and we wish Pretoria good luck, but the State is our largest employer to-day and the largest lessee of fixed property. Why should one city derive all those benefits? Mr. Speaker, we are all prepared to make the necessary sacrifices but then I want to ask the Government to reassure the people of the East Rand and the West Rand by saying: &#x201C;If you have a majority of non-Whites in your constituency, we as the State are prepared to cooperate to turn the flow of Natives back to the non-White areas.&#x201D; But then we ask the State to ensure that it is not those taxpayers alone who are asked to make sacrifices; those sacrifices should be shared by everyone. If we can apply a policy of this nature throughout the whole country I am convinced that we will be in a better position in this country. We must all co-operate in returning the non-Whites to their homelands. We will then be a very happy country. [Interjection.] This is a very serious matter; it is not a matter that the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) and I can resolve across the floor of the House. It is a matter that can only be tackled by people who can think clearly, people who are able to consider this matter, people who are prepared to make a study of it, and here we want to tell the Western Cape that they have taken the lead in this matter. I want to tell the North that they should not be mere spectators in regard to this matter. If we do not turn this stream of non-Whites back to the reserves, back to their homelands, it will mean the ruin of the White man in this country. We must make a start somewhere and that start must be made on the Witwatersrand because that is where we have the largest concentration of non-Whites. I ask the State to make those sacrifices with us and to make its contribution in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) who has just sat down is concerned with the Black stream of Natives who are coming into the towns in larger and larger numbers. I would like to remind the hon. member that they are there to provide the labour for the mines and for industry and that without their labour in the Western Province, from which it is the policy of the Government to remove the Natives, industry would come to a standstill. Would he wish that to happen in South Africa?</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Budget is the tremendous increase in expenditure on armaments. The expenditure on armaments now totals R157,000,000. While the policy of this Government to-day is to meet brute force with brute force, the threat to the country and to the Government is not only brute force; in fact, the most dangerous threat of all may not be physical attack from abroad but invisible ideologies inside the country acting on the state of mind of the people of South Africa. That danger is increased through ignorance and through lack of education and with consequent lack of judgment coupled with bitter feelings, which produce hotbeds ripe for extremist propaganda, which is directed not only against the present Government but against all the Europeans in this country. History has demonstrated that guns cannot stop thoughts. They can admittedly suppress physical violence, but the root causes of unhappiness and dissatisfaction and embittered thinking cannot be touched by bullets. What we need is a Government that will not only look after our physical welfare but will also recognize that education is the only means by which the masses can be lifted out of their ignorance and by which they can also achieve higher standards of living and better conditions for coming generations. Through such education the influence of agitators and troublemakers could be eliminated. But better education is not only a crying need for the non-European; it is also the cornerstone as far as the future of the European population in South Africa is concerned. Sir, there is no division on this issue. We have heard the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. H. G. Luttig) and the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) pleading for betterment in various aspects of secondary and university education, and yet the hon. Minister of Finance in his gardening Budget last week, with great adroitness, conjured up the analogy of a peaceful garden. But a careful observer will recognize that the blooms in his garden are merely red herrings, and they include that hardy annual the &#x201C;surplus&#x201D;. The Minister is a magician; he turns the red herrings into blooms and behind this peaceful picture of a flowery garden are camouflaged guns and other armaments, which represent the most important item in this Budget. The amount of money devoted to education in this Budget is dwarfed by this huge sum earmarked for armaments. Sir, I sometimes feel that the hon. the Minister looks on science and technology as a rose garden, a rose garden in which a bloom appears here and there with very little effort on his part. May I remind him that science is not a garden of roses; it is a kind of fertilizer that you have to put into the ground in order to make things grow and if the Government is not prepared to spend more money on this fertilizer the garden will not grow, and if production should fall behind in South Africa, then the lack of scientific work would be one of the main causes.</p>

<p>Sir, in these historic times in which we live, we also live in a revolutionary era, and we <span class="col_3541-3542" refersTo="page_0345"/>have in our hands powerful means for mass dissemination of knowledge. By that I do not mean the sort of superficial propaganda conducted by a former rugby expert. These powers for fast communication and mass production can and should be used for enlightenment and for raising the standard of living for all sections of the community and education should be given generous funds to achieve this end because armaments are only temporary necessities. Armaments cannot develop minds; armaments cannot improve relations between countries and between social sections, and armaments cannot in the long run save the State, while education can. The Minister&#x2019;s Budget demonstrates to my mind the shortsightedness of the present Government in spending the country&#x2019;s hard-earned financial resources on armaments and giving only a pittance to education. It seems to me that the South African Government becomes, if I may use an American slang expression, suckers of the world&#x2019;s armaments firms. The only comparable attitude that I can quote is that of the new British leader of the Labour Party because he is naive enough to think that South African armaments can be stopped by boycotts. The poor man has not learned at university or later on in life that the armaments industry is a ruthless machine. Not all the armies and navy and air force of France was able to prevent armaments from reaching Algeria, and when the armaments dealers of the world pick on a victim, these vultures of death pick their bones and armament firms are nourished by strife; they promote strife. The issue is not guns or butter. The issue is guns or education and a united South African nation. While the defence of the State is a duty of the Government, expenditure on such defence can be justified, but expenditure on education must be increased. I would like to say to the hon. the Minister that we have very grave problems facing us here in South Africa, and in higher education the Government has barred the non-Europeans from White universities. If the Bantu are going to develop under the Government&#x2019;s policy in their own homelands, then the first requisites are trained medical experts, a trained judiciary, trained engineers, trained scientists and technicians. And who can train this group of Bantu? Where are the teachers? They have to be trained also. Where are the institutes for this training and where is the money that is needed for such teaching? There is only the slightest sign in this Budget of a hesitant advance forward in Bantu education that was mentioned earlier by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson).</p>

<p>To-day there is a universal need for better education, for better productivity, for better human relations, and we have to face the fact that in this modern nuclear age, this age of automation, we are up against competition in industrial production in which the former advantage that we had of abundant, cheap labour is lost or may be lost in many instances as they turn more and more to automation. We know that Russia and the U.S.A. have a vast potential of population on which to draw for their needs, while in South Africa we have only 3,000,000 from which to draw. However able our European population may be, we have to realize that not only is our scientific and technical education poorer than that of the U.S.A. or Russia or Britain or Europe, but the smaller number of our European population in South Africa makes our position even worse. On the basis of higher education, the conclusion must be that there is an urgent need for reorganization of our higher educational system. The limited space for higher education in our eight universities is lowered by the wastage of over 50 per cent at the Witwatersrand University as far as first-and second-year students are concerned; it is further lowered by a 95 per cent failure rate in chemistry at the Natal University in the first year, and an over 70 per cent failure rate in engineering of all types at that same university. All this leads to the type of situation that has developed over the Orange River Development Scheme where we have advertised for engineers in South Africa, and the Minister himself in a reply to a question of mine last week said that they were waiting to see what the response is going to be to those advertisements. Sir, we have here the reason for this wastage. The reasons are to be found in the low standard of science training in our Afrikaans-medium and English-medium schools. We have to organize special classes in science teaching at high schools; we have to attract fully qualified teachers; we have to import such teachers, if necessary; we have to pay special salaries to science and mathematics teachers and centralize science training in special science institutes and colleges for special students taught by special teachers. Sir, Canada has been doing this since 1928, and we could well follow Canada&#x2019;s example. By doing this we would bring together the ablest students under the ablest science teachers, and furthermore I suggest that such special science colleges should have both English-and Afrikaans-speaking students and a mixed staff of Afrikaans-and English-speaking teachers, because this is the unity of science. In university training scientists should be awarded post-graduate research fellowships in special research foundations, headed by research professors who will be free from the responsibilities of administration and available only for lectures. In these research institutes that I advocate, those of us who have been in touch with universities all over the world, with the universities of the U.S.A., of Britain and France, know that much of the development of the students takes place through the exchange of ideas, through sharing quarters, through sharing hostels and sharing in community of life. They learn as much from each other that way as they learn from lectures from their professors. In South Africa we have until now been separating the youth into language and political camps. We should now reverse this policy and concentrate on education, because we cannot splinter our economic resources by separating the two groups. It must be considered that scientific efficiency in South Africa is not only needed in our industries; it is needed for our national safety to-day. We <span class="col_3543-3544" refersTo="page_0346"/>also depend on highly trained men and women in our defence organization, and therefore an appropriate amount should be allocated in the Defence Budget to higher scientific and technological training. Sir, South Africa&#x2019;s greatest asset is the talent of its youth. This is an asset which is as great as any of our natural resources. In fact the country&#x2019;s natural resources cannot be exploited without training talented youth in science and technology, yet this Budget as well as the Government&#x2019;s planning shows little signs of appreciating this important issue. The organization in Britain for Economic Co-operation and Development says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Investment in education is becoming so profitable that it is preferable to investment in physical goods. An investment in capital equipment can be regarded as one cause of immediate productivity.</block>

<p>In view of the fact that all these arguments have been accepted by spokesmen on the Government side of the House, it is difficult to understand why the hon. the Minister fails to face this issue of national importance. Sir, I have here a leading article which appeared in the <i>Transvaler</i> last year and it says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Scientific research is just as important to the welfare of South Africa as our defences. If R 120,000,000 can be spent on defence, there is no reason why millions should not be spent on scientific research.</block>

<p>At the annual meeting of the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns in Bloemfontein last year, Professor C. B. van Wyk said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any country which neglected to train scientists in the present era of technical development would reap the bitter fruit of its short-sightedness. About 30 per cent of the available posts in physics and mathematics were vacant.</block>

<p>I feel that these are reasonable arguments. The total sum which is allocated in this Budget for Government financial assistance to universities including bursaries is only R 11,000,000. The grand total of the revenue of the White universities is about R14,000,000, including the financial assistance which the universities receive from the Government. The Government&#x2019;s argument in past debates in this House has been that they contribute a higher percentage towards universities than is done by countries such as Britain which contributes only 70 per cent whereas we contribute 73 per cent. But whatever the percentage may be this money is insufficient for the purpose of mobilizing and training all the available talent for university education, thereby providing more men and women for much-needed scientific and technological research. Sir, we have about 37,000 university students, and taking R800 per head per annum as the cost of maintaining students at the university we arrive at a round figure of R30,000,000 which is spent by the students and their parents on university education, and yet the Government&#x2019;s allocation for bursaries to students is R110,000; that is all. This contribution amounts to one-third of 1 per cent. In other words, the Government flatly refuses to help financially except for this very small measure of assistance. Sir, if I may say so with respect, this close-fisted hard-hearted, short-sighted attitude is especially damaging to the talented children of many of the parents and classes from whom this Government derives its strongest support, and it is time perhaps that the Nationalist university students and their parents realized how badly they are treated by this Government in the way of bursaries. One can compare this attitude with the attitude of Australia. In 1937 Australia had a commission appointed and this commission advocated a twelve-fold increase in subsidies and in the money spent on education at universities. This was accepted immediately by the Australian Government. A quick approximate estimate which the Government should give in the form of bursaries to help and to encourage students will be gauged from the following: Assuming that about R4,000,000 is wasted annually of this R30,000,000 which I have mentioned on first and second year failures, you get a figure of R26,000,000; and assuming that at least one-quarter of the remaining students need financial support, it brings us to the sum of R6,500,000; if industry is to come in equally with the Government to share in this, it will mean that the Minister will have to provide for R3,000,000 in his Budget.</p>

<p>Last year when we had a debate in this House the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn), in a private motion debate, stressed the need for scientific and technological higher education. He pointed out many well-known facts, amongst others, that the community had to bear the financial burden. This is precisely my point. The extra burden of providing the future leaders of this country has to be borne by the community and by this Government. We cannot see this reflected at all in this Budget before us. We all agree that university training, and the full use of all the talent of our 3,000,000 White people, is the most important national requisite for maintaining and improving the standard of all sections of the population, European and non-European. The training of trained scientists and technologists is a national service and the cost should be shared by the whole nation. The hon. Minister knows that in Defence the State trains and feeds and clothes the trainees, the State houses them and pays for their equipment. In other words, the taxpayers of the whole country share this cost. That is what I am asking the hon. the Minister to do in this regard. Finally, I should like to quote from what Dr. Professor Selye said at the University of Montreal. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To adapt ourselves to the spirit of this century, we must reassess our whole philosophy and our senses of value. Just as the <span class="col_3545-3546" refersTo="page_0347"/>Stone Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age were characterized by the use of stone, bronze and iron, so our era will undoubtedly go down in history as the era of basic research.</block>

<p>If we wish to be included in such an era, as we must, then I would ask the Government to step out of its granite age and provide the necessary money.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) confined herself in particular to the educational policy of the Minister of Finance. I thought that it was the Minister of Education, Arts and Science who was saddled with that particular task. I can very well understand that she also wanted to say something, which was not much, and that she consequently raised something in the main debate which she should raise when the various Votes come up for discussion. I suggest to her that she would have made a far greater impression had she said: &#x201C;This University asked for so much and the Minister did not see his way clear to give it; he has cut the Budget of the university with so much&#x201D;. The fact of the matter is that the State is also bound by the Budgets submitted by the universities. As an ex-university man I am the last person to say that the universities roll in money but when you make an allocation to a university you must also bear in mind what your expenses connected with universities are within the social services which the State as a whole provide. I think it is very important that the balance should be maintained there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) spoke about the wastage which is supposed to be caused by the high percentage of failures. Is it the fault of the Minister of Finance that there are so many failures? Is it not perhaps the fault of the Administrators of the provinces which control secondary education and who deliver candidates to the universities who are unable to follow the university courses? Is it not also due to the fact that there are students at university who should not really be there? There is an important reason why there are so many failures in the natural science courses. It may be that the aptitude is lacking, but to blame the Minister of Finance for the high percentage of failures in chemistry at the various universities is not a fitting remark, and it ill-behoves the hon. member for Johannesburg (North).</p>

<p>She made great play of the fact that enough bursaries were not available to certain people. Does she want everyone who goes to a university or high school to be provided with a bursary? Does she want that? Why did she not suggest that?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) should rather keep quiet. He can take part in the debate when he wants to. I want to put a question to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North). She completely ignores the fact that there is general prosperity in the country and that it is much easier to-day for parents to send their children to university because they are much more assured of their income as a result of the good Government which this country has.

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) has asked him the second question. How much is necessary? The universities themselves estimate what they require. I think if we ask the Secretary of Education and the Minister of Education they will be better able to answer those questions than I am because I have not had insight into the estimates of the various universities. As an ex-university man, however, I know that in respect of the university with which I was concerned, that was the last item which was cut by the various officials of the Department of Education. It may be that the University of the Witwatersrand which is entrusted to the special care of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) has made such extravagant demands that the Department of Education thought that that amount should be cut. I was waiting for the hon. member to say that the University of the Witwatersrand or the Pretoria University or any other university had asked for a certain amount and did not get it. Had she done that there would have been substance in her argument but merely to make a statement the way she did is absolutely devoid of substance.</p>

<p>The hon. member is not really concerned about the higher education of the Whites. She is really concerned about the education of the Bantu [Interjections.] Of course; She started her speech by referring to the Bantu and she ended it by referring to the Whites. I did not get the impression that she concluded on a climax; but I did get the impression when she started with the Bantu that that was something which she was more concerned about than that with which she concluded.</p>

<p>Let us just analyse the position in regard to Bantu education. As far as the primary schools are concerned&#x2014;these are figures which come to my mind from previous debates; I have not had the opportunity of checking them because <span class="col_3547-3548" refersTo="page_0348"/>I did not think any hon. member would have the temerity to talk about this&#x2014;there were 800,000 Bantu children at school when we took over. To-day that figure has been doubled viz. 1,600,000. We also achieve much more with the funds at our disposal than the previous regime was able to achieve. If that is not an achievement I should like to know what hon. members opposite regard as an achievement. The hon. member conveniently forgets about that. Why she forgets that I do not know unless it is perhaps that she hopes an obliging Press will publicize it overseas that we are neglecting that part of Bantu education so that we can better exploit our Black fellow citizens. I think it is a disgrace.</p>

<p>But let us go further. We have established three university colleges for our fellow Native citizens. She may hold those colleges in great contempt. I can assure her, however, that I know that she does not even know the people who work there. She does not know what their academic qualifications are. She does not knows what their academic achievements are. Like the rest of the United Party she has simply written them off as &#x201C;tribal colleges&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Let me say this to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North): If she counts the number of Native students who attended the universities of Cape Town. Witwatersrand, Grahamstown and the Natal University three years ago she will find that there are twice as many students at the university colleges to-day than there were at the White Universities at that time. In other words, we are to-day providing higher education to twice the number of Native students who have a need for it than the former regime. Why? Because the Natives themselves, with a few exceptions, feel that they belong to these colleges; they are more their own. They make better progress there. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) asked me how many science students there were. Mr. Speaker, we are not mad; we do not lose sight of the needs of that national group. In the first instance those university colleges are staffed by lecturers on those subjects which the Bantu need most. Those are the facts of the matter and that is the policy of the colleges and of the Government in this respect. [Interjections.] The hon. member does not even know that we are discussing universities. It is a great pity, Sir, that there are some people in this House who are really never present although they are here in the flesh.</p>

<p>I want to repeat what I said for the education of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) namely that those university colleges which we have established for the Bantu provide more and better education to a greater number of students than when the doors of the White universities were open to them.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I have to be so harsh with the hon. member for Johannesburg (North). I want to return to her argument and her reproach that the number of failures in natural science courses, namely chemistry, was too high. If the Minister of Education were to enquire at the University of the Witwatersrand why the number of failures was so high, do you know what will happen, Sir? They will tell him that he is poking his nose into the affairs of an autonomous university. That is what they will say. They will say it is the thin end of the wedge; that he wants to interfere in their curriculum. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) will be the advocate for those universities. And not only those universities, Cape Town will also say that. And I imagine that the other universities will say the same; probably Pretoria and Potchefstroom as well. It is not the function of the Minister to lay down the syllabuses of the Universities. It would also be wrong of him to do so.</p>

<p>I want to leave the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) at that. Let her consult her conscience as to the propriety of her attack. I leave her to her conscience which will prick her in this respect.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Kensington (Mr. Moore) and Benoni (Mr. Ross) pleaded ardently for tax relief for the mines. They may have a case or they may not, but in order to place the matter in its right perspective I want to say this: We must distinguish between marginal mines and those mines which operate profitably. I do not even think they need refer to the marginal mines because the Cabinet has appointed a committee to investigate the question as to whether tax relief can be granted to those mines. The Government is already dealing with that. It ill becomes them, when we are already dealing with that, to say that we should do it now. I think the only reason why they have made that plea is so that they can claim the credit for themselves if the Government should one day decide to make a concession to those mines. I do not think, therefore, that this is a point about which we ought to argue. This is more particularly <i>&#x00E0; propos</i> the remarks made by the hon. member for Benoni.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington pleaded ardently for general relief for the gold mines. What he omitted to do was to tell us what the taxation policy of this Government was in respect of mines. The taxation policy is this: Every new mine, before the State receives a penny in taxation, can, if it wants to, refund every cent of capital that has been invested to its shareholders. That is a great concession. Therefore if a mine is producing and it is on the point of paying dividends you must know that it has recouped all the capital it has invested. It ill behoves the hon. member for Kensington to suggest that the position of those mines is that they are simply being mulcted by the State and that the money which is invested in them is subject to a greater risk than money invested elsewhere. What is more, Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member omitted to tell us was that all the social services connected with the development <span class="col_3549-3550" refersTo="page_0349"/>of a new mine were already provided by the State. When I say that I know what I am talking about because I have a so-called new mine in my constituency. I think of housing; I think of water, light, electricity, etc., which are provided by the State. The House must realize that in the meantime the taxpayers as a whole have developed that area in which the mine is situated so as to make it habitable for the workers and so that the mine owners can operate successfully. Without labour he cannot do anything. All the services which are required where you have a great concentration of people are already financed by the taxpayers. The mines in the Free State are only now starting to pay taxes. That means that the State is only to-day getting something back of all the money it has spent on the development of those parts. It built railway lines, roads; it erected power stations; it provided water, and so forth.</p>

<p>I think it will be a good thing if those gentlemen who plead for the gold-mining industry bear these things in mind, and for the sake of their own plea reckon out for themselves how much the State has spent before they plead for certain concessions to those mines.</p>

<p>I just want to say something in general about the ghost towns. I do not quite follow where these ghost towns are; I do not know them. It is not really fitting that I should talk about this because my knowledge of the Witwatersrand is limited. It really falls more in the territory of the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) who has already referred to it. I do know, however, that there are more labourers in industry to-day than in the mines. What is more, I know that industry absorbs many more workers to-day than the number who become unemployed on the mines. When you get that position you get industrial expansion and the town, as big as it, has already been financed. I want to say this to the House that when we are told by mayors and city councils in what a bad position they are, that should be taken with a pinch of salt for this reason: Every one of them wants to expand and he advances every argument he can think of to prove why he should receive special attention. You can never advance a better argument than the human argument. It is a very fine and human argument to say that the houses are there, they are empty, there is nobody to occupy them; it is going to become a ghost town like Dominion Reefs. That is the only ghost town that I know of. I know industrialists are already standing in a queue to occupy that town if they can only start an industry there which will be profitable. They are looking for it. We had the case where a number of businessmen wanted to extract petrol from mealies and Dominion Reefs was ready for them. But the Minister of Economic Affairs discovered that they wanted to start the industry on a basis which would not have been profitable to the State. That is the reason why Dominion Reefs remains a ghost town but that is the only ghost town that I know of. If it were argued that mine workers can only work in the mines and nowhere else I wish to draw attention to the fact that there is the prospect of new mines opening. It was only yesterday that I read the following report in the <i>Vaderland</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The concessions made in this Budget, the concessions contained in the Budget to the gold mines, contain very little immediate financial implications but they will definitely encourage new exploration; they will enable mines which have opened since 1946 to mine at deeper levels and they offer an encouragement to new mines to open in those areas which have already been proved. In connection with the latter it can be regarded as very probable that West Wits will open a new mine in the area adjacent to the Lebanon. As a matter of fact it is also possible that Union Corporation will open a fourth mine in the Evander area.</block>

<p>I do not know why hon. members are concerned about employment for those people who can only work in that section of our industrial life.</p>

<p>This Budget is one of the best, one of the most conservative Budgets we have ever had. Why? Because the Minister is not a prophet and he has to be careful. Hon. members opposite who spoke on financial matters&#x2014;unfortunately very few of them did&#x2014;all said the same thing namely that the State took too much money from the taxpayer in the past and that its liquid funds in the banks were too high and that that was wrong. Because we had surpluses in the past they conclude that there will again be a surplus. When we look at the economic picture and make a prognosis the future is in any case very rosy. It is possible that, no matter how conservative the Minister has been in his estimates, he will again have a surplus. You must remember, however, Sir, that we are living in an uncertain world. If you think, for example, how America&#x2019;s national debt is growing and what their unemployment figure is, if you think what the unemployment figure is in Britain, if you think what their tax problems are, it is very possible that if that country is not heading for a depression they are at least heading for a recession. The question that arises is what influence a depression in those parts of the world will have on our economy. Only a fool will maintain that it will not influence us at all. Nobody knows to what extent it will influence us but everybody knows that it will influence us. I think the Minister acted wisely when he only made a 5 per cent reduction in income tax and when he made other concessions and said: Let us see what happens. He was wise in being extremely conservative.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have disposed of the speech of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North). I pointed out that her criticism on the Budget as far as education was concerned was not justified; I pointed out that the plea made by those people who spoke on behalf of the gold-mining industry was incomplete and did not reflect the whole picture; I said that it would be wrong to paint a pessimistic picture of the <span class="col_3551-3552" refersTo="page_0350"/>ghost towns and in conclusion I maintained that it was very sound and right on the part of the Minister of Finance once again to have introduced a conservative Budget.</p>

<speech by="#botha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. P. BOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member for Mayfair (Dr. Luttig) who is not in the House at present, that it is difficult for hon. members opposite to criticize these Estimates. They dare not see the Estimates as a whole. That is why they are now concentrating on minor sub-divisions and carefully avoid dealing with the Estimates as a whole. Hon. members who spoke from this side of the House, such as the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, dealt quite effectively with the speakers who expressed their views on the Estimates, particularly in regard to the minor matters dealt with by hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>The country is grateful to the hon. the Minister of Finance for these Estimates. Since the Minister introduced the Estimates he has received many congratulations from all sides, and in the Press also. I think the hon. the Minister will be the last person who would state that a Budget could be completely perfect and to the satisfaction of all. No such thing exists. I should Like to congratulate the hon. the Minister for having managed in these Estimates, having regard to the forces ranged against South Africa at the present time, nevertheless to create so much confidence by means of these Estimates, to maintain the balance in the economy in this way, and to encroach in the various sectors (the private as well as the public sector) in such a way that everybody will agree that he has done the one and not neglected the other. It is a National Government that has so much confidence in the country and in the future of the White man that its Minister of Finance can think and plan and draft estimates for a concept of a greater South Africa. That is what the hon. the Minister has done, not only now, but during the past few sessions. He has budgeted for the concept of a greater South Africa. You will permit me to make only a few remarks. It has not always been so that a State has encroached upon the whole life of a country and a nation. That is a modern tendency. Nor has it always been the case that Estimates have been drawn with a view to the future. Indeed, not many years ago it was customary for a Budget to be a thing that fulfilled a certain basic function only, namely to budget for what the State for the time being required. It is really a modern development to do what this Government has done, namely not to think of the trivial things, but to consider the whole future and all the things in connection with a nation&#x2019;s life, and to be prepared to encroach upon the national life at all levels. In this regard I should like to say also that it is this Government, and previous National Governments, that have felt themselves called upon to help in our country where it is necessary to give assistance, and also to stimulate where stimulation is needed.</p>

<p>If we refer back to the past few years, we find that it was this National Government and its predecessors who started to tackle such things as, e.g., pension schemes, the Reserve Bank, assistance to farmers, research and all those things that came its way. Years ago these things were not done by a State. But I should like to go further and say that it was National Governments, and this Government too, that stepped in in the socio-political sphere of national life, and also set afoot economic action, as it has done, to lead the country to self-sufficiency and absolute independence. If that were not so, many of the undertakings of which hon. members opposite are proud with us to-day, would not have been there. But to that I wish to add that it has been the United Party that throughout the years has constantly opposed the economic action as developed by the National Governments through the years, in connection with this whole concept. I should like to mention a few. I should like to mention Iscor and Sasol, and I should like to remind you of what happened in the course of this Session when the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) remarked that he did not agree at all that there should have been such a thing as Sasol. The hon. member actually argued against the existence thereof. But I should like to point out that all these great semi-State undertakings were born of this concept I have referred to, and all these semi-State undertakings are there as monuments, and now I should like to tell hon. members that if the Government had done in the past what the United Party had asked, where would the Republic of South Africa have been to-day? I want to go further; not only in respect of this matter of socio-economic action, but also in the sphere of socioeconomic planning, the Government has taken the lead; and then I shall mention quite a number of things. I refer, e.g., to housing, with the concomitant removal of Black spots, and the border area development with the concomitant development of Bantu areas. That also was action on a broad field that was essential. And there also we have to ask ourselves again: If the Government had not done it, and had not budgeted for this action, where would the Republic of South Africa have been to-day if we had not started it 15 years ago? I therefore wish to say that State finance in relation to national income is becoming increasingly important because the Budget in our country is to an increasing extent becoming a State financial and State economic instrument of policy, and the Minister of Finance has also used it as an instrument of policy in these Estimates. I should like to mention a few examples of how he did it. I should like to mention, e.g., that the hon. the Minister in his Budget is also assisting border area development by encouraging industrialists to establish themselves where it is in the national interest they should establish themselves, although their personal interests and their personal feelings were not adjusted to that at that stage. I should like to mention the example of where the Estimates have been drawn with <span class="col_3553-3554" refersTo="page_0351"/>a view to the development of Bantu homelands. I mention the example of how the Government has taken a hand in the flow of capital with its monetary and fiscal policy, for the very reason that it wishes to apply its policy there also. The White Paper before us indicates that also, because 39.2 per cent of the gross capital formation in the year 1962, has been formed with a view to the development of the semi-State undertakings. Now I should like to say that in order to achieve a national objective&#x2014;and our national objective is the development of a greater South Africa&#x2014;it is essential that we should have a basic policy, and that the basic policy should be given effect to the Estimates. I should like to say that our basic policy is twofold, and in this regard I differ from hon. members opposite where they apparently adopt the attitude that one merely budgets in order to see how things fit in financially for the time being. No, one considers how it will fit in as broad policy for the whole nation, and our broad policy that has also to be served by the Estimates, is in the first place, the permanent preservation of the White man in this country of ours, and in the second place, to achieve economic stability and independence as soon as possible. Now I should like to say furthermore, that within this basic policy, and also with this basic policy as limit, it is necessary that certain major aims of policy should be aspired to, and I should like to mention four instances of how that has been done and pursued. In the first place, I should like to mention that it has been within the policy of the National Governments to develop a pattern of greater economic development and independence. And because it has had such a policy, they could create a Sasol and a Foscor and all these undertakings within that policy. I wish to go further and say that because they have had a basic policy, they were able, as an adjunct to that, to create by means of selective tariff protection, import control and valuta control, a climate, and circumstances in which it was possible for the industries of the country to develop to independence. And I want to say further that because they have had such a basic policy, they also could develop Bantu homelands. May I refer here to what one of the hon. members opposite has said? The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) stated here that as regards the Orange River scheme, they believe that the Orange scheme must come now and that it is a very ambitious scheme, but, the hon. member said, it must not be politically bound; the entire Orange scheme must be taken out like a Tennessee Valley Authority and then it will just have to take its course. I want to differ from him. I should like to mention this Orange scheme also as an example that should fit into a basic policy, and if it is the basic policy that so much will be spent to create a place here where the White man may develop, as announced also, then the Orange scheme should create a White homeland. That is why I repeat that with this Budget the hon. the Minister has managed to set up this aim and also to carry out that policy thus. For that also the country is grateful to him.</p>

<p>But in my opinion the country is also grateful to the hon. the Minister for something else, namely that he could pursue the objectives of a sound economy so well. For to pursue a sound economy, a balance should be found between three elements that are not always capable of being balanced. The one is stable prices, the other is maximum rate of growth, and the third is full employment. These three elements are not always reconcilable, but now I should like to say that the hon. the Minister has managed to do so in spite of the fact that particular elements were against him. It is very easy for any country to join in discussions on balance in the economy, but to try to maintain this balance in its economy as the Republic of South Africa has done, as regards these three elements, having regard to the circumstances that were against this Minister, and then to manage it the way he has done, speaks volumes. Now I should like to mention the next thing, namely that it has been the Republic of South Africa that has been singled out by hostile foreign countries to make things as difficult as they can be for it, and to interfere in its domestic matters, and to create a negative atmosphere, which has an influence upon the balance of economy. But apart from this threat from outside, we in South Africa have another very important factor against us that other countries do not have, and that is that the Republic of South Africa, as compared with other countries, has a non-White population comprising four-fifths of the total population, and who are in a very backward state, and who make demands upon the economy of South Africa that are far beyond the contributions made by themselves. It would have been a good comparison if America had also been in the position of having a non-White population of four times the present American population. It would then have been comparable. That is why I should like to make the point that the hon. the Minister not only has to cope with hostile foreign countries that wish to interfere, but also with this important factor which he has to take into account, but in spite of that he could maintain the balance. I should like to tell you further, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. the Minister in respect of this Budget, as in the previous ones, also had against him a hostile Press that tried to prevent internal and foreign capital to play a role in the development of the country. That is a further important factor he had against him. There has been reference in this House to-day from both sides, to the backlog we have in the executive sector and the scientific sector. I should also like to mention this as a very important factor, that South Africa, having regard to its total population, has to date had a very important shortage of executives and artisans, as well as of scientists and technologists. However, I should like to add to that that we are rapidly overtaking this backlog. But the Minister had to do one thing: he had to maintain a balance against all these factors, <span class="col_3555-3556" refersTo="page_0352"/>and I would say that no country in the world has managed to maintain such a balance. Indeed, there is no country in the world that has against it these factors that we have against us. That the Minister could balance the economy, as he has done, I think deserves the congratulations of our whole country.</p>

<p>Let me just tell you why I say the Minister has succeeded. Because, in the first place, he has a determined and strong Government; because he has a resourceful and purposeful people behind him; and because he could exploit the factors of production at his disposal in the interests of the country as he has done. I said at the outset that the hon. the Minister had a very difficult task to try and balance these various elements, and now I should like to refer to stability of prices. In the course of the debate we have had all kinds of speculative ideas from that side of the House in regard to stability, but I should like to state at once that in comparison with other comparable countries, the Republic of South Africa has managed to bring about greater stability in South Africa during the past years, in spite of all the talk on that side. As regards the cost of living index, for instance, in South Africa it has increased by 23 per cent, and the only other country that could do it to the same extent, was Australia with 22.7 per cent. But the United Kingdom, which is constantly thrown at us as an example, shows a much higher increase, and so does New Zealand too, with 26.8 per cent and 28.2 per cent respectively. If then we refer to stable prices, I should like to say also that it is not so easy merely to permit capital flow to South Africa to continue throughout the year as in the past, and then just to use all the money offering and try to fit it into the national economy, for that could very easily have inflationary results, and then price stability would have gone by the board. Now hon. members know also that the Government, when making use of capital, could have done so in various ways, but it has tried to avoid two ways; it has tried to avoid the creation of bank credit unless it was absolutely necessary, and it has also tried to avoid importing unneeded capital from outside, and preferred rather to borrow internally, and then to make supplementary loans from outside, and then further to transfer from current account to capital account. During this debate and in previous debates there have been numerous complaints about the practice of using funds of the Revenue Account for loan purposes, but may I tell hon. members opposite that it is not such a strange thing. The two countries that have made the greatest progress at the present time, America and England, to-day produce a very simple budget in a certain sense. These countries do not have a similar demarcation between Revenue Account and Capital Account. In America the basic point of view is that you Estimate and you borrow the deficit, and what is over, you return to the Treasury. Therefore this is not such an out of step matter at all. And as regards the rate of growth, I should like to say further that we admit that there has been a slowing down of the rate of growth. Now I should like to say also that the picture that has been painted here of the rate of growth, was not quite balanced or correct. Hon. members opposite very easily used figures and very easily came along with the charge that the rate of growth in South Africa is lower. But I should like to say to them that it is very easy to use a figure to suit your purposes. If we have regard to the national income, I should like to say that after the elimination of price influences, we are not out of proportion to other countries at all. Let me quote some interesting figures. Hon. members have referred to the rate of growth increase <i>per capita</i> of the population. But I should like to say that is not a fair comparison. I submit you have to take the aggregate. Let us look at the other countries. I am now taking the two last years for which statistics are available, namely 1960 and 1961, because the slowing down has taken place during these years particularly. As regards Canada, the growth in 1960 in the aggregate was 1.8 per cent; in the United States the increase was 2.9 per cent; South Africa the increase was 3.7 per cent; the United Kingdom with 5.2 per cent. Now I take the following year, 1960-1. In Canada it increased by 1.7 per cent; the United Kingdom 2.4 per cent; the United States 1.9 per cent; Australia with 3 per cent, and South Africa, more than any of the others, with 3.7 per cent. I think we have to see the rate of growth in perspective. Now I should also like to point out the unfairness of the arguments that are sometimes adduced rapidly. Hon. members opposite, and I am thinking particularly of the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) have mentioned figures in regard to West Germany, and the hon. member has said that West Germany has grown by 6.8 per cent. But if any country in the world had been destroyed to the extent that West Germany was destroyed during the war, it is easier of course to grow from nothing to a certain level, than to grow to the next point after you have already reached a certain level. That is why it is unrealistic to use a destroyed country for your comparisons, and hon. members ought not to compare us with West Germany. I want to go further, and say that if the rate of growth in South Africa had been greater, it would mean that we would have balance of payments difficulties, but we would eventually also have other snags. For surely you cannot grow economically if you do not employ people! How can you go on growing at a high rate when you have virtually full employment, as the hon. the Minister of Labour can confirm? If you want to grow further, you have to start doing certain things. If you want to grow at a faster rate, you have to start employing non-Whites in executive and other positions. If not, you are going to stay put. Now I should like to submit that it would not be possible to grow at a faster rate than that at which we have been growing, unless we wanted to come to that snag. I said at the outset that one should have a policy, and that your financial and economic policy should <span class="col_3557-3558" refersTo="page_0353"/>fit into the whole pattern. Now I should like to accept readily that if we had come to the same point, we would have said: &#x201C;Rather slow down a little in the interests of South Africa But hon. members opposite will adopt the point of view that if we grew to that point, and if we did not have any more people for the executive positions, they would then bring in the non-Whites also. That is where we are at variance as regards policy, and that is why I mentioned the point, of policy at the outset.</p>

<p>Generally as regards the Estimates, I think it will not be out of place if on this occasion I were also to say a few words on some other matters. I should like to refer to building societies. Commercial banks usually follow the bank rate fluctuations of the Reserve Bank, and they adapt their pattern of interest rates to that. Building societies, on the other hand, who have approximately 50 per cent of their investments in the form of interest-earning share capital, that is to say subscription capital and paid-up shares, need not take notice of these rates of interest. As regards the extent of their business building societies in South Africa are as important as all the commercial banks together. And now one can say also that they exert as great an influence. Is it desirable that these institutions should be permitted to carry on on their own without taking notice of the lead given by the Reserve Bank? Perhaps the solution to this is to be found in restrictive legislation in respect of their rates of interest; perhaps the solution may be that they should be restricted as regards their activities; or maybe the solution lies in quite the opposite direction&#x2014;perhaps the solution may be that we should give the building societies greater powers also to enter the risk field. I do not know, but I should like to say to the Minister that in my view it is a very real problem, and I am wondering whether the hon. the Minister could make a statement in this regard, for I know the matter has been inquired into. In my opinion too great a percentage of the people&#x2019;s savings is invested in building societies; considerably more than in other countries, and more of the savings ought to become available for the risk field. My point therefore is that too much of the savings is withdrawn from the risk field.</p>

<p>There is a second matter to which I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention, and that concerns a more flexible fiscal policy. At the present time we are bound by legislation to collect taxes as set forth in the Estimates. We cannot collect more taxes or deviate from the pattern of taxation of the Estimates. I think there ought to be great flexibility and freedom of action between budgets. A long time passes between one budget and another, as things are with us. May I mention the examples. The hon. the Minister has now tried to stimulate the economy by means of his taxation relief. Suppose now that the attempt to stimulate the economy should lead to inflation and that production facilities are subject to excessive strain. Then it means that we shall have inflation in the country. The Minister then cannot suspend the stimulant he has given before the next year. But conversely: If there is an anticipated acceleration of the rate of growth, and it does not come about, the Minister has no means of encouraging this rate of growth. He cannot administer a stimulant timeously in order to cause this acceleration to take place. If for instance the Minister had had the power to administer such a stimulant in August last year, we probably would have progressed more rapidly. He could then have intervened in the interests of the country. I should like to point out that we are living in dangerous times as regards our internal and external relations. Indeed, the world as a whole is living in dangerous times at present. It may become necessary for the Minister to consider extra expenditure in the national interest, and it may be that to wait for seven months, from luly until we meet again next year, may be too long a time when security is at stake. That is why I should like to urge elasticity in the actions of the Minister. I believe that he should have an opportunity within wide limits, to impose direct and indirect taxation, for instance as regards customs and excise, and also income tax. in between sessions of Parliament. Of course Parliament would have to approve it subsequently, and such a step would have to be taken with full Cabinet responsibility. I do not know whether the Minister could come forward with something of this nature, but I am asking whether the hon. the Minister could perhaps say a few words on this matter.</p>

<p>There is one final point I should like to mention in regard to what hon. members on both sides have said regarding mines. I should like to say that as regards mining development, we are on the threshold of great things, not only in terms of gold mines. Let us consider the whole series of minerals in our soil; our economic growth will in future depend very much on the development of our mines. With our wealth here we are one of the most prominent countries in the world as regards mining development, and mining development is going to be increasingly important in our country. Now we have the Office of the Government Mining Engineer and also the Division of Geological Surveys. But what is lacking here is a body, and I should like to call it an institute, that will concern itself with basic research for the mines. At the moment every mine does its own research, but it is of a commercial nature. Great mines are employing their geologists and research workers to extend the knowledge they have already, and not much is done regarding basic research. And when a mine has certain information at its disposal, they will keep it to themselves for their specific purposes, and not always permit the information to become available to another mine. That is why it has become necessary&#x2014;because mining is so important to us and because it is going to become so important to our whole economy in the future, and because there is such a dire need for it at the moment&#x2014;that we should consider the establishment of a Mining Research Institute <span class="col_3559-3560" refersTo="page_0354"/>with the necessary capital, to tackle this on a large scale. I know the hon. the Minister will not be unsympathetically disposed to this, for he has already in the past opened his hand where it was necessary in other spheres for the same purpose. That is why I should like to express the idea that as regards mining also we should consider research for mining as a whole, and basic research is necessary for that. In the sphere of agriculture we have our agricultural technical services, basic research that is carried on. You cannot progress in practice unless you have the people doing basic research behind you. That is why I think that basic research on an ambitious scale as regards mining development is urgently necessary to make available the information to the persons who require it, so that they can cause the full development that our country requires to take place. I hope the hon. the Minister will give his attention to the last few points, and that he will perhaps be willing to say a few words in that regard.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry to break into the continuity of the trend of this debate, but my colleagues and I would like to make some observations on behalf of the people that we represent in this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, everyone who has the welfare of South Africa at heart must feel alarmed at the unfortunate trend of events in our country. Despite the assurances given by the hon. the Prime Minister himself and by the hon. Minister of Justice that peace and order exist in South Africa to-day, there is no gainsaying the fact that there is an alarming undercurrent of uneasiness in the minds of most of the people of this country. The hon. the Prime Minister has told us that peace and order exist in South Africa to-day because of the Government&#x2019;s actions in establishing a strong Defence Force and a strong Police Force. I have no doubt that the hon. the Prime Minister is correct. Those reasons probably are the reasons for this so-called peace and order existing in this country to-day. On the other hand, however, the hon. the Prime Minister himself has admitted that it could not be denied that a crisis existed in South Africa, and he went on to palliate the position by emphasizing that all over the world there was a crisis. Mr. Speaker, we have been told in this debate that a great deal of the responsibility for the uneasy position which prevails in South Africa to-day can be laid at the door of agitators who have the ulterior object of disseminating among our people Communism in its most virulent forms. I am not at all doubting that that is correct. I am sure that there is not a single member of this House who would not do everything possible to assist the Government in eliminating these agitators from our midst. I am sure that the Government can rely on the whole-hearted support of everyone in this regard. I am sure that the Government can rely on the wholehearted support and co-operation of every well-disposed citizen of this country, irrespective of his party affiliation, to combat Communism and agitators. Having said that, I am constrained to say, that combating Communism and agitators by strong-arm methods, by having a strong police force and a strong defence force, will not solve our problems.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary for the Government to take immediate action to establish new bonds of understanding and cooperation between the Coloured people and the Whites. Enough has been said in this debate and in previous debates with regard to the steps which could be taken by the Government to establish new bonds of understanding with the Bantu. Very little has been said, however, in regard to the Government doing something tangible to restore the bonds of understanding and co-operation between the Whites and the Coloureds. There has never been a time in the history of South Africa when the position of the Coloured people has been more important than it is to-day. One must surely be impressed by the fact that despite the presence of agitators among them the Coloured people as a whole have continued to display the political moderation and levelheadedness which at all times has distinguished them from other population groups in South Africa. Surely the Government must be struck forcibly by the fact that in these critical times of ferment and agitation to which the Prime Minister referred, it would have been the easiest thing in the world for the Coloureds to have joined ranks with the communist agitators and to have wrought more chaos in this country. Instead of that, and despite the fact that there are agitators among them, our Coloured people have gone about their business and have performed their daily duties and they have helped to keep the wheels of commerce and industry turning, which is a credit to them and an inspiring example to many others. Surely this moderation on the part of the Coloureds could not have escaped the notice of the Prime Minister. Surely in this period of crisis we are entitled to ask the Government to take some imaginative action to re-establish on a permanent basis the bonds of understanding and co-operation between the Whites and the Coloureds. I repeat that never in our history has the position of the Coloured people been more important than it is to-day. In my view, in the critical days that lie ahead, it is absolutely necessary that a new bond of understanding be established between the Whites and the Coloureds.</p>

<p>I know that I will be told, in answer to this appeal, by Government speakers, that the Government has in recent years done much for the Coloureds. I want to say immediately that I appreciate the fact that in the last year or two something has been done in that direction. I will be told, e.g., that the Government has established technical schools for them which they did not have before, and a university college which will ultimately vie with the White universities, and that the Government intends developing the Coloured rural areas and that it has established the Coloured Development Corporation, etc. All these <span class="col_3561-3562" refersTo="page_0355"/>things, to my mind, do not compensate the Coloureds for the treatment they are receiving in other respects from the Government, with which I will deal presently. Despite all these improvements, there is no doubt that the Coloureds to-day are living in complete despair with regard to their future and one cannot blame them for it when one remembers how hard they were hit by the policy of apartheid. Surely the time has come for us to review that policy of apartheid as it applies to the Coloureds. The full impact and the consequences of apartheid have now become apparent to the Coloureds, as well as to the Whites. We can now see where the full logic of the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy is leading. The Government has been in power for nearly 15 years. It came into power on the policy of apartheid and has remained in power by continuing to apply that policy. No section of our population has been more harmed by that policy than the Coloureds. We know that they have lost their right to vote on the Common Roll and that they have suffered grievously under the application of the Group Areas Act, and at the moment they are under threat of losing their direct representation in many of the major municipalities of the Cape in exchange for their own petty village management boards. They live under perpetual fear of being thrown out of trades because of job reservation. They exist under the perpetual fear of the Government interfering with their jobs and livelihood. It is in their daily lives that the Coloureds come face to face with the unnecessary hardships and the humiliations brought about by apartheid. In the category of what has aptly been described as petty apartheid, our Coloured people are confronted with the most humiliating circumstances in their daily lives. In the transport system, the Railways and the buses which they have to use to get to their work, they find this petty apartheid being applied. In public places, in buses and taxis and on the suburban train services, we find the unfortunate Coloureds being crowded together with a total disregard of their feelings and their comfort. One often wonders how the Coloureds can exercise such immense restraint under those circumstances. One admires the moderation the Coloureds are showing in the face of all the discriminatory measures applied to them. Surely in these critical days it is necessary for some positive action to be taken by the Government to remove those irritations and to re-establish the bonds of understanding and co-operation with the Coloureds.</p>

<p>Some time ago an appeal was made for some constructive action by the Government&#x2019;s official organ, the <i>Burger,</i> to forge new links of understanding and co-operation between the Whites and the Coloureds. The leading article concluded with an earnest appeal to the Government for some imaginative action to be taken, and this was the final exhortation in that article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let everything which the agitator can seize on and which can be removed, be removed with the utmost speed, for future race relations in the Cape are at stake as never before.</block>

<p>In the light of what has been told us by the Prime Minister and the Minister of Justice, in the light of what the near future may bring forward, are we justified in wasting another day in removing everything which the agitator may seize on? Are we justified in delaying this matter any longer? Can you imagine, Sir, any circumstances justifying speedy action, more than the conditions prevailing to-day?</p>

<p>One read with a great deal of interest the announcement made by the hon. the Minister of Defence with regard to the re-establishment of the Cape Corps as a permanent military unit. One appreciates the decision of the Government to arm the Cape Corps. One realizes that this is a sensible and necessary step in view of the dangers confronting South Africa from within and without. The revelations made in the Snyman Report are sufficient justification for the Government to take every possible step to protect our citizens and to maintain law and order. There can be no doubt that dangers threaten this country both internally and externally, and that the Government has taken the right step at long last in re-establishing the Cape Corps. Our Coloured people have shown in no uncertain manner their loyalty to this country. Their history has proved that in the time of their country&#x2019;s peril they have always stood by the side of the White people as loyal citizens and they have played their part in all our struggles. It is quite obvious that the White people need their help to-day. If our Coloured men have to fight side by side with our White citizens to maintain law and order, is it not right that they should be given something to fight for? Is it not right that all the things which the agitator can seize on should be removed by the Government as fast as possible? Has the time not come for the Government to give immediate attention to the removal of the irritations and stigmas which have been inflicted on the Coloureds? I repeat that they have been the worst sufferers from the policy of apartheid. The time has come for the Government to declare that there will be no further discriminatory laws inflicted on the Coloureds and that the petty irritations which have been their lot for so many years will be removed as fast as possible. The word &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; has caused, and I am afraid is causing, South Africa incalculable harm. It has inflicted upon the Coloureds tremendous humiliations and embarrassment. I say that the continuation of this policy can only be the means of further separating the Coloureds from the Whites and forcing them against their will and against their natural inclinations into the hands of the Bantu. In this hour of crisis the Government quite rightly has re-established the Cape Corps. I think we can expect and will receive the utmost loyalty from that Corps. But one is constrained to ask how we can reasonably expect to receive undivided loyalty from the Coloureds when we, by our laws, are estranging <span class="col_3563-3564" refersTo="page_0356"/>them and driving them to join forces with the Bantu? The continuance of this petty apartheid policy can only alienate the Coloureds. It cannot help to establish this new bond of understanding which is so vitally necessary for our co-existence in this country. Has not the time come for the Government to take a realistic view of the position and to declare that it will give favourable consideration in the near future to the restoration of political rights to these people, rights which were taken away from them in the most humiliating circumstances? Is it not necessary for the notices which appear practically in every public place, drawing attention to the fact that Coloured people are precluded from those areas, to be removed? Is it necessary for the Government to continue with its policy of job reservation, which has had the effect of excluding Coloureds from certain trades? I want to remind the Government that as the result of its apartheid policy the social, economic and political worth of the Coloureds has depreciated during the past 12 years beyond all conception. Their opportunities of earning a decent living have shrunk from year to year, as more and more restrictions are imposed upon them. It has become increasingly difficult for Coloured youths to become apprentices, and for them to become apprenticed even in those trades which traditionally were reserved for the Coloureds. All in all, the plight of the Coloured man to-day is a very grim one. Are we justified in carrying on with this policy at a time when we ourselves are confronted with great danger and need as never before in our history the Coloured man to remain our ally and to stand staunchly by us?</p>

<p>Just as an example of how this petty apartheid is affecting the Coloureds, I would briefly like to mention something which appeared in the local Press a few days ago with regard to the enforcement of taxi apartheid in Cape Town. We had a public statement made by a responsible Coloured man, the father of seven children, who has been a non-White taxi-driver here for many years. He draws attention to the fact that the local Road Transportation Board has instructed the police to take immediate steps to prosecute Coloured taxi-drivers who convey all classes of passengers. He appealed on behalf of more than 150 Coloured drivers whose livelihood was threatened. The local Transportation Board, he said, had acted sensibly and leniently over the past ten years by not enforcing the apartheid regulations in multi-racial Cape Town and its suburbs. Now, as the result of pressure which was brought to bear on the board, they have asked the police to take steps to prosecute these taxi-drivers. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some three years ago the Coloureds showed their loyalty to the Europeans by not taking an active part in the strike which seriously affected the peaceful relations between the White and the non-White citizens of Cape Town. Some Cabinet Ministers openly praised the Coloured workers for their willingness and efficiency during this strike. Signatures could be obtained from hundreds of thousands of European passengers who were satisfied to be driven by non-White drivers. European passengers in the docks and at the station give handsome tips, which supplement the drivers&#x2019; meagre income. If we had to carry non-White passengers who use taxis only during week-ends, we will starve and our position will be hopeless. We will then join the thousands who are already unemployed workers.</block>

<p>He goes on to say that over 75 per cent of the passengers on the Bellville and Wynberg buses are non-Whites, but these buses are driven by European drivers with European conductors, and he asks whether that is apartheid. I mention this as one of the petty irritations from which the Coloured people suffer. Surely if we seriously intend to establish a new bond of understanding and co-operation between the Whites and the Coloureds, this type of irritation to which I have referred, and which is only one of many, must be stopped as quickly as possible. I say that it would be disastrous for us to allow this position to continue, in the light of the warning the Prime Minister has given us as to what lies ahead. It would be disastrous to alienate further these law-abiding Coloured citizens from the White people. It would be a calamity to the country if we allowed the Coloureds to be led to mob action by extremists and agitators. The Government is to-day facing its toughest problem. In overcoming that problem, the Government will have to win over the help of every law-abiding citizen. They have a wonderful opportunity of establishing a new basis of understanding and co-operation with the Coloured people. The remedy lies in the hands of the Government itself. If the Government is prepared to relax its rigid policy of apartheid in favour of a more human approach, I am sure it will get a willing response from the vast majority of Coloureds and it will also receive the approbation of the vast majority of Whites. Time is running out on us and something must be done urgently if we want to win back the goodwill of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>I would like to refer to another leading article in the <i>Burger</i> with regard to the changes that should be made as soon as possible. The <i>Burger</i> said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is always the danger that adjustments can be seen as fearful concessions and that they can stimulate appetites instead of satisfying them. It is, however, true that where adjustments can be made it is best to make them as quickly as possible, particularly if it is known that pressure will increase in the future.</block>

<p>This article expresses the feelings of the White people to-day. Do not wait until these concessions are forced upon us; this is the time to make them. The <i>Burger</i> goes on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_3565-3566" refersTo="page_0357"/>The possible adjustments at present are of two kinds, first the elimination of definite grievances and irritations, and secondly the adjustment that concerns the future constitutional pattern of South Africa. The country probably has need of both kinds if the White man is to retain proper control. We believe, for instance, that a good opportunity exists for adjustments of the immediate kind to be made to bring about a reciprocal improvement in the deteriorating attitude of the Coloured community. There are certain changes that can be made with the minimum risk being taken, which will make it easier for well-disposed Coloured people to remain steadfast against the extremists who are hard at work among their ranks. Our time has shrunk terribly. What we wanted to do in 50 years will probably have to be done in ten or five years.</block>

<p>I think even that may be an exaggeration. I agree absolutely with what the <i>Burger</i> said, that time is running out fast on us and that if we are going to eliminate these petty grievances and irritations, let us do it immediately while we still have time and before the agitators can seize upon them. Any delay in making these adjustments may well be disastrous to all of us. I would remind this House that as long ago as 11 April 1960 the then the Minister of the Interior made this statement in this House, as reported in Hansard, Vol. 104, Col. 5371&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I wish to make use of this opportunity on behalf of the Government and myself, and I am sure I speak on behalf of all responsible sections of all groups of the population, to express our sincere appreciation of the way in which the Coloured community calmly and loyally stood on the side of law and order during the recent disturbances which were caused by lawbreakers and agitators. I fully realize that many members of the Coloured community went through a difficult period as the result of intimidation. They refused to submit to this pressure, and once again in this time of crisis upheld the unblemished reputation of the Coloured community. In this connection attention is drawn with appreciation to the lead given by a number of esteemed leaders of this community. South Africa has taken note of this attitude and I personally am convinced that it has made an important contribution to the promotion of good race relations. In these difficult days the Coloured community has stood loyally by the White population, as we expected they would do, and I want to assure them that they will not find us unappreciative of their courageous and loyal attitude.</block>

<p>This promise was made in April 1960, by the Government, but what has happened since then? We find that session after session since that time this House has been confronted with legislation which has caused more irritation and more grievances and more despondency on the part of the Coloureds. In the light of what the Prime Minister has told us, are we justified in delaying to do something tangible to win their goodwill? I say again that to-day we are confronted with even greater danger than in 1960. The Government must not think that the Coloureds will be satisfied again by these empty promises which were never carried out. I am afraid the Coloured people will expect, and rightly so, the fulfilment of the assurances the Government gave them in 1960. The Government has a glorious opportunity of winning back the confidence and goodwill of the Coloureds by doing something on the lines I have indicated, and of winning back some of the favour of the outside world which it has lost over the years. I appeal to the Government not to dissipate these opportunities. The time to act is now.</p>

<p>I conclude by asking the Government, while there is still time, to establish a new bond of understanding and co-operation with the Coloured people so as to overcome the dastardly agitation of extremists who are hard at work amongst the Coloureds. The remedy lies entirely in the hands of the Government.</p>

<p>Business suspended at 6.30 p.m. and resumed at 8.5 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>This Budget debate has given the Opposition an opportunity to criticize, <i>inter alia</i> the financial and economic policy and achievements of the Government. Thus far they have merely scratched around and scraped around without effecting anything and that for one obvious reason only, namely because the country is experiencing a period of economic growth and prosperity. That is why they are struggling like that. Not only this side of the House says that we are experiencing economic growth and prosperity; the indices bear out also that this growth is taking place; our production of coal, our production of iron, our production of cement, building plans, real estate transactions, Railways, our imports and exports, the money in circulation&#x2014;all these indices, which are a good barometer of our economic development, corroborate this statement. We are also supported in that by bank reports which appear regularly; we are supported in reports of chairmen of companies at their annual meetings; and in the messages that are usually issued at the beginning of a new year by the leaders of commerce and industry, the same optimistic spirit is noticeable. The Stock Exchange indicates the strength of our economy; our unemployment has reached a lower level than four years ago; the announcements in the daily Press of new industrial developments and expansions&#x2014;all these things point to the rapid pace of our economy.</p>

<p>But the latest Budget of the Minister of Finance reflects the same spirit also. Now, it is clear that when things go well with our <span class="col_3567-3568" refersTo="page_0358"/>country, the United Party have a difficult time. When we experience setbacks, or when there are conditions of recession, there is rejoicing among the members of the United Party for then they have to prey upon that situation. When things are going badly, when there is a measure of recession or setback, the United Party derive joy from it, and it is immaterial what the cause of the setbacks may be&#x2014;it may be in consequence of recession conditions overseas; it may be in consequence of the problems of balance of payments of oversea countries, and which are having an adverse effect upon their purchasing power; it may be because the prices of raw materials have dropped as was the case since 1958 when they dropped by 13 per cent; it may be because we are concerned with world surpluses; or that our exports are affected by an extension of our uranium contracts; or because the Federation has imposed tariffs to stimulate their own industrial development there; or because our flow of capital is affected by events in Africa that are completely beyond our control, etc. It is immaterial what the causes may be, but whenever a setback is experienced, it is always the fault of the National Party, and it is more particularly attributed to our policy of apartheid. Whenever we experience the same setbacks here that other countries also experience, when the Stock Exchange slumps here as in other countries&#x2014;even more in other countries than here as proved by the slump this year in Britain and New York&#x2014;it has nothing to do with apartheid, but it is the result of ordinary economic factors we find throughout the world in economics. However, when it happens here, it is the Government&#x2019;s fault, and it is the result of our policy of apartheid. When there is prosperity, their point of view is that they had predicted it and then they try to make us believe that the prosperity would have been so much greater if there had been a United Party Government in power. That is their attitude throughout. Just consider how they tried to play our economy off against every crisis. When we had the referendum, when we left the Commonwealth of Nations, and when we became a Republic, they predicted what a difficult time lay ahead for South Africa, and how dark the future would be; we were on the threshold of a recession according to them; there even were rumours of devaluation.</p>

<p>That is the policy pursued by that party. Now we are finding that the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) still says that the Government approaches its task without vision and without imagination. We cannot allow them to get away with it that easily. We could quote much proof to show how very little confidence that same party had in our future. In the days that have passed, they were the people who were the Jeremiahs. I need not even look for that proof immediately after the National Party came into power in 1948. I recall 1953. What was the vision and the imagination of the hon. member for Constantia at that time? He then said that South Africa until recently had been a land flowing with milk and honey, but that South Africa had now become a country of locusts and castor oil. They have adopted that attitude consistently. Just refer to the words of the Leader of the Opposition himself. As recently as 1958 still, he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is slowly drifting to disaster. And in March 1959&#x2014;<br/>The Nats are helpless against the bogy of depression.</block>

<p>Who were the Jeremiahs then? They were on that side of the House and not on this side. Even shortly before the election of 1958, the Leader of the Opposition said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Graaff puts choice to South Africa: Either a big future or none at all! This is the time to get rid of the Jeremiahs.</block>

<p>But during that election the people did indeed get rid of the Jeremiahs. But even last year still we could find the same attitude among the Opposition&#x2014;the same lack of vision and realism. And that in spite of the indications at the end of the year that we had reached a turning-point in our economy. Share prices soared; our reserves exceeded the nadir of 1961 by far; our exports were higher than in the past; we had even become liberal with our imports; our internal production indices had risen; in November last year our incidence of unemployment was smaller than four years previously; the carrying capacity of our Railways had expanded; there was great formation of capital and we experienced great liquidity, etc. It was clear then that we were on the threshold of a revival, but in spite of that the Leader of the Opposition in September 1962 according to the <i>Sunday Times</i>, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nats leading South Africa to disaster. Dangers created by their own racial policies. The policies of the Government have undermined the confidence of the Western world, destroyed the climate for economic development and produced a stagnating economy in which living standards cannot rise.</block>

<p>The same attitude was adopted by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) also. According to the <i>Cape Times</i> of October 1961, he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Russell warned that apartheid meant poverty. It was the reason why more than 100,000 South Africans were now out of jobs; why capital shied away from our shores; why immigrants avoided us, and why South Africans were leaving.</block>

<p>Even in September 1962 still the Leader of the Opposition had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Graaff hits at Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s planned poverty. He accused the Nationalists of <span class="col_3569-3570" refersTo="page_0359"/>sacrificing economic growth for Bantustan dreams. The living standards of the ordinary man in the street are being badly hit by Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s obsession with Bantustan apartheid.</block>

<p>So you see that on every occasion it is brought back to apartheid. When in the course of last year, steps were taken to stimulate our economy by way of a reduction of the bank rate&#x2014;which is a monetary step taken throughout the world generally&#x2014;and when South Africa in consequence of its increased liquidity and with a view to accelerating its economy, reduced the rate of interest, the Leader of the Opposition said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that the latest bank rate drop underlined the public&#x2019;s unwillingness to borrow for investment because people believe this Government has not got the answer to race relations in this country.</block>

<p>You see, therefore, that everything is carried back to the policy of this Government. The hon. member for Jeppes held the same view. When in January 1962 he returned from a visit to the United States of America, he said this in a Press interview&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Well-informed Americans were confident that South Africa could become the most stable country on the African continent by adopting a realistic policy.</block>

<p>Those were &#x201C;well-informed Americans&#x201D; and not just any man in the street. Surely it is very clear to any person who has any knowledge of Africa, that the Republic has for a long time already been the most stable country in Africa. Now the hon. member comes along and says that informed people think that we can become that if we were to alter our policy. The hon. member continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But they feel that the present Government&#x2019;s policies are completely impracticable and that we will have to make experiments in extending political rights to all races.</block>

<p>Did the hon. member inform those people what political rights the United Party wants to grant? Even during the no confidence debate at the beginning of this year, one speaker after another was asked by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark and others whether they were prepared to admit the non-Whites to this Parliament. They were unable to give a single answer to that&#x2014;they could not say yes and they could not say no. Even now they are unable to reply to that. Does the hon. member believe for one moment that they could satisfy those people with their policy of federation, of &#x201C;White leadership with justice&#x201D;? Does he think they will satisfy the Black states in Africa with that? No, Mr. Speaker, that is only a dream.</p>

<p>At the close of last year, the Consul-General of America in South Africa pointed out that more than half the American investments in Africa were concentrated in South Africa. That is the country now which the hon. member says they think is not the most stable country in Africa. This Consul-General went further and said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hardly a month passes that we do not hear of a new investment or programme of expansion tackled with American capital to obtain the benefit of the growing markets and the Government policy which encourages such investments.</block>

<p>So in spite of our policy of apartheid, we have these investments. Mr. Banghart, vice-president of the &#x201C;Newmont Mining Corporation&#x201D; said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Newmont, who have been in South Africa for over 25 years, believe that the tradition of integrity of Government, coupled with the will and determination of the people, offers better promise for continued stability than untried social and political reforms in other areas.</block>

<p>Mr. Randall recently made a similar statement. But even an official organ of the American Government, the <i>International Commerce,</i> recently referred to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the significant upturn in both the investment and trade sectors in South Africa.</block>

<p>While in Whitehall and Westminster, in Washington and at UNO they were advocating a policy of granting political rights in Africa, to give them greater freedom which would in turn result in greater growth and civilization, the private investors of Throgmorton Street and Wall Street withdrew their investments from Africa. Thus we know that the Lombard Bank, one of the great banks in Britain, last year decided to withdraw completely from the African continent.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to another very interesting statement that appeared in <i>Business World,</i> a very well-known American periodical in which some very scathing articles against South Africa and the Government appeared in the past. In December 1962 the editor wrote as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oddly enough, much of South Africa&#x2019;s renewed economic health rests on the fact that, for all its ugly racial tensions, it appears to foreign industrialists to have a better chance for political stability than most African nations. Says one British businessman: &#x201C;If it were not for apartheid&#x2014;never mind whether we like it or not&#x2014;we would not think of investing there.&#x201D;</block>

<p>From this you can see they know we have stability here. Now the hon. member for Jeppes comes along and says they only want to go a little way, they want to give them only a few representatives, well, let it be Whites then; they cannot in any case say whether it must be non-Whites&#x2014;then everything will be <span class="col_3571-3572" refersTo="page_0360"/>calm; then there will be peace; and then everything will be accepted. Let me just refer the hon. member to the conference held in February at Moshi by some of the African states. This was the attitude there&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We cannot rest until this indignity is wiped out; until the Government of South Africa is replaced by one representative of the people of that country regardless of their colour.</block>

<p>So they will not be satisfied with the offer to introduce six or eight representatives. They will not accept things until there is absolute equality and &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; has been accepted in principle. Therefore it is not necessary for the United Party to speculate on such a trivial scale. The Leader of the Opposition on a certain occasion said there is only one solution for South Africa, and that is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Only one thing can now give the economy a lift: a change of Government.</block>

<p>The Opposition has been trying since 1948 to get into power. But they have been unable to succeed. On the contrary. At the first election after 1948, they said: &#x201C;We want to reverse the reverse.&#x201D; But they could not succeed. They are still on the road backwards. As recently as the latest election, the hon. member for Wynberg said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Wednesday&#x2019;s election was the last one the Nats, would ever win.</block>

<p>What hope has he got, Mr. Speaker!</p>

<p>Here in South Africa we have progress because we have a strong and stable Government in power. That is the reason why overseas investors are investing here. That is why we have progress here, in comparison with the rest of Africa. Every investor knows that we have a stable Government here. Furthermore: At the present time we have a much stabler Government with more continuity of policy than in the case of most of the Commonwealth countries who were in it with us. Since the conference at which we left the Commonwealth. there has been a change of Government in New Zealand; at the latest elections in Australia Mr. Menzies was returned with a majority of one. It cannot be said that in these two countries there is great political stability and continuity of policy. In Canada there is an election on the go at the moment, after Mr. Diefenbaker, the previous Prime Minister did not even have a majority. Here also it cannot be said that there is political stability. And who can say that there is great political stability in the United Kingdom at the present time? But here in South Africa there is political stability and every investor knows that is so. So it is not only we who say that. I have here a report of a speech by the president of the Cape Town Chamber of Commerce&#x2014;note, it is not the Chamber of Industries. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have a strong Government and political stability notwithstanding that the country&#x2019;s racial policies are disliked by the rest of the world. In my view we also have sufficient economic potential for increasing prosperity as a basis for maintaining political stability.</block>

<p>Here is the testimonial of a man who does not belong to our party. He nevertheless agreees that we have stability and a strong Government. Stability of government is one of the greatest factors for the existence of economic stability in our country. We can say this, that as long as that party over there shows an inability to think South African, and to grip the imagination of the electorate with it, for so long they will always be doomed to remain in the Opposition.</p>

<p>I pointed out earlier that when things go well with us, then the United Party says things can go better; then they are the optimists and no longer the Jeremiahs. When things go well, in their eyes we become the Jeremiahs. When this Budget was introduced and it became evident that things were going so well that we could even reduce taxation, the hon. member for Wynberg said this: Yes, but we have not gone far enough. And also: All these tax reductions the Minister was able to give, have been advocated by them in previous years. That is a very easy attitude to adopt, for there cannot be any reduction of taxation which has not been urged by that side at one stage or another, for instance during elections. And what about all the promises they have made? All that costs money. They want to abolish income-tax and promise all the services in the world, but they never say what it will cost, of where the funds will come from.</p>

<p>The Government cannot act so recklessly. We would also like to see further reductions in taxation; we would also like to see increases of salaries, in common with the hon. member for Constantia. In the amendment he has moved on behalf of his party, he says that we should take steps to increase the rate of growth of our economy and thereby the standard of living. In addition he said that we should increase salaries. But salaries have already been increased. Consider, in this connection, the salary increases granted to the railway personnel during the past year; think of the increases in the salaries of officials in the Public Service; the increases in the salaries of teachers; the increased minimum introduced by the Wage Board etc. It is a generally known fact that there has been an increase of our general purchasing power.</p>

<p>In a speech at Goodwood I recently referred to the purchasing power of the Bantu. I obtained information about it from a bank report&#x2014;and our bank reports on the whole are very accurate. But my attention has been drawn to the fact that the purchasing power of the Bantu as set forth in that report might have been put too low, namely at R800,000,000 per annum. I then requested Census and Statistics <span class="col_3573-3574" refersTo="page_0361"/>to get data for me. From that it appeared that the total earnings, in other words, salaries, wages, payment in kind and the income from businesses, in 1961-2 amounted to R1,250,000,000. For 1956 it was R850,000,000 as against the R800,000,000 I mentioned. So we find there has been a tremendous increase in the purchasing power of the Bantu. But in the case of the Whites too, it is estimated that from 1956 to 1962, the purchasing power has increased from R2,770,000,000 to R3,754,000,000. Thus we see that during these years there has been an enormous increase in the purchasing power of the Bantu as well as the Whites.</p>

<p>However, it has always been the point of view of the Government that increases of salaries etc. should be accompanied by a corresponding increase in productivity. The latest data in this respect show that in the Republic there has been a rapid increase. In the 11 months of 1962, the volume of our industrial production increased by 5.9 per cent. Towards the end of the year the increase was still more rapid. However, the average increase for the 11 months was 5.9 per cent. During the same period the increase in employment was 2.6 per cent. This is an indication to us at once that there has been an increase in production.</p>

<p>But apart from this increase in wages during recent times, for which provision has also been made in these estimates, there are the other steps also that have been taken to increase our purchasing power and to stimulate our economy. For instance, there were the reductions in income tax and excise on petrol and diesel oil, increased pensions, tax concessions to the mines, to farmers and to exporters; greater rebates for insurance and contributions to pension funds; there was an arrangement for the repayment of savings levies; I have already referred to salary increases, etc. All these things have been done with a view to stimulating our economy. The hon. member for Wynberg says we should go further, and that we should also reduce taxation in order to create greater purchasing power. Attention has been given to this particular aspect. The hon. member said, <i>inter alia,</i> that we should reduce taxation on companies. The position in this regard, however, is that South Africa is one of the countries where company taxation is of the lowest in the world. According to a report of the First City Bank this tax is much higher in France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, U.S.A., Canada, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Switzerland, Japan and others than in South Africa. There are only three countries where it is approximately 30 per cent, namely Norway and South Africa with 30 per cent and Italy with 26 per cent. But when we take into consideration that there is an exemption of one-third on dividends, it becomes clear that our company tax, as it ultimately comes into the hands of the Receiver, is by far the lowest in the world.</p>

<p>When we compare our taxation with our national income, South Africa&#x2019;s position is very favourable. When we take into consideration the concessions that have been made now, it appears that the taxation paid to the Central Government, in proportion to our national income, is 13.9 per cent, that of the U.S.A. 18 per cent and that of the United Kingdom 21 per cent. So we could go on. However, it is clear that South Africa is one of those countries where the general rate of taxation is much lower than in most of the other countries.</p>

<p>But in this Budget concessions have not only been made with a view to the stimulation of our economy and our purchasing power; provision has also been made for irrigation, for housing, telecommunications, expansion of Escom etc. This infra-structure, which is a necessary basis for industrial expansion, is one of the factors to which particular attention has been directed in recent times. That is why there are great schemes for expansion of Escom. It is estimated that during the past year the megawatt has been increased by 100 and 465 during this year. There are the new extensions at Campden. The expansion for this year has been estimated at R58,000,000. Of that amount R42,000,000 will be spent in the country. Let me also refer to the expansion of our iron and steel industries. I do not want to go into detail now, to indicate how rapidly we are progressing with these projects. However, it is anticipated that in the calendar year 1963 R37,000,000 will be spent on contracts. We know that the bulk of that will be spent in this country. This iron and steel industry which was established as the result of the struggle between Nationalism and Imperialism, laid the foundation for the contribution at the present day of R781,000,000 to our national income by the iron and steel and allied industries, that is to say, much more already than that of our gold-mining industry. Furthermore, we know that it also forms the basis for expansion of our South African Railways, our defence, our motor vehicle industry, our tractor and shipbuilding industries, etc.</p>

<p>Then there is also the expansion of Sasol which according to the Estimates will cost R43,000,000 of which 60 per cent will be spent in this country. But that does not apply only to Iscor and Sasol and other State corporations. Around them private initiative is building up a colossal industry. Consider merely the expansion of the fertilizer industries of Sasol, artificial rubber, of detergents, etc. On this alone R34,000,000 will be spent in the ensuing few years. According to an estimate that appeared in a newspaper during the past week, it is estimated that in the so-called Vaal triangle, that is to say, Vereeniging-Vanderbijl-Sasol, R700,000,000 will be spent during the next five years. That shows how private enterprise is building up industries around the State corporations. I could also refer to the expansions at Foscor. There has been purposeful expansion to provide our own fertilizer requirements. However, it does not end with the Government undertaking. It is clear that at Phalaborwa private enterprise will flourish <span class="col_3575-3576" refersTo="page_0362"/>much more than in the case of the State corporations. There is the copper scheme that will cost R75,000,000 with a refinery added to it, which will be the greatest copper producer in the southern hemisphere. There is the fertilizer consortium that will very likely start there; there is the possibility of processing magnetite. During last week I saw an announcement that it is not excluded that aluminium also will be processed there. Around the nucleus that has been created by State corporations, therefore, a much broader and wider field for private enterprise has arisen.</p>

<p>And the Government has purposefully headed in the direction that these undertakings should play an important role in the expansion of our economy. The Government has realized that by so doing not only opportunities for employment will be created, that it would not only foster capital growth and thus increase the standard of living, but that the institutions that will come into being there will form the basis for a much broader expansion of private enterprise.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Constantia comes along and says that we are without imagination and without courage. As against that I should like to say that in these times&#x2014;and there have been setbacks, that I shall admit&#x2014; it is not the United Party that has had courage, but the Government has had confidence in the future of the country, and has shown courage not only in its Estimates, not only by schemes for the provision of basic services, but also by its action in tackling iron and steel industries as well as other industries and placing them on a firm foundation. And we believe that it is this action which has largely contributed to rendering the possible economic revival that we are now experiencing. That is the only way in which we can increase the standard of living of White and non-White in this country. It is in this way only that we can obtain the co-operation of all, to make us economically strong. We know that a strong South Africa, an economically strong and stable South Africa, is the only and the most effective answer to the forces that are threatening us from Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, four fronts are opened up in the amendment of the Opposition. The first front is the economic front, which has just been replied to so clearly and satisfactorily by my hon. colleague. The second front is the defence front. The third front is the international front, which has been linked with the old charge that we stand isolated. The fourth front is the agricultural front. On all these fronts the National Party has taken the initiative from the very beginning of this debate. I recall clearly how the Opposition began with Poqo the other day. But they dropped it like a hot potato, as the <i>Cape Argus</i> said. We have taken the initiative firmly into our hands. Yesterday the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to stage a come-back, and the hon. the Prime Minister completely flattened him. They dropped Poqo just like that. I should like to make this prediction: With the legislation to subdue Poqo we shall be as successful and effective as with all the legislation initiated by the National Party. Their conduct is unpredictable, because the ideas among their members are as manifold as the multi-racial state they stand for.</p>

<p>What have they produced on the economic front they opened for discussion? Here my hon. friend, the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, gave a reply that is well-founded and sound. They know the position as as he sketched it. What has become of the other two fronts? I ask the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan), the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker), and I ask the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren): What has become of the agricultural front? I ask the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman): What has become of those fronts? We are nearing the end of this debate: to-morrow afternoon the Minister has to reply. Not a single word has been said in this debate on agriculture. On the most important matter, defence, they have not said a word either.</p>

<p>I was about to say that. The hon. the Chief Whip reads our thoughts well. I was about to say that they did not discuss defence, because they themselves are on the defensive. Time is running short, but we are waiting for them. We are prepared for them. Raise the matter of agriculture; come along with defence! there is no choice left to me. Faithful to the methods of the National Party, I now have to take the initiative to-night on the matter of defence. [Laughter.] Yes, we always have to set the framework for the debate. How often have we not heard that hollow laughter?</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>They had to burn down a school to get that hon. member out of Std. I. He will just have to wait a little while. You may laugh, but I shall take the initiative in respect of defence. I should like to say a couple of things on defence this evening that will prove irrefutably that the National Party, under the leadership of the present Minister of Defence, is doing the same thing on the defence front that the National Party is doing in our country on all the other fronts. I should like to begin by stating a few propositions that are incontrovertible. My first proposition is this: Among the people of South Africa there has never yet been so much loyalty and confidence in our defence as at this moment. I should like to state a second proposition: The morale of our defence forces has never been as high as at present. I should like to state a third proposition: Our defence forces have never been so closely interwoven with our people as at the present time. My <span class="col_3577-3578" refersTo="page_0363"/>proof is this: Have an air force demonstration; let the defence force just organize some military day, and you will see how they flock there in their 10, 20, 50 thousands. Our public has become intensely integrated and interwoven into our defence forces as a result of the confidence that exists between the people and the defence force. I should like to state another proposition: South Africa has never yet been compelled to be so independent, as regards its defence, as she is to-day. I should like to tell the hon. member who is laughing over there, that he does not know what is going on. During the last few years radical changes have taken place in respect of our ideas on our defence. In the past the South African defence force was a sub-division of the British Army for tactical purposes. We had to adapt ourselves to the British Army. Since South Africa has been freed from the Commonwealth ties, and South Africa started becoming independent on all fronts, it brought about a truly substantial change in our concept of our defence forces. All of us must realize that. Nobody can deny it. In this new order, outside the framework of the Commonwealth, with full recognition of our ties with the Commonwealth as a fellow Western state, South Africa is standing on its own feet in respect of defence, with a greater striking power than it has ever had in its history, thanks to the National Party.</p>

<p>If that were not so, it would have been as this English newspaper wrote last week. It wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing is easier than to criticize Fouch&#x00E9;, but if he fails to defend the country properly, who will be the first to criticize him?</block>

<p>There they sit. There they sit over there. And they continue&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not preparedness but the degree of preparedness which should be the subject of calm dispassionate discussion.</block>

<p>Yes, we are calm and dispassionate on this side; we are merely being harassed in our calm discussion by the laughter over there. I cannot find better evidence of what is going on in our defence forces and defence than the words of Lord Selkirk, when in 1957 he attended a banquet here, and afterwards spoke on defence. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place in modern war it is essential to have the best weapons and the best weapons to-day are becoming increasingly expensive. Fewer but more powerful weapons.</block>

<p>That is precisely what is going on in our defence force. The hon. member for Johannesburg North (Mrs. Weiss) attacked the Minister in a very subtle manner to-day, and said he should not spend the money on the defence of our country, he should rather take that money and educate the people. What a splendid ideal! All of us desire that. But I should like to answer her, and I do not think I can give her a better reply than to quote the famous Clausewitz, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most decisive act of judgment a statesman can exercise is rightly to understand the war in which he engages. He should not take it for something or wish to make of it something which, by the nature of its relations, it is impossible for it to be.</block>

<p>My reply to the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) is this: This Minister of Defence has to formulate and implement his policy in regard to the defence of the State according to the dictation of realities. That is the answer, and not the dream pictures the hon. member for Johannesburg North, with all her idealism, wishes to hang up. The study of our defence has become a very difficult matter. Warfare has become increasingly difficult, particularly in respect of the type of defence we are engaged on, namely, our own defence, not for aggression. It has become more difficult because after the Nassau agreement, during the last few months and the emphasis that has been laid on the use of the Polaris submarine, a complete change has come about in world strategy, a change that affects us profoundly. With this change in the use of weapons of war, and the rapid changes armaments have undergone, a number of new fronts have opened up for us simultaneously, to which our Minister of Defence must have regard. The whole Africa front has been opened up, with the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean and the north, but the latest front that has been opened up lately is space, which will be of very great importance in future in the military sphere.</p>

<p>Because from our experience during the Second World War we learned that a war is decided with the weapons with which it did not begin, it has become a matter of vital importance to us that we shall have to harness science and the most modern knowledge and research in order to keep pace with the ever increasing and rapidly changing exigencies of modern military techniques. Owing to the development of dangerous things, research and observation are extremely important to us. Because the latest invented scientific facts are to-day woven into the mechanical and electronic and chemical and thermic techniques that are already known, and can be applied productively for the manufacture of armaments, it is necessary that South Africa, as regards its defence, should not only resort to the training of people to use the weapons, but that South Africa and any country in the world should man the first front, and that is the front of science, to defend its country against aggression from within or without. The work of a modern defence force has become interwoven so closely with science in all its branches. and with scientific resources and methods, that it is completely impossible to maintain it on a proper level if it cannot rely upon a separate defence research department.</p>

<p><span class="col_3579-3580" refersTo="page_0364"/>Thus operational research was born of the Second World War. South Africa also has become profoundly involved in this whole new concept, this new pattern that has evolved in the sphere of militarism and war. I should like to mention some respects in which we have become involved in that. I say that with us warfare and the concept of defence have changed radically. In the past we were adapted to the British Army. In view of the new Wilson statement in particular, it has become absolutely necessary for us to develop wholly new ideas in connection with our defence. We should remember that South Africa is a power base in Africa, that South Africa overshadows all countries in Africa. The poor Africa is a poor country in comparison with South Africa. We occupy a special position because we are the only country in Africa that has never yet asked a single cent from any country in the world as a gift. When Mr. Soapy Williams recently referred to the $210,000,000 America has allocated to Africa, apart from the agricultural commodities they distributed gratis, South Africa did not get one cent of that. We stood on our own legs, and that creates a particularly unique position for us. But South Africa is something else too. We do not play off the West against the East like the rest of Africa. We have irrevocably compromised ourselves on the side of the Western world. We do not play to the right nor to the left. Because this is so, I should like to say that a vote of any Western country against South Africa is a vote of more significance against their own security and safety than it would have been had they cast it against any other country in Africa. If it should come to pass that we should lose control of the sea communications around the Cape, it will be a catastrophe for the Western nations, for America and mainly and specifically for Australia too. That creates a necessity for us to have a specific approach to our defence. But, Mr. Speaker, I should like to add that if this tremendous industrial machine and our industrial potential were to be lost to us in this power struggle in Africa, and if it were to fall into the hands or under the influence of the enemy camp outside the Western freedom camp, that self-same industrial power and potential in Africa, as brought about in South Africa, will be used to prepare the funeral of America and the Western world.</p>

<p>Important as we are, with our strategic value, with our great industrial potential, with our importance and with our irrevocable ties with the West, we are in spite of that the most maligned country and nation on earth, as we have once again seen in this film &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa.&#x201D; [Interjections.] All right, you rejoice about everything that is bad for South Africa. Because South Africa has the key to the future of a confused Africa, and wishes to retain it, because South Africa is the only power in Africa that can talk to the rest of the Western world on an equal footing and with an equal language, because South Africa will be able to deliver food in case of conflicts when food will be necessary, because we have the sources, because we have a settled civilization here and a proper parliamentary institution and a virile philosophy of life founded on the Christian faith of the European civilizations with which we are integrated; because South Africa has many fifth columns in its midst; because we know that our enemies have modern arms at their disposal; because we know that many of them are being provided with modern scientific equipment, not only from behind the Iron Curtain but from other countries too; and because we do not know whence our aid will come from the modern States; for these reasons it is essential that we shall build up our own pattern in respect of defence. We have limited manpower, Mr. Speaker. We have to prepare ourselves for one of the most difficult kinds of wars, and that is the defensive war. Because with the latest additions of science and technique to warfare, we have to deal with the destruction of all geographic boundaries, and because there has been a breakthrough by speed and because we shall not have much say in any global war, that is why it is essential that South Africa should have its own approach in respect of defence, and should prepare itself to protect its own boundaries against aggression. We say this, Mr. Speaker, we are grateful to say that our Minister of Defence&#x2014;I shall like to pay high tribute to him for it&#x2014;in 1961 established the Council for Defence Research. It is unique in the world, nowhere in the world is there such a position where the Minister himself occupies the Chair. It is the first time in history that the militarist and the scientist has been interwoven, for without science we shall go under as surely as we are sitting here to-day. If we are not going to harness science to the fullest extent to prepare our defence and related problems, for the purposes of our defence, we shall go under. I repeat this: We can do so only by means of science and by means of research. That is why I think the Minister deserves the thanks of every citizen of the country for having taken this initiative. It is unique. This Minister satisfies himself personally on the problems in respect of defence research. I repeat: He has knitted together the militarist and the scientist. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that America spends 80 per cent of its entire research expenditure on defence research? England spends 75 per cent; France spends 62 per cent. Australia has 4,400 people in its Weapons&#x2019; Research Establishment in respect of defence research that costs it nearly R40,000,000 per annum. And South Africa? We have to become aware of one fact, and that is that we shall not be able to stay on our feet if we do not take science with us most closely in respect of defence.</p>

<p>This conflict in the world is not the conflict the hon. member for North East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) knows. The phase in which he was living has long since passed. To-day it is a conflict of ingenuity; it is not a conflict of brute force. I should like to prove that. World War II and subsequent events amply demonstrated in a most fearful manner the role science plays <span class="col_3581-3582" refersTo="page_0365"/>in the destiny of mankind. Apart from the awesome nuclear bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki the war was largely decided by the battle of ingenuity between the scientists of the belligerent parties. Historians writing the history of the Second World War are unanimous that in 1940 England was saved from defeat because in 1935 already she had started to prepare herself for the scientific defence of her land. I should like to suggest to the hon. member who laughed like that just now, that he should go and read this history in the book of C. P. Snow &#x201C;Science and Government&#x201D;. By the intensive harnessing of science, the Allies won the battle against the German U-boats as well as against the Luftwaffe. Without going into details, I should like to quote from a letter written by Admiral Doenitz on 14 December 1943 to Dr. Karl K&#x00FC;pfm&#x00FC;ler. He instructed him to establish a corps of scientists for the German Naval Forces as soon as possible, and here are his words:</p>

<block name="quote">The enemy has achieved its object, not by superior tactics or strategy, but by its superiority in science.</block>

<p>A study of the Second World War reveals clearly how the battle in the Atlantic Ocean was won by science; how Britain won the Battle of Britain by the application of science, how the Allies smashed Germany only after they had summoned the scientists to come and help them. I should like to conclude by giving some figures. The great Battle of the Atlantic was won by science. The U-boat danger to the Allies was overcome by science. The onslaught of the German U-boats against Allied shipping during the Second World War was vanquished by science. When Germany sent its V.I. projectiles across to London&#x2014;it is interesting to see the data&#x2014;England would have lost that battle had it not been that they had harnessed science and combined a proximity tube, as they called it, plus radar plus an electronic predictor. Here I have the data. In the first week 24 per cent of the projectiles were destroyed. They gave Britain a hard knock. In the second week 46 per cent were destroyed; in the third week 67 per cent; in the fourth week the British anti-projectile men succeeded in destroying 79 per cent of the projectiles, and during the last day only four projectiles out of 104 reached Britain. And Britain was saved. I could also quote similar figures in respect of shipping.</p>

<p>In the interests of all of us, Mr. Speaker, I should like to urge here to-night, that where South Africa has entered a new era that is irrevocable, where South Africa is irrevocably compromised on the side of the Western world, where South Africa is irrevocably committed to defend its boundaries against aggression on its own, the people of South Africa should become aware once and for all of how important science is to our defence. Scientists are internationally marketable commodities. That is the reason why many of our scientists are resident overseas. They are there because they are receiving more remuneration.</p>

<p>You cannot expect of the scientist that his patriotism should always keep him in South Africa. He is internationally saleable on the market. Therefore I should like to plead tonight that all of us should come to realize fully the great task of the Minister of Defence. We should like to congratulate him for having taken the lead in bringing the militarist and the scientist together, and for having emphasized by the establishment of this Defence Research Council, how important science is. We would express the hope that the people of South Africa will be prepared to give much more in future to pay the scientists much more for they are fighting in the front line. Without their aid we shall lose this struggle as surely as we are sitting here to-night. I am pleading for the scientist; I am pleading for better remuneration for him; I am pleading for recognition. In the same way that I am pleading that we should provide the soldier with the very best training, I am pleading that we should give the Minister of Defence his front line, and that is his scientists. The modern and military techniques and modern warfare is no longer the affair of the layman; it is no longer a matter of brute force or physical strength; it has become a matter of ingenuity, of shrewd planning and research. It has become closely interwoven with knowledge. Because the intelligence associated with scientists is normally so frugally conferred upon any nation&#x2014;there is only a very small source from which that intelligence may be drawn&#x2014; it will not help us to send more and more people to the universities. That will not produce the scientist. The scientist will be produced by enabling him to utilize all the related branches of science, and to concentrate on that particular task and to develop the required arms that will provide us with the striking power to defend our country against those who will have the courage to dare attack us. May our people become aware of this necessity, and may we give our Minister of Defence the support he truly deserves for having giving South Africa his guidance. That is why I say, as I began, that I have never seen so much confidence, such a morale, such a profound interwovenness between our people and our Defence Force, as in the year 1963, and with such a Defence Force and with such an approach and with such a realization we shall be able to face all these swaggering braggarts who are challenging us and provoking us every day, and we shall be able to hold our own. May it be so.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We have in this House become accustomed to the hon. the Minister of Finance adopting various roles when he presents his Budget, but I must say that it is a new experience for me to listen to the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) who has the voice of a sergeant-major, assuming unto himself the role of a military strategist and the rank of a field-marshal. Since my experience of the army is about as non-existent as is that of the hon. member for Ventersdorp, and since he is in the habit of making <span class="col_3583-3584" refersTo="page_0366"/>very loud, very dogmatic and very inaccurate statements in this House, I do not intend to waste any of my precious time in replying to the hon. member for Ventersdorp.</p>

<p>I want to address a remark or two to the hon. Minister of Finance. The first is that I want to congratulate him in a very small measure on at last showing some understanding of modern economics, of budgeting as far as growth-planning is concerned. There are some indications in this Budget that the hon. Minister is at last coming round to that type of budgeting; secondly, I want to say that I am pleased to see that in this Budget he has given some cognizance to suggestions I made last year about the incentive that has to be given to the gold-mining industry, firstly, to go in for new prospecting and secondly, to encourage mining of medium grade ore at deep levels. Those are the two small bouquets which I would like to hand to the hon. the Minister of Finance. But I am afraid that that is where my small tribute ends. I have no further floral tributes to offer to the hon. the Minister. I do not share the sentiments of members such as the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet), who went into ecstasies over the fact that not only are we able to make small concessions to the taxpayers but we are also able to go in for this larger-scale expenditure on national security.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say &#x201C;small concessions&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. Minister is not basking too much in the plaudits of the populace for these concessions that have been granted, because it is customary for taxpayers to heave a large sigh of relief when the Minister of Finance does not impose any further taxes on them, and that sigh of relief turns of course into a smile of appreciation when a few concessions are granted at the same time.</p>

<p>But the hon. Minister really has not been enjoying the role that he should have been enjoying in this debate as Minister of Finance. He should have been the star turn as Minister of Finance, but in fact most of the discussions in this debate have been of course on other matters. To some extent, the hon. the Minister is himself to blame for this because his own Budget with its large new expenditure on defence, on national security, a 33&#x00BD; per cent increase on last year&#x2019;s amount, raising it to the unprecedented level of R 157,000,000 this year, together with an additional R5,000,000 for police, I think depicts this Budget as a Budget of fear. It also depicts the hon. Minister&#x2019;s frame of mind and the frame of mind of the entire Government and is as far as I am concerned, a clear admission of failure that Bantustans are not going to engender a feeling of good neighbourliness in South Africa. If you are undertaking a policy such as the Government is doing at the present stage of &#x201C;good neighbourliness&#x201D;, which is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s phrase, then, Sir, it is not necessary to buy guns with which to face your new good neighbours. As far as I am concerned, this Budget is a Budget of fear and it is a Budget which admits that the Bantustan plan is doomed to failure as a method of inducing harmonious race relations in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister has in fact realized that and his additional expenditure for defence and police has got a financial aspect to it. He knows that there is a feeling of uneasiness about South Africa despite its wonderful resources, resources, for which I may say, the National Government and indeed this evening the hon. Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, takes personal credit. In fact, those resources are there whether the Nationalist Government is there or not. Whether the efficient exploitation of those resources will ever take place under this Government is of course another matter. The hon. Minister realizes that despite our wonderful resources, despite the fact that South Africa should be poised on the brink of its third great economic expansion, he knows that investors both abroad and in South Africa are nervous of this country. Therefore he says to them in effect: Invest your money in our wonderful resources and I will provide the security. This is the key to the additional 33&#x2153; per cent that the hon. the Minister wants us to vote for internal security together with the R5,000,000 additional for the Police Vote. As I said, the hon. the Minister has not been enjoying the role that he should have been enjoying in this Budget, and to a large extent this additional expenditure on internal security is of course one of the reasons why the debate has gone the way that it has gone over the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the subject that was raised yesterday, because it is tied up so strongly with this question of internal security, about which a great deal has been said, but about which a great deal as yet been left unsaid. I want to come back to the Snyman Report and the Poqo trouble in South Africa. To me the only surprising thing about this is that anybody should have been surprised that it happened. Three years ago when I and my colleagues in the Progressive Party were the only people to oppose the Unlawful Organizations Act, the banning of A.N.C. and P.A.C., we warned the country and we warned this House that if we banned organizations, open political organizations, they would be replaced by underground subversive organizations. We warned this House and we warned the country that if non-violent political protests were banned, they would be replaced by other organizations and violent political protests. I want to warn again that no matter how drastic the measures that are taken against the sort of organization such as have appeared recently, no matter how drastic those provisions are, such organizations will reappear in ever greater strength in South Africa, unless certain additional steps are taken as well. I do not think that the official Opposition should boast that it supported the passage of the Unlawful Organizations Act through Parliament a few <span class="col_3585-3586" refersTo="page_0367"/>years ago. I believe that if the official Opposition had acted strongly at that time, if it had not given the green light to the Government to go ahead and believe that all that was needed were strongarm methods, the country would have been in a much better position to-day. I believe that the very least that the official Opposition should have done at that time was to get an undertaking from the Government that not only would it put down subversive activities, but that at the same time it would take all the necessary steps to do something about the root causes of the then emergency state in South Africa. Yet, when the Government of the day took the one sensible step that it took during the emergency, which was to relax the pass laws, it was the United Party that immediately accused the Government of an act of weakness, and so, Sir, immediately the Government reimposed the pass laws and tensions were as great in South Africa again as they had been before. To my mind, far too much time has been devoted in this House to attacking the Minister of Justice for not taking stronger action against Poqo, and not merely enough attention has been devoted to the positive evidence that has been given at the Paarl inquiry about conditions in the Paarl location, conditions about corruption of officials, the grinding poverty and the frustration of the people&#x2014;the real cause for the emergence of organizations like Poqo. I want to quote a few of the statements in the submissions of the advocate who appeared on behalf of the Institute of Race Relations at that inquiry, Mr. King. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is submitted that the basic, underlying cause of dissatisfaction amongst the Bantu of Paarl is the restriction of the right to seek work and to reside with dependants at the place of work.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The migrant labour system, which is enforced primarily by the so-called &#x201C;pass laws&#x201D;, causes a disruption of family life by the enforced break-up of the family unit, limits the right of the Bantu bread-winner to earn a living, forces the concentration of large numbers of married men in &#x201C;bachelor quarters&#x201D; and is bound to lead to frustration and tension.<br/>That it causes widespread dissatisfaction has emerged as common cause at this commission.</block>

<p>These are the things that should have been receiving the major attention of this Parliament, because the important thing is to me that Paarl is not an exception&#x2014;to some extent or another, wherever the Bantu Urban Areas Act is being administered, the same conditions apply. There may not be as much corruption in other areas as there is in Paarl. In Johannesburg, for instance, I do not believe there is such corruption, but the same underlying causes of frustration and grievance exist in every single urban area throughout the whole of South Africa. One has only to look at the Riots Commission&#x2019;s report of 1958, a commission consisting of Judge Centlivres, Judge Roper and Judge Greenberg, three of our great judicial men. Those men in framing their report came to very much the same sort of conclusion as the submissions that have been made at the Paarl inquiry. The hon. member for Yeoville was quite right yesterday when he pointed out that it is in Langa that Poqo is at its strongest, and that it is in Langa that the Government&#x2019;s policies are being most strictly administered. Paragraph 13 of the Snyman Report says this. The hon. member over there shakes his head. Two days ago he was lauding the Snyman Report. But if he will look at paragraph 13 of the Snyman Report, he will see that the report points to the fact that it is in Langa that this organization is at its strongest. It does not require a trained sociologist to realize the correlation between the fact that Poqo is at its strongest in Langa Location and that it is in the Western Cape that endorsements-out are being conducted on the greatest scale, that following the Eisselen Line, 26,000 people have been endorsed out of this area over the past three years and that in Langa of the 18,311 men housed in bachelor quarters two-thirds, or over 12,000 are actually married men. So this is a correlation which cannot be ignored. It is all very well for the Government to say that they accept the Snyman Report. But in the very next breath the Government should promise to do something about the underlying causes of grievances. Then I believe there would be a ray of hope throughout South Africa immediately. But not one single member of the Government side has so much as breathed a word of hope to the African people in this regard. What have we had indeed in this country since 1950, since the first oppressive measure was passed which was, and I quote &#x201C;to guarantee the security of the state and its citizens&#x201D;? One oppressive measure has followed the other, from the Anti-Communist Act. to the Whipping Bills, from the Whipping Bills to the Banning of Unlawful Organizations Act, from there to states of emergency, to the banning of persons, and finally, to the <i>pi&#x00E8;ce de r&#x00E9;sistance</i>, the Sabotage Act with all its vast powers of house arrests and restrictions. And what else have we had? At the same time as these oppressive measures have been introduced we have had further restrictions on the ordinary every-day life of the African people and the non-Europeans. We have had removals under the Group Areas Act, we have had the loss of the few remaining freehold rights of Africans in urban areas, we have had the removal of their representatives from Parliament, heavier taxes, and hardly anything done about the crushing burden of poverty under which the Africans live, the break-up of their trade unions, the introduction of job reservation, and finally, ever more burdens and restrictions under influx control and the pass laws. And these laws I say are inhuman laws, and what is more, they <span class="col_3587-3588" refersTo="page_0368"/>dehumanize the officials that have to administer them. Because unless these officials can forget that they are dealing with human beings, that they are wrecking the lives of human beings, they are unable to carry out their jobs. I challenge any member of this House who has got a grain of compassion in him to go and spend a morning in the Bantu Commissioner&#x2019;s court, to go and spend a morning in a pass office and watch the expressions of pure hopelessness on the faces of hundreds and hundreds of Africans whose entire life has been changed and ruined by the application of influx control and pass laws and not feel moved by this sight. Sir, I want to say that two days ago, a letter arrived which completely, as far as I am concerned, highlights this whole attitude of officialdom, of inability to yield, of determination to carry out apartheid, to bow to this holy cow of apartheid, irrespective of the circumstances of the case. Sir, I have a letter from a man called Samuel Manjati. This letter arrived a few days ago and he begged me to take up his case, because he says he has been trying for many months now to get permission for his wife to stay with him in Cape Town. Now Manjati himself, I might say, is only allowed in Cape Town by the tenuous thread of official permission because he has lost his qualification to stay here. He came to this town in 1947, a long time ago, but, Sir, he committed the cardinal sin of breaking his continuous residence by going back to the reserve, back to Umtata, and when he returned, he found that he had lost his qualification; he no longer qualified for permanent residence, but he was allowed to stay here as long as he continues to hold his job with his present employer, which so far he has been able to do. But it is his wife who has been with him since 1957 who is now being endorsed out of the area, on whose behalf that he pleads. This is the letter, or part of it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dear Madam, I appeal on behalf of my wife Beatrice Manjati who has been endorsed out by the authorities. She must leave on 25 March 1963. The reason why I make this appeal to you: My wife is ill through the injuries she sustained during 1960 riot when her baby was shot dead by a soldier, and since then she never get well.</block>

<p>A woman whose child was shot dead on her back during the 1960 Langa disturbances. This woman is being endorsed out of the area and is not allowed to remain with her husband. The letter goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">She has sore heart. She is still under treatment at Groote Schuur Hospital. Last month I appealed to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. He has turned down my request. I now appeal to you, Madam. This is a serious matter that an unhealthy woman must stay without her husband.</block>

<p>The hon. Deputy Minister is incorrect. He laughs. This is the usual reaction. But he is incorrect. I have checked on this. She is once again receiving treatment and she has been receiving treatment from private doctors. I have here a letter from the Minister&#x2019;s Department, turning down this request, and it ends by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of all these factors &#x2026;</block>

<p>including the one that she has not been for treatment, not for three years incidentally, but since July 1961, and I have proof of that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in view of all these factors coupled with the fact that further medical treatment that may be required can be obtained at Umtata, the hon. Minister is of the opinion that it will be in the interest of all concerned if she now returns to her home in Umtata.</block>

<p>I want to tell the hon. Minister that at the moment this woman has been given an extension of time until Friday. She should have left on Monday. She has got an extension until Friday because an official in the Minister&#x2019;s Department is waiting for the medical certificates to be produced to show that she is still under treatment and requires treatment here. I sincerely hope that permission will be further extended. But this is not the point. I only raised this medical point because it is a factor which is being used by people who are trying to help this woman. But surely the main point is that this is a case of unbelievable callousness, and whether this woman requires medical treatment or not, surely the least that the Government can do, after the woman has gone through this experience, and apart from the bonus which they have given her, some R560 to compensate for suffering and pain and expenses, etc., surely this was a case in point where the granite front could have cracked a little, where this woman could have been given permission to stay with her husband? I think, Sir, this is a case of sheer lack of compassion and humanity and that is why I say even to administer inhuman laws, means that eventually those who have to administer the laws become inhuman themselves because they are unable to carry on with such a job if they realize that they are dealing with human beings. I say that the least the Government could do in a case like this is to cut the red-tape and allow this woman to stay with her husband, whether she requires extended medical treatment or not. I make this plea across the floor of the House to the hon. Deputy Minister, and I say: At least let the Government emerge from this with some semblance of compassion and understanding, and let them at least in this case grant some respite <span class="col_3589-3590" refersTo="page_0369"/>from these dreadful pass laws. I want to say that whilst I am asking for special exemption in this particular case, not for a moment do I believe that the granting exemptions under the pass laws is the answer to this problem. I believe the pass laws must be scrapped completely. I believe that they are the greatest single cause of racial friction in South Africa A thousand people a day, in 1961 (the last figures available), were convicted under the pass laws. A thousand people a day went to gaol or paid fines under the pass laws. I say that granting exemptions is no answer, because for every 100 exemptions granted, hundreds of thousands of people still suffer under the pass laws. People are convicted for what? What is the crime? The crime is moving freely around the country of one&#x2019;s birth, seeking to sell one&#x2019;s labour in the market that will pay the highest price. As far as I am concerned, that is no crime at all. It is a fundamental right. And amending the pass laws will not help either, because you cannot maintain pass laws and influx control unless all these restrictions still obtain. The hon. member for Yeoville talks about the shanty town conditions that came about in Johannesburg during the war. He knows that we could not have sustained the war effort without those thousands of Africans coming into the urban areas, and he also knows or should know, that the City Council of Johannesburg did not spend a penny on housing the Africans who came to those areas, and that is why shanty towns developed.</p>

<p>The hon. member is confusing two completely different issues, and I advise him to keep his temper and to try and think logically for once. The Western Areas Removal scheme had nothing to do with the shanty towns that already existed in Orlando Township. The Western Areas provided in fact better houses than many of the shanty towns, such as Moroka. The hon. member also knows that the major principle behind the Western Areas removal scheme was the deprivation of the few remaining freehold rights that urban Africans enjoyed. He knows that perfectly well.</p>

<p>I want to ask this House what a White man would say if he lost his job, was removed from his residence and told that he could no longer stay in the city and if he were deprived of his family life. What would a White man say? What would a White woman in this country say if, because her husband is not qualified by virtue of being born in this town or by virtue of continuous residence for 15 years, or continuous employment with one employer for ten years. (Section 10 of the Urban Areas Act), what would a White woman say married to a husband by Christian rights in this Christian country, if she were not allowed to live with her husband under those conditions? What would any White woman say in this country, and what would any White man say?</p>

<p>At the risk of being repetitious, I want to say again for the umpteenth time in this House that people will only consent to laws if they believe that they are just laws. That is why I really believe it is a mistake to bracket together &#x201C;law&#x201D; and &#x201C;order&#x201D;. It is a mistake, because very often the worst disorders stem from unjust laws. This was said a long time ago in the British House of Commons, but it is equally true in South Africa to-day. Sir, one can rule by force for a long time, but one cannot rule by force for ever. And while it lasts, that rule by force, life becomes increasingly uncomfortable for everyone, for those who rule and for those who are ruled.</p>

<p>I say again that unless a sincere attempt is made to remove the underlying grievances that lay behind the disturbances at Paarl, that lay behind the formation of an organization like Poqo, we are going to have a repetition over and over again in this House of more and more legislation in connection with more and more violent organizations being formed, the Minister taking more and more drastic measures to control them. In the end we will be living in a state of siege, in a White laager.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) is the last one who should talk about the clearing up of slums and shanty towns, because during her entire political career in Johannesburg she welcomed having slums and shanty towns for her contemptible political purposes. When we wanted to clear up that terrible breeding ground of crime and disease, when the poor Bantu about whom she is now so concerned became ill and died by the thousands, she was the one who opposed us most, together with the United Party, she and the whole City Council of Johannesburg. She ought to be ashamed to talk about shanty towns. I suspect her of being one of the people who welcome that type of thing. She welcomes it for one of two reasons. Some people welcome it because they make money out of it. I have no knowledge of her business transactions. But one reason why she welcomes it is because she wants to make political capital out of it.</p>

<p>South Africa has been terribly shocked during the past day or two by this television film. &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;. It is <i>a</i> shockingly false distortion of what goes on in South Africa. I saw only part of that film this morning, but I have quite a good idea of what it is about, and I now say without fear of contradiction that that film does not contain half the distortions in regard to conditions in South Africa that that hon. member would like to tell the world about. But I do not stop with her. I say that that film, &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;, is based on the type of speech to which we have just been listening, and it is based on the type of propaganda made by the United Party. I say there is absolutely nothing which appeared in that film <span class="col_3591-3592" refersTo="page_0370"/>which has not been said by that hon. member from time to time, and by the Opposition.</p>

<p>But I first want to deal with one of the most scandalous speeches to which we have ever listened in this House, the speech made last night by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman). The hon. member said that we were angry and the Minister of Information was angry because the Opposition says that we do too much for the Bantu, and then the hon. member added this: &#x201C;You are now angry because we say that you do too much for the Bantu. Do you want us to say that you do too little for the Bantu?&#x201D;. No, that is not what we want. All we want is that they should not paint such a false picture in regard to what is done for the Bantu. All we want is that they should not paint such a false picture as the one depicted in this film, &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;. Mr. Speaker, I tell you now that the United Party and the hon. member for Zululand and his minions have painted a picture of South Africa equally as false as the one painted by that despicable American. I want to prove it by reading what was said by him. I have here a speech made by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), in which he set out the position in South Africa, and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While Dr. Verwoerd stays in power and rules with a rod of iron, he should not be surprised if the iron enters the soul of his African fellow-citizens and causes them to think with their spears.</block>

<p>That is precisely what this American said. And precisely the same incitement contained in that false American film. Then he said in regard to a request for a conference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One could expect nothing but chronic disturbances, perpetual unrest and recurring riots from non-European South Africans who have been driven to distress and desperation by 13 years of bullying, of dragooning, of injustice and of humiliation.</block>

<p>I now ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Germiston (District): Is there anything in that film worse than what their member for Wynberg said? Then he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Nationalists are inviting a fight that they can never win. Final victory must go to superior numbers.</block>

<p>Is that not precisely what Patrick Duncan said in that film? I say that film is based on the statements of the hon. member for Wynberg, or the statements of the United Party and on the propaganda which they falsely made against the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton Russell, according to a report in the <i>Cape Times</i> of a speech he made at Claremont on 4 May 1961. But listen to what that hon. member said further. and that is contained in an article he wrote in the <i>Cape Times.</i> Listen to what he says about conditions in South Africa. I say this is almost twice as bad as the film &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;. If they had just photographed half and shown half of what the hon. member for Wynberg as well as other hon. members opposite had said, that film would have been even worse than it actually is. This is what the hon. member for Wynberg says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">People of Black and Brown skins have been banished from our universities.</block>

<p>Surely that is a lie; surely it is a false statement. There is not a single word about the universities established for them, and not a single word about the fact that those who are still at the universities may remain there. No, he tells the world that people with Black and Brown skins have been banished from our universities. &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D; does not contain anything as shocking as the words of the hon. member for Wynberg. But he goes on and says the following&#x2014;just listen. Then we are surprised that the Americans hate us and that the British hate us and that the outside world hates us. What I am going to read now was not said by that lying American. It was not said by the so-called open enemies of South Africa, but it was said by one of the leading figures in the United Party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To this Government anyone with a Black skin is an untouchable.</block>

<p>I ask the hon. member for Germiston (District) whether he agrees with that? Does he think this is the type of thing to tell the world, that all Blacks are untouchables in South Africa? Does it surprise him then that this American has made the film he did, a film which is now arousing enmity towards our country? He says, further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All channels of communication and contact between men of different colour in South Africa have been deliberately destroyed &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is an infamous lie and a total untruth&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is no sphere in which men of intellect of different colours can carry on responsible discussion. The Only relationship which is permitted is one of master and servant.</block>

<p><span class="col_3593-3594" refersTo="page_0371"/>That is what the hon. member for Wynberg says. He is a man who will become one of their leading Cabinet Ministers if they should ever come into power. If this is the truth, then I say that nobody can blame America and UN if they say they can no longer tolerate such a state of affairs. I say they are now reaping the dragon&#x2019;s teeth they sowed in South Africa. They are now reaping the hatred they sowed, not by means of truths, not by means of fair criticism, but by means of what the Opposition to-day admits is a distorted, false and shocking representation of the position in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) this. They say we do too much for the Bantu. I do not care about that. They can say what they like, but what I find so immoral and indefensible, and what revolts me to the soul, is this. Those hon. members, particularly the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) and others, want to make political capital and they say: &#x201C;You do too much for the Bantu and neglect the White man,&#x201D; in order to catch a few miserable votes.</p>

<p>I will point out what the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) said. But in the same breath they tell the outside world that we oppress the Bantu. Mr. Speaker, I do not blame the hon. member for Germiston (District) for walking out now, because he is far too decent to remain sitting in that party any longer. But then they tell the outside world, not that we do too much for the Bantu, but that we oppress them to such an extent that it can only lead to a blood-bath. What do they say about the Transkei? I just want to mention it in passing; I do not want to discuss it. They say it is complete independence with all the attendant dangers, and then they try to incite the public by telling them of the dangers which immediate independence will lead to. But then the hon. member for Wynberg writes articles which are cabled overseas and in which he says there is no talk of independence; it is only a bluff on the part of the Government. Sir, I say that is sabotage such as we have never before had in this country.</p>

<p>I should now like to have the attention of the hon. member for Zululand if he would stop writing Hansard. Surely there are other people here to write Hansard. I do not want to do the hon. member an injustice. I want to ask him whether he said last night that he is opposed to job reservation? He was very brave when he spoke last night, and I ask him now to show some courage and to reply to a very simple question. Did he say that he was opposed to job reservation?

<p>I withdraw it, and say we have never seen so much courage. I ask them whether they are in favour of job reservation in the mines, or are they opposed to it? No, he will not reply. But, Sir, someone who has a lot of courage has just entered the Chamber, the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). In politics he can give as good as he can take. He has not yet received instructions from his Whips not to reply to anything I say, and therefore I want to ask him whether he is against job reservation?</p>

<p>Then I take it that the hon. member for Durban (Point) agrees with the hon. member for Zululand and that they are opposed to all job reservation. But are they opposed to job reservation in the mines? He has not the courage to reply. I ask: Are they in favour of job reservation in this House? Of course. [Interjection.] They say that these troubles we have with Poqo are the result of job reservation, but I tell them they are just as much in favour of job reservation as we are. It is in terms of their written policy that there should be job reservation in the mines and job reservation in this House, so that, in terms of their policy, Luthuli will not take over Vause Raw&#x2019;s job in this House. There is job reservation here. There is job reservation in the municipalities and in the Provincial Councils and everywhere. There is job reservation in education, because they will not allow a Black man to educate their children. They are as much in favour of job reservation as we are, but their whole accusation against the Government is that Poqo is <span class="col_3595-3596" refersTo="page_0372"/>the result of job reservation. Are they not ashamed of themselves? It is a pity the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) is not here, but last night he said the primary reason for the existence of Poqo was the fact that the families of the Bantu workers could not live with them. He says it is our policy, but if it is our policy I want to ask any of the members over there: Is it their policy that the families of the Bantu should live with them? Is it their policy that every Bantu worker who is employed here should be able to bring his wife and children with him?</p>

<p>Ah, there is the Leader of the Opposition. I am sure he will not reveal the same lack of courage as the hon. member for Durban (Point). I am disappointed in him. I asked the Leader of the Opposition, seeing that his deputy leader said last night that the reason for Poqo was because Bantu women were not allowed to live with their husbands in the cities, is it the policy of his party that Bantu women and their children should be able to live with their husbands in the urban areas? No, he will not reply. He is also starting to write Hansard now. No, they do not know what their policy is. They just say this when it suits them. Mr. Speaker, the whole of the mining industry is based on migratory labour. Mr. Harry Oppenheimer asked permission to build townships in the Free State goldfields so that the Bantu could live there with their families, but this Government refused, and it had the full support of the United Party. In other words, they themselves said that the things which they consider to be the cause of Poqo should take place. But they tell the world that it is not the inciters, not the intimidators, not the saboteurs, not the criminals, who cause these things; it is these poor frustrated people, because there is job reservation, and because they cannot keep their families with them. That is the reason for the murder and the manslaughter and the sabotage. When they live in this country and say such things, can one be angry with such a vile American who makes a film such as &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;? He need only film half of what they say and propagate to have a much worse film than the one he has. Sir, look at this shocking situation. They dare not say what their policy is, but they say this is the cause of the murders and of Poqo. Those hon. members know it is not true. The greatest peace we had in South Africa was in the single quarters in the mine compounds, where almost 500,000 Bantu are employed, who all live in the single quarters. But the greatest violence we have had in the history of South Africa came from those quarters where the Bantu were living together with their wives, such as Cato Manor and Sharpeville. But the world is told that the agitators are not responsible for those murders; it is the Government&#x2019;s fault, through not allowing the Bantu women to live with the men. whilst they know that just the opposite is the truth.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Zululand made this shocking statement last night that the great majority of the Bantu support Poqo. He went so far as to say that the Bantu police support Poqo. Mr. Speaker, I want to say this frankly, and I hope you will not order me to withdraw it, that in so far as the Bantu police are concerned I am sure they have as much loyalty as one could find on the part of the Opposition. It was a shocking allegation which was made by the hon. member for Zululand, that 80 per cent of the Bantu police in South Africa support Poqo. The hon. member for Zululand keeps on writing because he is ashamed of himself, and because he is afraid of answering a single question in regard to that speech of his, because he knows that what he said is not true. He did not care what he said to undermine this country, as long as he could just make a little miserable political propaganda. [Interjection.] The Opposition dragged Judge Snyman&#x2019;s Report into this debate with the sole object of making propaganda out of it. I repeat what was said by the Prime Minister, that when the Leader of the Opposition said that they were willing to assist the Government to suppress this thing, he did not speak the truth because they do not intend assisting the Government and they will not help it. They will oppose every step taken by the Government to deal with Poqo, as we will still see during this Session. They pretend that all these things which Judge Snyman mentioned in his report, Poqo and this sabotage, murder and arson, are all attempts to right the wrongs in South Africa. The hon. member for Yeoville said so in so many words. He said: Let the women come here. The hon. member for Zululand said: Abolish job reservation. The Leader of the Opposition said: Give these people the opportunity to buy their own sites in the Bantu residential areas and then there will be an end to all this violence. In other words, make concessions to them. But I say to them: Do all those things and you will not even have touched the fringe of this matter, because their whole diagnosis is wrong. Their diagnosis would have been correct if the aim of Poqo was to right supposed wrongs, but that is not their object: they are there for a different purpose, and even though all those grievances are eliminated they will still carry on in the same way. We can test it very easily. They say: Put us in power. That is what the hon. member for Yeoville said last night. Sir, I almost thought I had said something wrong again! [Laughter.] They say: Put us in power and this sabotage and the murders and Poqo will cease. I want to ask: How far are they prepared to go? We have the instance of Southern Rhodesia. I am not talking about the north. Southern Rhodesia said: Let your women come and live here; all job reservation is abolished and you can swim in our swimming-baths and sit in our hotels and drink tea in our caf&#x00E9;s. Southern Rhodesia said there would be not only eight Bantu members in the central Parliament, but 15. But did that put a stop <span class="col_3597-3598" refersTo="page_0373"/>to the demands of those people? Did that put an end to the violence? So little did it put a stop to it that after they had made all those concessions, after the swimming-baths had been opened to them and all job reservation had been abolished, and after they had been granted equal political and social rights with the Whites, then the throwing of petrol bombs took place on such a scale that they passed &#x00E0;n Act in the Southern Rhodesian Parliament providing for the compulsory death sentence to be imposed on anyone throwing a petrol bomb.</p>

<p>Yes. All that murder and arson and the throwing of petrol bombs took place after the Southern Rhodesian Parliament had made 200 per cent more concessions than the Opposition is willing to make.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, why do they not realize what is going on in this country? The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) said that these things were the result of the injustice committed against the Bantu, and this is merely an attempt to set right those grievances. Mr. Speaker, Southern Rhodesia went further than even she wants to go, and it is no use her saying, &#x201C;nonsense She is an intellectually honest person. But notwithstanding all those concessions, these things are happening. Can these people not realize that this is not an attempt on the part of the Black people to remedy grievances? Only one thing is happening here, and it is an attempt, not to overthrow this Government, but to make it impossible to have any White Government in South Africa. It is precisely the same sort of thing which went on in Kenya and in Nyasaland and in Northern Rhodesia and in Southern Rhodesia. It is not an attempt to remedy grievances. They do not want to remedy grievances. They want to take over the country and the Government.</p>

<p>I shall argue with the hon. member on that point next week. The hon. member may not know it, but there is a Bill on the Order Paper which, in his language, makes provision for Bantustans, and therefore I am not allowed to discuss it. But he is still a young member and in ten years&#x2019; time he may perhaps know the rules of this House. I am just saying that those hon. members should realize that this is the position, and they admit that the position is dangerous, but they are not prepared to say whether they will do something to help this Government to put a stop to this attempt which is being made, not to overthrow this Government, but to make any White Government in South Africa impossible, and to give the Government the powers to do so.</p>

<p>I do not think anyone will deny that this is the problem with which we are faced&#x2014;not the elimination of grievances, but the bloodthirsty, inexorable and ruthless attempt on the part of Mandela, on the part of Luthuli, on the part of Sobukwe, to put an end to the White man in South Africa, with the assistance of the Opposition. If the Leader of the Opposition were sincere in the offer he made to the Prime Minister and had said: We will assist you in combating this attempt to overthrow the White Government by violence&#x2014;if he were sincere that there was only one way open to him, then he should have done just one thing, and that was to tell the Prime Minister: Here we have murder and manslaughter; here we have sabotage of the worst kind, and here we have an attempt to overthrow the Whites, so therefore you must take all the powers you consider necessary, and we as an Opposition will see to it that you do not abuse those powers. But what does history teach us? And it will happen again during this Session. Every time we take powers to combat these fiendish forces, these devilish things about which the hon. member for Germiston (District) is so concerned, they tell the outside world that this is a police state, that it is a fascist state, a state in which there is no longer any freedom. Sir, I am afraid that whatever the protestations of the Opposition are&#x2014;and I have never been more convinced of it than when I saw that film to-day&#x2014;they are prepared to sacrifice the safety of the Whites in South Africa in the pious hope that it will gain them votes and that they will be able to take over the Government.</p>

<p>I now challenge that hon. member to deny the things said by the hon. member for Wynberg. Is it not a fact that that hon. member&#x2019;s party said that we are a police state? Is it not the truth that they said that there is no freedom of speech in South Africa? Did his leader not say that in terms of the church clause there is no freedom of religion in this country? Does he want to deny it? Then he still says I ought to be ashamed of myself. Yes, I should be ashamed of myself because we do not reveal these things to the public and to the world to a greater extent. That is the only reason why I am ashamed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am now going to resume my seat. You will not have to put up with me much longer. I say that is the role they played and which they now play in regard to the Snyrnan Report, and that is the role they will play when we try to safeguard the position of the White man. I have reluctantly come to this sad conclusion, that the hon. members opposite, and amongst them I must include the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Germiston (District), would very much like to see a state of affairs in this country which would lead to chaos, on the wave of which they would come into power, and on that note <span class="col_3599-3600" refersTo="page_0374"/>I conclude. That is why the people despise them. That is why the people reject them increasingly. That is why the people will no longer listen to them, because they see through these things. They now want to make use of the Snyman Report&#x2014;and that proved it to me conclusively&#x2014;but they made not the slightest attempt to tell the Government: Let us leave all politics aside now, let us leave aside all this nonsense and let us stand together. No, then they put up their most exemplary member to make a plea, and they said that this was not the fault of the saboteurs or of the intimidators or of the murderers or of the arsonists, but the fault of Hendrik Verwoerd and his followers, so carry on. That is why I have come to this conclusion. They said that this was the parting of the ways. Yes, it is really the parting of the ways. We cannot expect any assistance from that side of the House in this crisis. But the people will hear of it. We will not settle accounts with them; the people of South Africa will settle accounts with them.</p>

<p>From the statements made by Ministers and the more responsible members opposite, we have had a constant stressing of the serious state of affairs developing in this country, and one can gauge the depth of despair to which the Government side has sunk as the result of the hammering they have received when they put the hon. member for Vereeniging in to try to restore the morale of their party. The hon. member is well known for his synthetic display of indignation, but that is not the sort of speech we want at a time like this. We do not want appeals to the blood; we want appeals to the head. That is what a country needs at the moment, and therefore I do not want to answer the hon. member at all because it is not worth it. I am sorry, also, that I am not able to reply at length to the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling), because our time in this debate is limited and I want to deal with a particular subject, but I want to tell him that I am sorry I cannot follow him in his orbital flight through space. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Defence was delighted to find this new technical expert backing up his defence system. But one thing he did mention about the morale to-day in the Defence Force I accept, but I will add this to it, that this Minister would have found it very hard to have done anything at all for the Defence Force he inherited without improving it. But it has been improved. But I will leave the hon. member there.</p>

<p>We have come to a point in this debate where it is not possible to treat the matter with levity. There are serious matters affecting the security of the country which have to be discussed, and I want to deal with a matter of defence, not a new matter, but a matter which has been raised by this side of the House before, in the hope that some effective action will be taken, and to consider our proposals and if possible to meet them.</p>

<p>One of the most important aspects of the parliamentary control of defence expenditure has been raised by this party time and again. I refer to the aspect of the information available to Parliament to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities as the watchdog over expenditure, which Parliament itself has to approve of. Over the last 12 years this Parliament has voted approximately R1,000,000,000 towards the defence of this country. We have to accept that probably an equivalent amount has been involved in the hidden costs to the country of defence, in its effect on the general economy, the expenditure in cash, men and material, on which no money value can be placed. That is no small amount for a small country like ours. Following on last year&#x2019;s record defence budget of R120,000,000, the hon. the Minister of Finance has asked us this year to put up another record by voting R157,000,000, and the Minister of Finance asked us to accept that as the minimum price of protection against the foreign aggressor. These are two important statements which have to be followed up. This side of the House is not going to hold up the provision of that expenditure. The Minister has asked for it and we are in that parlous state where we have to be prepared, and it is not our intention to hold up the granting of the money, but there are questions we want to ask. We are not only going to repeat and emphasize our request that Parliament be given considerably more information about this expenditure, as well as much more information about what South Africa has received for the money spent last year, but we are going to put forward what we believe is a perfectly reasonable proposal as to how this can be done with substantial benefit to the country and its defence. Two of the most powerful Western nations who are fighting Communism, which is the basis of our own defence problem, and whose defence expenditure runs into most astronomical figures, are Great Britain and the U.S.A., yet both those nations keep their respective Parliaments fully informed not only in regard to the amount of money and men required, but also in regard to the armaments, the amount of defence assets to be provided for the expenditure of that money, the reason why that particular equipment has been decided on, and in the bigger defence projects and training programmes, their effects both on the local and the national economy of those nations, both directly and indirectly.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned last night I said that I intended to deal with a matter affecting defence, something we felt was an important facet of defence, and that I would endeavour to put some constructive proposals to the Government on this matter which we believed would be in the best interest of the defence of the country. I had got to the stage of stating that in the two greatest countries in the world combating Communism to-day, the U.S.A. and Britain, they had taken action on lines which would fully meet the criticism we levelled in the second leg of our amendment, namely that Parliament, as the authority which has to vote the money for defence, should be furnished with sufficient information to enable it to judge not only on the value received for that expenditure but also as to the necessity for the general usage of the money voted. Both the U.S.A. and Britain have accepted the principle that Parliament, which has to vote the money required, has a definite responsibility as the national watchdog firstly to satisfy itself that the expenditure is necessary and, secondly, to see that full value is received by the State for the money which Parliament has appropriated. In the case of both those countries not only the particular committees to which the authority is delegated by Parliament, but the Members of Parliament or of the Senate of the U.S.A. are themselves given detailed information which enables them in turn, when the proposals come before them for financial sanction, to carry out their functions both before the money is voted and after it is spent.</p>

<p>In our own case, I just want to ask this question. What does Parliament get? What have we got to tell us what we have got for last year&#x2019;s record Budget? What have we got to guide us to-day with regard to coming to a decision as to the necessity for a still further increase in the Defence Vote? We have the general picture and we have some general statements, but in our opinion they do not go far enough from the parliamentary point of view, to give the information which Parliament should have. We are clinging to a fetish long abandoned in other countries in respect of the need for secrecy, a thing which has been abandoned by most of the other large countries, especially the two I mentioned, in respect of everything but the very highest level of national strategic planning or regarding certain of their long-term scientific experiments. Outside of that, the Parliaments of those countries, and indeed the citizens themselves, are placed in the fullest possession of any available information to guide them. As a high-ranking officer from overseas with whom I discussed this matter recently said, &#x201C;We have decided that secrecy no longer exists and that the other fellow knows about it while we are still in the stage of thinking about it&#x201D;. They have found by practice and experience that there is a decided build-up in a nation&#x2019;s morale and confidence by getting official information given to them as to what their country is doing in regard to defence, instead of having to pick up odd bits of information, often distorted, which drift in from various channels. I would commend that viewpoint to the Minister of Defence, who appears, in my opinion, to be just a little overcautious in this regard. I can understand the Minister&#x2019;s view, but I still think, as many of us do, that in this regard he is a little overcautious in regard to both defence information and the use of responsible newspaper channels of the country through which the people of the country as a rule are informed. There is no need to emphasize that aspect of responsibility. We had an example of that only a week ago where certain newspapers fully reacted and respected the Minister&#x2019;s request for responsible action, and certain others either took no notice of it at all or never even troubled to find out whether they should have dealt publicly with the matter. But that is water under the bridge. But it is an aspect that I would commend to the Minister for consideration.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the other proposals. Up to 1960 our Parliament voted plus-minus R650,000,000 for defence, and I believe that only the hon. the Minister himself and some of his Service chiefs have any accurate knowledge of how little South Africa really received by way of effective added security for that heavy expenditure. The hon. the Minister himself and his Service chiefs know the state of Defence affairs when he took over. There has been an improvement since then. That is one of the examples I quote in support of the proposals I want to make that Parliament should be better informed and that at that stage it should have been better informed as to what was going on in Defence. The country itself can get a fair idea of the extent to <span class="col_3603-3604" refersTo="page_0376"/>which there was a wastage of Defence spending and assets from the tremendous increase that it has had to face since then in Defence expenditure. Those of us who are able to keep some form of contact with defence matters, feel that a much wiser, more efficient and better use is being made of those assets to-day, but that is only in certain individual cases. I am speaking to-day on behalf of Parliament itself, particularly from the Opposition point of view. Sir, it is every bit as necessary to move forward and streamline our system for exercising parliamentary financial control over Defence expenditure as it is to see that the defences of the country are moved forward in step with modern technique, modern equipment, modern training and modern methods of warfare. This itself is a parallel case. If we do the one without the other we are covering failure. Both the United States and Britain place the highest priority on keeping their respective parliaments informed, not only as to the financial aspect but on all phases of their defence organization and expenditure. In order to do this, amongst other things, they issue reports popularly known as a White Paper on Defence but which actually is officially entitled, in the case of the United States of America, &#x201C;statement by the Secretary of Defence placed before the House&#x2019;s Armed Services Committee&#x201D; and in the case of Britain, &#x201C;A Statement on Defence to accompany the Navy, Army and Air Force Estimates&#x201D;, The United States statement for the current year 1963-4 covers 164 pages of the most accurate, intimate, detailed information for the guidance of the Senate; it covers not only the Defence proposals and expenditure for 1964 but it sets before its Senate an outline of the main aspects of the United States Defence Programme between 1964 and 1968 in order to enable them to form a judgment with regard to the advances which are being made. It not only does that, but it takes into account many other aspects not associated in the military sense with the fighting forces but associated directly with the impact of Defence expenditure on the nation. The British statement for the present year is one of 86 pages and also deals with practically every fact of Britain&#x2019;s armed forces. Again we get the most initiate information of developments, Defence experiments and projected movements, and what the aim is for a number of years ahead. Both White Papers which are available to Members of Parliament and the Senate of the United States not only deal with the actual moneys voted by their respective parliaments but practically give every reason that is advanced in support of the proposals as well as the results and the general plan that they aim to achieve. They cover the training systems in force, the long-term planning for years ahead, the replacements to be faced, the use to be made of the material as it becomes obsolescent and in the case of the U.S.A. statement, which is much more far-reaching than the British one, it also deals with the economic benefits and the economic dangers which arise as the result of the heavy unproductive expenditure, as they call it, on Defence, as well as the impact to be expected internationally, nationally and locally as a result of the proposals placed before Parliament. Both reports in turn give detailed comparisons and the reasons for the variations in the annual expenditure. In both cases they comprise a most instructive and valuable guide to every Member of Parliament when dealing with Defence Estimates placed before the House. Each arm of the fighting services is dealt with separately. They give their Parliament <i>all</i> the necessary information to enable it to exercise a sound and considered judgment in dealing with expenditure and to see that the nation gets value for the money spent. Naturally in our case the expenditure is much smaller and any attempt to follow the principle of these two White Papers would naturally have to be adapted to our very much smaller expenditure on Defence, but the underlying principle, the principle of giving to Parliament the information that it should have to enable it to carry out its task, remains unaltered, and the principle of the effect of Defence, of the results to Defence, remains the same whether you are spending in billions as they are or in millions as we are. The underlying principle, the effective security of the State, remains the same. I think the hon. the Minister and his side will agree that we on this side over the past years have demonstrated that politics play no part in our approach to Defence. We do not hesitate to criticize, we do not hesitate to suggest improvements and we do not hesitate to hit hard when the time is ripe for it, but our broad policy is that in the matter of Defence planning and administration, the security of our Republic is a national matter and not a sectional one. It is on that basis and speaking on behalf of the official Opposition that I want to put this proposal before the Government. I want to put forward this request and commend it to the very serious consideration of the hon. the Prime Minister, the hon. the Minister of Defence and the hon. the Minister of Finance, all three of whom are Government leaders who between them share the main responsibility for directing the defence policy of the country and for ensuring its efficiency and that it is run as far as is consistent with defence requirements on business lines. All defence expenditure in the long term, apart from providing security, is unproductive expenditure, but is just as necessary as insurance on your home, but, we hope, just as unproductive of results in the long run. We do not hope for a war, any more than we hope for a fire when we insure our homes, but we have to be ready for it in case it does happen. Our proposal is that Parliament should establish an official Parliamentary Select Committee on Defence, whose duty amongst other things should include the examination of all aspects of the defence organization involving the expenditure of money appropriated or to be appropriated by Parliament, and including major new proposals involving very heavy financial, economic or industrial commitments which in turn <span class="col_3605-3606" refersTo="page_0377"/>involve parliamentary sanction; that examination to be conducted within the limits which are possible in the matter such as Defence, prior to Parliament being finally committed to such expenditure. Such a committee, if appointed by the House, should have at its disposal a White Paper or a statement on Defence following generally the lines and the range covered by the British or the American Defence statements to which I referred, but limited naturally to the much smaller scope and range which would apply in our own case, but relatively equally important in its range and coverage to the Republic&#x2019;s own defence programme. The committee to have power to hear and question the Secretary for Defence and others responsible, in a similar manner to that permitted by both the British Parliament and the American Senate, much on the same lines as witnesses would be questioned by, say, the Select Committee on Public Accounts or the Select Committee on Railways and Harbours. Copies of the White Paper to be made available to Members of Parliament prior to the discussion of the annual Defence Budget so as to assist them when dealing with defence estimates. I believe, Sir, that the present time is the most appropriate for making such a proposal. Not only is defence spending on a new high level, a level at which the Minister of Finance warns the country that it must be expected to remain for quite a time, but in our isolated state, coupled with the unsettled conditions in both international and internal affairs, the importance of a strong defence policy and a strong defence organization cannot be overestimated. But not only do those important considerations apply, but at the present time a special senior committee of Parliament is going into the whole question of revision of parliamentary procedure with the object of speeding up and also bringing about greater efficiency in the work of Parliament. We on this side believe that the establishment of a committee, generally on the lines that I have put forward, combined with the introduction of a White Paper to accompany the estimates, will fit very well into the deliberations of the present Revision of Rules Committee, and that the acceptance of the principle of these proposals, on the general lines suggested, would not only speed up discussion of the estimates but ensure a more effective consideration of defence expenditure and also assist in establishing a link between the defence organization and Parliament on the one hand and the people of the Republic on the other. A link which will have a definite value in building up public confidence in the national security provided by the country&#x2019;s defence organization. Sir, I do not want this committee to be confused with the procedure at present adopted whereby the Select Committee on Public Accounts examines certain items of defence expenditure reported on in the Annual Report of the Auditor-General. That is something quite different and it deals with a very limited range of problems long after the money has been spent and generally too late at that stage to be able to take effective action on that particular matter. It may well be that those items can also be referred to a Select Committee such as I have suggested, thus relieving the load on the Public Accounts Committee.</p>

<p>Do you want the committee to sit before the expenditure is incurred or afterwards?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Before the expenditure is incurred, broadly following the lines established by these two countries that I have mentioned. The responsibility of the proposed committee should be much wider than that of a normal Parliamentary Select Committee, to enable it to examine and report upon proposed new expenditure before Parliament is finally committed to it. I think that more or less answers the Minister&#x2019;s question. It should also examine the expenditure incurred and the results obtained from such expenditure. It is clear that senior members on the Government&#x2019;s side are themselves beginning to become concerned about certain aspects of defence administration. To illustrate that let me just quote the motion which appears on the Order Paper of 18 January at page 20 in the name of the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). He himself is a member of one of Parliament&#x2019;s most important Select Committees, the Public Accounts Committee, and his motion says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the House is of the opinion that the Government should consider the advisability of establishing either an independent inspectorate under the Auditor-General or another organization outside the Defence Force to carry out inspection in regard to and report upon the existence, the physical condition and the effectiveness of military material in stock.</block>

<p>The hon. member had a second proposal on somewhat different lines but also dealing with the same principle. Although hon. members opposite approach the matter on slightly different lines to the lines on which we have approached it to-day, they show that there is an awareness on their part of the necessity for more effective parliamentary control over defence spending. We welcome that attitude. It follows in general the spirit of our proposals. In these days of isolation the need for the best that we can provide in Defence has never been greater. The hon. the Minister of Finance himself is reported in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 25 March to have stated over the week-end&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The wave of Black nationalism which is rolling down Africa would inevitably reach South Africa, and the only thing which might prevent this country being overrun would be for it to be well armed.</block>

<p>Even more important was the warning that was given by the Commandant-General himself when he addressed the Johannesburg Afrikaanse <span class="col_3607-3608" refersTo="page_0378"/>Sakekamer last week. This high-ranking officer, who must know the inner history of what he is talking about, warned the country that subversive warfare had already begun in Southern Africa. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The 1961 rebellion in Angola was directed by rebel leaders from the Congo. Just as the rebel action could overflow the borders of the Congo into Angola, so it could overflow across the South African borders.</block>

<p>Overshadowing even those grave warnings is the serious challenge that is being made to law and order which the House has been dealing with in the last day or two&#x2014;the time of crisis referred to by the hon. the Prime Minister; the equally grave warning given by our Minister of External Affairs himself and by the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. Sir, what we have put forward is something new in procedure and machinery of Parliament, but we believe that it is a constructive proposal, a forward move, which we may find is just as valuable to the Republic as it has been proved to be in the case of the two great nations I have referred to. It should not only assist Parliament in discharging its duty of exercising financial control over expenditure, but should also be a valuable aid to those who are responsible for the defence of the country. Speaking with the full authority of this side of the House I would commend this proposal to the most earnest consideration of the Government in what I am convinced is not only the best interest of the security of the Republic but also of those who are charged with the very grave duty of building up and controlling the defence of this country.</p>

<p>I am glad to see that I am as popular as ever before. Those interjections at least show that hon. members opposite take notice of me.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, while we are dealing here with defence, and whilst I have always admired my hon. friend over there to some extent for the attitude he adopts in regard to our defence&#x2014; because that is something which belongs to all of us&#x2014;there is something else which is just as important as defence, and that is the food of the people, and in this regard we have one nightmare in South Africa, the periodic droughts we have here. I want to express my sympathy with those people in the Northern Transvaal and in other parts of South Africa whose cattle have been suffering for the last two or three years from foot-and-mouth disease and who have had to cope with terrible droughts. We realize in what position those people find themselves. It is not something for which they are responsible; it is due to the vagaries of nature, and it is our duty to devise plans to assist them as far as possible. As I am the chairman of the Farmers&#x2019; Group of this party&#x2014;and when I refer to the Farmers&#x2019; Group I mean not only the farmers in this House but also those in the Senate&#x2014;I should like to read out a statement here to-day. We are, of course, a strong party. We have various study groups to study the problems in all branches of agriculture. We want to do something to help all those people who find themselves in difficulties, and therefore we made a proposal which I will read to the House later. There are really two proposals, one for immediate consideration and the other for later consideration. As far as the first is concerned, the Government has agreed to take these steps. Although I have not consulted the Prime Minister, I have in fact consulted his Minister, and I want to say immediately that they were very sympathetic.</p>

<p>In regard to the first part of the suggestions, viz. the immediate action to be taken in regard to the economic position of our farmers, we have had an interview with Ministers Uys, D&#x00F6;nges and Sauer. &#x201C;Minister Uys appreciates that attitude and the actions of the group namely that in general things are not going badly with agriculture, but at the same time realizes, together with the group, that certain farmers in certain areas are in a critical and even parlous position. He ascribes those conditions particularly to natural and climatic conditions such as foot-and-mouth disease, drought, etc., and also to a large extent to the uneconomic farming units. He is giving instruction to the Department of State Advances to ensure that nobody is sold out as the result of arrear interest and capital redemption, except in obviously deliberate cases where farmers leave the land permanently or refuse to reply to the representations made by State Advances. Where creditors institute sales, State Advances will buy the land at the lowest possible valuation and resettle the farmer concerned on the land with a lower capital investment. This is a deviation from the former procedure whereby State Advances made profits from these sales. Where sales have taken place, investigation will be instituted as to why farmers still remain responsible for the unpaid portion of their debts. Further investigation will be instituted with regard to the suspension of interest obligations. Minister D&#x00F6;nges will request the Land Bank also not to order any sales to be held as the result of arrear interest and capital repayments. Minister Paul Sauer has already, having realized their position, given instructions that the necessary legal amendments should be prepared to give the Department and the Minister the discretionary power, even after four years&#x2019; arrear payments, to grant further extensions to settlers in terms of all three sections.&#x201D;</p>

<p>These proposals have already been put into operation and we want to tell the Minister that the farmers are very grateful. I think even the farmer members opposite will agree that these people were in such a position that something had to be done immediately. I just want to say that we welcome the acceptance of these proposals, but we went further and expressed <span class="col_3609-3610" refersTo="page_0379"/>our views in regard to future policy. There is already the Cabinet Committee which has been appointed by the Government to investigate the matter.</p>

<p>Then I come to the second portion, viz. the recommendations made by the Farmers&#x2019; Group to the Ministers concerned in regard to the possible long-term solution&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>1 (a) The Farmers&#x2019; Group request the Cabinet still during this Session to establish a full-fledged Department of Agricultural Finance in such a way that all farmers&#x2019; assistance loans, hypothec loans, crop loans, emergency and drought loans, loans from Agricultural Technical Services and Water Affairs, and also subsidies, will be coordinated under one Department.</li>

<li>2 (a) That investigation be instituted into the necessity for co-ordinating loans granted by the Department of Lands with this proposed Department.</li>

</ol>

<p>Hon. members will therefore see that we leave it to the Cabinet and the Cabinet Committee to use their own discretion. Then I come to the following one&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>2 (b) Agricultural Finance Board: That a Government-appointed autonomous Finance Board, on which practical farmers and, <i>inter alia,</i> the Land Bank, the Departments of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, Finance, and Economic Affairs will be represented, will replace the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board as the head of the proposed Financing Department.</li>

<li>3 (a) That the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Committees be converted into Agricultural Finance Supervisory and Advisory Committees to deal with all local matters on behalf of the Agricultural Finance Board.</li>

<li>3 (b) The Agricultural Technical Services extension officers and/or stock inspectors will, on behalf of the board and in consultation with the local committees, see to the necessary inspection and supervision.</li>

<li>3 (c) Where lands inspectors are available they will be co-opted to the aforementioned committees in an advisory capacity.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then I come to the functions and the jurisdiction of the board and of the Department&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>1. To apply as a comprehensive scheme agricultural financing for Category 3 farmers in terms of the report of the Study Group investigating agricultural credit.</li>

<li>2. Wherever necessary, to transfer farmers from uneconomic units to economic units to be provided by the Department of Lands on its closer settlements or under Section 23.</li>

<li>3. Where farmers are in this way removed from uneconomic units, to credit the price valuation of the aforementioned units against the economic purchase price of the land on which those farmers are settled.</li>

<li>4. To consolidate uneconomic units and again to make them available to the farmer at an economic purchase price.</li>

<li>5. To supervise and to give guidance in regard to soil conservation works and general farming methods according to the production potentialities.</li>

<li>6. Where circumstances demand it, to order the suspension or partial suspension of accruing interest.</li>

<li>7. The above-mentioned proposals will result in certain legal amendments.</li>

</ol>

<p>We feel that these recommendations deserve serious attention with a view to our future policy. I am very glad to be able to say that the Farmers&#x2019; Group unanimously adopted this report. I also want to say that our three Ministers, although they did not accept the report as a whole, in fact said that they would welcome the principle of such legislation. I feel that as a farmers&#x2019; group we have done something here of which we can be proud. These proposals concern the financial aspect of the matter; we will discuss the practical aspect of the matter later, which is already in operation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are two practical ways of combating drought. The one is water conservation and the other is to combat soil erosion, and I do not think that there is a farmer in South Africa who would like the legislation in regard to combating soil erosion to be repealed, because whereas formerly our water all flowed down to the sea and our best soil was washed away, we now find that these erosion works have done wonders, and in many respects it helps to keep our people on the land. I know of cases where the water table was very low, say 20 years ago, but in areas where erosion works have been tackled on a large scale the water is again coming back and we find that even the fountains are running again. In the north-west, as hon. members know, and also in other areas, the water table is so low that whereas 20 years ago one could bore for 100 feet and find water, to-day one has to go down 300 or 400 feet. The position is that all the water which formerly flowed into pools was pumped out with the result that the water table sank, and therefore erosion works are absolutely essential.</p>

<p>I also want to take this opportunity to thank the Prime Minister for the great scheme he <span class="col_3611-3612" refersTo="page_0380"/>has given us, the Orange River scheme. I think if there is one thing for which we are very grateful, it is for the Orange River scheme as a whole. Mr. Speaker, I do not want to start a quarrel here over the question as to who should get the credit for this scheme, but I just want to say that 20 years ago already we realized that we would have to make use of the Orange River. We first spoke about the Orange-Fish River scheme. I want to give all the credit here to one man who knew that it could never be done unless the water laws were changed. I want to give the credit for that to the late Adv. Strijdom. He was the first person to say that we would have to amend the water laws. I think the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) was one of the members who served on the committee which discussed the 1956 Act. That Act gave the Government the right to use water in the way it thought best. We must thank that committee for the good work they did. It was preceded by a commission. That commission also did very sound work. If it were not for that, we might just as well have forgotten about the Orange River scheme, because the Government to-day has the right to take that water to another valley. Adv. Strijdom was the person who said that before we could take water to the Fish River we should first amend the laws. I want to praise him for that to-day.</p>

<p>It was in this House that I made the first speech to the effect that the State should be master over the water resources of the country in order to put them to the best possible use. The then Prime Minister took it up and he then appointed that committee which was composed of members from both sides of the House. My hon. friends opposite made their contribution on that committee, because we regarded the matter as being in the national interest and not as a political matter.</p>

<p>I just want to say that had we not had a Prime Minister and a Minister of Water Affairs such as we have to-day, we would have had to wait much longer. I remember that the matter was originally put to General Smuts round about 1946, and he said that his children might see it one dav; he said that the Orange-Fish River scheme would be tackled one day. We, however, have wonderful engineers. We want to thank our engineers for the splendid work they have done. The question was asked the other day as to when we would start with this work. Mr. Speaker, the work will be done. I have often said that when once the Orange River scheme is completed the Karoo will be changed into a flower garden. I hope I will still see it. I am convinced that the Eastern Province and the Free State and those other areas where there is a shortage of water will one day be the richest and the best parts of South Africa. Then there will also be an end to the depopulation of the platteland.</p>

<p>The preliminary work for that tunnel is being done. But when one considers, Sir, that it will be a tunnel of 51 miles, and that camps and roads will have to be provided and other preliminary work will have to be done, we realize that it will not be completed soon. There must be co-operation with the various divisional councils. But I am convinced that when once that tunnel is completed the Karoo will blossom again and the valleys round about Cradock will be the Tennessee Valley of South Africa. I have had the honour of visiting the Tennessee Valley, and the nature of that valley closely resembles that part of the Karoo. Whereas the Tennessee Valley consisted of three of the poorest areas of America, it has to-day become the richest and the best area in America, just because it got water and power, so much so that the other parts of America are envious of the power it has, because hydro-electric power is the cheapest.</p>

<p>I hope that I will still experience the day under this Prime Minister and his Minister of Water Affairs to see that water flow and to see the Karoo blossoming. The people in my part of the country are grateful to the Government. Not only did the Government help the people there, but it bought out the farmers who were in trouble and paid them good prices so that they could re-settle themselves in other areas. On behalf of the Eastern Province, I want to thank the Prime Minister and the Minister of Water Affairs. I want to tell them that we will never forget them. [Interjections.] Just listen to that, Mr. Speaker &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, having uttered these few words I think I have done my duty. There are many other hon. members who will follow me. I just hope that my hon. friends opposite will not show a lack of sympathy for those people who have endured these droughts. Some of them are so poor to-day that they barely have food to eat.

<p>We say thank you very much to those Ministers for we know what is going on in the souls of those farmers. We lived with them for three years during the drought and we represented them before these Ministers. We learned to know the souls of these Ministers; their willingness and preparedness to combat the drought together with the farmers; those farmers who greatly needed their assistance. To us it is one of the ugliest things to hear that a motion has been introduced in this House insulting those Ministers by asking them to resign. It was a painful experience. But, Mr. Speaker, we are firmly convinced that they are White, that their conduct is White, that their hearts are White, and that they will be received as White by the farmers in the stricken areas. Unlike my hon. friend who introduced the motion, in respect of whom, if we take everything into account, his deeds, his words, his works, himself, there is only one thing left over that is White, and that is the outside of his head. We have met this Minister at all times&#x2014; while they were tired, while they had time &#x2026;</p>

<p>As you were born, yes. We met them at a time when there was an opportunity to meet them, but we also met them when truly there was no opportunity, and when we overtaxed them by expecting them to talk to us and to listen to us. Never did we see by word or deed or facial expression that we were unwelcome. I would be committing a sin against all the farmers of the northern Transvaal, if I did not also convey to all the officials of the Departments with whom we had to deal during this time of crisis, our profound and sincere gratitude for the manner in which they received us in the days when we were in great distress, as we still are. We felt that together with their Ministers they were standing by our side. We had no hesitation in going to them at any time.</p>

<p>I should like to proceed now to say what I have to say to this House. After all the thanks that has been conveyed to the Departments and the State for all the assistance we have had, it is nevertheless clear to us that there is something wrong somewhere. It is still clear to us that the assistance that is offered and has been offered, does not always have the effect it ought to have. The retrogression which the State is using all its endeavours to try to stop does nevertheless occur again from time to time. It is threatening to become more effective. We think there is a plan to stop it or at least to overcome it without involving the State in extra expense or without us having to spend much time on it.</p>

<p>I feel that we should utilize the smaller sources of income that are at the disposal of every farmer. It will assist in bridging that time of need. We think that in many instances we have overlooked those smaller sources of revenue in the headlong rush after greater incomes that are required to keep pace with the rapid tempo of life, and to keep pace with costs of production. We have overlooked those smaller sources of revenue, and when things are black indeed, it is not easy to notice them. One sees these things when one is calm and can think dispassionately. But when distress knocks at your door, you are not so easily prepared for or so readily susceptible to that which is so necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to stand here explaining the problems to you. We all know them. But what I should like to do is to suggest something, or try to open up something, if I may put it that way, so that we can see if there is not something we can use. I do not want to make a very wise suggestion to you. I merely wish to assure the House that I have pondered this matter very deeply. I have considered everything possible to see whether I could find something. I am bringing it forward here where there are trained brains, scientific brains, people with more experience in that line than I. I ask that we should examine those smaller sources of revenue together, and see whether we cannot utilize them in practice.</p>

<p>Let me mention a few. Mr. Speaker, what has become of the good old method of keeping food in storage for at least one or two years? I do not think there is a single agriculturist here who will not remember how his father, after threshing his wheat, stored at least a two years&#x2019; supply of wheat for bread in his store-room. After using the first year&#x2019;s bread wheat, if he had a fresh harvest, he sold the extra wheat, but never before that time. We know that in the early days it was the primary duty of the farmer to see to it that the food stocks were replenished. Have we not perhaps neglected that? Have we not perhaps lost that fine custom? I think we have.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when I refer to the small farmers, and I say &#x201C;we&#x201D;, I should like the House to understand that I am one of them; I am including myself. I live among them; I am one of them and I understand them. I know their souls. That is why I feel justified in saying these things. We have passed by that good old method in the headlong rush to something we cannot use when things become difficult, in the rush towards something which cannot help us through when things go wrong and times are difficult. Now we ask whether it is not possible to return to those days when the store was full. We remember the days when one farmer would not sell any seed or food to another farmer. Seed or wheat was given in exchange for other seed or wheat or other food, or it was given free, but such a thing as selling everything in the store was unknown.</p>

<p><span class="col_3615-3616" refersTo="page_0382"/>You may perhaps ask why I am emphasizing the food of the farmer so much. I am doing so, Sir, because we say that if those smaller sources of revenue were properly utilized, the money that is spent on food will be available to purchase the essential other items that are required so urgently and that are not grown on the farm. We are entitled to say that the greater portion of a man&#x2019;s salary in the city goes towards feeding his family. Are we not perhaps guilty of not maintaining our food supplies on the farms as they ought to be maintained? With your consent, Mr. Speaker, I should like to suggest a few small things, things we could examine and see whether some good cannot come of it. There is hardly a single farm in those drought-stricken areas where there is not a borehole. Some of those boreholes are so strong that they produce sufficient water to keep a few small vegetable beds going. Why can we not, around such a borehole, grow quickgrass in rows that could be watered&#x2014; for it requires very little water&#x2014;on half a morgen of land, planted three times in succession, so that it covers the whole of the growing season? That quickgrass will be one of the most valuable forms of feed on the farm. And if we were to place about eight beehives near that quickgrass, to produce honey, we shall provide food for that family that is one of the most nutritious foodstuffs of all. There will be enough honey left over from those six to eight hives on one and a half morgen to three morgen, to sell in order to buy the necessary foodstuffs which cannot be grown on the farm. A little sacrifice early in the morning and on Saturday afternoons after the bell has rung will provide the farmer with those most valuable items in his home. It will have a reassuring effect, Mr. Speaker. I cannot imagine a more frustrated person in those drought-stricken areas than the mother who sends her children to school in the morning knowing that their tummies are full, but also knowing that they are underfed and that at school they will take an inferior place against the child who is well cared for, and knowing that in future he will take a back seat in the community. Such a body can only drag along to rear children; such a body cannot become anything but sick. When the farmer loses the lightning and the spark in his eye, there is danger for us. As long as the spark is there, we can be very sure that the farmer can see through that eye what is needed for the future. Once he has stored sufficient food, he can withstand a drought, for then there will be more spirit in the body. What is more, a saving will be effected by the storage of food, a saving which will carry him through a drought crisis.</p>

<p>Now I should like to explain the greatest of those sources of income, as I see it, and that is namely those small patches of grazing grass in our country, the hundreds of morgen grazing that is being neglected at the present time. There is grazing alongside rivers in valley farms that cannot be used as a result of the fact that it is too small. That is the truth; it is too small. If we were to ask a man who owns 100 morgen; &#x201C;What can you do with it? Can you use it as grazing?&#x201D; then he says no, it is too small. We also say it is too small, but it is not too small to be employed usefully. If all those small patches were added together it would well be utilized. Let me give the example of a farmer who owns a farm of 300 morgen. Suppose now, for example, he cultivates 200 morgen for cash crops and 100 morgen are cultivated not for cash crops, then it is one-third of that farm. Then it is one-third of that farm of 300 morgen; then it is no longer 100 morgen. That is a very great loss already. If we now drive down those fertile valleys, we shall see ten miles out of every 30 miles where the grazing is not being used properly. That is an incalculable loss. We say that that land can be used to prepare stock and animals for the market. We have all that at our disposal. The Department is helping people to acquire stock, and to breed stock. But they do not as yet have a method whereby they can assist the farmer to prepare his stock for the market. Now I say that the farmer can prepare his stock for the market on those 100 morgen although he cannot breed stock there. In the best parts of our country he could keep 20 head of cattle there. If he works economically when the veld is nice, and he gathers all the fodder that could be gathered on the farm, when he has cut the grass inside his enclosed camps where the grass is growing nicely, and has packed it in stacks, and he has gathered all the mealie-stalks and all the peanut hay, that farmer Could make 40 head of cattle ready for the market. There should merely be a regulation that when a farmer can buy breeding stock, he can also buy stock to render ready for the market. His security will be good because when he sells his stock, it will be done by the Land Bank or by the source that helped him to purchase the stock. The risk as regards breeding stock is much greater than the risk involved in the case of stock that is rendered ready for the market, for the stock the farmer purchases for the market, he sells within six months. Accordingly there is very little prospect of loss, or as I see it, no risk of loss. That is the method I adopt. Mr. Speaker, that will be an invaluable supplementary income for the farmer. It will give him courage, and that will convert the object of the Department, the aim to render assistance, into what it really ought to be, namely, to bridge difficult times. This bridging could be brought about in a few years by enabling the farmers to use that which can now not be utilized.</p>

<p>Where our Departments may possibly now follow up this idea, I should like to say that there should be an arrangement between the farmer and the place from which he derives his money, an arrangement to the effect that he does not receive all his profits in a good year; that he may receive only a portion of the profits. The entire selling price is paid over to the bank and the bank then pays the <span class="col_3617-3618" refersTo="page_0383"/>farmer in accordance with the prosperity of the year; the balance is retained by the bank for the farmer. When there is a bad year, he should receive all, and then the bank should wait a year longer. The next year when that farmer again borrows money, he borrows the whole amount less the amount which the bank has retained. That means that within five to six years, with the aid of the bank, the farmer will have saved enough money to easily buy those animals he wishes to prepare for the market on his farm. It will help to make the younger animal in our country ready for the market so that when we have a surplus, our Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing will have a sufficient number of animals ready for the market to export overseas. If now we were to add together all the feed that could be stored, right from the windmill I have mentioned to the money that is made from the making ready for the market of the animals, I am firmly convinced that we shall be able to assist that farmer through a very difficult year of crisis. I am concluding: I say that if we could do that, we shall make more effective those methods that are being applied. We shall also enable that farmer, when the hail has flattened his crop, to know that there is enough food in his home. He will then go along with the lightning in his eye to grease his plough to go and plough his land, a few days after the sum has shone once again. If in this House we would bring that about&#x2014;and I think we can&#x2014;we shall render the greatest service to the small farmer of the agricultural population of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S. P. LE ROUX</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday the leader of our small group made certain remarks here in connection with the position of the Coloureds, namely their relation to us, the Whites, and also their relation to the present Government. He suggested certain things which he thought the Government ought to do in regard to the Coloureds not only to retain their goodwill, but also to forge stronger bonds. I should like to dilate upon that; but I do not want to make further reference to the Government&#x2019;s difficulties. I do not think that all the existing difficulties and all the existing friction and the degree of bad feeling that exists are attributable to the Government and the Government&#x2019;s policy only. I am one of those people who believe we should be realistic, and face facts, and as a representative of those people I would very much like to see that our relations in this country with those people should become better and better. To illustrate what I have in mind, I should just like to mention a few small things I experienced during the past two months, and draw certain conclusions and inferences from that.</p>

<p>About the middle of February our State President opened the University College of the Western Cape. After opening the college, he travelled to Bellville in a Government car for a banquet in the City Hall given by the Mayor there. What struck me was that on the route through Bellville South, there were hundreds of Coloured children of the primary school standing beside the road, hundreds of them, and when the State President passed in his car, spontaneous applause came from the children. There were no people behind them who said &#x201C;Now you must applaud and clap your hands&#x201D;. No, it came from their hearts. That reveals to me that the soul of our Coloured people, the children who are not as yet influenced by other factors, is right. They are South Africans, and they recognize our State President and they form part of our nation. That was fine to me, and I think it must have made a very great impression upon the State President himself to see that.</p>

<p>But now, Mr. Speaker, I come to the other side of the picture where things are beginning to go wrong. Now I am at the wine festival at Paarl, and the State President came there to open the wine festival. Now let us be honest. Our wine industry as it is at the present time has been built up on the labour of our Coloured people, for hundreds of years. I stood somewhere at the back. You know, I am not one who intrudes himself. I always stand somewhere along the back. A little way behind me there were two well-dressed and well-educated Coloureds, as I could see. They did not annoy anybody. They also felt that they wished to hear what our State President said. They also felt it their duty to come to this wine festival, just to come and show their presence there. And while the State President was speaking, a White man&#x2014;I do not know who he was&#x2014;standing in front of me turned round for some reason or other and looked at them and said: &#x201C;Look, you Hottentots do not belong here.&#x201D; I merely turned round and said to the White man: &#x201C;My friend, you are now making a very big mistake.&#x201D; But the two Coloureds turned round and said: &#x201C;Sir, if we do not belong here, we would rather go.&#x201D; Actually this is a very small thing, but it is something you find among a section of our White people to-day. Here the two people were standing, one could almost say representative of the wine industry, and a festival is being held, but they are labelled as Hottentots who do not belong there. I am sorry about that.</p>

<p>I know that all of us here disapprove of it, but many people outside do not know what our feelings are about that, and they want guidance from us, and they turn to us to see what our views are. A few days later I drove down to Hermanus, and I travelled past our plantations there, and at various places there were boards with the notice on them &#x201C;Picnic: Whites only&#x201D;. I saw several, but nowhere one that said: &#x201C;For Coloureds.&#x201D; This again is a trivial thing, perhaps only thoughtlessness, but I do not think it is quite fair that the Coloured person who can afford a motor-car and who also travels that way, cannot stop somewhere. He also wants to admire the scenery, and for him it is even more necessary than for me to be able <span class="col_3619-3620" refersTo="page_0384"/>to eat his little parcel of food under a tree there. But there it says: &#x201C;Whites only.&#x201D; It may be only an oversight, something that could easily be rectified, and which would improve feelings.</p>

<p>Now I come to my own people, my farmer friends, and this also is an incident that occurred within the past two months. I am only talking about things that happened recently. I could of course mention so many examples that the House would become bored. But now I come to my fellow-farmers, and I should like to say candidly that in general this is not the case, but you do get the exceptions, and as regards the Coloureds, we are judged and condemned according to the acts of those exceptions. I should like to tell you about this case. The owner of a big farm, a very well-to-do man&#x2014;I do not wish to indicate his identity further, but he does not live far from Worcester&#x2014;sent his Coloured lorry driver to the Cape Town market with a load of potatoes. The driver then said to him: &#x201C;But master, the brakes of this lorry have been so bad for quite a few months that I am afraid to cross the mountain.&#x201D; The farmer then said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Oh, but you are a very good driver, man, are you not, and why should you worry; drive to Cape Town; I am sure there will not be any trouble.&#x201D; The Coloured man went, and this side of Paarl the blue jackets caught him, tested the lorry&#x2019;s brakes and the end of the story was that the poor Coloured man had to appear in court because he had to drive a lorry of which the brakes were quite defective. He was then sentenced to a fine of RIO or ten days&#x2019; imprisonment.</block>

But that is not the point that bears heavily on me, but what I object to is the fact that when the Coloured man said: &#x201C;But master, have I now to go to gaol, or will master pay the fine for me?&#x201D; he said: &#x201C;No, I shall pay the R10, but it will be deducted from your wages at the end of the month.&#x201D;</p>

<p>No, I shall not do so, but when he referred to the &#x201C;end of the month&#x201D; there is something else that hurts me as a farmer terribly. You know that here in the Western Province it is the custom for us to pay the Coloureds on the farms by the day. They earn so much per day, and on Friday or Saturday morning they receive their wages. But what is happening now? In very many cases it happens that the man is paid weekly, by the day, but he supposedly works on a monthly basis. He is always in debt to the farmer, and those Coloureds can never go to any other place of employment, for at the end of the month he owes the farmer R1 or R3, and when the Coloured man wants to go away to another farm, the farmer goes to the police and says: &#x201C;Look here, that Coloured man left my employ; he is a monthly man. and he should be arrested.&#x201D; Then the poor creature gets a fine again, which he in turn owes to the owner of the farm who pays it. and then he is stuck there for so many months longer. I think the time has arrived that I should mention these scandals of my own people also, and that we should try to rectify these things. We come here and blame the Government for everything that goes wrong between the Whites and the Coloureds, but we ourselves ought to put our hands in our own bosoms and see to it that we do the right thing. I have mentioned these few small examples, and I wish to express the hope that it may contribute to these exceptional cases not being repeated, so that the relation between our people and the Coloureds may improve. It will make a tremendous difference.</p>

<p>When I speak about the Coloureds, particularly that section I represent, I want to say that the majority of them are people who work. There are some of them too, as I have already said in this House, who are inclined to sit in the sun. But I have said what I wanted to say about them. The majority of these people are hard-working, and they are struggling to eke out an existence. But they are people who permit themselves to be influenced very easily, and that is what hurts me&#x2014;and here again these are exceptional cases&#x2014;that among them you also find people whom we must label as agitators. For some reason or other they derive pleasure from giving the other Coloureds who are perhaps not quite so well educated&#x2014;or perhaps they are better educated judging from the manner in which they are living&#x2014;a fright and inciting them to resent everything that smacks of authority. It might be the owner of the farm or another employer, but usually it is the Government of the day, and not only this Government; when the other party is in power it is the same. I have said that I am going to confine myself to things that occurred during the last few months only, and I now wish to give you an example of the things that are going on, and it is an illustration of something that happens from time to time in my constituency also among the less well-informed Coloureds. Now you will recall that during the last three years we have in this House passed two Acts and one Consolidating Act to place the Coloureds in the rural areas on a sound footing, and as <span class="col_3621-3622" refersTo="page_0385"/>far as I am concerned, the object was particularly to enable a certain group of Coloureds at Saron, about 35 to 40 miles from here, to live under better circumstances than in the past. Now on 1 April the community decided that they would be taken over by the Department of Coloured Affairs under this new order, and the people were enthusiastic about it. But last Saturday afternoon certain people came from the city, and they distributed among all of them a certain pamphlet. The pamphlet is headed: &#x201C;Beware of Coloured Affairs.&#x201D; Then it continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The independence of Saron is threatened. We have always had a hard life, but what is going to happen now? Coloured Affairs will take over Saron on 1 April 1963. Consequently the inhabitants of Saron are facing an existence of greater oppression and poverty.</block>

<p>My blood also begins to boil when I read this kind of thing. For three years we and the hon. the Minister have been trying to put this specific case right. Here they come along now, a week before the time, and we no longer have an opportunity of telling these people that it is wrong, and that they are presenting everything in a wrong light. This whole pamphlet does not contain a single true word. Everything contains just a grain of truth, just like the film show we saw this morning&#x2014;there is something that is true in it, but the entire presentation is wrong. Now they are referring to the Coloured Affairs Department and they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The C.A.D. (i.e. the Coloured Affairs Department) owns all the land.</block>

<p>That is a complete lie&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You owners are owners in name only. The sole owner is the C.A.D.</block>

<p>It is a very sore point with those people at Saron, for there are people who own their own land, and our Department is now extending that land. Those people are going to retain their land intact, but in many instances land is going to be given to others who do not possess their own land. The whole thing is going to be converted in the interests of the people. Then they refer to taxes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Who will have to foot the hill? Every area will be surveyed for C.A.D. separation and the people of the area will have to bear the expense.</block>

<p>Now it is separation (&#x201C; afhokking&#x201D;) when we survey plots for them of which they will get transfer on payment of merely the costs of passing transfer and surveying, and then they say that is separation. One would say they are a lot of pigs that we are going to place in sties.</p>

<p>The C.A.D. determines to whom an owner may bequeath his plot.</p>

<p>Just imagine, the Department will now come and tell me or any Coloured man that I must bequeath my plot to this one or that one, and that I may not bequeath to anyone else. Can you imagine that?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any improvements that are made from time to time will have to be paid for by the people. For instance there will be water rates, grazing fees, night soil removal fees, etc.</block>

<p>We who are used to paying, know we have to pay for these things, don&#x2019;t we? But the thing is not put in its proper light here. I do not intend reading more of this, but now I should like to tell you what a Coloured man living there has written to me&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As you know, Sir, we as a community will as from 1 April fall under the Department of Coloured Affairs. But see what these people are doing. They are sowing suspicion among our people. We are shocked at what is being said about Coloured Affairs. My real object is, and I should like you, Sir, to ask those who are in charge of Coloured Affairs, what they intend doing about this, and whether they are going to stop these people coming from the city who are concerned &#x2026;</block>

<p>Here is the same thing again, they come from the city&#x2014;</p>

<p>I am pleased to hear that from the Minister. But I am already sick and tired of this kind of thing in my <span class="col_3623-3624" refersTo="page_0386"/>constituency. The Minister has just said it was a teacher, but they are not always teachers. It is going on constantly. I should like to mention another example. The Department of Coloured Affairs has made available to the Coloured people at Worcester a sum of R2,500 in connection with new sports fields, to start laying out the sports fields, and the municipality of Worcester said that they would also contribute their share. But at the end of this week, it will be the close of our financial year, and the Department then said to the sports bodies: &#x201C;We shall be glad if you will inform us as soon as possible whether you are prepared to receive the money so that we shall not have to carry it over to the next year, and we are warning you that if it is to be carried over into next year, it will take you three or four years before you will have your turn again and will have an opportunity to get this money.&#x201D; The vast majority of the Coloureds of Worcester rejoiced about it. What is happening now? Now that the time is coming closer for them to say &#x201C;Please send the money&#x201D;, the same group of people came along last week again, people in the service of the State, and they said: &#x201C;We do not want this money from the C.A.D., for if we were to take that money for the sports fields, it is going to mean that we shall admit that the Department of Coloured Affairs means something to our people and is doing something for our people.&#x201D; Petty; unfortunately nearly all of them people who belong to T.N.S.A. too. Now the Minister has said that this kind of thing will be stopped as regards teachers, but see, in law we cannot do anything against these people who spread pamphlets, and I am wondering whether now that we are involved in sabotage laws and all these things, where people are spreading such things that are absolutely in conflict with the truth, we could not subject these people to prosecution. At the moment you can do nothing. They may spread the greatest lies in the world, hut as long as they do not defame a man, nothing can be done about it. If the teachers are prohibited from doing it, others will do it again. It is only a small group of people always. I doubt whether it is .1 per cent of the Coloured population that does it. The time has arrived that we should put a stop to these things in one way or another.</p>

<p>I should have liked to follow the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux) for he has raised a few very interesting matters here as regards the relations between the Whites and the Coloureds. However. I should like to warn him that he should not take too much notice of isolated instances such as those he raised here. He himself admitted that they were only exceptions to the rule. The rule is constantly improving good relations between Whites and Coloureds. In the second place I should like to express to him my appreciation of his disapproval of misrepresentations within the Coloured comnunity. In this regard I think he could do a good thing for his own people in close co-operation with the Minister of Coloured Affairs. I am sorry I cannot follow him further, for this matter of the relations between Whites and non-Whites is a matter in which I am keenly interested, but time will not permit me to go into it further now.</p>

<p>In the time at my disposal I should like to confine myself to the agricultural-economic conditions in the north-western Cape, and I do not apologize for that. The north-west Cape has its own peculiar problems, problems that will have to be solved speedily if we wish to maintain a settled and independent farming community there. We are concerned here with a region in which the rainfall varies from almost nothing on the West Coast to approximately seven inches in the vicinity of Prieska, Carnarvon, Victoria West and Beaufort West. Even this scanty rainfall varies from year to year and we have to contend with periodical droughts of longer or shorter duration. The drought conditions prevailing there at the present time have continued for five years already, and a large portion of this area has been converted into desolate desert. You can do nothing about it. Drought conditions are something a farmer has to learn to live with. All you can do is to build up resistance to it, as you build up resistance to disease in the human body. In the past, say up to about 20 years ago, the farmer could adapt himself perfectly, or almost perfectly, to these conditions. The extent of his farm was not really relevant. Sometimes the little farms were hardly big enough to establish his stock farming there for a few months in the year. When droughts came, he simply migrated, and that was his answer to every drought. The world was wide open, grazing was plentiful and the nomadic farmer could obtain grazing for his stock <i>gratis</i> or at an extremely low price. He lived a more or less nomadic life. The rapid development of agriculture north of the Orange River in the &#x2019;forties and the &#x2019;fifties, together with the intensification of farming in the north-west Cape itself, brought about a radical change in this. To-day the small farmer is tied down to his small farm where he can hardly run a few hundred head of small stock. According to the Du Toit report on the depopulation of the rural areas, about one-quarter of the farms in the sheep-grazing region, i.e. the Karoo and the north-west Cape, are too small and must therefore be regarded as uneconomical. In a previous debate in this House I pointed out that in nine districts in the north-west Cape comprising more or less one-half of the sheep-grazing region, no less than 28 per cent of the farms are too small and must be regarded as uneconomical. As my norm I took the finding of the Du Toit Commission that a farmer requires at least 1,200 sheep to be able to make a decent living.</p>

<p>Now I should like to refer specifically to one district in the north-west Cape, namely Carnarvon, where I had an opportunity of making an analysis of the position. I found that in that district there are 87 farmers on <span class="col_3625-3626" refersTo="page_0387"/>farms less than 1,000 morgen in extent; 78 on farms of 1,000 to 2,000 morgen; 63 on farms of 2,000 to 3,000 morgen; 85 on farms of 3,000 to 4,000 morgen; and 135 on farms of more than 4,000 morgen in extent. That means that in this district, there are 228 farmers who cannot make a decent living from farming; furthermore, there are only 85 who in good years only can live according to civilized standards, while there are 35 farming on farms that could be regarded as more or less economical. Small uneconomic farms are the crux of our problems, and the question should now be put whether the present form of State aid can make any contribution to not only the settlement but also the becoming independent of this type of small farmer. State aid consists, <i>inter alia,</i> of the following: There are direct subsidies and loans to individual farmers; advances from control boards and farmers&#x2019; cooperatives; provision of capital by the Land Bank and other Government Departments; consolidation of debts and rehabilitation under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act. This assistance covers the whole field of provision of credit to the farmers. Colossal amounts are spent on that. To mention only a few: During <i>3</i>&#x00BD; years ended June last year, no less than R5,000,000 was spent by State Advances on production loans, the preservation of stock and aid to farmers afflicted by foot-and-mouth disease among their cattle. During the same period no less than R18,000,000 was spent on the consolidation of debts. So I could continue, and mention the aid given during the period from 1948 to June of last year. Unfortunately I do not have the time to go into the figures. This aid is the greatest and most comprehensive any Government has ever given in order to finance production, and it is one of the reasons why to-day we have surpluses instead of having to put up with shortages. That has incidentally given the Opposition a new attacking front. Now they can squeal about surpluses which cannot be disposed of, as if surpluses are not a sign of prosperity. When the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) reopens his summer school in Carnarvon, I should like to suggest to him that he should place some of these data at the disposal of his lecturers, then they will talk less nonsense. Perhaps it is not generally known that that hon. member, or his party, has a summer school there to enlighten the old United Party members and to indoctrinate the young ones. The current joke prevalent in Carnarvon to-day against this school is that if you pass you exams you become a Nationalist, and if you fail you have to stay in the class for another year as punishment.</p>

<p>Government aid has been to the benefit of all farmers, but was always aimed at the needs of the small farmer to increase his productive ability and to dispose of his products at remunerative prices. However, the past five years have proved that this kind of aid is not sufficient to keep the small farmer on the land. In spite of the assistance, many of them had to give up the struggle and seek a living elsewhere. Seen from a purely economic point of view, continued subsidization of uneconomic farming is undesirable. You keep the patient alive at great cost without hope of his recovery. If, however, we are to leave the small farmer to the mercy of the laws of economics, he falls by the way and we depopulate the rural areas. We cannot afford that. We do not want that, because we cannot do it in a multi-racial country such as ours, and furthermore it is undesirable for cultural reasons. That is our dilemma and the only alternative then is a State-planned scheme for the consolidation of uneconomic farms into economic units.</p>

<p>When one refers to economic units, objections are raised. They say it depends on many factors and it is virtually impossible to fix such units. It is said that it depends, <i>inter alia,</i> on climatic conditions, it depends on the physical potential of the land, on the kind of agriculture which is practised, the ability of the farmer, the minimum needs of a family, produce prices, etc. All that is true but, if it is not pradoxical. I should say it is not so difficult to determine an uneconomic holding. This is what I mean: One may have one&#x2019;s doubts as to whether a farm of 3,000 morgen in the north-west Cape is economic or not. One may regard it as a borderline case, where it depends on the ability of the farmer. But a farm of 1,000 morgen definitely is uneconomical. for its potential is only 250-300 sheep. Therefore nobody expects one to fix uneconomic units for ever. There are various factors that have to be taken into consideration. There are certain tendencies. The drop in the purchase power of money is one. The downward tendency in produce prices is another, as well as the rising standard of living. Unless the technical and economic services, research, are able to step up the profitability of the farm to such an extent that it can overcome these tendencies, units will have to become increasingly larger. That is why we are compelled to considerations that are valid to-day, and we must learn to adapt ourselves in future to circumstances that will be prevailing then. But two or three such small farms that are contiguous and which would form an economic unit&#x2014;there the solution obviously is that the farmers should buy one another out with or without State aid. If it is done with State aid, it is always possible to assist the superfluous farmers who are eliminated to obtain land elsewhere. But if that cannot be done, then what has been happening in America during recent years must happen here. There about 7,000,000 farm units have been reduced to 3,700,000, with the result that the American Government is saddled with about 2,000,000 superfluous farmers and does not know what to do with them. Big land ownership is not a great problem in South Africa as yet, but the tendency is there, and the proper thing would be to restrict this tendency as soon as possible.</p>

<p>What then is the solution? We have been toying with the idea for a long time that we <span class="col_3627-3628" refersTo="page_0388"/>could use the Orange River to make small farms in the great valleys of the north-west economic propositions by making them partially irrigable, by applying extensive irrigation there. There are thousands of morgen available for that purpose. However, the planning of the Orange project, as announced now, has largely eliminated this possibility. The role the Orange could play in this respect is trivial, if not insignificant. I am convinced of that for the following reasons.</p>

<p>In the fifth phase of the planning water for 30,000 morgen is allocated in the Carnarvon valley and in the Sak River valley and in the sixth phase to a further 30,000 morgen in the Kalahari at Witsand. That may possibly happen after 30 years, provided sufficient water is available, and I am almost tempted to say if this Nationalist Government is still there to concern itself with the fate of the farmers. So unless this part of the plan can be completed earlier, it cannot have an influence worth mentioning on the uneconomic ownership of land. I do not think that can be done, for the plan does not provide for it, and as far as I am concerned, I do not feel optimistic about the carrying out of that part of the plan which affects the north-western Cape. I am not now referring to the land along the Orange River lower down. My reasons are as follows: When the Minister announced this scheme last year, he called it an elastic scheme. From that I inferred that certain sub-divisions of the plan as announced would not necessarily be carried out, or at least could be modified. As the water has been apportioned in advance between the east and the west, the elasticity does not mean that you will be able to effect a re-apportionment of the water between the two regions, particularly also because you will give preference to the development of the east. It merely means that you can separately regulate or change the relationship between consumption for irrigation, industry and municipal requirements according to the circumstances in the two regions, with this difference, that the quantity of water to be used in the Fish and Sundays River area has been fixed. While the far west, not along the banks of the Orange, but away from its banks, is left more or less in uncertainty. We must remember that the development of the Fish and the Sundays River area will have precedence and in the first four phases that will be completed, while the north-west will have its turn only in the fifth and sixth phases. The planning of the region in the north-west will depend on certain factors, and I should like to mention a few of these.</p>

<p>In the first place it depends upon the quantity of water available. We do not appear to know precisely. I may remind you that at the Colesberg Conference it was put at 1,500,000 morgen feet, after deduction of the waters of the Vaal and the Caledon. According to the White Paper made available to us last year, it is now called 2,100,000 morgen feet, and as you require at least 700,000 morgen feet for the development of the east, 700,000 would remain. If the first figure is correct, 800,000 morgen feet will remain for the development in the west then. If the second figure is correct, there will be 1,400,000 morgen feet available. I do hope the second figure is correct.</p>

<p>The second factor is unforeseen development in the field of mining and industry. Suppose deposits of a single mineral are discovered in the north-west, and a mine is established, that would cancel all your calculations. A third factor would be a clear appreciation of the needs and of all the possibilities of development of the north-west, e.g. the gradual exhaustion of underground water, which would mean provision of water from the Orange River for purely farming purposes.</p>

<p>Another factor is our pattern of apartheid that will require more and more water for Coloured settlers in the north-west; and finally, the fact that our water source is situated in a neighbouring Black state. Now we have had the assurance that provision has been made for that. I do hope that we shall be able to arrange something of this nature from Pretoria in the future. What I wish to emphasize is this, that a sober analysis of the position indicates that the Orange scheme, as announced now, will make a very scanty if any contribution at all, to the solution of the problem of uneconomic farming units in the north-west, that its value will have to be sought particularly in the fact that it will provide a livelihood to stock farmers that become superfluous in the process of the consolidation of uneconomic units. For this reason other measures have become so much more urgent and essential. We cannot wait 30 years in any case. The Government will have to intervene, cost what it may.</p>

<p>What I thought about, is a consolidation plan, call it a ten-year plan, in which you could solve the problem of uneconomic land ownership, <i>inter alia,</i> in the following manner: By preventing the further sub-division of farms, if necessary by legislation; by discouraging the acquisition of uneconomic units, and the Land Bank could play a role in this, and it should be made difficult or almost impossible for other financial institutions and for the commercial banks, to depart from this policy; by the purchase of small farms by the Department of Lands and the consolidation of these into economic units; by the purchase of large farms and the sub-division of these into economic units; and finally, by using irrigation schemes in the future to settle landless farmers. There is still 18 per cent of the White population of the Republic in farming. We have no hope to maintain this percentage in future, but if we act timeously we may possibly be able to retain the present numbers. In the north-west Cape lies the true hinterland of the White man. It is comparatively free of Bantu. It has a potential that holds possibilities of development. It is inhabited by hardened, proud, freedom-loving farmers, and I can assure you it is worth while.</p>

<speech by="#keyter">

<from><span class="col_3629-3630" refersTo="page_0389"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KEYTER</person>:</from>

<p>First of all I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Finance on his Budget and thank him for the concessions and the relief he has given the farmers and other taxpayers in his Budget. Then I should like also to tell the Minister that as gardener he has used the pruning scissors here and there and lopped off a small branch, which might have been necessary. He said he wished to administer phosphate to improve the growth of the plants, and now I have a request to make of the Minister, that there is one kind of plant in his garden that requires a little extra fertilizer, and that is the young farmer who has just started. We have just heard from the previous speaker about uneconomic units and the small farmers, but now I should like to appeal to the Minister, that when a young man has chosen to become a farmer, and where his father is willing to assist him to acquire an economic unit, that that &#x00A3;5,000 which may now be donated to a child without tax, should be doubled, or more, but only in the event of that son becoming a farmer. We know that the position to-day is that when a son takes up farming, &#x00A3;5,000 is really insignificant. It requires enormous capital to begin farming. You will ask why should the son who becomes a farmer get &#x00A3;5,000 or &#x00A3;10,000 without tax, and not the others. Let us take the parent who has two sons. He gives the one a university education, and what does that not cost him? And he is entitled to make deductions from his income-tax for all those years because he still has that boy at university, and the son does not pay income-tax either. But the young man who goes farming immediately becomes subject to income-tax and the father may not deduct anything in respect of him. We should like to see the young men who become farmers beginning on a sound basis. When a yound farmer begins farming operations with too little capital, we have the position that he subsequently has to go to State Advances for assistance. Where the father is able to assist the young man to begin on a sound basis, the father should not be penalized because he is helping the son. We see that the State is even awarding scholarships to encourage young men to continue their studies. Tremendous sums of money are spent to get the young men we require in industry and the sciences. Therefore we should not hesitate either to help the young farmer to start properly financially, and where the parent is able to place such a son on a sound basis, the donations tax and even the estate duty on the young farmer should be lightened a good deal, for we find so frequently that the one son goes farming and the other continues his studies, and in the course of years, when the parents pass away, the young man has to pay out the brothers and sisters and consequently he begins with a big debt. That is why I am urging that we should try to help the young farmers to begin on an economical basis.</p>

<p>I wish to go further and say that when a young farmer has started, and his income is such that he just begins to pay income-tax but his capital is still small, the notch at which he should have to begin paying income-tax ought to be raised higher. You may ask why should the young farmer have preference there too? The young farmer has no pension scheme in which he can participate. We see now that in the Estimates the amount people may deduct for a pension scheme has been increased, but the farmers have no pension scheme and accordingly they cannot deduct that amount, and I feel it is only fair that the farmer should also be given an opportunity by raising the notch at which he has to begin paying income-tax, to compensate him for not having a pension. Eventually the farmer has in any event to see to it that he amasses sufficient capital to enable him to live in his old age, because he has no pension. Therefore we have to have regard to all these things when we come to the taxes the farmer has to pay.</p>

<p>I do not wish to say any more regarding the young farmer. During this debate reference has been made to the Mother City, and that Parliament should remain here until the end of time. I do not wish to urge that Parliament should be moved to Pretoria, but I should like to say, though, that the Mother City should begin to pull up its socks. I should like to ask the Minister of Justice to refuse to prosecute in Cape Town when people are summoned for a contravention of the traffic regulations. Here I have a whole pile of summonses issued by the Department of Justice in one month, as many as 20 being served on one person, and this person was not convicted in court in a single case. Approximately 5,000 summonses are issued in Cape Town every month, and that is only a portion of those who have been ticketed, for the vast majority of people admit guilt and pay, but those cases which go to court are withdrawn because the man pleads not guilty and says that the traffic signs are wrong. Here is a number of photographs taken all over the whole of Cape Town, where the traffic signs do not comply with the ordinance. But the Cape Town City Council is aware of it, and does nothing to improve things. They virtually set traps and we who come from the rural areas fall into them so easily. In one case they erected parking meters here and the white marks where the cars have to park are still there in the street; then they remove the parking meters again, and at the one point they place a little board to say that you may not park there. Now a man comes along and sees there are the white marks where he has to park, and he parks there, and when he returns he sees his car has been ticketed. Then only he begins to look around, and over there on the other side there is a little pole with a notice that he may not park there. If you go to the office of the traffic inspectors, you will see that the one pole right in front of their office is not even marked correctly in conformity with the ordinance. It has happened here in Cape Town that the man has been summonsed and he pleaded not guilty because the traffic signs were not correct, and then the magistrate postponed the <span class="col_3631-3632" refersTo="page_0390"/>matter to hold an inspection later on, and in the meantime the City Council&#x2019;s traffic inspectors went along and quickly painted that thing correctly as it ought to be; but the man had taken a photograph of it before it was painted and after it had been painted, and when the magistrate went there, and when he saw the photograph in court, he found that man not guilty also. I think it is disgraceful that the Department of Justice is abused in this way here in Cape Town, and only the people who are willing to do so, pay up, and all the other summonses that are issued every day are withdrawn again. But it is a waste of time and it goes on like that from day to day. I think it is absolutely wrong that the Department of Justice&#x2019;s time should be wasted in this manner and that there should be such an abuse of manpower as there is here in Cape Town.</p>

<p>It is just as I received my Hansard, and if he wants to do so the hon. Whip can satisfy himself that that is so. I want to quote what I said. I spoke about a Zulu who was asked whether he wanted the franchise. Hon. members on that side then made interjections, so many interjections that the Chief Whip on this side had to stand up and ask the Chair to protect me.

<p>No, the hon. the Prime Minister said that I had said &#x201C;I think only of the White man; I have nothing to do with kaffirs; when I think of someone, then I think of the White man&#x201D;, There is a world of difference. What is interesting is that the hon. the Prime Minister got this news from an English evening newspaper or morning newspaper&#x2014;I am not sure which&#x2014;but it came from a small report in one of the English newspapers. He read it and instead of asking for my Hansard as one would expect a Prime Minister to do, he made that allegation. But I said more in this debate; I spoke about the Bantu and I said: &#x201C;They ask for a small place in the sun.&#x201D; I said further as far as the traditional policy of South Africa was concerned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The traditional policy was to give them some measure of self-government or self-management in the reserves, but under the control of the White man. As the White man progressed economically in South Africa, so he communicated that progress to the non-White races. When we built a hospital, we built a non-White section as well. When we built a post office, we allowed them to fetch and to post their letters there. When we built a railway line we gave them carriages to use. As we progress economically, so the Bantu, the Coloured and the Indian in South Africa shared that progress under the traditional policy of the Afrikaner and of all Governments in South Africa.</block>

<p>Does the hon. Whip doubt my Hansard? If he does he must say so and then we can appoint a committee of inquiry to investigate Hansard. The hon. the Prime Minister is a responsible person and even though his whole speech was completely irresponsible, he should not have attacked me in such an irresponsible manner.</p>

<p>I have said that I want to talk about farming matters and in doing so I want to discuss the last leg of our amendment. Mr. Speaker, in the past economic prosperity in the country was always linked up with our agricultural economy and the prosperity of our agricultural economy. When the country flourished economically in the past, that prosperity was also experienced and shared by the agricultural industry. That position has now changed. The position in South Africa at the moment&#x2014;and this was abundantly clear from the speech of the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014; is that there is an upsurge in the country&#x2019;s economy. The hon. Minister made a very optimistic speech: I want to state here that agriculture. with the exception of the wool industry, still finds itself in a position that can almost be compared with a severe depression. What is the position of agriculture? During the period from 1926 to 1959, agricultural production doubled. The amount of land under cultivation in South Africa increased by 40 per cent, in other words, by two-fifths. While the increase in the amount of land under cultivation was 40 per cent, the increase in production was 60 per cent. We find, for example, that the production of maize has increased by 30,000,000 bags since 1949 and that the wool yield per sheep has risen from 5.5 lbs. to 8.8 lbs. The increased production has not been so phenomenal in the case of milk and meat but it has nevertheless been adequate. The hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) has pointed out that as farming methods have improved, so surpluses have accumulated, and at the moment we are faced with the position in South Africa that 30 per cent of the products produced by the farmer have to be exported. The farmers have complied with the request of the Government to produce more; they have made use of the information that they have received from the Department. They have applied improved farming methods; they have had a higher production, and what has the result been? We find that 28,000 farmers have left their farms during the past few years. In the case of the farmers who remained on the land, out of 90,000 who completed income-tax forms, 17 per cent suffered losses during 1957-8 and 23 per cent in 1960-1. The hon. member for Prieska has referred to large sums spent to assist the farmers in various ways. He has discussed this matter very thoroughly and it is not necessary for me to do so again except to say that in 1961 the farmers were already R4,600,000 in arrear with the payment of moneys that they had borrowed from the Government. The hon. the Minister was asked&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How many estates of farmers were sold for the recovery of advances made by the Land and Agricultural Bank subject to the provisions of Section 26 of the Land Bank Act before the amendment of the aforementioned section by Section 9 and since the aforementioned amendment came into operation?</block>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s reply to this was: 1,876 and 45. That was up to 31 January 1963, a total therefore of 1,921 farmers who were sold out. This is not a very pretty picture. I want to return now to what the hon. member for Prieska said. He made a very interesting speech. He spoke about the north-west Cape. When I spoke about the difficulties experienced by farmers, I drew this distinction. I said, &#x201C;All farmers except the wool farmers&#x201D;, The hon. member for Prieska spoke about the north-west Cape, a part of the country with which I am not too well acquainted, and in regard to that part of the country he said that as a result of a study that he had made, he had found that 228 farmers could not make a reasonable living there and that there were only 35 farmers who could make a reasonable living in that part of the country. If the hon. member could make this allegation about the one type of farmer whom I excluded, the wool farmer, then I ask: What is the position of the other farmers? I am very sorry indeed that the hon. the Prime Minister is not here because I wonder whether he knows the circumstances of the farmers in this country?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>No, he sold his farm.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct. He sold out when things began to deteriorate, when maize prices and milk prices began to fall. But that has no bearing on the point at issue. I want to know whether the caucus of the Nationalist Party, through the two Ministers of Agriculture, have told the hon. the Prime Minister about the critical position in which the farmers find themselves? The hon. member for Prieska suggested that very urgent steps should be taken. He said that assistance must be given to the famers, come what may, or no matter what the cost may be. I am trying to remember the exact words that he used. I think he said: &#x201C;No matter what it costs&#x201D;. He said that the Government would have to intervene, whatever the cost <span class="col_3635-3636" refersTo="page_0392"/>may be. He mentioned three things. He said that the sub-division of farms should be prevented, if necessary by legislation; that the purchase of uneconomic farms should be made impossible by forbidding the Land Bank or the ordinary commercial banks to make loans available; that the Government should buy small farms and join them up and that it should buy large farms and sub-divide them. He said that those people farming on uneconomic small-holdings should eventually be settled under farming schemes. He also made this interesting remark with which I agree. He said that we had no time; that these things must be done within the next 10 years and he added that in fact we did not have 10 years in which to do these things. I want to agree with him and congratulate him on having made such an interesting study of this matter.</p>

<p>I have said that the farmers find themselves in a very critical position. At the moment the farmer in South Africa is left to his own fate.</p>

<p>A good crop in South Africa, particularly as far as the maize farmer is concerned, puts him in a difficult position and a few good crops make him bankrupt. What is the result? I have already said that the bulk of farming products has to be exported and this holds good particularly for maize. The more maize we export the greater is the loss and the greater is the danger that the price to the farmer will be reduced in the next year.

Mention is also made of the freer handling of maize but I find little comfort in this recommendation. I think that the time has come for the Government to face two facts; the first being that the determination of the prices of agricultural products should rest with the Government, with the Cabinet.</p>

<p>No, it rests with the Marketing Boards. The Marketing Boards advise the Minister and he merely confirms the findings of the Marketing Boards&#x2014; or let me rather put it this way. The Marketing Boards recommend the prices to be fixed and then the Minister usually fixes the price at a slightly lower figure than that recommended <span class="col_3637-3638" refersTo="page_0393"/>by the Marketing Boards. But the point that I want to make is this. The Government accepts the responsibility for the fixing of minimum wages in the other sectors of our economy and the time has come for the Government to realize that the farmer is also entitled to a minimum wage.</p>

<p>I used the analogy of a minimum wage simply to bring the fact home to the hon. the Minister that the Government accepts the responsibility for fixing minimum wages for all other sectors of our economy and I say that the Government should also accept this responsibility in the case of the farmer so as to ensure that the farmer makes a reasonable living. As far as the marketing of our products abroad is concerned, I think that the Government ought to play a far greater role. Just compare what our Government is doing with what is being done in other countries!</p>

<p>I do not want to make a personal remark but out of the corner of my eye I can see a sort of dark cloud in the corner over there. Let me tell that hon. member that Japan is not an export country but an import country. May I also remind the hon. member that his Government declared the Japanese to be White. May I also remind him that a special mission was sent to Japan in order to sell some of our agricultural products, not to buy things there. But the difficulty is that while other countries have a credit system in terms of which the Government stands surety for the eventual payment of the price obtained for the products, we do not have a system of that kind in our country. In other words, when products are pur chased from a country, those products need not be paid for immediately; payment need not be made before those goods are delivered or before the product is shipped. Provision is made for free-on-board delivery or for postponement for a certain number of months and the Government stands surety for the payment of the purchase prices. I do not want to go into detail in this regard; I just want to suggest this to the hon. the Minister for his consideration. The details can be worked out later. In conclusion I want to say that in South Africa we ought to try to encourage our people to buy more maize and more maize products. We should also process more maize in South Africa in order to sell it in other forms. What I advocate is that the farmer should be given a certain amount of security so that he will know what the future will bring, and only the Government can tackle this, I have here a cutting in connection with a new product made from maize. The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The National Nutrition Research Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has developed a new product which consists of mealie meal and fruit or vegetables.</block>

<p>This comes from the very highest level, the National Nutrition Research Institute of the C.S.I.R. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This new product is known as fruit flakes, and according to a recent article it has a resistance against discolouring and retains its freshness. Bananas, pineapples and guavas have been used and some vegetables may also be processed in this way.</block>

<p>This product is mixed with the mealiemeal. The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These fruit flakes may be taken as a breakfast food or with custard as a dessert.</block>

<p>How much of this product can be sold? I want to say that they should be a little more practical. This sounds to me like a Cabinet Minister&#x2019;s breakfast! Since we have a surplus of maire in South Africa and since we have to process it into other more acceptable forms in which, for example, the Eastern nations will use it&#x2014;and I am thinking here of the millions of Chinese who are starving&#x2014;I would like to see that we do everything in our power to dispose of our surpluses but I am sure that people will not eat these fruit flakes containing, amongst other things, bananas and guavas, because I can imagine how high the price would be. They would simply not be able to afford it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I want to tell the two Ministers of Agriculture that the time has come for more attention to be given to farming matters and to the welfare of the farmer. The hon. member for Prieska said&#x2014;and I agree with him&#x2014;that the small-scale farmer knows no other profession; there is no other way in which he can make a living. He has to be kept on the land. In this multi-racial country <span class="col_3639-3640" refersTo="page_0394"/>of ours we cannot afford to allow those people who form the backbone of this country to leave the land. The hon. member for Prieska said: &#x201C;No matter what it costs.&#x201D; I do not want to say that but I want to go so far as to say that even though it entails considerable expense, the farmer must be kept on the land.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. C. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down must forgive me if I do not follow her. The time that I have at my disposal does not allow me to do so. I want to associate myself with the hon. members who congratulated the hon. the Minister on his Budget. This is our second Budget since becoming a Republic. The first one was a great surprise to us and to the outside world but the second Budget has exceeded all expectations both inside and outside the country. That is the answer to the blood and tears story&#x2014;the closing of the banks, unemployment, depression, the flight of capital and so forth. Having regard to the Railway Budget and the general Budget I say that our country is experiencing a period of prosperity such as we have never before experienced. We are experiencing peace and quiet amongst employers and employees which is borne out by the wage increases granted to employees in our transport services, the Public Service, education, Posts and Telegraphs and in private undertakings as well, without any conflict between employers and employees. &#x201C;Mutual loyalty&#x201D; is the motto of this Government. That has been, and is and will remain our motto. That is our answer to the United Party prophets of doom. We on this side of the House steadfastly support the policy of separate development. There is no other alternative if the White man in South Africa is to survive. We are irrevocably in favour of separate development or segregation. We are prepared to die for that policy. In our God-given homeland we are prepared to give the Bantu their homeland as well in the pattern of the Transkei. We are giving them their own language, their own flag and their own national anthem. We are sincere in our aims for ourselves and for the Bantu. We are inexorable in demanding that same loyalty for ourselves. If our sincere aims fail, we will act mercilessly. The policy of the Opposition to give the Bantu representation in this House on a joint basis makes us shudder because in this we see the eventual supremacy of the forces of one man, one vote. In this sphere too the Opposition will not succeed in its fear-mongering: it will not succeed in its incitement and prophecies of doom. The people have rejected them at every by-election and general election. We on this side of the House are prepared to admit, having regard to foreign opinions and views and agitators inside and outside of our country, that there are stumbling-blocks and obstructions in our path, but because we believe in our just cause in respect of both Whites and non-Whites we see a future along that path. We see the fall of the White man and of non-White supremacy in the policy of the United Party. After the course of years when the occurrences in the Transkei will be seen in their correct perspective and when the history of this period and these happenings comes to be written, the United Party will have judgment passed against it. Its children will accuse it because it is that party and the English Press who, since 1948, have run with the hare and hunted with the hounds. Now that hare has become a monster and they are becoming afraid of that monster.</p>

<p>The Opposition on that side and the English Press have been suggesting for years that the Bantu were being oppressed, that they should rebel. They also made this known to the outside world. In South Africa this was not a normal, national awakening. It was just like a leaking tap. The Press suggested to the Bantu that they should break away from the White man. The bitter irony of the matter is that they did not do so out of affection and concern for the Bantu, but for their own political gain.</p>

<p>The name of Dr. Verwoerd will also be recorded in these annals and what he stood for and what he did in all sincerity for the salvation of all those living in South Africa will also be recorded; Dr. Verwoerd, the man of character who was called upon to perform a task. When his people needed a leader with initiative and vision, a leader who was not afraid to take risks because his intentions were honest and sincere, he was there.</p>

<p>I want now to confine myself to farming matters and in particular to the maize farmers in regard to whom the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) expressed concern. Once again this is the time of the year in which the maize farmers live in great suspense regarding the price of their product. I have a dozen and a half telegrams in my possession that I still have to show to the hon. the Minister. They all express their concern about the maize price for this year. Because I have the privilege of representing the constituency of Lichtenburg which is the largest maize-producing constituency in the Republic, I want to ask the Government and particularly the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing to fix maize prices this year in a most sympathetic manner. Drought struck the crop at a very critical final stage after all the production costs had already been incurred. Because of this the farmers suffered a loss of millions of bags in comparison with the crop they expected to have. The damage that has been caused has in most cases wiped out the anticipated gross profit. The maize farmers indirectly subsidize other industries, such as the bag industry, the fertilizer industry and other industries which are already established and which cannot compete on the world market. I want to make an appeal to these industries as well as to other industries, to factories and industries, to commerce in general and to housewives in particular&#x2014;particularly the wives of maize farmers&#x2014;to make more use of our maize products. It is well known that the disposal of products on the world market to-day is a great problem <span class="col_3641-3642" refersTo="page_0395"/>because the supply of maize is far larger than the demand. To a very large extent the solution to successful marketing is obvious and that is the assistance that the South African housewife can give in this regard. Maize products like mealiemeal, mealie rice and crushed mealies must be utilized more by housewives. In planning their meals&#x2014;to be unknown is to be unloved&#x2014;they can serve crushed maize with meat sauce, or mealie rice with borrie and raisins. Mealie rice can at any time be used as a substitute for rice if only it is correctly prepared. It has a higher nutritive value and it is far cheaper. There is also the question of barbecues, which is the way of entertaining nowadays, and poetu porridge. Statistics show that 8,000,000 lbs. of rice are being imported annually from China, India and Japan since 1961. This means that money leaves our country and apart from this fact we import the rice from countries that are not friendly towards South Africa, except for the small ray of light on the horizon that we may perhaps in the future be able to do some trade with Japan. Maize is not merely an agricultural product; it is <i>the</i> agricultural product. Not only does it assist young industries through their initial stages but it assists in keeping other industries alive. Maize forms one of the largest single items in our Railway revenue. Next to gold it earns the most foreign currency for us. Once again, I want in all sincerity to make an appeal to the housewives of South Africa, housewives from the lowest to the highest level, to make their slogan: Buy South African; support the products of your own country!</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope I will be excused if I do not follow the hon. member for Lichtenburg (Mr. M. C. van Niekerk). He dealt with a wide variety of subjects ranging from the policy of the United Party to the latest recipes of Mrs. Kotie van der Spuy. I hope I will be excused therefore if I return immediately in the short time at my disposal to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), who spoke just before he did. That hon. member qualified to-day as the prophet of doom in the sphere of agriculture. She has done more harm than good to our agricultural industry and I think there is one thing that I must put right. In the first place the hon. member said&#x2014;and I think that she was speaking for her party&#x2014;that maize prices should be fixed by the Minister in future. I do not think that in saying that she did a service to the maize farmers. We know that that is not so. We know that maize prices are considered by a Maize Board, a board on which various bodies are represented. The price is fixed in a democratic way. They then make a recommendation to the Minister and it is only thereafter that the price is announced by the Minister. I want to make a humble appeal to the hon. the Minister to keep the policy as it is at present. The hon. member went even further; she explained with great ado that the farmers were in reality in a very critical financial position. That is certainly not the truth. I want to refer the hon. member to the <i>Friend</i> of 29 November 1962 in which it is stated emphatically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Both Dr. T. H. Coetzee, Secretary of the S.A. Agricultural Union, and Mr. M. J. Deacon, Secretary of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, to-day said that they could find nothing abnormal in the agricultural economy of the country.</block>

<p>They go on to refer to 28,000 farmers in the Transvaal who owe about R66,000,000 to the Land Bank. But at the same time they point out that this amounts to an average debt of about R3,000 per farmer, something which is not at all unusual. They go on to say that having regard to those figures, only about 20 per cent of the rateable properties of the farmers are bonded. In the last sentence the <i>Friend</i> says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The overall agricultural economy was sound and compared well with any country in the world.</block>

<p>In other words, the position of the farmer is undoubtedly completely sound, and we have this from the <i>Friend</i> which is not a newspaper that goes out of its way to assist the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member also did her best to show that the economic prosperity that the Republic was experiencing at present was not shared by the farmer at all. I maintain that the opposite is the case and I say that the prosperity that we are enjoying in the Republic is to a very large extent due to the prosperity which is experienced in our agricultural economy. The present Budget proves that things are going well with the majority of the farmers and that our agricultural economy is integrated in our national economy in such a way that the two are actually inseparable. That is why, as farmers, we want heartily to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Finance on his Budget. We want to thank him heartily for the concessions that he has made and which will help the farmers. This shows that the hon. the Minister of Finance realizes that the farmer has made his contribution during the past financial year. That is proved by the fact that the Republic has profited to the tune of R847,000,000 through the operations of the agricultural sector of the country. I think this is a considerable sum which compares very well with the amount earned by any other industry in the Republic. A point of very great importance is that agricultural products are primary products; they form capital in the sense that they attract industries to our country. They create opportunities for industries to invest money in our country thus providing employment for our people. In this way they exercise a considerable influence on our economy. That is why I say that the farmer still holds a key position in our country. We know that the United Party ridicules it but this side of the House maintains that the farmer is still the backbone of our country. Since hon. <span class="col_3643-3644" refersTo="page_0396"/>members opposite refer to the farmers in sneering terms, it is necessary to emphasize that the agricultural industry is one of the largest employers in our country. About 50 per cent of our whole population is dependent to a very large extent upon agriculture for its survival.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the importance of agriculture must once again be brought to the attention of this House. Because our agricultural sector plays such an important part in our economy, it is necessary that it should be an independent and self-respecting community. It is true that we do not always sufficiently appreciate the traditional virtues of the inhabitants of the platteland. Those virtues are often not sufficiently emphasized. The Afrikaner people in particular have benefited spiritually from the conservative way of life of our rural society. That section of our people has also played a very stabilizing role in the composition of our nation and that is why we have been enabled from time to time to rectify imbalances that have arisen. I want to point out that there are certain characteristics that one finds mainly amongst the rural population. That is so not necessarily because they are better people but because they have been brought up in that way; it has been their way of life since child-hood. After all a young agriculturist who grows up in the platteland and who is prepared by his parents for the role of farmer in the future must possess that sound judgment which is always a very fine and honest characteristic. He also has to have determination in order to keep his head above water during difficult times. The last and in my view the most important characteristic is the desire and wish to be a farmer and to continue to be a farmer, no matter what may happen. There is an old saying that the eye of the farmer fattens his stock and that his tracks enrich his land. This is a saying which is only too true and is reflected in every true farmer one finds.</p>

<p>In the composition of our agricultural industry it is a fact that we have to deal with large-scale farmers and that we also have to deal with small-scale farmers. I want to deal with the position of the small-scale farmers. I want to quote from the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into White Occupancy of the Rural Areas. This deals with the question of farms becoming smaller or larger. This is one of the conclusions arrived at by that Commission. Paragraph 477 states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission studied all the Agricultural censuses since 1927 with a view to ascertaining whether farms were becoming smaller. From these it appears very definitely that the number of farmers owning less than 500 morgen is on the increase. In 1927 those owning less than 500 morgen were 52.5 per cent whereas in 1954 as much as 62.5 per cent of all farmers owned farms of 500 morgen or less. It appears further than the percentage of the total farm area in the Union comprising units of 500 morgen or less, has increased from 9.3 per cent in 1927 to 11.2 per cent in 1954, signifying an increase of nearly 2,000,000 morgen. Consequently there is a definite increase in the number of smaller farmers; and the area owned by them at present represents a larger percentage of agricultural land than 30 years ago. In certain areas the cutting up of farms has assumed such proportions that drastic control of this development has now become essential.</block>

<p>This is the position that we have and that is why we feel that those small-scale farmers must be considered because they form such a very important section of our national economy and because their turnover is so much smaller than that of the large-scale farmers. They are also far more vulnerable in times of adversity. Not only is their turnover smaller and, because of this, their profits, but they also have far less capital to enable them to overcome those setbacks. And when prices fluctuate on the market, that group is hit particularly hard. It is also true that a large percentage of small-scale farmers are completely dependent upon the income from their farming operations. They have no other income and in most cases they are qualified for no other calling. Because these farmers have no other calling and are completely dependent upon the income from those small farms, I say that they are far more vulnerable in the event of price fluctuations. It is also true that those small-scale farmers rely to a large extent upon family labour and it is also true that when they have no income from farming, no other member of the family is in a position to provide an income from some other source. As I say, when natural disasters strike, the small-scale farmers are the first people whose livelihood is jeopardized. Because they make up a large percentage of our agricultural industry, our national economy is very vulnerable when things do not go well with the small-scale farmers, who are indispensable to our agricultural economy. It is absolutely unthinkable that we should do without them. We know that the United Party went from platform to platform during a previous election and proclaimed, in an attempt to discredit our two Ministers of Agriculture, that they had said that the small-scale farmer should cease to exist. That is not true. They brought those two Ministers into discredit by saying those things. That is why we on this side of the House want to say in no uncertain fashion that the small-scale farmer is there to stay. That is the policy of this Government. And there is any amount of proof that we are looking after those small-scale farmers to the best of our ability and giving them more stability. That is why we say that this action on the part of the United Party is typical of the vulture-like politics that they have been practising recently. They try to create trouble where the shoe pinches most, where people are suffering because of circumstances beyond their control. The hon. member for Drakensberg held meetings in the Northern Transvaal where the farmers are faring so badly. As far <span class="col_3645-3646" refersTo="page_0397"/>as I know&#x2014;and I live in an area which has been very hard hit&#x2014;not a single Nationalist there has become a United Party supporter as a result of those circumstances. The opposite is true, Mr. Speaker. The farmers in the Northern Transvaal realize that they can only expect assistance from the National Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to deal for a moment with the question of financial assistance. It is not unusual for a Government or a State to assist farmers financially. This happens in most countries, to a lesser extent in some and to a greater extent in others. It is a well-known fact that from time to time and under certain circumstances, farmers have to be assisted financially. But the reason for this is obvious. Those farmers have to feed the nation. It is the responsibility of any Government to ensure that the nation is fed. That is why this Government will continue to give farmers the necessary financial assistance where it considers it possible and necessary to do so.</p>

<p>I dealt in detail on a previous occasion with the question of financial assistance. I am also fully aware of the fact that the present assistance is given generously in deserving cases but we also know that there are certain shortcomings. We are aware of the fact that the Cabinet is giving its attention to certain financial measures that have to be taken to meet those needs. In order to emphasize the necessity for these measures and their urgency, I want to quote again from the report that I have already mentioned. Paragraph 554 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since a special investigation into the agricultural credit system is at present being conducted, the commission limits itself to the recommendation that a central credit system for the provision of all agricultural credit be established, with due regard to the particular needs of agriculture in respect of short-term, medium-term and long-term credit. There should be strict control of the utilization of such credit.</block>

<p>We are grateful for the steps that are being considered to meet that need. I have quoted from this report merely to impress upon the hon. the Minister that there has never been a more suitable and a better time than now to take this step in regard to the financing of agriculture. In this regard I want to say that we in the northern Transvaal are experiencing a drought such as we have never known before. I hope that I will be forgiven if I sound selfish in emphasizing the northern Transvaal because we know that things are also going badly elsewhere. But the fact is that in the constituency that I represent 95 per cent of the farmers are small-scale farmers. As I have already indicated these are the people who are hit first and hardest when disaster strikes. There are also many farmers in the northern Transvaal who do not have the necessary capital. I think that it is our duty to thank not only the Ministers concerned but to thank the Government as well for what it has done in this area over the past years. There are farmers there who have not had a crop for four successive years. As I say, these are farmers who have little capital and one can understand that their need is very great, and because that is so I want to conclude by indicating that what is required immediately is not assistance to buy luxuries but to buy the necessaries of life. It is necessary for some of these farmers to be provided with the necessaries of life. In the second place there is the question of food and renumeration for the people in their employ. We have the harvest loan scheme to-day, and after the crop failure this year we can expect that more farmers will have to be assisted under this scheme. A crop failure, as hon. members are aware, means that the farmer gets back his seed and a little extra, but this year they are getting even less than that. In many cases they are getting absolutely nothing. It is alarming to think that some of our farmers may possibly disappear from the land, farmers whom we will then have to rehabilitate and who will then have to be assisted by the Government. The position in which they find themselves is not the fault of the National Party and it is not the Minister&#x2019;s fault; it is due to factors over which nobody has any control. I conclude with the request to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the other Ministers who are concerned with this matter and whom we know are always sympathetic to realize that the need in the northern Transvaal is great and to give these people generous assistance.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to direct my remarks to that part of the amendment moved by the hon. member for Constantia which calls upon the Government to take steps to end our ever-growing isolation from traditional friends in the Western world. Mr. Speaker, it is because we wish to see the good name of our country honoured by the nations of the world and because we wish to defend and preserve South Africa for Western civilization, in the African continent in particular, that we have included this leg in our amendment.</p>

<p>I do not think it can be disputed that our position at an international level is growing worse and worse as the months go by. Therefore I think the question must be asked for how long can we in South Africa afford to go it alone, to go it alone in political isolation from the rest of the world. Sir, it would appear from ministerial statements made recently that the Government have resigned themselves to following a policy of political international isolation. They have done so because they have accepted the fact that as long as the Nationalist Party Government, with the image the rest of the world has of its race policies, continues in office and continues to rule our country, in the descriptive words of the <i>Burger</i> South Africa &#x201C;sal nog wees die muishond van die w&#x00EA;reld&#x201D;. When we have reached the position, Sir, that the Prime Minister of our country has to issue threats against the <span class="col_3647-3648" refersTo="page_0398"/>rest of the world, as he recently did at a meeting at Epping, then I would suggest that we have reached rock-bottom in our relationship with the other countries of the world. He said this in discussing the attitude of other countries towards South Africa at the present time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As ander nasies die verstand verloor en verder gaan as wat hulle mag, as stryd nodig is in die plek van diplomasie, sal SuidAfrika nie aarsel nie.</block>

<p>Surely, Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister cannot issue threats of this nature without an acute awareness of the difficult and bad position on the international front of our country. But he even went further. The hon. the Prime Minister alleges that every leader of the free world is out of step except himself and the Nationalist Party Government in South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister went so far as to accuse the leaders of the Western world of having in the first instance no principles, and secondly as acting as nothing but political opportunists. At the same meeting at Epping a couple of weeks ago, he had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Een van die grootste tragedies vandag in die w&#x00EA;reld is dat leiers hul volkere beginselloos wil lei en alles wil prysgee wat oor baie eeue opgebou is. Sulke leiers voel hulle deur geen beginsel gebind nie. Mens moet bid dat daar vandag meer leiers in Europa kom wat sterk wil optree en standpunt will inneem vir dit wat vir hul volk en die Westerse w&#x00EA;reld goed is.</block>

<p>The inference is quite clear. The Prime Minister on that occasion was talking about the Western nations. I would remind the hon. the Prime Minister that the leaders of the Western World, like him, are elected by the people that they represent, and if any one of these leaders of the Western world had to stand for election in their own countries, with a race policy such as our present Government has, they would never have any hope of being elected at all. As for having no principles, I wonder if the Prime Minister or the Minister of Foreign Affairs will permit me to remind him that if it was not for the principles of the leaders of the Western world in their fight against Communism, the free world might have ceased to exist already, and that includes our own country. I think that these statements of the hon. the Prime Minister indicate how bankrupt of hope the Government has become in trying to retrieve the international position of our country and to reinstate its status amongst the nations of the world. Sir, is it any wonder then that we have to read in the newspapers a speech made by the hon. Minister of Economic Affairs the other day in which he told the students of the Free State that South Africa is engaged in a struggle for its very existence. The Government defends the situation as it exists at the present time by stating that there is only one alternative and that is complete capitulation. Because they argue there is only one way to satisfy the rest of the world and that is complete White capitulation by accepting the principle of &#x201C;one man one vote When we raise these issues across the floor of the House, Sir, we are always met by the question by members on the other side &#x201C;will the United Party accept such a policy and pay this price for the favour of world opinion?&#x201D; Before replying to this question, I think it is necessary to to take very briefly into review the extent of South Africa&#x2019;s isolation at the present time. Let us look at the position as it is to-day and how it has deteriorated in the past few years. I want to begin with the United Nations. The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, last year, reporting in this House on events at the United Nations Session in 1961. had this to say when the vote was taken at the United Nations on the application of sanctions against South Africa, which was defeated on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was a very nervous moment for us when the voting was taking place.</block>

<p>I can only comment at this stage in the light of what did happen at the United Nations since then that the Minister must have been frightened out of his wits this past year at the last session of what was decided then in regard to sanctions being applied against South Africa. If he was nervous the year before when the motion was defeated, then he must really have been frightened out of his wits this year as to the consequences upon world opinion and the consequences of that motion being adopted at the United Nations.</p>

<p>Now the Government and the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs try to cover up the tragic position in which we have landed by saying &#x201C;Well, it was going to happen in any event because we are dealing with a lot of Black states, we are dealing with the Asiatic states and with the African states at the United Nations&#x201D;. But we have heard continuously from the Minister of Foreign Affairs during the last three years that one can do what one likes, but the position is no different to what it was in 1946 and 1947 and if there was a United Party Government in power, one would still have to face the same situation. Sir, in support of this contention for the past two years the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs defending the deterioration of our position at the United Nations, has in long speeches here quoted lengthy extracts from speeches made at the United Nations in the years 1946 and 1947, as taken from the United Nations records. Mr. Speaker, what was the position in those years when a United Party Government was in power that gave representation in this House to the Bantu population and when the Coloured man was on the Common Roll? Firstly, without exception, all the Western nations voted for South Africa, everyone of them. Secondly, important South American countries voted for South Africa. Thirdly, even African states voted for South Africa, those that were represented at the United <span class="col_3649-3650" refersTo="page_0399"/>Nations in the years 1946 and 1947; fourthly, the Scandinavian countries voted for South Africa. If any hon. member has any doubts about this at all, I have in my hands here a voting paper of the United Nations for those years, in which it is recorded which countries in those years supported South Africa. I do not want to mention them all, but amongst them was even Ethiopia. I do not want to quote all the speeches, but I want to quote just one speech to show the general attitude of the Western nations towards South Africa in those years, and I quote this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say first of all, countries critical of the Union of South Africa should practise the spirit of tolerance and understanding that the Charter demands. They should look at the history of this very new nation, at the tremendous effort it has made in overcoming its internal difficulties, how it has got within it racial difficulties of a peculiarly onerous and intractable character, and how the leadership of men like Botha and Smuts and other leaders are helping them to face these difficulties.</block>

<p>I cannot stand by and read some of the things which have been said, which are to the effect that there has been some breach of morality by the Union of South Africa.</p>

<p>I am not going to use the term &#x201C;morals&#x201D;, but I repeat that when people criticize a country, for its treatment of dependent peoples or its failure to act in a certain way, let them look at the position fairly. Let them look at the credit side of the balance. Let them look at the good record of the Union of South Africa, a magnificent work in war, and let them look at the great contributions in principles solely of government which have been made by the leaders of South Africa.</p>

<p>That statement in 1946-7 was made by the Leader of the Australian Delegation, and I want to ask the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs now: Where is Australia&#x2019;s voice to-day when Australia voted against South Africa? Where is the vote she gave to South Africa in those years and where is Australia&#x2019;s vote today. The plain fact of the matter is that no Western nation gives South Africa her support. They would consider to do so in the words of the Australian Delegate as a &#x201C;breach of morality&#x201D; in the treatment of non-Whites. It is the direct result of the policy enunciated by this Government.</p>

<p>I now want to turn to our situation in Africa. In the years in which this hon. Minister has been Minister of Foreign Affairs we have had one statement of policy in regard to Africa. That statement of policy which the hon. Minister made in 1957 was based on our country forming a link between the West and the peoples of Africa, which was, as the Minister put it at the time dependent on the other African states accepting the Republic as a fellow-state in the Continent of Africa. This policy statement contained certain laudable sentiments with which we at the time agreed. But we also warned the Government at the time when the Minister&#x2019;s statement was discussed in this House that if the policy had to be successful, we as an African state would have to recognize the tempo of development in Africa itself to the extent that we could not here in this House legislate in isolation. The Government have made the fatal mistake of not recognizing that what they do in the sphere of domestic policies in South Africa will have its repercussions in Africa far beyond our borders, and <i>vice versa,</i> perhaps even more important, that what is accomplished internally in the other states of Africa will affect our own way of life in South Africa to an ever-increasing extent. We see to-day with the fertilizer of communist ideology and the rain&#x2014;to use a metaphor of the Minister of Finance&#x2014;of American dollars the development of African nationalism, aided by the policies of this Government in dismembering our own country. You must, Mr. Speaker, see the impact of these developments on our own country to-day with the situation with which we are presently faced.</p>

<p>I say that this Minister&#x2019;s policy as far as Africa is concerned, has been a miserable failure. But why has it failed? It has failed because the Minister and the Government have failed to get the acceptance of the other African Black states to recognize our country as a country in Africa containing both White and Black Africans who are prepared to make positive contributions to the development of Africa. It has failed to such an extent, Sir, that we have been kicked out of the Commission for Technical Co-operation in Africa, and I would submit that if our contributions have been of such a nature as to be valued by the other African states and had been proportionate to our resources, we would possibly still be members of this organization, to-day the only all-Africa organization. Mr. Speaker, what was our total contribution to this African organization? Let me give the House what the Minister himself has given me: Four visits from our country to other states in Africa, two visits by two representatives of the Republic as agricultural experts; one visit by a member of the staff of the C.S.I.R.; and one visit by the Market-master of Johannesburg. How many visits to our country by representatives of the other states? Three visits. Two instances where we made publications available to other African states. On one occasion we made three educational films available at a total cost of R40.36; two instances where we supplied vaccines; in one case we gave diagnostic services to another African state at a cost to the taxpayers of South Africa of R1.85; and then as a final terrific contribution to show the extent of our co-operation in Africa we gave 50 guinea-pigs to the Congo at a value of R83.69. That is the sum-total of our contributions in a positive way to the emergent states of Africa in the years 1959, 1960 and 1961, and I am not including in this case&#x2014;perhaps the Minister would like to make a point of it&#x2014;the two or three contributions of assistance that we made <span class="col_3651-3652" refersTo="page_0400"/>to the Federation. With all our know-how, with all our resources and the Minister&#x2019;s protestations over the years of active assistance that is all that the Government have offered. I think every member of this House remembers the great manner in which this Minister has for years brought up our efforts with the C.C.T.A. before we were kicked out.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Compare that with the rain of dollars: $55,000,000 contributed in 1958 and a total amount voted for foreign assistance by the United States Government fo something like $287,000,000 in 1961, to which President Kennedy referred as being essential to build a strong and a free Africa. Apart from the C.C.T.A., we; were linked up with one other organization, a United Nations Organization, the Economic Commission for Africa, which this Minister in the first instance refused to join because he lauded the C.C.T.A., and then subsequently had to change his mind. We cannot attend the meetings of this organization either, because no country in Africa will give our representatives visas. I could go on at length quoting information of this nature. But what is our position with the other Western countries, the Scandinavian countries who were friends before? I can quote from statements made by leading members of European countries, statements by Americans. I can go on at length quoting statements made by politically elected leaders of all the other Western countries in their attitude towards South Africa. But I think it will suffice to quote one in the time that is available, because I think it represents the views of all the leaders of the Western states and this is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the end it will be the South Africans themselves, Black, Coloured and White, who must bring about the change which will allow all races to dwell together in mutual amity.</block>

<p>It is incumbent on us here to-day to consider what we can do as members of the United Nations, and as representatives of individual states, to convince the Government of South Africa that apartheid is wrong, that it cannot succeed, and that its abandonment is indispensable for the future of all the peoples of South Africa. I would add that its abandonment would aid the Continent as a whole; for apartheid does more than separate the races within South Africa; it also separates South Africa from the rest of Africa and denies that nation the opportunity to make the contribution it might make to the development and progress of all Africa.</p>

<p>We believe that the nations must take evey opportunity to make known to the Government of South Africa the sentiments of the world community.</p>

<p>That was a statement made by the United States ambassador to the United Nations and I think represents in tone the statement made by all the leaders of the Western nations in expressing abhorrence of the race policies followed by this Government. But, Sir, what is the answer? Will it be necessary to follow a policy of complete capitulation on the principle of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; and surrender what we look upon as Western civilization and a civilized way of life in our own country in order to placate the rest of the world? Of course not. Such a course is unthinkable, and I have no doubt that we can save the situation. I do not for one moment believe that in the present mood of the peoples of Africa and certain Eastern countries it can be changed overnight. But I do believe in one thing: That we can change the views of the Western nations whose sympathy and support is vital to the future security of our country. In order to achieve that, there are two things we have to do, there are two essential requirements. The first is that we have got to change the image of South Africa that this Government has created of South Africa, the image of the White man in South Africa we have got to change in the world at large. What is that image? It is one of race domination in the worst degree, where all other non-White citizens are denied rights and privileges enjoyed in any democratic society. Sir, the film that was viewed to-day and the impact that it has made on millions and millions of people in the Western world is the image of race discrimination.</p>

<p>It is a lying document.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>It is a lying document, but it is also based on half-truths, precisely as the speech made by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) in this House last night which has done just as much damage to the interests of South Africa. There is no difference to my mind between the speech made by the hon. member for Vereeniging last night in this House and the film that we saw to-day. Both were harmful to the interests of South Africa. This picture of South Africa can only be changed by the Minister of Information. The Minister of Information can never hope to counteract the influence that this film has had. Sir, the image of South African can only be changed by the people of South Africa, and it can only be changed by the people of South Africa rejecting at the polling booth this Government who have created this image of South Africa abroad at the present time. I am convinced that the fall of this Government will without doubt show the world, in the words of the Australian delegate to the United Nations, that there is no breach of morality on the part of the White people of South Africa in their treatment of Black Africans. Sir, the Western world would look upon the rejection of this Government by the White people, as the rejection of apartheid which is interpreted as the worst degree of race suppression; the rejection <span class="col_3653-3654" refersTo="page_0401"/>of this Government would create the impression in the Western world at large that the White people of South Africa have restored Western democratic principles, under which the Black Africans will have the right of enjoying political and economic and social opportunities under the policy of a new Government. The second essential is to establish in the minds of the people of Africa, that the White Africans of the Republic have as much right to the soil of the Republic as the Black Africans have and that White Africans of the Republic of South Africa are prepared in company with the other African states to share their know-all, their industrial and technical resources for the common good of Africa. If we want to achieve these essentials and we want to gain once again the confidence of the Western nations in our country as a state in Africa, then I have no doubt that we will have their support in achieving the second essential, namely to get the support of the African states, and that the Western nations will look upon South Africa as the pivot on which activity will hinge to keep Africa safe for Western democracy.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to quote two Prime Ministers&#x2019; statements here. I wish in the first instance to quote the Prime Minister of South Africa when he said this in this House on 11 April last year. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would certainly wish to isolate my country&#x2019;s policy in colour matters from the United Kingdom.</block>

<p>Sir. the United Kingdom&#x2019;s views are the views of the Western world. The Prime Minister continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am convinced that our strength for ensuring our survival lies in that isolation. I have no hesitation in saying so.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think it can be accepted that the views of the United Kingdom Government generally represent those of the Western world. The other Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement I wish to quote was also made in the confines of this building&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact is that in this modern world no country, not even the greatest, can live for itself alone.<br/>Nearly 2,000 years ago, when the whole of the civilized world was comprised within the confines of the Roman Empire, St. Paul proclaimed one of the great truths of history: &#x201C;We are all members one of another.&#x201D; During this Twentieth Century that eternal truth has taken on a new and exciting significance.<br/>It has always been impossible for the individual man to live in isolation from his fellows&#x2014;in the home, the tribe, the village or the city. To-day it is impossible for nations to live in isolation from one another.<br/>What Dr. John Donne said of individual men 300 years ago is true to-day of my country, your country and all the countries of the world:<br/>&#x201C;Any man&#x2019;s death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind.<br/>And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.&#x201D;<br/>All nations are now inter-dependent one upon another, and this is generally realized in the Western world.</block>

<p>These words were uttered in the confines of this building by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in his famous &#x201C;winds of change&#x201D; speech. Sir, our plea on these benches is that the people of our country do not wish to see us being further isolated, because we cannot live alone. Our plea is that the people of South Africa should see that a wind of change blows for the betterment and the decent upholding of democratic principles in South Africa, so that once again we can get the respect of the Western world and in getting their respect, be able to get the respect of the rest of Africa.</p>

<speech by="#niemand">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEMAND</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to follow up what has been said by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant). He spoke about the isolation of South Africa and completely lost sight of the fact that under a United Party Government, where one concession after another would have been made, South Africa would already have been Black. If he feels that it is desirable to have a Black Government in power in this country and that in that event we will not be isolated, then I can understand his argument.</p>

<p>The charge has been made against us by the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) that as far as our agricultural economy is concerned we are in a position that can be compared to a depression. I want to refute that allegation. A statement such as that can only do our agriculture a great deal of harm. The Budget has shown that there is economic prosperity and agriculture has also kept pace with that prosperity. I want to say immediately that I exclude those places, some of which fall in my constituency, where a state of emergency prevails at the moment. This Government is very sympathetically disposed towards the farmers and this is proved by the fact that provision is made in the Budget for an amount of R38,000,000 in respect of subsidies on railway tariffs for the conveyance of livestock and dairy products, wheat, artificial fertilizer and maize. In the past year 1962-3 an amount of R2,700,000 was allocated to State Advances to assist our people. This year, 1963-4, there is an amount of R5,400,000, twice the amount voted last year. This proves that this Government looks after our people when they are in difficulties. As far as this amount for State Advances is concerned I also want to say that it is the policy of the Government to assist the farmers, and that this is the correct thing to do because it is done in every country in the world. I want to mention here that the <span class="col_3655-3656" refersTo="page_0402"/>total amount recoverable by State Advances up to 31 March 1962 amounted to nearly R 136,000,000, including interest. Of that amount, only 3.2 per cent was written off. This proves that our farmers do meet their obligations if they are assisted. In 1961-2 the total production in agriculture, stock-breeding and horticulture increased by 4 per cent. In 1960-1 the production amounted to R814,000,000 as against R846,000,000 in 1961-2. The value of our agricultural production reached a record figure. But this creates the problem of surpluses that we have to contend with to-day. When we have surpluses and we are able to export our surplus commodities at a good price, there is not much danger in this regard but the difficulty we experience is that foreign agricultural countries are out to protect food production in their own countries and this creates a problem when we are faced with a surplus production. If the price of a product which is exported to another country is lower than the price in the interior, this creates a danger for the Government because if we have to export large quantities of that product at a lower price, the industry suffers because the industry has to bear that loss itself. We are very dependent upon overseas markets and there are certain products which are produced in this country mainly for the foreign market, products such as wool and fruit. It has been proved over the years that the prices of those agricultural products which are exported fluctuate more than the prices of the products that are produced and consumed here. It is obvious that in those cases where we receive poor prices for products overseas, the Government will try to create a more favourable relationship between production and internal consumption. The question, of course, is how? We are then faced with the question as to whether we should restrict farmers by means of a quota system. There are many farmers who still do not like this idea but I foresee that this will eventually have to come. The size or the scope of our internal consumption is determined by the economic prosperity of the country, by the growth of our economy and industry in the country. As far as the marketing of our products is concerned, there is one bright spot and that is that this Budget shows that there has been a healthy growth in our economy and that the position of the country is sound. In the second place, the purchasing power of the Bantu will increase to such an extent that their large numbers ought to create a good market for our agricultural products. When we think of the large amounts spent on the Bantu homelands and on border industries, we realize that this will create good markets for our agricultural products. But our population also increases by 2 per cent every year. This means an addition of more than 300,000 people to our population every year by means of this normal increase. Every year we have 300,000 extra mouths to feed.</p>

<p>I want to indicate the important role that agriculture plays in connection with our balance of payments. In 1956-7 our total exports amounted to R797,000,000 of which R350,400,000 or 44 per cent was made up by agricultural products. In 1960-1 our total exports amounted to R801,000,000, R311,000,000 or 38.8 per cent of which represented agricultural products. There was a decrease at that time as a result of the fact that exports were reduced and because prices fell. But in 1961-2 the total value of our exports amounted to R875,600,000 and of this figure agriculture was responsible for R373,100,000, or 42.6 per cent. This indicates that the export of agricultural products is an important factor in augmenting over foreign reserves. It is important to exploit these export markets because in this way we earn money for South Africa abroad. The United Party have referred to the adverse conditions in agriculture but they lose sight of the fact that the prices of many of these products have fallen on the world market. When we look at the index figures for wool, groundnuts and maize, taking 100 as the figure for 1955-6, we find that in 1960-1 the figure was 85 for wool, 91 for groundnuts and 84 for maize. This indicates that there was a considerable drop in the prices of those products on the world market. But the United Party say that things are going badly with our agriculture. Falling prices are a world tendency.</p>

<p>I want to come back now to our farming industry and particularly to the drought conditions which prevail at present. It is true that it is of the utmost importance to the country we should have a sound farming community. We have fluctuating climatic conditions. Let me say this about our farmers; they are able and they have proved in the past that they can adjust themselves to these changing climatic conditions. But notwithstanding the favourable position as far as our present Budget is concerned, it is a fact that the constituency that I represent in the Northern Transvaal has been hit by unusual conditions and the survival of many of our farmers is threatened by drought. Large numbers of our farmers in the Northern Transvaal, the vast majority of them, are small-scale farmers, and if something unforeseen happens, it affects those people adversely. I want to sketch the position briefly for the House and I make no apology for doing so because it is necessary for us to know what has happened.</p>

<p>In November 1962 crops were sown in that area and although the crops came up well, very little rain has fallen since January with the result that the crop has been lost. The grazing is so poor that already at this stage farmers have started trekking with their stock and the whole of the winter still lies ahead. What makes the position so serious there? The reason is that this condition has been aggravated by what happened during the two preceding years. What happened in 1961? We had foot-and-mouth disease in the Northern Transvaal and the stock of many of the farmers was placed under quarantine with the result that those farmers were unable to sell their stock. This livestock represents the farmers&#x2019; sources of income, by means of which they <span class="col_3657-3658" refersTo="page_0403"/>have to pay their instalments and interest. Nowadays most of our people have to buy their land on the instalment system because farming is an expensive business. The result of this is that the farmers have not been able to move their stock or to sell them, their grazing has been ruined with the result that thousands of head of stock have died and in this way many farmers have lost their capital. Their debts are increasing and these farmers are worried about the position. I want to compare their position with that of a person drawing a salary, a person who has to make ends meet without his Salary for a year, who has to pay the instalments on his house, who has to support a wife and children and who in the eighth month loses his roof in a storm and then has still to borrow money to build a new roof. After having had no income for months, these people were hard hit by the fact that they lost many of their livestock.</p>

<p>The following year 1962, was a year of very poor crops. In my constituency particularly cattle farming is the stabilizing factor in the economy. The crop farmers had very poor harvests and the cattle farmers had no grazing and because of the loans which they had to take, those people were very depressed, as one can well understand. It is true that from January to April after the rain, our people are usually very optimistic, they are filled with hope when the grass grows well because the young animals fetch good prices on the market. But what has happened now? I visited that area recently. The time is past when people on the Highveld bought trek-oxen and store-oxen. What we have in the Northern Transvaal to-day is a cycle. One man is a breeder, another buys young heifers, another buys store-oxen and yet another fattens up his animals to make them ready for the market. There is a complete cycle there, but during the drought nobody was able to buy young animals. The crop farmer did not have a crop and the stock farmer was affected by the drought and had to get rid of his animals with the result that the value of oxen which should have been sold dropped by from R10 to R20 per head, and that is precisely the amount that the cattle farmer needs in order to have a gross income on his farm. As far as slaughter stock was concerned, the position was slightly better and indeed, from October to January, slaughter stock prices reached a peak that they had not reached in years. But our people in the Northern Transvaal were unfortunately not able to share in those prices because they were experiencing a drought They were not able to enjoy those benefits. The future looked bleak for those people, mainly because we concentrate on expensive stock-farming there. It is unprofitable to feed that livestock for a long period. One may perhaps buy fodder for a few months, but not for longer. I want to say that we are grateful that we have a National Party Government in power to look after our people. By means of the assistance given by the Government many of those people have been saved from ruin. Many forms of assistance have been made available and I want to express our gratitude not only to the two Ministers of Agriculture, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Lands for the most sympathetic manner in which this matter has been dealt with but also to every official of the Department who has had anything to do with this matter. We have had great sympathy from all of them. But I feel that I must also pay a tribute to those people who find themselves in these circumstances and who refuse to go under. They have faith and courage and confidence in the future and they have the necessary determination. These people deserve encouragement which, fortunately, they do receive from this Government. We are grateful for the fact that we have a National Party Government to look after our people under these circumstances, a Government which will treat them with the greatest sympathy at all times.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have just listened to a speech by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) on the Opposition side which was completely foreign to the debate on agriculture and one gained the impression that the Opposition suddenly realized that they had moved an amendment in this debate and that one of its points dealt with the so-called isolation of South Africa from the rest of the world. Because in the nearly four days of debate that we have already had there has not been one word on the part of the Opposition in regard to that point of their amendment, the hon. member for Turffontein jumped up quickly to say something in that regard. He said at the start of his speech that he would give us the answer to-day to what they regarded as the solution to all those things which in their view are wrong with South Africa. We all waited in anticipation and we though that after all the caucus meetings of the United Party we were going to have some guidance to-day regarding the solution of our problems. But then the hon. member began a long tirade against the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs and he continued to belittle South Africa and her finest efforts. He eventually gave us his answer at the end of his speech. He said that everything that was wrong with South Africa could be rectified if we had a change of Government, but he did not substantiate his statement. He did not tell us why world opinion would change in respect of South Africa if we had a change of Government, why South Africa would then no longer be isolated. I want to put this question to the Opposition with all the earnestness at my command: Why do the Opposition think that South Africa will be no more isolated than she is to-day if we have a change of Government? And if we have a change of Government, who will be the alternative Government? Will it be the United Party?</p>

<p>It has become very clear to me in this debate that the United Party are finished as a political factor in South Africa. The United Party does not represent any trend of thought in this House. That can be seen, and the <span class="col_3659-3660" refersTo="page_0404"/>world will realize it if the speeches made here by members of the United Party are read. Each one has a different story to tell. No specific trend of thought is followed. That is why I say that the United Party is finished as a political factor and an Opposition. The United Party is completely frustrated and in its frustration it does not care what it does to belittle and hurt and blacken South Africa in the eyes of the world, or how far it goes in doing so as long as it imagines that in this way it may perhaps be able to regain a little of its lost political prestige.</p>

<p>We listened last night to a speech in this House that I cannot allow to pass unnoticed. The hon. member for Vereeniging has already replied partly to it. I refer to the speech of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) who unfortunately is not here now. I want to say that what that hon. member said here ought not to be permitted in this country, let alone in this House. She knows that she enjoys parliamentary privilege and she is abusing it. The speech of the hon. member was damaging to the State; it was damaging not only to the National Party but to the United Party as well. I came to the conclusion while watching the Opposition when the hon. member for Houghton was speaking, that she was expressing the most fervent desires and wishes of the United Party which they did not have the courage to express in this debate themselves because they were afraid of what the electorate would do at the next election. The United Party has been following a certain pattern for some time of belittling South Africa and accusing this Government of being the oppressors of the Black man, up to a point, and now the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) and a few other conservative members have apparently gained the upper hand temporarily. They have suddenly swung around and placed the Government in a completely different light. But while the hon. member for Houghton was speaking, it was very clear to me that she was expressing the views of the vast majority of the Opposition. Her&#x2019;s were their desires and wishes and their past actions substantiate this fact. That is what they want to see in South Africa. Because if they can destroy South Africa and the National Party simultaneously, they will not hesitate to do so for one moment. The type of speech that we listened to last night is damaging to the State and undermines the authority of the State and in her absence I want to make an appeal to the hon. member and to members of the Opposition to be very careful what they say here not only now but at all times. Sir, I want to remind you of what she said in regard to the unfortunate happenings at Paarl a short while ago. It is convenient for the hon. member not to be here now but there are a few members of the Opposition here who are absolutely frustrated and discouraged and without hope for the future because they do not have the courage to express the policy that they are in favour of. They use the hon. member for Houghton for this task and last night that hon. member expressed the wishes of the United Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the unfortunate happenings at Paarl. She went further and she said these things here in this House where she has a very willing Press to record her barbed words, where she has a forum and where she enjoys parliamentary privilege. She came to this House and said these things and they were transmitted to the world. She said that it would not end with Paarl but that it would happen throughout the country whereever oppressive measures such as the pass laws were applied. That is why I say that speeches of this kind should not be permitted either in or outside of this House because it is not in the interests of the State that these speeches should be made. The hon. member told the Bantu by implication that they should act as they acted in Paarl wherever the laws of this Government are applied. I think that at the present time we must be careful of what we say.</p>

<p>We had the opportunity this morning of seeing a film which I am sure deeply shocked every right-thinking person. I can think o dreadful parts in that film. I want to brand it as a horrible film which, together with the speech of the hon. member for Houghton, was planned by a master-mind for the year 1963 when the future of the White man in South Africa was being threatened. That film is only one small card in the jigsaw puzzle giving the final picture. That film was made and put together in that distorted fashion in order to condition public opinion abroad against the White man in South Africa. That is the sort of thing that happened prior to the Anglo-Boer War. That is the ugly sort of thing that we do not want to see here and I am waiting for hon. members of the Opposition to stand up and to condemn and reject that film out of hand. I am waiting for the hon. member for Houghton who is a member of this House and, as such, a part of the Government of the country, to stand up and condemn that picture as a false image of what is taking place in South Africa. But it is part of a pattern that must be followed to condition world opinion against South Africa, to ripen it. It is not aimed at the National Party but at the White man in South Africa. I would prefer to say nothing more about it. It was a shocking and a dreadful thing to watch and it filled one with revulsion. One could take the same picture in any country where certain incidents take place, incidents which take place each day in most countries of the world, and perhaps far more often than is the case here. I would like to see this picture released for public consumption in South Africa, not in order to create a wrong impression or to stir up hatred against America, but to show the White public of South Africa what is being done to present our country in a distorted and incorrect light to the outside world and so that we can make up our minds to put a stop to that sort of thing. I want to express the hope that if those people ever come here <span class="col_3661-3662" refersTo="page_0405"/>again, no matter under what pretext, no facilities will be given to them to make films of this nature which blacken South Africa abroad in this libellous fashion.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned for supper I was pointing out the connection between the horror film we saw this morning, &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;, and the speech made by the hon. member for Hougton in this House last night. To my mind there is a very strong link between the two. I cannot but conclude that this horror film was inspired by a person who fled the country illegally&#x2014;Patrick Duncan, the bosom friend and the ward of the hon. member for Orange Grove. I cannot but conclude that that horror film that we saw and that dreadful speech to which we had to listen to-night constitute an atrocity against the White people of South Africa. But I want to leave it at that.</p>

<p>As far as this Budget is concerned, I cannot do otherwise but associate myself with all the other hon. members who have congratulated the hon. the Minister on the excellent Budget that he has presented to the House. In regard to what the hon. member for Turffontein said this afternoon&#x2014;that we are isolated&#x2014;I want to point out that the aircraft of other countries still land at our airports, and ships of other countries still touch at our ports, money from other countries is still flowing into South Africa and immigrants are coming to South Africa as never before, so much so that we have a Minister and a Department of Immigration to-day. Speeches like the speech of the hon. member are aimed at deterring people by telling the world that we are isolated. Imports and exports are increasing. Money is coming into the country. The Orange River scheme, the building of a pipeline between Durban and Johannesburg and similar undertakings create an interest on the part of overseas&#x2019; investors to come to this country to invest their money here.</p>

<p>Perhaps the United Party is isolated from the Republic but the Republic as such is not isolated. The United Party and its policy are isolated from the minds of the electorate here. But I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I want to make only one plea on this occasion and that is in connection with soil conservation. All those who can assist in forming opinion in this country must try to create the correct attitude towards our common and permanent heritage, our only true capital investment&#x2014;our soil. That part of the Republic which remains to the White man after certain areas have been given to the Bantu is land that we must develop to its maximum potential. There are three main requirements for soil conservation. In the first place it is necessary to promote the correct attitude in this regard. That attitude must be cultivated on the part of the child, the White man, the Black man, the Brown man&#x2014;on the part of everyone. Our attitude towards the soil must be the correct one. We cannot make two morgen out of one morgen and that is why we have to increase the carrying capacity of one morgen. This can only be done if we follow a long-term policy in respect of agriculture. We must not exhaust our soil as swiftly as possible for our own benefit. Secondly, we need to know how to conserve the soil and to build up its fertility. This knowledge is obtained by research which is done by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and we are grateful for it. Thirdly, funds are needed because if we have the correct attitude and the necessary knowledge but we do not have the funds, that does not help either. That is why I want to ask for more money to be made available in the future. I am not criticizing what is already being done. We are grateful for it. By improving our soil we will be making a capital investment for our future generations. That is why I ask&#x2014; and I make no apologies for doing so&#x2014;for higher subsidies for soil conservation. I am not making a plea for our present-day farmers; I am not asking for this so that he can make larger profits. I see this rather as a capital investment by one generation for future generations. By means of an investment of this nature in the soil of South Africa, with the correct attitude, with the necessary knowledge of soil conservation and with the necessary funds for soil conservation I believe that all will be well with South Africa as long as we have a Government in power here that will do what it can for the good of South Africa.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>The state of mind of the hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) interested me far more than what he had to say. His mind is so typical of the minds of so many members on the other side. He said, for instance, that he had no hope for the United Party because we had &#x201C;geen gedagterigtings&#x201D;. Why does he say that? I will say why. It is because hon. members on the other side have this amazing mentality that unless you oppose one extreme with another extreme, they seem to think there is no opposition. To them a thing is either black or white&#x2014;there is nothing in between, no shades of political meaning. That is why. Because we are not an extreme party, he writes us off, because when we do not oppose their extreme policy with another extreme policy the United Party has no hope! Nothing illustrates more clearly that line of thinking than what he said immediately after that. Again and again we have heard from hon. members opposite that the honest opposition to their policies was that of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). But what did the hon. member for <span class="col_3663-3664" refersTo="page_0406"/>Wolmaransstad do to-night? He asked that the type of speech the hon. member for Houghton made last night, should be banned. That is the ridiculous position their thinking leads to! When they have what they regard as an honest policy against their policy, they want to ban it! On the other hand, if it is not extreme, then there is no opposition! Again and again we have heard from the opposite side that the only other direction in which we can go in South Africa is that represented by the hon. member for Houghton. But now they want to ban that direction.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that if you study all real democracies, you will find that they have advanced not by dogma but by adapting themselves to the facts of social, economic and human life. The policies of this side of the House are in accord with this and reality will still bring us into power because in the long run that is the only way in which you can advance along democratic lines: not according to impracticable dogma, but according to the principle of adapting yourself all the time to changing circumstances. But that is probably an idea which is too subtle for them to understand.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wolmaransstad also wanted to know what our attitude was to the film which we all saw this morning. I do not know why he asked that question because what we think of it was put so clearly by the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant). He said that that was analogous to the type of speech which was being made by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). That shows what we think of it! There is nothing more to it. [Interjections.] If we on this side do not appear to be so shocked by this picture as members on the other side are, it is because we are already so accustomed to the type of bias which we saw this morning, by the type of speeches we hear from members on the other side. When they compare the United Party with an organization such as Poqo, I say it is going further than this film went to-day. It is as totally biased as unreal as this picture was. But I leave this matter there.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to the Budget. The kindest thing that one can say about this Budget is that it was better than last year&#x2019;s Budget. But then, last year&#x2019;s Budget was not really a very good one because all the mistakes the Minister made then he admitted this year. My time is limited but I still should like to give him only two examples. This year the Minister has said that we must cut taxes and for the very good reason that there is not enough purchasing power or demand in the country. But if that is so this year, then surely it was the more so last year. On the Minister&#x2019;s own showing the economy was more depressed last year than it is now. Surely that is all the more reason why he should have done it last year. Then there is this other important innovation in this Budget, namely that the Minister is swinging a large proportion of current expenditure to loan account. Surely, if that is the right thing to do this year&#x2014;and we say it is&#x2014;it was even more so last year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>But only on a very minute scale. Let us compare the situation of this year with that of last year. Last year we stood before an era of greatly expanding liquidity in our economy. Therefore, it was all the more reason for the Minister to have financed as much of his current expenditure out of loan funds as was reasonable. This year the Minister himself admits that this year our liquidity is diminishing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>What is the difference between taking money from loan funds or out of taxation as far as spending power is concerned?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>That depends upon circumstances, i.e. upon how much loanable money there is available. The fact of the matter is that at this stage last year there was more loanable money available than there is at this stage. So that if it is correct to follow that procedure this year, it would have been more correct to do it last year. This is one instance of the Minister not wanting to admit last year that our criticism was correct. If I remember correctly, he said last year when he had to reply to our criticism that there was really nothing to answer! But what is he doing now? He is tacitly accepting our criticism of last year! But this criticism was even more valid last year than it is this year.</p>

<p>But we must be thankful for small mercies. The fact that the Minister has accepted our criticism, even though it was more valid last year than this year, does not mean that we are against this change of direction. The economic fertilizer which the Minister now seeks to spread over the economic garden of South Africa, could have been spread with far more usefulness last year. But we must still ask ourselves whether he is now using the correct type of fertilizer and in the correct quantity. Is he using it for the right places? Before answering these questions, let us put to ourselves what the Americans call &#x201C;the 64-dollar question&#x201D;, namely &#x201C;what is wrong in the garden of Eden&#x201D;? That ought to be the real question. But here again the Minister has been very helpful because he has, to a large extent, already answered that question himself. He pointed out that what was basically wrong with South Africa was that our economic growth was too slow, too slow in relation to our economic potentialities. In fact, he has admitted, although very guardedly, the criticism which we have expressed during the past four years, namely that our purchasing power was too low, investment was too low and that our economic growth was too low. The effect of that on the people of South Africa is, of course, that their standards of living are either rising too slowly, or in many cases are stagnant. Another result was that we did not <span class="col_3665-3666" refersTo="page_0407"/>create sufficient jobs for our rapidly expanding population.</p>

<p>But I do not want to blame the Minister&#x2019;s Budget entirely for this state his garden is in, because he is in this unfortunate position that he has to garden in a most inhospitable political climate. That is his real trouble. Let me give him one example of that. If he would trace our economic history of the past, he would find that the main component of our growth was Black labour. If he studies our economic growth of the past, he will find that whenever South Africa grew rapidly, we had to bring in a large amount of Black labour. Now he is committed to a policy of restricting that Black labour if not to reversing it. To talk in botanical terms, Mr. Speaker, that is equivalent to a gardener deciding that he cannot do with carbon in his plants anymore! The Minister must remember that plant life is, to a large extent, dependent on carbon because it gives the plant its structure. In the same way, our whole economy is dependent upon Black labour. And yet he is committed to a policy for restricting the use of that Black labour or for even taking it out of our economy altogether. Now if a gardener said he was going to take carbon out of his plants, people would think he was a bit scatty.</p>

<p>But yet the Minister is in a more favourable position than most gardeners in that whereas gardeners can do very little about the climate, he is in a position to influence that climate if he wishes to do so. I say that what is basically wrong with us, and that the Minister has admitted, is that our rate of economic growth is far too slow in relation to our potentialities. We are not providing sufficient jobs for the people. It has been one of the great myths of the Government, usually repeated most emphatically by the Minister and Deputy-Minister of Economic Affairs, that thanks to the Nationalist Government coming into power in 1948. we have had one of the most remarkable economic growths in the world. I think that is a fair summing up of the attitude of hon. members on the other side. But what are the facts? If we look up the facts, we find that far from having had a remarkable rate of economic growth, the opposite has happened. I should like to refer the Minister to calculations made in the &#x201C;Commercial Opinion&#x201D; of November, 1962, based on our official statistics of national income. There he will find that from 1912 to 1953&#x2014;i.e. the first four decades of the existence of the Union of South Africa, we had a rate of growth which very nearly doubled the standard of living of the people&#x2014;in other words their real income more or less doubled itself. That means that the wealth and welfare of the people increased at a rate of 2&#x007C; per cent per annum. That was one of the fastest rates in the world, if not the fastest. I am unaware of any other Western country which have had this fabulous rate of growth over that period. We doubled the standard of living within 40 years. But what has happened since? When this Government took over in 1948, we were growing at a rate of about 3 per cent per annum real income per head. Through the momentum which was thereby imparted to the economy by the United Party Government, the Nationalist Party Government managed to keep up that rate for exactly five years, i.e. up to 1953 when we still continued to grow at the rate of 3 per cent. I am, of course, talking of real income per head. But what has happened since 1953? During the last ten years our rate of growth dropped from being the highest in the entire Western world to one of the lowest in the world, i.e. to a rate of 1&#x002B; per cent per annum. Other countries with rates as low as ours, are very perturbed about it&#x2014;countries like the United Kingdom and America. They realize that they are losing the economic race in the world, and that if they loose the economic race, they will loose the military race.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>What is happening in West Germany? Are they maintaining their rate of growth?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>It dropped but is still more than twice as fast as ours&#x2014; more than twice. For the last year, it was still of the order of 5 per cent. At any rate, it is still incredibly higher than ours.</p>

<p>So this myth that thanks to a strong Nationalist Government we have a healthy economy, reminds me of a story I heard many years ago of a boy at school who was asked by his teacher who created the ox. He replied that his father did so. The teacher then said he was wrong because it was the Creator who created the ox. Thereupon the little boy said the teacher was wrong because, he said, the Creator created the bull, whereas his father created the ox. Now, this Government can be taken to be the creator of our economy in exactly the same sense as the farmer. We had an economy of great vitality. But what have we got now? An economy that plods along with no real future. One should never cry over spilt milk, but it is interesting to note that were we able to maintain the rate of growth which obtained in 1948, dire poverty amongst our non-Whites would have largely been wiped out just as in the period from 1912 to 1953 poor Whitism was wiped out completely. Mr. Rupert said in Pretoria very recently that the greatest antidote to Communism was prosperity, prosperity which was shared by all sections. As I could gather from remarks which were made by the Minister of Justice and by the Prime Minister, most members opposite believe that you must fight Communism by an extension of the rule of &#x201C;un &#x2019;&#x2019;-law; in other words, you must constantly restrict the application of the rule of law.</p>

<p>Shared prosperity, Mr. Speaker, is the answer to Communism. Now. to what extent has our prosperity been shared in our society? In this connection, I should like to refer the Minister to one of the most interesting articles which has appeared recently in the <i>S.A. Journal <span class="col_3667-3668" refersTo="page_0408"/>of Economics</i> of June 1962. This article was written under the heading &#x201C;Bantu wages in South Africa&#x201D;, by the Chairman of the Wage Board. On page 96 you will find what I can only call &#x201C;alarming&#x201D; figures of the rate at which real wages have increased for the various races in private industry, over the period 1936 to 1961. Between 1936 and 1948, i.e. under a United Party Government, wages increased 34 per cent for White workers or at an annual rate of about 3 per cent per annum. During the same period Bantu wages increased by 65 per cent, i.e. at a rate of per cent per annum one of the highest rates in the world. The gap between skilled and unskilled wages were therefore being closed rapidly. But what happened in the ensuing 13 years? During the period 1948 to 1961, White wages increased by 32 per cent, i.e. not quite so fast as in the United Party days. But what was the position with Bantu wages? Bantu wages increased only by 11 per cent during that same period, i.e. not even 1 per cent per annum! Is that shared prosperity? Is that the way in which we are going to fight Communism? And what is more, it is amazing that the major portion of this increase of 11 per cent took place during the past two years, i.e. since the troubles of Langa and Sharpeville.</p>

<p>In that same article the Minister will find that the same type of trend took place in commerce. As a matter of fact, the Chambers of Commerce pointed to another alarming fact, namely that between 1951 and 1961 real wages of the Bantu on Railways dropped from R260 to R233. Let us reflect once more that were we able to maintain the rate of increase in this respect which applied between 1936 and 1948, then the poverty amongst Bantu industrial wages, as measured against Western standards, would now have been a thing of the past. And the facts indicate that the White workers would not have suffered as a result because in reality you cannot have a rapid rise in wages of Whites if there is not a corresponding rapid increase in the wages of unskilled workers. Certainly our farmers would have been far better off because they would then not have had these vast surpluses they are saddled with to-day. Also our industrial and commercial people would have been better off.</p>

<p>In the long run no nation can have sustained prosperity unless that prosperity is spread over all sections of the people. That is shown by the experience of countries all over the world. One of the reasons for this crisis in our purchasing power in South Africa is the inequality of the advance in the position of skilled and unskilled workers. That is one of the main reasons. Think of the advantages a rise in Bantu wages of another 50 per cent will hold out for our Minister of Foreign Affairs and our Minister of Information. It is ironical that if you wish to defend South Africa against the outside world to-day one of the best defences is to compare the standard of living of our Bantu with those in other parts of Africa. While it is true that the standard of living of our Bantu is incomparably higher, the ironical thing is that the United Party is largely responsible for that, because it was attained under a United Party Government. That then is another example of this Government defending its policies with the results of United Party performances!</p>

<p>We on this side are the first to admit that we cannot have full trade union development for many years yet in this country because so many of our people still are in a primitive stage of development. You cannot, therefore, have trade unions in the normal Western sense for these. But that is all the more reason why the Government should follow a definite income policy. If they claim to be the guardian of the unorganized worker, then surely it is their duty to see that those who do not have bargaining power get their fair share of our prosperity.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>The case of the gold mines is different and the Minister must not try to distract me. But if they can increase their wages, let them do so. If ever there were a country needing an income policy, it is this country. The aim of that should be to see that our prosperity is equally shared. That will be another powerful antidote to Communism. And if we really want to fight Communism. there is the necessity of creating jobs for the people. We should not become a nation of unemployed. Sufficient jobs should, therefore, be created for all. But what has happened? It seems that until 1957 our economy was moving at a rate which could absorb any increase in population. But since then we have had stagnation. Any objective observer has to admit that we are simply not creating sufficient jobs for our rapidly increasing population. The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) already pointed out that during the past 4 years our labour force must have increased by the order of 10 per cent whereas our employment index show that employment rose by only 4 per cent. Surely here is proof that we are not developing fast enough to give employment to all our workers.</p>

<p>I know that the Minister pointed out that unemployment dropped by 34 per cent during the last 12 months. But these figures are confined only to Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics, and then only to those who bothered to register.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<p>I used the same yardstick last year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>The fact of the matter is that the registered unemployed is only a fraction of the total number of unemployed in this country. Even the Minister did not refer to Bantu unemployed. We know, however, that we do not have comprehensive figures in this respect. But as for Coloured, Asiatics and <span class="col_3669-3670" refersTo="page_0409"/>Whites frequently only those who stand to benefit by unemployment payments, bother to register. A very large number of unemployed do not under these circumstances register at all. There is no advantage to them in doing so. In fact, that is to their disadvantage because they cannot get jobs as quickly. Let us take unemployment amongst the Bantu. The Bantu is, after all, still a part of our population&#x2014;we have not made them foreigners yet. Now, the register show that there are 74,000 unemployed. However, in a survey which was carried out by the Department of Native Affairs, which the Chairman of the Wage Board referred to that indicated there were no less than 200,000 adult male Natives unemployed as squatters in rural areas and 160,000 juvenile and adult males unemployed in the urban areas. That gives a total number of 360,000 unemployed. So when hon. members opposite talk about us having the lowest unemployment figures in the world, they do that by shutting their eyes to the unemployment amongst our non-Europeans in the country because if we take these into account we will have one of the highest rates of unemployment in the world. It is against this background &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is an estimate made by the Native Affairs Department. It is against this background that we have to judge this Budget. It is quite clear that the Minister&#x2019;s main objective should have been to accelerate economic growth as far as possible. I admit that it is not enough to have a good Budget to restore confidence in this country. We will have to undo so many of the restrictive racial laws which have been passed over the last 14 years because it is the cumulative effect of those laws that has destroyed confidence so largely in South Africa. Even within those limits I think the Minister, had he been more optimistic, should have tried through his Budget to stimulate our economic growth more. It is amazing that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council talks about economic budgeting, and the Minister ignores it. By economic budgeting I understand that the Government set itself a target, the rate at which the economy should be capable of growing. The Minister of Finance must indicate that target and budget accordingly.</p>

<p>If one is to judge from the tax estimates for the next year the Minister does not expect rapid economic growth next year. If one is to judge from the tax estimates he does not even expect the economic growth over the last year to be maintained because he budgets for an increase of R26,000,000 compared with the real increase of last year of the order of R57,000,000. Does the Minister expect the growth to slow down? Had the Minister budgeted for a much bigger national income he could have given even more tax concessions. He could have given the full R36,000,000 as the hon. member for Constantia suggested. He could have increased the wages of the unskilled labourers of whom there are hundreds and thousands on the Railways. The Minister is obviously afraid of inflation if he gives too many tax concessions and if he increases wages too much. But, Sir, you only get inflation if your rate of growth is not fast enough. Surely the Minister realizes that? If you have a rapid rate of growth you cover your extra expenditure out of that growth; you do not have to increase your rates and taxes. I sometimes think that this Government&#x2019;s policies scare this Minister almost more than they scare me. I remember last year suggesting to the Minister that he should budget for a national income increase of 10 per cent. He pooh-poohed the idea and told me that I was irresponsible and that it would lead to inflation. Sir, what growth have we really had? We have had a growth of 7 per cent. I suggest to the Minister that he had followed my advice he would probably had had a growth of 10 per cent. If you look at the figures for last year that Budget was not a stimulating Budget at all. What stimulated growth was the rapid rise in gold production and the fact that exports kept up very well. That was the real stimulant to the economy not the Minister&#x2019;s Budget. I suggest that had the Minister shown more confidence he could have cut taxes more; he could have increased the wages. That would have been an active contribution on the part of the Budget to a long-term income policy anyway. If the Minister sets an example to all private employers and to the gold mines that he mentioned himself, by increasing the wages of their own unskilled employees he will be setting a very fine example. It has been shown over and over again that if you get the economic growth by cutting tax rates and by increasing wages it does not lead to inflation. You only get inflation if you do not have economic growth and the Government expands its expenditure to a great extent. It is quite a simple question: You increase your demand and if your supply on the other side increases proportionately you do not have inflation. So I do not think the Minister must make the mistake of staring himself blind at the marginal gold mines. He must not be afraid to encourage the economic growth fast enough.</p>

<p>I also want to suggest that if the Minister really had confidence in South Africa he should have done something to relax capital control even further. Surely the Minister realizes that despite the superficial talk of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs and the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs that we are now very largely independent of foreign capital, for really rapid economic growth we still need foreign capital in large doses. The moment we start growing rapidly we will <span class="col_3671-3672" refersTo="page_0410"/>see that need all the more. You are not going to get this flow of capital in large amounts unless you relax control. We were told by the previous speaker that there was industrial expansion, that confidence had returned completely and that millions of pounds were again flowing into South Africa. Why did the Government not show a corresponding confidence and relax capital control to some extent? I cannot quote it to the Minister, because of the shortness of the time at my disposal, but I suggest to him that if he wants to read a very interesting article he should read the article by Brand from the Pretoria University in the <i>South African Economic Journal</i> of December 1962 in which he shows the whole fallacy of this idea that we can be independent of foreign capital if we really want to grow fast economically. The moment we start growing fast economically there will be such a demand for capital goods that we will again need foreign capital, apart from the know-how and the experience and the skilled labour that comes in with such capital.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Speaker, the Minister and the Prime Minister showed some concern. The only bottle-neck in our economy, as they pointed out, that might lead to inflation was skilled labour. It is rather ironical to think that those two gentlemen are largely responsible for the shortage of skilled labour because they killed our immigration policy. Even so, I say that if we really grow rapidly enough economically we will get the skilled labour from overseas. It is again a question of confidence. I do not know of a single industrialist who, when he really required skilled labour from overseas and went to the trouble of advertising, did not get that skilled labour in the end. There again I think the Minister must show slightly more confidence. I can just sum up this Budget as a Budget which reflects the lack of confidence of the Minister in the future growth of South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SOUTH WEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I could not quite grasp the joke of the hon. member about the bull and the ox, but I take it that he meant that if they had introduced this Budget it would have been a bull of a Budget, but now that the Nationalist Government has introduced it it is a budget which lacks certain essential organs. I can just say that my experience as a farmer&#x2014;and I am certain that the experience of my hon. friends who are farmers will be the same&#x2014;is that when one wants to turn a bad bull into something good one must make him an ox.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, two years ago when the Government decided to hold an election it was accused by the Opposition of having been compelled to hold an election at that time, because if it allowed this House to live its normal life, which meant up to 1963, the country&#x2019;s economic position would be so bad that the Government would not dare to hold an election because it would already have lost it. We have now reached the year in which we would normally have held an election. I think it is also admitted by hon. members opposite that the economic position of the country to-day is particularly rosy. It is said that the tempo of economic growth has slowed down. I do not want to argue about that; the hon. the Minister will surely deal with that. I can just say this, however, that we can consider ourselves fortunate to be able to live in a country with such a flourishing economy.</p>

<p>I should like to congratulate the hon. the Minister and the Government on the Budget they have introduced. I almost want to say that it was a bull of a budget. This Budget affects South West Africa directly and indirectly. It is true that South West Africa controls its own finances, but there are many measures adopted here which directly affect it. I am thinking of customs and excise. When customs and excise dues are increased here, they must also be increased in South West Africa; when they are reduced here they are also reduced there. Therefore we will now reap the benefit of the reduction in the price of petrol and crude oil. That will mean much to South West Africa because it is a country of long distances where transportation is one of the most expensive items in the economic life of South West Africa.</p>

<p>Another thing which is integrated is our transportation system. When concessions are granted here in regard to transportation it also affects South West. We have the Railways, the Airways and the Road Motor Services. I can assure hon. members that when a concession is granted here we are only too grateful. Another thing that affects us is pensions. South West in fact pays for the pensions of its officials and for old-age pensions, but when an increase is granted in pensions here it must also be granted there. So the pensioners there also derive benefit from the increase granted here. Then there are salaries. When salaries are increased here, for officials or for teachers, we in South West Africa must adapt ourselves to that because our public <span class="col_3673-3674" refersTo="page_0411"/>service is integrated with that of the Republic. Although our education is not directly integrated with education in the Republic, we must follow suit when teachers&#x2019; salaries are increased here, otherwise we simply will not get any teachers. The education system as a whole is integrated with that of the Republic. We have the same curricula; we send our children to the universities, the colleges, the technical colleges and the technical schools of the Republic. Whenever any concession is made here which improves the position of those institutions, we benefit directly.</p>

<p>Where we are integrated even more is in the marketing of our products. The position to-day is that the dairy products of South West are pooled with those of the Republic and are marketed by the Republic. South West Africa is subject to the levies and contributes its share to the pool and to the funds which are levied. South West Africa derives advantage from the marketing facilities offered here, and we are very grateful for it. We bear our burdens, but we also derive benefits. Something which is of great importance to us is the marketing of our meat which intimately integrated with the marketing of meat in the Republic by means of legislation passed by this House and also by the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa. I will go so far as to say that if South West Africa was not allowed to market its meat in the Republic, we would certainly have great trouble. If we had to be dependent on an overseas market only, we would, for example, during the period when we had foot-and-mouth disease, not have been able to market a single carcass on the overseas market. It is therefore a great concession made to us and a great privilege we have to be able to market our meat in the Republic. In spite of all the difficulties we had during the past year, we were still able to send 200,000 cattle to the markets in the Republic. There was a backlog of over 100,000 head of cattle from the previous year, and for this year it is anticipated that 300,000 head of cattle will be available, with the result that in the coming year we will have about 400,000 head of cattle available for marketing in the Republic. I foresee trouble, Sir, if everything possible is not done by the bodies responsible for marketing. I may say that delegates from South West and I to-day together had consultations with both the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and with their technical men. I may say that we were received with the greatest sympathy, and that I have confidence that the necessary measures will be taken shortly to comply as far as possible with our requirements in regard to the marketing of cattle from South West Africa. I understand, of course, that it is not possible to over-stock the market and to send all those animals there simultaneously without lowering prices appreciably. But I want to appeal to the farmers in the Republic to realize that South West Africa is not a separate area and that its farmers are not a separate community, but that we are one community in so far as the marketing of our meat is concerned, and that they should not feel that South West Africa is encroaching on their markets, and that they should give us the opportunity to market our animals in the way they market theirs, because we have become a single unit in so far as marketing is concerned. We are already restricted because South West Africa is subject to a quota, and at the moment we can sell our animals in only two places, whilst the farmers of the Republic are free to market their animals anywhere. They do not need permits and have no quotas and they can market when and where they like. We also had the opportunity to abolish quotas and permits, and South West Africa would have been able to do it, but there were other practical difficulties which prevented us from doing so in the interest of the farmers and also of other organizations concerned with it. Therefore I just want to express the hope that the measures which have now been effected will prove to be successful.</p>

<p>I just want to direct one appeal to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. I am aware of the fact that he has appointed a Committee, a Cold Storage and Abattoir Committee, to investigate the possibility of providing refrigeration space and storage facilities. I should appreciate it if that Committee could speed up their work. I know that it is a difficult and comprehensive task which has been entrusted to them, but our need for these things is so great that I do hope the Minister will see to it that this Committee completes its work as soon as possible. I have the fullest confidence that they will be able to make recommendations which will alleviate our position.</p>

<p>The marketing of meat takes place from day to day, from month to month and from year to year; now you have shortages and then you have to cope with surpluses; you have to contend with droughts and you have to cope with food-and-mouth disease; you are concerned with control and with restrictions that you may not be aware of in advance. Therefore it is impossible to say that a method should now be evolved which for all time will ensure that there will never be a shortage or a surplus.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to take up too much of the time of the House, but I do feel there is a matter I would like to touch on to indicate to hon. members, particularly the farmer members in the House, the number of problems a person has to cope with when he is suddenly affected by the elements of nature. I made a speech here last year in which I referred to the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in South West Africa, and how it affected us. I am now able to say that the campaign waged against foot-and-mouth disease in South West is the biggest one of its kind that has ever been waged in any part of the world. I also believe that it was most successful. I do not think that more success has been <span class="col_3675-3676" refersTo="page_0412"/>achieved in auy other campaign than was achieved in South West Africa. I am able to say that to-day there no longer is any active foot-and-mouth infection in South West Africa, thanks to the efforts of everybody concerned with it, the South West African Administration, the Agricultural Department of South West and its officials, as well as the Department of Agricultural Technical Services of the Republic, under the leadership of the Minister. There was the closest and heartiest co-operation, between all these various bodies. Neither time nor money was spared in combating this dangerous disease. Nor was it merely a question of money I may inform the House that this campaign has cost South West Africa close on R5,000,000 up to new in direct expenditure which cannot be recouped. That is expenditure in respect of payment for mileage travelled, vaccines, inspections, vehicles, and roads which were made. That is really money cast into the water, because it can never be recouped. Then there was also indirect expenditure. When such an epidemic strikes, things happen which could never have been predicted, and which have to be dealt with. Marketing immediately comes to a standstill; the income of the farmers is stopped; animals may not be moved. And if in addition one has a drought there is the danger that the animals will all die on the farm. And when one has to, or is allowed to, move the animals, it may not be done on the hoof but must be done by transporting them. Fodder must be supplied if the farmers cannot trek. One must put up camps and erect fences to keep out the game. I may just say that in South West Africa we erected more than 1,000 miles of fences to keep out the game&#x2014;8 feet 6 inches in height, with 16 strands. That was certainly no small task. I saw the other day that such a great fuss was being made of the fact that 350 miles of fences had been erected along the Kruger National Park. Sir, that is child&#x2019;s play compared to what we did in South West. It is indeed asking a great deal to have a farmer collect all his animals for inspection every fortnight, particularly when the animals are in poor condition. Stock sales came to a standstill, and the farmers&#x2019; credit at the banks was exhausted. The Administration was faced with a task which would normally have proved impossible, but the Administration tackled that task, and thanks to the assistance of everybody concerned we succeeded in bringing our farmers through that period. The revenue of the Administration suffered because the interest and instalments of farmers who owed money to the Land Board were suspended, because the interest and instalments of the Land Bank were suspended. The Administration lent the banks R2,000,000 to assist them in not curtailing the credit of the farmers. Hundreds of thousands of rand were left to the co-operatives, to assist them so that they would not stop the credit of the farmers. Hundreds of thousands of rand were lent to the canning factories to assist them in slaughtering the animals and canning the meat. No money was spared, Sir, to assist the farmers. I may say that we have now been blessed with splendid rains; the farmers are smiling again and their prospects are bright. Nothing gladdens the heart of a farmer more than rain. They have big debts, but I know the farmers of South West, and of South Africa. We need not be afraid of losing a penny of the money lent to them. We give them time and they will pay their debts. They will get on their feet again, and again become prosperous farmers in South West Africa.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a final point, and I want to address my remarks to the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services. He announced last year that he was busy establishing a research station specially adapted for research in regard to combating foot-and-mouth disease. I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to tell us how much progress has been made. I may say that we were reasonably successful in regard to the vaccine we used in South West Africa, but we are not convinced that it was 100 per cent successful. In some cases we had to inoculate twice. But it is as a result of using that vaccine that to-day we have managed to overcome that disease. If I may issue a word of warning, it is that the hon. the Minister should do everything in his power to have an effective vaccine developed as soon as possible against this dreaded disease. It is not impossible for it to break out again; it is not impossible for it to cross the borders, and to break out in the heart of South Africa. I think it is a tremendous achievement that we succeeded in not allowing a single animal to enter the Republic to spread foot-and-mouth disease here. I must say, Mr. Speaker, that our people did not always accept these control measures with a smile. It has already been said that the veterinarians to-day rule South West Africa, but as one who has knowledge of this matter I must say that, however hard it may be, one must abide by the advice given by the technicians. When eventually success has been achieved, one is glad that one did so.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by expressing my thanks to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and his Department for what they did, and to the Government of the Republic for the contributions it made. Once again, my heartiest thanks to the hon. the Minister of Finance for the concessions he granted which are applicable also to South West Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. KOTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if there is one thing that has become very clear to me in this debate it is the unwillingness on the part of hon. members opposite to take part in an agricultural debate. We have been discussing agricultural matters for the whole afternoon and since a quarter past two only one single member on the other side has participated in the debate. I give credit to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk)&#x2014;I am sorry that she is not here at the moment&#x2014;for having done so. The hon. members who usually talk about agricultural <span class="col_3677-3678" refersTo="page_0413"/>matters are not here. Where is the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) who viewed the matter in such a serious light that earlier this Session he moved a motion of no confidence in our two Ministers of Agriculture? Why did the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) not take part in the debate? The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) does have the gumption to be present. It seems as though he will fight the matter to the bitter end.</p>

<p>It is a pity Mr. Speaker, that when one discusses agricultural matters one does not have people before one who differ from one in regard to this matter. I just want to say that to generalize in a debate is a dangerous thing but to generalize under the Agricultural Vote is far more dangerous. That is the mistake made by hon. members opposite. There has not been a definite attack on this side of the House in regard to some or the other commodity or in regard to some matter or other so that we can debate the matter and so that the hon. the Minister can reply and make a statement to the country. That simply has not happened. It has so often happened this year that hon. members have generalized and said that the prices of products have been falling, but that has merely been generalization.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. KOTZE</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member was a farmer his experience would be just the opposite. If he tells me that meat prices are falling, if he says that the grading is incorrect, if he says that the producer&#x2019;s price is incorrect or that the consumer&#x2019;s price is wrong then we can argue. If he has something to say about the wheat price we can argue, but the hon. member makes use of generalities; that is the way hon. members on that side attack the Department of Agriculture. This illustrates one of two things, Mr. Speaker; a total inability to make a point or else an unsympathetic attitude towards the matter. So unsympathetic, that the hon. member does not even have to think about the matter for a while to find out where the fault lies.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakenberg said a few things in passing that I want to deal with briefly. Contrary to expectations, the hon. member was a little more careful at the start. She said amongst other things that things were going badly with everyone except with the wool farmers. But that is not true, Mr. Speaker. There was another statement that she made. She said that the farmers were left to their own fate. That is simply not true, Mr. Speaker. In the short time at my disposal I just want to mention a few examples which hold good for the whole country. This is in support of what I said about the generalizations of hon. members opposite in their attack on the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. It was stated in the no-confidence debate that there was no planning, that there was no research. I want to take my own constituency. Take for example the basic research that is done in connection with the skin industry. What a wonderful dividend this has produced for the farmers! Do you know what prices we are getting to-day as a result of that research and guidance given to the farmer? Does this look as though the farmer has been left to his fate? Does this look as though things are going badly with all the farmers, except the wool farmers? Skin prices were never as high in the history of the industry in the Republic of South Africa than they were at the most recent auctions.</p>

<p>I want to make a further point apropos the remarks of the hon. member for Drakensberg who said that farmers were left to their fate by the Departments of Agriculture. You know, we have already had quite a few years of drought and the karakul ewes now producing these skins were bred over a period of 25 to 30 years. When the drought was at its worst it was this Government and these Departments of Agriculture that stepped in when those animals were threatened with complete extermination. These Departments and the Government stepped in and supplied them with water and transported them right across the northwest Cape. The Department also supplied them with water in the Kalahari otherwise they would have died. It is those same ewes which are producing the results and the dividends for us to-day because the Government did not leave the farmer in the lurch. I mention this as further proof that things are not going well with the wool farmers only but they are also going as well with the karakul skin farmers as never before in the history of the skin industry.</p>

<p>But I have not yet finished. I want to return to the statement that the farmers were left in the lurch. When we had difficulty in cultivating cotton along the Orange River and when the factories could not take all our cotton, research was applied and a new cotton was cultivated along the Orange River by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. When the cotton market overseas collapsed because of subsidized cotton with which we could not compete after having being able to compete on equal terms in the past, and when we could not dispose of the cotton, it was this Government that did not leave the cotton farmer and the cotton industry in the lurch. Because of negotiations between the textile industrialists and the Department, the cotton growers along the Orange River are paid a price which is as high as has ever been the case before in normal marketing years. Not only has the farmer not been left in the lurch&#x2014;which was the wild allegation of the hon. member for Drakensberg&#x2014;but progress has also been made by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services to enable the farmer to obtain two crops on one morgen of land each year. He first plants wheat and then he can plant a quick-growing cotton on the same lands. In this way he gets two crops from the same piece of land. Does this indicate that the farmers have been left in the lurch? It shows the hollowness of that argument and <span class="col_3679-3680" refersTo="page_0414"/>also shows that not only are the wool farmers paid a good price, but the cotton farmer is paid a reasonable price too. Things are not so easy, but the price is still better than the price for lucerne or anything else, except sultanas.</p>

<p>This brings me to another point. In order to prove how wild and far fetched the allegations of the hon. member are, I want to say that when we had trouble with our sultana production in 1958 because of frost, the farmers simply went on planting at that stage although they were continually suffering setbacks. But then we called in research. Once again the Department of Agricultural Technical Services in co-operation with the Dried Fruit Control Board did research in connection with the combating of frost and since 1958 frost damage has become a thing of the past and frost is being effectively combated. Since that time production has risen from 2,700 tons to 4,700 tons which was the figure for last season. During the previous season the farmers along the Orange River made an average of R686 per morgen, and this included all the recent plantings, all the land which was added and which was not then in full production. R686 per morgen throughout the whole area! But I want to mention a few exceptional cases, where over three years farmers have shown an average yield of R 1,400 per morgen! And then hon. members say that this Government has left the farmers in the lurch, has left them to their fate, and they say that it is only the wool farmers who can make a good living! What a far-fetched thing to say in a serious debate, in a responsible Chamber like the House of Assembly of South Africa! This is what one finds when people who merely stare blindly at one aspect of the matter take part in a debate. What they contend is not true. I thought that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) would say I was wrong when I referred to the meat prices, but he was silent. I thought that I could provoke him but he remained silent.</p>

<p>I want to raise a matter which has always been a source of friction in connection with the marketing of meat. I must raise this point because apparently we cannot expect any constructive criticism from the other side. If we have to depend upon the criticism of the Opposition then I feel sorry for South Africa. There is one point in regard to which we have always had trouble and that is the very large number of grades that we have. We have said that this simply does not work. The consumers never derive any benefit from it nor do the farmers; the advantage of the system disappears somewhere along the line. I am pleased to be able to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing this evening on the fact that the large number of grades are gradually being done away with. What has happened? As far as lamb is concerned, prime and super grade have been grouped into one grade, and nobody can complain in this regard. It is one grade lower. In the case of mutton we also have the grouping of the super and prime grades into one prime grade. As far as beef is concerned two grades have also been grouped together; grades four and five have been grouped together as one grade and as far as pork is concerned, grades three and four have been grouped into one grade&#x2014;a third grade. This shows that progress is also being made in this regard. We are gradually following a policy of adjustment to see what can be done and what is best for the country.</p>

<p>In this connection I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. I see that the meat committee made representations to the Minister saying that where we have to deal with a levy of 90c for 100 lbs. of meat, lightweight or heavyweight, this is not sufficient and that the levy on the heavier carcasses should be increased. I do not want to tell the hon. the Minister not to consider this request but I want to ask him not to agree to it. My view is that this must simply not be done because all my lamb carcasses which were objected to on the grounds that they were overweight were sold this year at 25c, 24c and 23c on the open market. I think the lowest price that I got was 20c on the open market. They say that they buy up this meat but they did not buy up one of those carcasses. That is why I say I cannot see why the levy should not be calculated on a sliding scale. Let it stay as it is although I would like to see the levy on the lightweight carcasses removed. I also want to make another request. Although slaughterings are gradually increasing, it is noticeable that there has been no increase per unit consumption on the part of the public; the position is rather static; unit consumption dropped by about 1 lb. of meat from 1960 to 1961. That is why I want to ask that when this sort of thing is done the Meat Board must remember that it has to follow a long-term scheme which will stimulate consumption on the part of the broad mass of the public. The system that they are now considering will certainly not stimulate it. Statistics show that the consumption of beef has increased because&#x2014;this is my conclusion&#x2014;there are cheaper cuts. I want to make another request. I want to say that we have to deal with a marketing problem in this country. We are looking for markets internally or outside of the country while we have a broad mass of the people on our doorstep who can consume very much more meat. At the moment the consumption stands at an average of 5 oz. per day. That is why in determining the price of meat we should rather follow a system which is aimed at the expansion of the internal market so that the farmers will have a larger market. It will not help at all if the price is increased out of all proportion and we find ourselves with no market. People will eat more fish and then we will have to be satisfied with a smaller market. That is not a sound policy to follow, and so I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to accede to the request of the meat committee which is again trying to impose a higher levy on the heavyweight carcasses.</p>

<p><span class="col_3681-3682" refersTo="page_0415"/>My time is very limited but there is another point that I want to make. The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) moved a motion of no-confidence in the Ministers of Agriculture during the course of this Session. He is so interested in the discussion of agricultural matters that he is not present here at all. The hon. member made a wild statement to the effect that farmers must be satisfied with 40c for first grade lucerne because of a drop in prices. But that is simply not true. The hon. member ought to make sure of his facts. We have a lucerne industry committee which fixes lucerne prices. There was an underwriting of 6d. by one co-operative but the co-operative of which I am a member and which easily handles 50 per cent of the industrial lucerne of the country never paid out less than 6s. 6d. and 7s. 6d. per 100 lbs. during 1961 and 1962 while the maximum price was fixed at 7s. 9d. for first grade lucerne. If there is a surplus of plus/minus 60,000 tons it is not too bad. The hon. member launched an attack on the Minister in moving this motion of no-confidence and then he based his arguments on wrong information. His informant gave him the wrong information. That was not the right thing to do. How can an Opposition make use of such arguments to make out a case against our Ministers? My Chief Whip has warned me that my time is up, but I hope that the House will concede me this last remark.</p>

<p>I live in an area which is subject to drought and I know what our farmers have gone through. I would like to elaborate in this regard but time does not allow me to do so at the moment. I want to express my thanks to the hon. the Minister of Finance for the sizable amount that he has made available for the rehabilitation of farmers because there are farmers in that area living on farms which have had little or no rain for eight years. Only the desert wind blows there. The farmers are trekking. Some of them have only been on their farms for three months out of a period of six years. That is why I want to express my sincere thanks to the hon. the Minister of Finance for having made such a generous amount available for rehabilitation purposes.</p>

<p>We have almost reached the end of the Budget debate for 1963. We like very much to listen to the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje). He is a person who came to this House with a reputation as an economist and in the few years that he has been in this House he has proved to us that he is very interested in economics and in the meantime has built up a reputation for himself in that when he makes a speech, he proves that he has considered his case and that he has made a study of his subject. But we want to issue a warning to the hon. member for Jeppes this evening. He is a young member and this warning may perhaps help him. We want to tell the hon. member for Jeppes that he must be careful not to follow the same path in this House that the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) has followed over the years so that eventually just as little notice of his views and statements in regard to financial matters is taken as is taken in this country to-day of the views of the hon. member for Constantia.</p>

<p>We have had a number of opinions in this regard from other people, from the Press, from financiers and others, but for the sake of the hon. member for Jeppes I want this evening to give him the views of a few people, views to which I am sure the country pays more attention and of which more notice is taken than the views of the hon. member for Jeppes. In the first place I want to refer to a newspaper which is certainly not well disposed towards this Minister and this Government and which often expresses criticism which is not justified, a newspaper which is always on the lookout for something to use against this Government and this Minister. In its issue of 21 March, the day after the Budget was presented, this newspaper announced the Budget in the following terms&#x2014;</p>

<p>Industry, wine farmers, trade unionists and old-age pensioners joined the ordinary taxpayer in welcoming Dr. D&#x00F6;nges&#x2019;s &#x201C;booster&#x201D; Budget, aimed at injecting an additional R13.6 million into the general economy.</p>

<p><span class="col_3683-3684" refersTo="page_0416"/>In spite of the fact that he has provided for a record peacetime expenditure of R157,000,000 on Defence, the Minister has produced a popular Budget, the only criticism so far being that he has not been bold enough and that some of his tax concessions fall short of expectations.</p>

<p>This is a newspaper circulating in the Eastern Cape and the United Party depends upon its support.

This newspaper printed the views of Mr. Meter, President of the Federated Chamber of Industries, and stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Meter said in Cape Town last night that the Chamber welcomed the emphasis the Minister had placed on the need for stimulating consumption and economic growth. The tax relief proposals contained in the Budget were &#x201C;a step in the right direction&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The newspaper also gave the views of Mr. Jan Marais, but I do not think that the party opposite attaches much value to his views because it does not suit them to do so.

<p>The view of this newspaper as far as this Budget is concerned is that it is in the interests of South Africa and that it is welcomed by all sections of society, by the farmers, by the workers, by industrialists and by the Chambers of Commerce. The hon. member for Jeppes did not make any impression in trying to belittle this Budget. I want now to deal with some of his arguments. As an economist and as a person who is used to working with figures, he tried to prove that during the period of office of the National Government, South Africa had not made the progress which was made during the period of office of the United Party or progressed at the same rate. He then showed that for every year during the period of office of the United Party White wages rose by 3 per cent while Bantu wages rose by 5 per cent. He argued that from 1948 to 1961 White wages rose at about the same rate but his objection was that Bantu wages rose only by an average of 1 per cent per annum during that period and he tried to blame the Government for this fact. In the same breath he said that Bantu wages in South Africa should be raised by 50 per cent if we wanted to combat Communism.</p>

I also want to ask the hon. member what the position is on his own farm and in regard to his own employees?

<p>May I put a question to the hon. member? Must I take it then that the hon. member is opposed to an increase in Bantu wages? I said &#x201C;if it rose at the rate&#x2026;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>No, the hon. member cannot draw his own conclusions from my statement that an increase of 50 per cent in the wages of Bantu workers in the agricultural industry will place the agricultural industry in dire straits or suggest that by that I meant that wages should not be increased. Indeed, they are rising steadily. The hon. member must not draw the wrong inferences. I want to deal with another point in regard to his speech. He wanted to suggest that the unemployment figure in South Africa was high and he tried to prove this in pursuance of the fact that Bantu unemployed are not registered. He said that there were 360,000 unemployed Bantu. I want to put this question to him: If his figure is correct is he sure that all of those people need work and that they all want to be employed? Is he aware of the fact that even in our reserves and in cities, there are many of those people who are work-shy, as indeed he said, and who do not want work? He cannot try to suggest that it is the fault of the Government that those people are without work. I want to deal with one last point made by the hon. member. He said that the Minister should have shown more confidence in South Africa and should have relaxed import control. But the hon. member neglected to tell us how much capital he wanted the Government still to invest. How far must the control of capital be relaxed in order to prove the confidence of this Government in South Africa? No, if there is a Government which has confidence in South Africa and has proved it by means of this Budget, by means of the policy it is implementing, by means of the money it has invested in South Africa&#x2014;as has again been illustrated in regard to important schemes like the Orange River scheme, Sasol, Iscor and other expansion that is taking place&#x2014;it is this National Government. It is this National Government that has the confidence of the electorate of South Africa in that at each election the Government is returned to power more strongly. No, as an older member I want to tell the hon. member for Jeppes that he is a member who can be very useful in this House. He has had the proper training for it but the hon. member must not allow the political climate in which he airs his views on the Budget to influence him in such a way that eventually he is not able to give us his real views on the Budget and instead gives us an opinion which is different from the opinion that he would give as the president of the Netherlands Bank. That is all I have to say to the hon. member I come now to the amendment of the hon. member for Constantia the fourth leg of which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Opposition refuses to pass this Budget unless the Government takes steps to resolve the continued crises in agriculture.</block>

<p>When the hon. member for Constantia moved this amendment he said that other members of his party would explain this leg of the amendment. Those of us who are particularly interested in agriculture have sat here now since Monday and in a few minutes time this debate will come to an end. Out of the whole of the United Party which contended that it would gain the support of the farmers by suddenly acting as the champions of the farmers, only one speaker spoke about agriculture&#x2014;the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk), and that hon. member has been conspicuous by her absence this evening. I expect that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) will also participate in this debate and discuss agricultural matters but I want hon. members to note the stage at which he will discuss agriculture. You see, they are so vulnerable when discussing agricultural matters that they see to it that the person who has to speak about agriculture is the last speaker, so that nobody can reply to him. But I want to come back to the hon. member for Drakensberg even though she is not present. Before I deal with her views on agriculture I want to dwell for a few moments on another matter she raised here which has nothing to do with agriculture. She was very indignant here this afternoon because she thought that the hon. the Prime Minister had done her an injustice by saying that she said that when she thought, she thought about White people and not about Kaffirs. The hon. member took particular exception to the fact that the hon. the Prime Minister should have attributed a remark about &#x201C;Kaffirs&#x201D; to her. I want to put this question to hon. members opposite in the absence of the hon. member for Drakensberg: Will they deny that the hon. member for <span class="col_3687-3688" refersTo="page_0418"/>Drakensberg has stated repeatedly and at more than one place that this Government uses the term &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; but that she was taught to talk about the Kaffirs? Will they deny that she has said that this Government is sharing South Africa with the Kaffirs? Will they deny that she and the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) who is also conspicuous by his absence, were the ones to accuse this Government of being &#x201C;Kafferboeties&#x201D;? No, the hon. member for Drakensberg was unnecessarily annoyed and indignant because the hon. the Prime Minister did not do her an injustice.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that was what it really was. She was playing a role and 1 want to predict that this Session will end and when we travel through the platteland again we will find that the hon. member for Drakensberg will again be holding meetings there and 1 predict that her accusation is going to be that it is the members of this Government who are the &#x201C;Kaffirboeties&#x201D; and that they (the Opposition) are the great champions of the Whites. Nobody in this House is impressed by her remarks. The United Party does not impress anyone in this House nor does it impress the electorate. She can go on playing a part but it will make no impression.</p>

<p>I want now to deal with agriculture as such. The hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. G. P. Kotze) has already largely replied to the remarks of the hon. member for Drakensberg, but there are a few misrepresentations or incorrect facts that one cannot allow to pass by unnoticed. The hon. member for Drakensberg said that while this Government is in power it will just mean that the larger the farmers&#x2019; crops are, the sooner they will go bankrupt, because with every large crop that they have there is a larger quantity of maize that has to be exported. The price then falls and those farmers go bankrupt so much sooner. I think that the economy practised by the hon. member for Drakensberg should be dealt with with the contempt that it deserves. I want to ask the hon. member for Jeppes, who is an economist, whether he will not give the hon. member for Drakensberg a few lessons and tell her that the larger the crop, the larger the production per morgen, the lower the price may be but the higher will be the profit.</p>

<p>But there is another matter that she also raised. She said that the Government should fix prices and then she said that when the Government fixed the prices the Minister should ensure that the price was fixed on the basis of production costs plus a minimum wage for the producer. When the hon. the Minister asked her to explain what a minimum wage was, as usual she became highly indignant and told the hon. the Minister how to conduct himself so that she could continue with her speech. But if that is the view of the United Party then we still have the member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) who can explain to us what the policy of the United Party is in regard to this question of the fixing of prices. I am sure that he will not say that the Minister should fix prices because he knows that this does rest with the Minister. I want to ask him whether, if they come into power, the only basis on which his party will fix prices will be on the basis of production costs, irrespective of where those production costs are incurred in producing that product, plus a certain wage, a minimum wage in the words of the hon. member for Drakensberg? Will that be the only consideration?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>It is easy for the hon. member to ask that but I want to ask him whether he wants to maintain the same basis when there are surpluses, irrespective of the size of the surplus? When that surplus has to be exported in order to maintain a consistent internal price, how can they export the surplus at a loss because the price on the world market is below the internal price? How else can they finance this than by means of a Government subsidy? The hon. member has the opportunity to explain this to us. Let us take the case of maize of which we have a surplus. This surplus would have been even larger if it had not been for the drought. If we have to export a large surplus this year and the price of the world market is below the internal price, 50c or 60c below the internal price, and that loss has to be covered by the levy fund to which the consumer, the producer and the Government all contribute, and that loss increases, where will he offload that loss? Will it be only on the consumer? If I understand them correctly, the last thing they want is to offload it on to the producer. Oh no; the producer must not be affected. That is the sin of this Government&#x2014;that the producer is the man who is adversely affected because of the actions of this Government. He is an untouchable. I want to ask the hon. member whether he wants to offload that deficit on to the consumer or on to the Government alone? Perhaps he can give me a reply by way of interjection.</p>

<p>He now has a chance to think about it. But I want to tell him that if there is a surplus and he wants to offload it on to the Government alone, in other words, on to the taxpayers alone, what justification does he have for taxing the producers of other commodities of which we also have a surplus and of selecting one specific commodity and giving preference to that commodity? Hon. members opposite owe us a reply. I wanted to deal with the other points but time will not permit me to do so. It is a pity that they have waited so long to discuss this fourth leg of their amendment. To sum up, I want to tell the United Party that in regard to agricultural matters we have been told by way of a motion <span class="col_3689-3690" refersTo="page_0419"/>of no-confidence, by way of private motions, and we have heard it during this Budget debate&#x2014;and we will still hear it said repeatedly during this Session&#x2014;that the farmers are bankrupt. They have tried to intimate further that the farmers have been neglected by this Government and that the Government does not have their interests at heart. But they omit to say what they are prepared to do and the methods that they will follow to solve this problem. I will not deny that there are problems in agriculture. They have one reason and one reason only for acting in this way. In its zeal to become a force to be reckoned with again, and in thinking that it will be able to take over the Government, the Opposition will make use of every means at is disposal, whether it be Poqo or the Orange River scheme or colour policy or taxation or agriculture&#x2014;it makes no difference; it may also be drought and circumstances which are causing hardship&#x2014;to see what support it may perhaps be able to obtain from a few people who are in trouble and who are desperate. They could perhaps succeed in this but there is one thing that frustrates them and that is their record. I see that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) shakes his head. He is perhaps a bit young to remember their record but the farming population of South Africa, like the voters, have not forgotten the record of the United Party. They are not impressed by this criticism which does not hold water and by this new attitude which they know is different to the attitude of the United Party in the past. That is why the United Party is steadily deteriorating and becoming more and more despised by the voters, including the farmers. That is why this National Government is going from strength to strength and will become even stronger in the future.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) put a number of questions to me in regard to the position of the maize farmer and how it could be improved. These are the old tactics of those hon. members because they find themselves in difficulty to-day on account of the promises that they have made in the past and have now been left holding the baby. They now have a greater problem on their hands then they had ten or 20 years ago. They have again sought answers from the United Party. [Laughter.] Those are their old tactics. If they do not have the answer to a question they ask the United Party to give them the answer and when we give them the answer it is only a few months afterwards that our advice is given effect to by the Government. This has been the case in regard to the Orange River scheme, immigration scheme and in respect of many agricultural problems that we have had [Interjections.] The United Party&#x2019;s policy is that we have the Marketing Act and over the years, as the hon. member for Drakensberg said to-day, the farmers have always expected a reasonable entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage over and above theit production costs. Is it not the policy of the Government then to give the farmer his production costs plus a reasonable entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage? I think it is their policy to do so but they find themselves in difficulty temporarily in regard to surpluses because of the fact that over the years they have not listened to this side of the House, particularly when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has told them that because of our improved farming methods in South Africa and because our standard of living has not risen sufficiently, we will find ourselves saddled with surpluses. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and this party have told them for years: Do not put a stop to our immigration scheme because in that way you will prevent our having thousands more people in South Africa who can absorb that increasing agricultural production. Only last year at the Transvaal Congress the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made suggestions to them in connection with maize and said: Is it not your intention to discover other ways to dispose of the surplus? What about converting the surplus into animal feed so that we can export an improved quality meat? Scarcely had my leader said this when it appeared in the report of the group which travelled to America in connection with the whole question of maize. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has told us to-day about this tremendous financial scheme of co-ordinating the Land Bank and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Boards and all those bodies so that agricultural credit can be consolidated for the farmers in a separate department. The hon. member intimated that this was something new but the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing announced it in August last year. The hon. member for Cradock made it out to be a new policy coming from them. Why did he stand up and say this? Because hon. members opposite know how they are criticized by the farming electorate outside. Similarly I can quote from the agricultural policy of the United Party as approved publicly at our Congress in 1957, a policy advocating that the agricultural credit of the farmers be co-ordinated and that a sound body be created so that farming credit can be dealt with in a better fashion. What we advocated in 1957 the Government is only doing in 1963.</p>

[Interjections.] What is the position of the farmers? 28,000 of them have already left their farms over the past few years, and in 1957-8, of the 90,000 remaining, according to the income tax forms which they completed, 17 per cent operated at a loss and 23 per cent operated at a loss in 1960-1. They are now giving the farmer of South Africa a tax concession of R100,000. Mr. Speaker, the position of the farmers has changed to such an extent that they are scarcely able to pay income tax now. That is the position and that is why I will not boast about it. But hon. members opposite tell us how well things are going with the farmers. But what is the position? Is the number of farmers increasing? If things are going so well with us we would find people queueing up to become farmers! But the farmers are leaving the land. The hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) gave us figures to illustrate the depopulation of the platteland over the past years. But what is more, let us look at the economic position of the farmer. Hon. members tell us: See how the gross income of the farmers has increased over the past few years. That is true; I do not want to deny that the gross income has increased. Last year it was about R800,000,000. But what must we look at? A few years ago this Government appointed a study group to inquire into the financial position of the farmers, a group under Dr. Neethling, and that group found that the farmer in South Africa received only a 2&#x00BD; per cent dividend on the money he invested in agriculture. Economists will say that if they make an investment in industry, it is not unreasonable to receive 15 per cent on their money. People in commerce also say that they want to make 6 per cent or 7 per cent on their money but the farmer is lucky if he makes <i>2</i>&#x00BD; per cent. That is the position. How can one assess the prosperity of the farmer? I do not want to repeat what I have stated previously but I want hon. members to look at the amounts owing to the Land Bank and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board, amounts that are increasing annually, and to look at the debts that farmers have with the agricultural co-operatives.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member has a point there. I agree with the hon. member that this is the only thing that has saved the farmers up to the present, and that is because of an inflationary tendency that has given a higher value to his land. But look at his standard of living, look at the house in which he lives, look at his bank account and see whether he has a new car or whether he has the ordinary amenities of life. That is the position of the farmers. The hon. member for Gordonia said that we were generalizing but the mistake he made was to select certain farmers; he mentioned the sultana farmers and the cotton farmers in his constituency. He only singled out those few but what is the position of the farmers at Cradock? The hon. member is a director of a leading co-operative and a year or two ago they told the farmers that they should plough over their lucerne because there was such a large surplus of it. They even advised the farmers in that regard. No, if we want to test the position of the farmer we must take the average. When the report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing becomes available they can look at the indices and see how the prices of farming products have fallen and how production costs continue to rise. They will see it again in that Report this year as we have seen it each year. What advice has been given to farmers in this debate? The hon. member for Rustenburg (Mr. Bootha) gave us the very important advice that the farmers should go back to farming like their forefathers farmed. They should go back to that time when the farmers packed their wheat into a barn and waited until the next year to sell it. That is precisely the difficulty in which the farmers find themselves to-day. They no longer have barns on their farms; they are now governed by conrtol boards and they have to be satisfied with that. The position is still precisely the same. He said that the Minister is overtaxing himself because he has to work so hard. Yes, I can understand the Ministers overtaxing their strength as a result of their journeys through the Free State to explain the policy of the Government to the farmers. What policy did they explain to those people? The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services told us a few years ago that the trouble with our farmers was actually that we had very few prosperous farmers and the hon. the Minister of Lands said last week when he opened the show at Bloemfontein that that was actually our trouble. But when he was in the Free State he said that the trouble was that the farmers wanted to live too well. That was the position. Hon. members must realize that the farmer to-day is in the position of the businessman whose shelves are full of goods. But nobody wants to buy those goods and he has a surplus. What must he do? There are only two things to do; he has either to go bankrupt or he has to put some other product on his shelves. Our farmers have not quite reached that stage, but they will shortly find themselves in that position if the Government does not give attention to assisting the farmer to dispose of his surplus products. They have now to try to follow a long-term policy.</p>

<p>We will have the same problem next year and we have the problem with milk and butter too. If there are no surpluses, why are prices lowered? We have fortunately reached this stage, but this is one of the reasons why the price has been lowered&#x2014; because there are surpluses of those products. The Government must listen to the advice given to it by agricultural leaders&#x2014;that the economic aspect of agriculture is the most important aspect and we must help the farmers to find new markets. If we cannot bring about a higher standard of living in South Africa the hon. the Minister must try to convert those surpluses into something else that can be exported at a reasonable price. That is what we want from this Government. Earlier on I told the hon. the Minister what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had suggested could be done with maize.</p>

<p>But there is another matter that I want to raise, a matter that should have had the attention of this House during this debate, and that is the report of Mr. Justice Snyman.</p>

<p>We were immediately told that it was a bluff on the part of the Opposition. The hon. the Prime Minister went so far as to say that he had no hope of the Opposition offering assistance. But what are the facts of the matter? The facts are that the people outside tell the Government when we have trouble in South Africa, as we have had it previously: &#x201C;Get the support of the Opposition.&#x201D; Their own people say this to them because the people outside know that to maintain law and order one cannot only depend upon the thousands of people supporting the Nationalist Party; one also has to depend upon the thousands supporting the United Party. The people know this and hon. members know it too.</p>

<p>The people know what the position is. What did the Government do? It told the Opposition: We do not need your help. In effect, what they also told the people was: We do not want the assistance of those thousands of supporters of the United Party although they know that in our armed forces, in our Active Citizen Force and in our police force there are thousands of people who are supporters of the United Party. Why did they do that? They did it for one reason&#x2014;to give the people of South Africa the impression that we are on the side of the undermining elements in South Africa. They want to quote to the people from Hansard, from the speeches that have been made here and to tell the people: There you have it; the United Party is on the side of the undermining elements in this country. This is not the first time this has happened. I remember that in 1959&#x2014;I have the cutting here with me&#x2014;we adopted a resolution at the United Party Congress to have a maximum of eight representatives for the Natives in Parliament and we refused to purchase land for Bantustans without knowing what the boundaries would be. Do you know what the immediate reaction of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration was? It was: &#x201C;U.P. Resolutions a great triumph for the A.N.C. in South Africa; the word of honour of the White man has been broken.&#x201D; And now on this occasion, during the debate that we have had here, they have told us: We do not want your assistance. They say this so that they can tell the people outside that we do not want to give them our assistance. Although the safety of South Africa is our first priority the Nationalist Party is playing at politics and playing fast and loose with South Africa&#x2019;s safety. While we fully realize that the people of South Africa want unity in regard to this matter the Nationalist Party is playing to the gallery, not only for the sake of the audience but also for the sake of the Press.</p>
