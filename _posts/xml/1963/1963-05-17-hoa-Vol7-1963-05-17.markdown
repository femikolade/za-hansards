<heading>Shooting of Prisoners on Robben Island</heading>

<question by="#suzman" to="#minister_of_justice">

<num>*I.</num>

<from>Mrs. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Justice:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether he has received any report from the departmental inquiry into reports of (a) the shooting of two prisoners on Robben Island and (b) the admission of eight prisoners to hospital with cut tendons; and, if so,</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_information" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF INFORMATION:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) and (b). Yes.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) A few cases of self-mutilation has since August 1962 occurred amongst the incorrigible and dangerous criminals who were transferred from security prisons to Robben Island to protect not only society but their fellow prisoners from their vicious acts of violence. Their sole purpose is to obtain a transfer to the mainland for medical treatment where they hope to regain their freedom only further to endanger the lives of innocent citizens.</li>

</ol>

<p>Two gang leaders falling within this category were shot while attacking fellow prisoners. In all such cases the relative papers are referred to the police for investigation and submission to the Attorney-General for the holding of a public inquest in fatal cases or such other action as he may deem fit where the victim of the shooting recovers.</p>

<heading>Abuse of Medicines Containing Alcohol</heading>

<question by="#raw" to="#minister_of_justice">

<num>*III.</num>

<from>Mr. RAW</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Justice:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether reports that preparations containing high percentages of alcohol are being sold by certain grocers as tonic wine and tonic brandy, have been brought to his notice; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_information" to="#raw">

<from>The MINISTER OF INFORMATION:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) It appears that a number of these preparations recently appeared on the market and that it is being sold in quantities and under circumstances which indicate that it is not purchased for medicinal <span class="col_6229_6230" refersTo="page_0447"/>purposes but to be consumed as liquor.</li>

</ol>

<p>The matter has already received consideration and steps are being taken to put a stop thereto. I wish to issue a warning that abuse of the exemption granted by the Act in respect of medicine containing alcohol and sold for medicinal purposes will not be tolerated. Manufacturers and distributors are accordingly warned that if they continue to manufacture and possess such preparations they do so at their own risk.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I regret the Minister&#x2019;s personal attack on me yesterday in the Committee when I raised the question of jointed-cactus. The Minister, I suppose, regards it as wrong if say any person under one of the Government irrigation schemes, on which they have spent millions, raises any question as regards its proper administration, but as regards jointed-cactus I am the injured party, not the Minister. The Government took over my farm and used it for experimental purposes and for a long period it was used as a try out for biological control, and although they promised to clear up the mess after the experiments, they did not adequately do so. Mr. Chairman, they assured me that they would issue me with a clearance certificate before I was to take responsibility for my farm. They never did. The Minister will not find a record in his Department that I was ever issued with a clearance certificate or given the chance to say &#x201C;Well, a decent job of clearance has been made&#x201D;. I suffered a life-long injury, it has cost me thousands of pounds. The Government talks abut its thousands of pounds, but it is nothing compared to what I have spent on jointed-cactus <span class="col_6235_6236" refersTo="page_0450"/>comparatively speaking, the time I devoted to research. I do not want to say it myself, but I am one of the leading authorities on jointed-cactus, although the Government does not seem to want to ask my advice. I made experiments with cochineal, I was prepared to take a risk at my farm, and I still have faith in biological control of jointed-cactus as the best method of controlling its spread. That is why I still try to impress upon the Minister to apply biological control and to experiment in that direction. Do not ask world authorities for reports on the success of biological control or the way it keeps control of cactus in its country of origin. Send our own people over to experiment and to find out. There may be several varieties of cochineal. Apart from that it is said that cochineal has lost its toxic effect. It is not so much that as the attack of the ladybird on cochineal. The ladybird has increased by millions and attack our cochineal. I hope the Minister will listen now. He has attacked me, and now he is carrying on a conversation with another Minister. I want to defend myself and give the reasons why I allowed my farm to be messed up, because I have faith in cochineal control, and I still believe in it and I am quite certain that in the end, even if another Minister were to succeed this Minister, I will be proved to have been correct. The only way we will be able to control the spreading of jointed-cactus is by biological control.</p>

<p>I have a few other matters I would like to raise. I would like to ask the Minister what progress he has made as regards the production of seed-potatoes in this country. Last session I mentioned that some of the finest seed-potatoes I have seen were produced on the Riet River Settlement. We import something like 15,000,000 lb. of seed-potatoes annually into this country, and I cannot see why our efficient farmers in this country, who have proved themselves equal in ability to develop farming methods to any farmers in the world, cannot produce these seed-potatoes. For instance, our farmers in the Western Province are the most efficient in the world, and I do not see why we should not produce our own seed-potatoes. We have all varieties of climate and we have facilities to produce our own fresh strains in other areas, and I do hope that the hon. Minister will pay attention to this particular matter.</p>

<p>I would also like to again ask the Minister to have some more efficient experiments carried out as regards the production of pineapple fibre. It seems that fibre is going to be one of the major important products in this country. We are a great wool-producing country and our need for bags per population must be greater than in any country in the world. The hon Minister has Collondale as an experimental station and there they are carrying out very efficient experiments, but they do not carry out experiments to prove to the farmer which is the most efficient method of combining pineapple production and fibre production. These two must be combined. I have no doubt that instead of letting the pineapple plantations carry on until they stop bearing, the Minister should experiment and have these periods of production reduced. It is claimed, as a result of experiments by the Minister&#x2019;s officials at Collondale, that pineapples are at their maximum production for the first six years after plantation. I would suggest an experiment to try out five years for fruit production and use the sixth year for fibre. I have no doubt that along those lines, which the Minister himself to some extent has suggested, we may find the pineapple industry an economical one and one of particular value to this country. I would ask the hon. Minister to have these particular experiments carried out. There are farmers trying to carry out experiments, but they can never do it as efficiently as the Government Department that has the facilities and has all the data at its disposal. It may be of advantage if the pineapple is kept six years in production and the seventh year for fibre before the plant begins to fall to pieces or becomes unproductive. If a pineapple plantation is left in production, in about ten years it just dies out and there is nothing left for fibre production to speak of; I think the best fibre is obtained when the pineapple plant is at full production, when the leaves are the longest and are at their best. I have no doubt, with the machines the Government has and a regulated production of pineapple fibre, we may have an industry in this country, not only of value to farmers, but to the country in general.</p>

<speech by="#bootha">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOOTHA</person>:</from>

<p>I want to start by thanking the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services very sincerely on behalf of the tobacco farmers over a very wide area for the wonderful new building that has been added to the research station at Rustenburg, a building that was very necessary. It was nut into use during the course of last year. This has made it possible for research to be done in connection with tobacco such as has never been done in this regard before. This has now enabled the research station to tell us precisely what a tobacco leaf is and it has also enabled the research station to determine the nutrients in the tobacco leaf which are obtained through the medium of the various elements. In this way we will in the near future be able to determine precisely what is good and bad in any tobacco leaf. I also want to express our thanks to the staff of that research station for the services that they are rendering to the farmer and for assisting the farmers in every respect. But I also think particularly of the analysing of soil in connection with which much valuable work is done to enable us to know what our soil needs in the way of nutrients. I am speaking on behalf of those tobacco farmers whom we regard as small-scale farmers. They are small-scale farmers but they are small-scale farmers who can hold their own and I think that we are entitled to say that there are few farmers in the country who give less trouble than that group of small-scale tobacco farmers. It is interesting to note that a small ten morgen tobacco farm provides the living for at least 16 people&#x2014;a family of five or six and ten labourers. <span class="col_6237_6238" refersTo="page_0451"/>It is not often that we find that such a large number of people can make a living on Such a small piece of land. And this is only in the production stage. When that product leaves the farm, only then it the value of the product apparent because then thousands of workers in factories are engaged in the manufacture of the final product of tobacco in the form of cigarettes, cigars and pipe tobacco. And it goes even further than this. It appears as though this chain is never-ending because we also have the business people who trade in tobacco and who make their profit from tobacco. I think therefore that if we consider the size of the land, there is no other branch of agriculture that provides a living for as many people as those small pieces of land that are under tobacco. Not only does tobacco provide these people with a living; not only is its existence justified because of the share it contributes towards the economy of the country, but it also contributes an important share towards the income of the State. I think that it is necessary for me to mention a few figures. Figures are perhaps not actually binding, but in this case I am sure that this will be so. We find that from a crop in our country of 49,500,000 lb. of tobacco for internal consumption and 17.000.000 lb. for export, the State collects revenue in excise duty on cigarettes alone to an amount of R46,000,000; on pipe tobacco, R5,000,000; on cigarette tobacco nearly R56.000 and on cigars, R11,000. a total of R51,800,000. This is the revenue that the State collects, over and above the living that tobacco gives to the community. All this comes from these small pieces of land. I think that I have proved that tobacco farming merits the support of everyone in South Africa. A large industry of this nature on such a small piece of land, an industry which gives the Government so little trouble, cannot lightly be ignored. That is why on behalf of the tobacco farmers I want to ask people to forget about all the accusations that are made against the smoking habit because these accusations hamper the hon. the Minister in his efforts to promote this strong industry. Questions are continually being put to the hon. the Minister of Health and we are always reading reports and hearing speeches made which are to the detriment of this industry. We feel that this is unjust be cause there is no proof of any sort that there is any harm in smoking. This has not been proved by any doctors in the world. On the contrary, a great deal has been proved in favour of smoking and I want to quote what was said by a great doctor, Dr. Norman Shenstone, the man who made a name for himself in 1932 by removing an infected lung. This doctor says that he removed a cancerous lung from a man in 1932 and that that man is still alive and smokes up to three packets of cigarettes a day. The man who still wants to tell me that there is any danger in smoking must be warned that I will not believe him.</p>

<p>The medical world is uncertain but we must analyse the matter further. Let us ignore the finding of this doctor. If we want to take this argument further we can say that everything we eat may be fatal. Everything we drink and eat, so the doctors say, cause the death of certain people. The drink that we take has a calming effect, and the smoke that we take which has a calming effect in this tense world gives us an opportunity to relax and to remain calm. This alone is of great value in calming our overtaxed nerves which are the result of a demanding life.</p>

<p>When we think of what the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has done for us, we cannot imagine what our agricultural industry would be like without the great and important work that they are doing. The Department, which has a very difficult task, does not always receive the necessary credit for what it does. There are some of its experts who are world renowned, but the results achieved by the Department are not always weighed against the amount of work which precedes those results and against the background of research and study and of experiments and the many failures that precede those results. And that is how it should be. We must have failures because if this Department does not experience failures in its research, those failures will simply be transferred to the agricultural industry itself, which cannot afford to experience them. That is why it is no argument to say that the Department should have an experimental farm which is an economic unit. That is not posssible in practice. It must of necessity bear the losses which would otherwise be transferred to the agricultural industry. I want to go so far as to say that as a result of the work and the experiments and the guidance of the Department, the agricultural industry has made a tremendous amount of progress over the past years and we have had far larger crops and a larger yield per morgen, most of which has been due to the work of the Department. The yield has been increased to such an extent that we have to deal to-day with a problem of surpluses, and as a result of this fact I want to ask that the question of efficient farming methods should be taken to the highest level with the assistance of the Department. All positive factors that can assist in increasing efficiency must be utilized in the technological sphere but the financial aspect must also be given the necessary attention and the necessary knowledge must be conveyed to the farmers. We are grateful for the efforts made by the Department in various directions to convey the knowledge that <span class="col_6239_6240" refersTo="page_0452"/>it is acquiring to the farmers. The Division or Mechanization and Engineering holds short courses; demonstrations are arranged and farmers&#x2019; days are held and this knowledge is conveyed to the farmers in every possible way. This helps a great deal because we must remember that a large number of our farmers have not had the opportunity of receiving a thorough agricultural training. This is not their own fault because many of the farmers entered the farming profession during the depression and they did not have the means to receive that agricultural training. A large number of farmers entered the profession during the war and shortly thereafter and these farmers did not have the opportunity to receive this training either. It is necessary that our farmers should be guided in the various spheres. I want to support the appeal the hon. the Minister made that the farmers should visit the experimental stations and the agricultural schools. But it is also true that a large number of farmers who from the nature of things are conservative or in a groove, have first to be educated in order to receive training. Because of the changes in farming conditions and the more scientific direction that the profession is following, as in the case of mechanization, the farmer has to know more about the correct way to mechanize otherwise he may do himself a great deal of harm. They have to know what implements to use under certain circumstances and for a certain type of soil. They have to guard against the purchase of unnecessary and ineffective implements. The Department is doing a great deal of research in this respect. There is also the factor of soil fertility. I have said that the production per unit has been greatly increased but do our farmers know that in spite of the use of artificial fertilizers the fertility of the soil is decreasing as a result of that increased production? Are they aware that in the long run they will do their soil great harm if they do not treat it properly? There is the animal factor. Do our farmers all know how to obtain a low mortality rate and a high birth rate and a higher production per animal? Because this is so and because the farmers desire guidance, because many of them have still to be educated in order to receive training, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to adopt a new direction. I suggest that regular outside schools should be held everywhere on the platteland, schools which have to be attended every year. In this way the farmers will be educated. They will be given the opportunity, practically on their doorsteps, to attend those outside schools which should last for at least a week or two. In this way they will become aware of the value of training. I want to ask the hon. the Minister and his Department to give attention to this suggestion so that the largest possible number of farmers can attend those outside schools. If we cannot get them to attend these short courses in sufficiently large numbers let us then for the sake of the industry itself and its future educate the farmers to be as efficient as possible by bringing the schools to them.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the Minister&#x2019;s remarks yesterday, when he referred to certain of my suggestions as &#x201C;bangmaakstories&#x201D;, I want to suggest that he has not kept himself conversant with what has taken place in the past, or with what is taking place at present. I want to tell him what has taken place and what is taking place. First of all, where were rinderpest and lung sickness arrested? In the very corridor I was speaking about. Where was East Coast Fever stopped? In that very corridor. Does he realize what those farmers put up with during that time? Where was foot-and-mouth disease arrested in 1902? In that corridor. From that time on that particular area has had to put up with five, seven and 14 days&#x2019; dipping. For what purpose? To save the rest of South Africa from infestation. Was it not only last year that he released Komgha from the restrictions that had been imposed upon them for 50 years? Is the Minister aware of the fact that there were periods of time when East Coast Fever jumped from the Natal border to the West Bank of East London, a distance of 300 miles? How did it get there? Through sabotage. We know full well that infected ticks are easily collected, and they were carried for hundreds of miles in match-boxes. The point is that under White control those things happened in the Transkei, but does the Minister realize what could happen under Bantu control if they tried to sabotage the rest of the Republic? [Interjection.] If any hon. members opposite would like to check up the facts they are welcome to do so. However, we are extremely pleased that the hon. the Minister did arrest and localize foot-and-mouth disease in the area in which it broke out. Let me say that we would have taken a very dim view of it if he had not done so. If he had taken every veterinary official in South Africa to do so we would still have been pleased.</p>

<p>However. I want to get on to the question raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central), and that is the production of bags and woolpacks. He indicated that it would cost about R970.000 over three years, which was in excess of the price at which those commodities could be imported. I want to put it to the Minister that the farmers are carrying by that means the industries we are hoping to develop in this country, and none of us on this side want to retard the development of those industries provided it is possible for us at some future date to supply sufficient jute for the manufacture of these products. I maintain that with the increasing levies that have been imposed, it might be possible to subsidize these commodities from that fund rather than drawing it from the farmers as at present. Over a period of three years the better part of R 1,000,000 is a substantial sum of money to take out of the pockets of the farmers.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with fertilizers and ask the Minister whether he has given any attention to the Viljoen Report and whether he has made any suggestions as to its acceptance or not. We farmers know that we are paying dearly for the fertilizers which are so essential for production <span class="col_6241_6242" refersTo="page_0453"/>at a time when there are reduced prices and surpluses which are difficult to dispose of. We feel that if the Viljoen Report is accepted, it might place the whole of the fertilizer business in the hands of monopolies again. So I suggest to the Minister that he should give the greatest consideration to it before he accepts that report. He knows full well that many of the commodities that are being produced by public utility companies are essential for our agricultural production and we feel that he might give some indication to the co-operatives to club together and take control of those articles so that they can get them at a reasonable figure. I want to assure him that in one instance the article is available at approximately R21 a ton, whereas it is being sold by the organizations which are disposing of them for as much as R28 a ton. That can represent a saving when the farmers are facing the position where they are being asked to reduce their cost of production and they are facing rising costs of production. The Minister should try to let the farmers have these commodities at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>I was extremely interested in the statement made by the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) earlier this Session when he indicated that a financial department would be established within the Department.</p>

<p>We have now reached the end of this debate, in which a very wide field has been covered. I rise rather hesitantly, because I do not want to be guilty of repetition. A great deal of emphasis has been placed upon guidance and research. I, myself, was required to do a little research as far as my own position was concerned and, although I have great praise for the research that is being done, I must say that, as far as my own research is concerned, I feel that we are a little unfortunate in so far as, when we ask for a dam, we are told that we have high rainfall: when we ask for a veterinary officer, we are told that the climate in the Free State is such that we do not need a veterinary officer. I want to ask that consideration should be given to the provision of these services when they can be supplied.</p>

<p>During the 1962 session, and this year as well, a great deal of emphasis was, and has been, placed upon the shortage of staff and extension officers. Because of this fact it is gratifying to be able to say that this Department has done particularly well, notwithstanding the fact, as has been said, that this guidance is not always correct, and that it is sometimes unreliable. But I believe that no thorough investigation has been made into the reasons why the guidance given has not been successfully applied. In pursuance of this, I want to quote what the hon. the Minister had to say last year during the debate on his Vote, and we want to express our appreciation of the fact that the Department is working along these lines. The hon. the Minister had the following to say. I quote from Hansard, Part 4, Col. 5597&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the one hand we have created a Directorate of Agricultural Research, and on the other hand a Directorate of Field Services. In these directorates there are directors&#x2019; posts for the various technical divisions, because each of them has several technical divisions. So, in the case of the Directorate of Research, posts for directors of cultivation and grazing, horticulture, stock-breeding and dairy products, plant protection, agricultural chemistry and veterinary science have been established.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister said further that in connection with the policy of this Department it was the intention to bring an agricultural research advisory committee into being for every branch of farming. A few agricultural research advisory committees for various branches of agriculture already exist to-day. In pursuance of this policy statement, I want to say that this is a wonderful way to streamline this Department, and no one can object to it. But where we do experience a shortage of staff, having regard to what the hon. the Minister has said, I want to suggest that this shortage can be partly overcome by making more use of colour films and projectors. Mention has already been made of the literature that we have at our disposal for agricultural guidance, but, because that literature has not yet achieved the desired results, in that there are farmers who do not make full use of it, I want to suggest that guidance can be given through the medium of colour films that can be made available to the farmers&#x2019; associations, agricultural colleges and so forth. I believe that enthusiasm will be built up through this medium of guidance. I believe that an army of zealous farmers will greatly facilitate the task of the Department so that better results can be achieved. I believe that a climate must be created in which the farmer will have confidence in the work being done by the Department, and if results are achieved through the medium of these colour films, I will not be surprised if the farmers show more interest in the work of the Department and follow the guidance given. The climate that must be created is that the farmer must be convinced that if he follows this guidance it will not only be in the interests of the country or of his own farm, but that the policy is aimed at assuring the farmer of a better living. This living is after all, the important factor about which all this work turns, and we can only achieve success if we can make the farmers more interested and get them to apply what they learn from the Department. It has become necessary for us to preserve our agricultural land and even improve it, and it is vitally necessary for us to protect our natural vegetation for the future. This is the task of our generation and is one we cannot overlook. <span class="col_6243_6244" refersTo="page_0454"/>It is our duty to do this in the interests or the present-day farmer and also of future generations. Production must be increased, but this can only be done if there is close co-operation between the Department and the farmers. I believe that there are many farmers who have already had a good deal of success as a result of the guidance that they have received. Those farmers who still have problems can follow the example of those successful farmers. I want to make an earnest request that the methods used for giving guidance in this direction will receive attention. I want to conclude by thanking the hon. the Minister for having visited my constituency during the recess. I want to say that his visit was a very fruitful one.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_for_south_west_africa_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER FOR SOUTH WEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say something about the youngest branch of the agricultural industry in the Republic, a matter about which nothing has as yet been said in this debate. That is the karakul industry. That industry is perhaps sometimes under-estimated. If it is realized that there are already more than a million karakul sheep in the North-West and that the industry earns foreign currency for the country amounting to between R6,000,000 and R7,000,000 per annum, and that there is a great future for the industry, it should indeed not be under-estimated. I am referring now to the Republic only, and not to South West. The climate of the North-Western Cape is excellent for the production of karakul pelts, and there is no doubt that in spite of the regular droughts which afflict that area the karakul industry will expand still further. The success of karakul farming depends on the quality of the pelts. If a pelt of inferior quality is produced, then, as in the case of all other agricultural products, the karakul industry will face a dark future. The secret of the production of good pelts is to use rams of a very high quality, and to be able to distinguish between a ram of good quality and one of low quality requires a lot of knowledge. That is the point on which I particularly want to concentrate. In South West Africa the mistake was made of not timeously and properly instructing the farmers in regard to the choice of good rams. There was a time when an attempt was made to introduce legislation to provide for the compulsory selection of rams; that the State should select the rams and that no ram could be sold unless approved of by the State. I was responsible for Agriculture in South West at the time and I felt that this was perhaps the wrong method and that a different method should be adopted, and that is the method which I now want to suggest should be adopted in the Republic, namely to educate the farmers so that they themselves will be able to distinguish between rams of good and of inferior quality. That can only be done by way of practical demonstration. If a serious attempt is made to hold practical demonstrations for the farmers as often as possible, either on their farms or at central places, that is the only way in which they will learn to distinguish between good aud interior rams. When one has once made use of an inferior ram and its progeny is inferior, one just cannot remedy the matter again. We have now started giving short courses for the farmers there. I know that at Upington there is a research station which does outstanding work and i am aware of the fact that an extension officer has also been appointed there by the Meat Board, who also does excellent work, but for such a tremendously widespread area that is not enough, and in view of the fact that there is a great future for the karakul industry in the Republic I feel that I should make an appeal to the Minister to devote special attention to it; to give special instructions to the officials there to spare no pains to impart the necessary knowledge to the farmers as soon as possible, to those who have to buy and use these rams, and only then will the karakul industry in the Republic be a success. We need not be afraid of an over-production of karakul pelts. The world demand has never yet been satisfied. This year, in the cold weather they had in Europe, the men started wearing karakul hats, and over two million pelts were used just for making hats, whereas the total production of South West Africa is only 2,000,000 pelts per annum. The total production was therefore absorbed in a single season just to comply with the requirements of the men, and therefore we need have no fear, i feel that the karakul industry in the Republic should be encouraged as an additional economic factor, and if the farmers receive the necessary guidance it will be a success.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister just what practical research work has been carried out in the last few years in feeding experiments with straight-run maize meal mixed with proteins as against the maize meal which is now being supplied by the maize mills and to which all the proteins are then added. Today with all the extraction of oil, etc., that is allowed, all the best ingredients of maize are being removed by permission of the Government with the result that the meal that is coming from the mills and which is subsidized by the Government or the Maize Control Board consist of practically nothing but pure starch. The farmer, especially the small producer, whether he is producing poultry products or dairy products where he is using balanced rations, is paying through the nose for his balanced ration because ingredients are being put back into those balanced rations at a tremendous cost because of the extraction which is allowed by the milling companies. I think it is time a little further research was done in this regard and that steps were taken to see that the straight-run meal is made available to the small producer at the same subsidized rate. I as a feeder can afford to have maize ground for myself. Like others who have carried out experiments i know what it costs to buy meal which, even though it is subsidized in price, has had all its goodness extracted with the result that one buys practically <span class="col_6245_6246" refersTo="page_0455"/>straight starch and therefore has to add ingredients of proteins in order to produce a balanced ration for dairy cattle, pigs, poultry, etc. I think this is very important to-day to our small producers. They are finding their costs of production almost prohibitive. I think that the small producer should be helped by means of practical demonstrations as far as the feeding of his herd or his poultry is concerned. He should even be assisted by means of practical demonstrations as far as the feeding of his Natives is concerned. Sir, I know that I cannot discuss the question of malnutrition here in much detail. I think this Minister is responsible for nutrition as well. I simply want to make the point that malnutrition is being brought about to-day because of the fact that all the goodness is being extracted from maize meal. I do not think that as much maize is being utilized on the farms to-day as could be used. I would therefore appeal to the Minister that more information should be distributed amongst the smaller feeders and the younger farmers who have not got the time or the money to make experiments themselves to find out just what it is costing them to put in those expensive ingredients to replace the other ingredients which have been removed by the milling companies.</p>

<p>Then I want to go on to another matter and that is the question of soil erosion. Judging by what the Minister said yesterday he is quite happy about the soil erosion position. He seems to think that soil erosion is pretty well under control in this country. I was rather surprised to hear him say, in reply to the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan), that he was satisfied about the soil erosion position. Sir, I still do not see one river running clear yet after rain, no matter how small that rainfall may be. When you go through the watersheds of the Drakensberg and when you go through East Griqualand you see soil erosion on every side. Our watersheds are still being denuded of soil; our rivers are still running red with the soil which is being carried to the sea, and when you fly along the coast, as we people from Natal do periodically during the summer months, going backward and forward between Cape Town and Durban, you see this soil being carried miles out to the sea, discolouring the sea. This only goes to show how many millions of tons of soil are being carried from the land. Does that prove that soil erosion is under satisfactory control? Is there one dam which is not being silted up in the Republic to-day? As a matter of fact there is not a municipal undertaking anywhere in the northern parts of South Africa where their water supply is not being endangered by silting up. If the Minister does not want to believe us we can supply him with the figures from the municipalities. All the bigger dams in Natal, and I think the same applies to the Transvaal, are being very gravely endangered by silting because of soil erosion, which does not show that soil erosion is under satisfactory control. Take the watersheds of our main rivers in Natal and East Griqualand.</p>

<p>Sir, I am dealing with the soil erosion part of it. Soil erosion comes under this Vote. I am not talking about water conservation; I am dealing with the soil erosion that causes the silting of dams. Soil erosion definitely falls under this Vote and the Minister dealt with it yesterday. I submit with all due respect that I am correct. I am dealing with the watersheds where soil erosion is taking place to a very serious extent. We will deal with the water conservation side to-morrow or later to-day. I want to deal with the soil erosion that is taking place. A few years ago soil erosion was taking place in East Griqualand on a large scale on land made available to the Bantu Affairs Department, and while I am on that point I want to ask the hon. the Minister just what liaison there is and what co-ordination and co-operation there is between his Department and the Department of Bantu Administration in relation to the control of soil erosion in the Native reserves, especially those on our watersheds. There is a tremendous amount of soil erosion on the slopes of the Drakensberg in places and in the watersheds of our main rivers. If we are going to run into trouble in Natal with the water we have, what about the rest of South Africa? You are going to spend huge amounts of money on your schemes in the Cape and if soil erosion is going to take place there and nullity that work almost before you start, then I say it is going to be a poor outlook. I want to ask the Minister with all due respect whether he has enough officers in that Department; whether he is training sufficient soil erosion officials to tackle this huge task; has he got the necessary manpower and how many technical officers is he training to undertake this very important work? Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister what he is doing to see that we will be allowed to keep a satisfactory, well-trained and happy farm labour force. I do not want to talk about the marketing side; I refer entirely to the production side. As the hon. the Minister knows, you cannot take any odd Native who turns up on the farm and let him handle a four or five-gallon cow or a valuable horse because he may never have handled an animal of that kind before. If we have to rely for our labour on the influx control regulations, which seems to be the suggestion, then we are going to be in very great trouble. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>If I could have entered the debate earlier, I should have liked to reply to the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) in regard to the locust plague about which he is so concerned. The hon. the Minister has, however, told him what the position is, but to set his mind at rest further I just want to refer to a few letters and telegrams I have received from the infested area, namely Marydale. His own supporters, <i>inter alia,</i> in that area assure me that the plague is now <span class="col_6247_6248" refersTo="page_0456"/>under control. In the beginning the position was not satisfactory, but if one bears in mind how large the infested area was one cannot blame the Department of Agricultural Technical Services for the fact that their machinery did not get into gear immediately. For example, they started there towards the end of March with about 15 units for the whole area, and the latest report from Pretoria is that today there are between 40 and 50 such units. In the beginning there was only one aircraft, but later there were as many as three aircraft. I leave the matter there.</p>

<p>Then I want to take the opportunity of congratulating the Secretary for Agriculture and his staff on this outstanding report for the year ended 30 June 1962. It is an excellent piece of work. To tell the truth, it is something more than an annual report. It is really a textbook on agriculture. The time and care devoted to it and the thoroughness with which it was compiled set an example to the other Government Departments. Now I want to come to my comment. In the preface to the report the secretary claims much credit for the efficiency in agricultural and horticultural production, and quite rightly so. The work done by the Research Department and the guidance given to our farmers were so efficient that today the trouble is not production but overproduction. This efficiency was attained by research and guidance along the lines of better cultivation of the soil, better seed, better fertilizers, the combating of plagues and weeds, etc. Together with that, the farmers of course received financial assistance on a scale unprecedented in the history of agriculture in this country. But now we come to stock-farming, and here unfortunately the picture is quite different. The secretary says, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<p>The stock-farming industry in many parts of the country has not yet reached the same level of efficiency as agricultural and horticultural production.</p>

<p>He qualifies it by saying &#x201C;in many parts of our country&#x201D;, but then he continues to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Grazing control and the conservation of fodder for use in times of drought were the exception and not the rule.</block>

<p>I do not think that this reprimand for the stock farmers should be stated in such general terms, because where these things can be done I believe they are in fact done. I want to ask him: How does one attain this efficiency in areas where droughts are the rule and not the exception, and where, due to lack of water, one cannot produce any fodder, and how does one do it on an uneconomic farm? In the north-west, as I said earlier&#x2014;and I am referring now to our stock-farming areas&#x2014;almost 30 per cent of the farms are too small. It is all very well to talk about planned agriculture and of grazing control and of fodder banks in the form of spare, grazing, silage, haystacks, etc., but viewed against the background of the low rental, the lack of water for irrigation and uneconomic small farms&#x2014; and here I am again thinking particularly of the stock-farming area&#x2014;the remedies referred to by the secretary only remain pious hopes. I want to pose the question as to what the Department can do in regard to this matter. Other than in the case of agriculture and horticulture, it is still a fact that intensive research, and particularly comprehensive research into our specific problems in the northwest, is not in full swing yet. There are a large number of problems in regard to which hardly any research has yet been done. I shall mention a few of them. There are the stock diseases which are peculiar to the north-west. I think, e.g., of blindness amongst small stock, and I think of &#x201C;geeldikkop&#x201D;, plant poisoning, weed control, methods of controlling the caterpillar plague&#x2014;and here I am not referring to the life history of the caterpillar itself; every schoolchild knows that, but what I am talking about is the control of that plague&#x2014;the production and control of subterranean water, the desalting of water, and economic fodder for animals in time of drought. It should be remembered that in those areas ore has to buy one&#x2019;s fodder; one cannot produce it. Then the basic problem is uneconomic holdings. I am glad that I can thank the hon. the Minister for the establishment of an experimental station, an experimental farm, in the north-west, at Carnarvon, and I hope that this experimental farm will consider it its duty in the first place to devote attention to this multiplicity of problems in the north-west.</p>

<p>But there is one predominating problem, and that is this question of uneconomic farms. To ask this type of farmer to devote attention to farm planning, conservation practices, fodder banks in the form of silage, etc., is simply a waste of time. In passing, I want to express the hope that when the Orange River scheme becomes a reality, the stock farmer of the north-west will also be given the opportunity to acquire plots in the new areas to be put under irrigation, so that he will at least be able to produce his own fodder. The consolidation of small farms is the basic problem in the stock-farming area, and I hope that the necessary attention will be devoted to it.</p>

<p>Just allow me to add this before I resume my seat. In spite of what is so often said by hon. members opposite, financial assistance to our farmers has never been lacking. The Government has done its duty, but this assistance should not degenerate into charity; it should be constructive and rehabilitative; it should be concentrated on the establishment of an independent and prosperous farming community. I want to assure everybody who might have doubts about it that the farmers do not desire anything else. The last thing they want is that the Department of Agriculture should be turned into a welfare organization for them.</p>

<p>I do not propose to react to the remarks of the hon. member <span class="col_6249_6250" refersTo="page_0457"/>who has just sat down except just to say in passing that he thanked the Minister for the experimental station which has been established in the north-west. I want to link that up with what I said yesterday evening, and that is that unfortunately this Department has unlimited capital at its disposal for extension services to the farmers. The amount paid for the land on which this experimental station is situated once again shows that this Department has unlimited capital at its disposal. I said yesterday evening&#x2014;and various speakers have drawn attention to it this morning&#x2014;that the main reason for the failure of farming ventures is the fact that the capital at the disposal of the farmers is not being used to the best advantage. I discussed this subject yesterday evening and when the hon. the Minister had to reply, the Whip on this side of the House exchanged a few words with me; it was not my fault. Whips are in the habit of discussing matters with members in the Chamber, and I noticed again this morning that Whips on the other side did the same thing. The hon. the Minister used this as an excuse for refusing to reply further to the points which I had raised. I assured the hon. the Minister that I was listening to him but he said that he refused to reply further because my manners were bad. A minute later, while the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) was speaking, the hon. the Minister turned round and conversed with the hon. member behind him; then it was not a case of bad manners. Mr. Chairman, when Ministers get into difficulties, they always use this sort of way out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member must discuss the Vote now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am going to discuss the Vote. Sir, since yesterday evening in discussing this Vote, our discussions, as the <i>Burger</i> put it, have ranged from pests to farms; we have talked about the fruit-sucking moth, jointed cactus, caterpillars, &#x201C;stinkblaar&#x201D; (thorn-apple), tea and coffee, tobacco, agricultural training, foot and mouth disease and goodness knows what else. And, Sir, do you know what the hon. the Minister said? In reply to all these complaints put forward by hon. members, in the proportion of two members on that side to one on this side, the hon. the Minister said that he was satisfied with the extension services which were being given to the farmers of South Africa but that many farmers still lacked the will and the desire to acquire knowledge. It was this same attitude on the part of the hon. the Minister which induced this side of the House earlier this Session to move that the hon. the Minister should be discharged from his post. After all the criticism that we heard yesterday evening and today, what is the Minister&#x2019;s reaction? He makes a statement about the soil conservation committees and about fire-fighting committees and about the regional organization and then he says, &#x201C;the implementation of effective soil conservation fire-fighting measures still remains one of our most important tasks&#x201D;. But, after all, that is the position, Mr. Chairman. That is something which we on this side have been telling the hon. the Minister over the past 12 years. We have been saying to him over the past 12 years that he has too few extension officers; that farming planning is going ahead too slowly and that if he carries on in this way it will take goodness knows how many years before every farm will be planned and before soil conservation will be implemented properly. But then the hon. the Minister goes on to say &#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Having regard to this, the procedure has been simplified. Under the new procedure it is no longer necessary for farmers to wait until their farms have been fully planned or until the plans have been approved.</block>

<p>He now talks about district planning and then he says: &#x201C;The time has come now when it is possible for every farmer to make a start with conservation practice,&#x201D; and then immediately afterwards there follows this threat: &#x201C;That is why all our farmers are now expected to make a thorough start without any delay.&#x201D; He makes that statement after we have been waiting for years and years for the Minister&#x2019;s Department and the Minister to see to it that we get more extension officers! I want to quote what was said in the debate of 1962, in which certain districts were mentioned in which there was no extension officer at all. The districts which were mentioned include Murraysburg, Aberdeen, Prince Albert, Willowmore, Sutherland, Ceres, Bredasdorp, Mossel Bay, Knysna, Uniondale, Steytlerville, Pearcetown, Hanover, Britstown and Hopetown. That is the position only as far as the Cape Province is concerned. I could mention a whole series of districts in Natal where we have the same position. I want to quote from a debate which was conducted here in 1961. [Interjection.] We are still complaining and the hon. the Minister admits it now, because he now talks about district planning and no longer about farm planning. Mr. Chairman, can there be any clearer proof of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s hopeless failure to introduce proper planning than this very statement of his? If any member happens to hold a conversation with some other member, then the Minister refuses to reply, as he did when he referred to the hon. member for Harrismith who thanked him for having come to his constituency. The hon. member for Harrismith forgot to tell us about the row which took place at that meeting; he forgot to tell us that at that meeting too the hon. the Minister said what he said here yesterday evening and what he says in this statement in which he again tries to put the blame on the farmers. The farmers are now told to make a start in applying soil conservation measures after they have been waiting for years on the Minister&#x2019;s Department. The hon. the Minister must not stand up here and tell us hypocritically &#x2026;</p>

<p>I withdraw it, Mr. Chairman, and I say that he must not come along with the pious statement that the necessary services are available but that the farmers do not have the will and the desire to make use of them. I regard the statement made here by the hon. the Minister as scandalous. In switching over from farm planning to district planning he says that responsible leaders of the farming community have asked that active steps should be taken and then he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That means that I have agreed that steps may be taken against persons who deliberately persist in neglecting the basic soil conservation instructions.</block>

<p>In other words, legal steps are now going to be taken against those farmers. Mr. Chairman, I should like to know on what leg the hon. the Minister is going to stand. How is he going to prosecute a farmer because he has failed to apply soil conservation methods when that farmer has been trying in vain for years and years to have his farm planned? How is he going to do this when there is not even an extension officer in that particular district or area? It is simply because of the pressure which has been brought to bear on the hon. the Minister and because he is aware of the fact that he has failed hopelessly in providing the extension services which he ought to provide that he has now issued this statement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not want to follow the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) in the bitter disappointment which she has revealed here because the discussion on this Vote has not been to her liking and has not fitted in with the United Party&#x2019;s &#x201C;operation platteland&#x201D;. She has said nothing in her last speech to which I can reply although she did mention a matter of importance yesterday evening, to which I propose to reply. She stated that economic guidance should be integrated with our extension services. I must admit that this is one of the aspects on which sufficient emphasis has not been placed in the past. With the establishment of the new Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and with the very close co-operation which exists between the two Departments, I think it is perfectly clear to everybody that we do give careful attention to that aspect of our information services. One of the difficulties in agriculture, a difficulty which sometimes causes farmers to suffer, is that the available capital is not always used correctly. That is true, but that not only applies to agriculture; it also applies to other branches of our national economy. The wrong use of capital must be eliminated as far as possible, and the only thing that the State can do in that connection &#x2014;because every person is at liberty to use his capital as he pleases&#x2014;is to give guidance and to demonstrate practically how capital can be put to the best use.</p>

<p>The hon. member created the impression &#x2014;an impression under which I also laboured when I did not know better&#x2014;that there was no proper control on Government experimental farms; that money was no object there. I just want to emphasize this point: Both on our closer settlements and on our experimental farms we have created farming units of the same size as the economic farms in those particular areas. The accounts in respect of the variety of farming activities which are carried on there are kept absolutely separate so as to show the farmers that they do not necessarily have to practise exploitational farming in order to make a living but that by integrating scientific methods into their farming they can increase their income and the efficiency of their production to their own advantage. That is how we demonstrate in a practical way what can be achieved by balanced farming.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) put forward the plea yesterday evening that we should establish another faculty of veterinary science. He stated that I had said that I did not think the time was ripe for this. I want to tell him that whereas five years ago there was only provision for the training of 15 veterinarians per annum, there are facilities to-day for the training of 45. Those facilities can be extended without great cost to provide for the training of up to 60 or 75 veterinarians, if necessary, and nobody has convinced me yet that such a faculty which is capable of training 60 to 75 veterinarians would be too big to be centralized within a single institution. The hon. member said that the veterinary profession as such was being hampered because the chairman of the Veterinary Board is a departmental official. That is not the position; the veterinary association is a completely free body. I act on the advice of the Veterinary Board; it is the veterinarians themselves who advise me. The fact that the Veterinary Faculty at Onderstepoort has really fallen under the Department of Agriculture ever since its inception does not mean that it is a subordinate faculty. It is a faculty which academically falls under the University of Pretoria and it enjoys the same academic freedom as the medical faculties at our universities. I cannot see any reason at all why the medical faculty and the veterinary faculty should be integrated. They have been separated all these years and I think they have both done good work. As a matter of fact I am extremely proud of the achievements of our veterinary research institute under the Department of Agriculture, because if there is one research institution which has acquired world fame and renown it is certainly this institution. During the past year Onderstepoort has been visited by no fewer than 60 persons from overseas, not only veterinarians but very learned people. At one stage we had seven German professors <span class="col_6253_6254" refersTo="page_0459"/>here from the Free University of Hamburg. They spent a week here to investigate our research work. We receive requests from America and other countries that we should create an opportunity for them to send their post-graduate veterinary students here for further research and further training at Onderstepoort. In certain respects our research at Onderstepoort has advanced further than our research at the medical research institute. In other words, we do not take second place to them; in many respects we are ahead of them. There is the most cordial co-operation between these two specialized institutes. The hon. member says that we must not put all our eggs into one basket, but in that case we should also apply that principle to other specialized institutions; surely then it also means that it is extremely dangerous to have one central tobacco research institute where the basic research is actually done. In that case the institute should be divided into two or three or four or five sub-divisions. After all, research is not like an inflammable object which, if set alight, is going to go up in flames and consume all your available talents. I cannot understand the hon. member&#x2019;s argument; I do not agree with him. I know that we differ, but let us agree to differ. If we always had to agree with each other in this life, I do not suppose we would ever make any headway.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kroonstad made an interesting speech yesterday evening, but the matter with which he dealt really falls under the Department of Commerce and Industries and the C.S.I.R. It does not really fall under my Department.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Vryburg also discussed the question of research. He talked about the utilization of our natural pastures and to what extent it can be supplemented by the addition of minerals and trace elements. We are doing extensive research in respect of these matters. If we continue with our research a little while longer, I think we shall be in a position where we shall be able to give the farmers very much better guidance in that connection. The hon. member himself stated that one should guard against giving precipitate advice to the farmers as to what they should do.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) dealt with the better utilization of maize in animal feeds. At the ruling domestic prices it would scarcely be economic for farmers to use white or yellow, but partiularly white mealie meal, which is really milled for human consumption, in their feed mixtures. If the farmers do not produce maize themselves, it will be cheaper for them to buy maize and to mill it themselves. In that way they can then be sure that all the necessary fats and the other properties of maize go into the mixture. As I said, we are experimenting with the addition of ureum, molasses and all sorts of other things to stimulate the appetite of the animals.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Waterberg has asked me what control we have because he is perturbed about the spreading of stock diseases in South Africa, particularly from the Protectorates. We have no control over it but there is close co-operation and consultation between ourselves and the veterinarians of our neighbouring states, whether they be the Protectorates or other territories beyond our borders. I can give him the assurance that in the past two years considerable improvements have been effected and that protective measures have been taken in the Bechuanaland Protectorate istelf in order to place or to keep under control the spreading of diseases in that Protectorate, so that if they should break out again, they will not spread, as they did on the last occasion, over such a great area of this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Berea) wants to know what steps we are taking to protect people against the insecticides which are being used to keep pests and plagues under control. Those insecticides are registered by my Department, and my Department has to see to it that the regulations are properly carried out. In the case of poisonous insecticides, and many of them are poisonous, the directions for use as well as the fact that it is poisonous must be indicated very prominently on the container so that people will know precisely how to use it. Our experience has taught us that if it is correctly used according to the directions there is little danger to human beings. But the question as to how these insecticides affect human beings is really one for research by the Department of Health, which does undertake such research.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Outeniqua is not here but he talked about the resettlement of the Coloureds from the Transkei. That is a matter which really falls under the Department of Coloured Affairs and not under my Department.</p>

<p>I just want to say to the hon. member for Albany that he and I do not differ; we are agreed that the best way to combat jointed cactus is the biological method. We have sent people overseas to go and see what is being done there. We have also imported some of those insects: we are still doing so but we have simply not been able to achieve success as yet. As far as pineapple production and research are concerned, the hon. member has suggested that we should make experiments so as to be able to give guidance to our farmers. Such experiments are being conducted on our experimental farm at East London. I think he could spend a very fruitful day at that experimental farm. The hon. member also asked what we were doing in connection with the cultivation of potatoes. We are still carrying on with the cultivation and selection of disease-resisting seed potatoes, particularly at Bethlehem in the Free State and at Roodeplaat in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rustenburg has raised a matter to which we are giving very serious attention. I want to give him the assurance that careful research is being undertaken at our institute, with the assistance of scientists, amongst others, whose services have been <span class="col_6255_6256" refersTo="page_0460"/>loaned to us by one of the large tobacco manufacturers and whose salaries are being paid by them in order to determine which properties in tobacco smoke are harmful and how one can get rid of them. I might add that a very interesting experiment is being conducted at the moment by one of our large tobacco co-operative societies. This concerns the process of fermentation. The progress which is being made in that sphere may lead to very important discoveries because by applying a certain process of fermentation, a complete change is brought about in the tobacco and it is possible to separate the various properties of tobacco and to determine the content of those properties.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Harrismith has asked that more extensive use should be made of colour films. We do make extensive use of colour films at demonstrations and at gatherings of farmers. However, I shall also bear in mind the suggestion that they should also be released to schools.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister for South West Africa Affairs dealt with karakul farming in this country and pointed out the importance of this industry. I agree with him and we are very pleased that land has become available at Upington. In the future we are going to concentrate especially on karakul farming and as we become more expert we shall certainly be able to show our farmers the difference between quality and quantity at farmers&#x2019; gatherings and by way of short courses.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) complained because I had said that I was happy with the progress which had been made in connection with soil conservation. Naturally I am happy about the progress which has been made. But when I say that I am happy about the extent of the progress we have made nobody will convince me that that means that we have combated soil erosion altogether.</p>

<p>*We all know that this is a matter that we will always have to regard as a serious problem to which attention will have to be given continually. But I want to emphasize that it is not the duty of the State alone to combat soil erosion. The State&#x2019;s duty is limited to the construction of large erosion projects which are too extensive to be undertaken by the farmer himself. But the farmer is subsidized to enable him to undertake smaller projects himself. The purpose of the subsidy is not to compensate him for what he does but to serve as an incentive to the farmer to appreciate his responsibility in respect of the land and in respect of his own farm. The greatest responsibility for the implementation of soil conservation measures really rests on the farmer. I want to thank the farmers for their contributions. There are many farmers who think that once they have built a small dam and erected a fence, they have done enough and the other things are then neglected. The time has come now when we should apply the law and compel those farmers who do not do their duty to do so.</p>

<p>I merely want to ask the hon. the Minister a question. There is a reduction here of R900,000. This is in connection with advances for soil conservation works. This is a very big reduction. The whole Vote only amounts to R 1,100,000 whereas last year it amounted to R2,000,000. Will the Minister explain the reason for this reduction?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>The reason for this reduction is that we have changed our policy, as I said yesterday evening, of granting loans to farmers in advance for three years. We now grant only one-third of the loan for the first year, and as soon as the work is completed the farmer may apply again and then we give him the next instalment. We have divided the loan into instalments, and that is why the amount provided for in the Estimates for this purpose has been reduced.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half-hour? Water is the life-blood of a country and a country&#x2019;s civilized development and total population is limited to the extent of its economic availability of water supplies. It is for this reason that the conservation of water is a major question in our Republic with its low general and erratic rainfall and consequent limited flow of water in its rivers It is for this reason that the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, Water Affairs, is regarded as of major importance and why it is essential for the Minister to take the public into his confidence regarding the various schemes which the Department has on its present programme of works.

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Sir. The decision to embark upon the Orange River project has come at a most opportune time so as to give the necessary impetus to our waning industrial revolution and to ensure a supply of water for our increasing industrial civilized population. The minimum estimated <span class="col_6257_6258" refersTo="page_0461"/>civilized requirement per individual alone is 50 gallons of water per day whereas the Bushmen, for instance, can manage on a gallon a week. As our population increases in its standard of civilization so will our domestic demand for water increase out of all proportion. I am pleased that on this Vote the hon. Minister has made quite liberal provision for the subsidization for municipal and town water requirements, but I would like the hon. Minister to make a statement as regards his policy in providing water from the Orange River sources for the towns and cities which fall into the area served by this project. It is a great source of satisfaction to towns and cities if they have the Minister&#x2019;s assurance that their industrial development consequent on the Orange River scheme will be assured.</p>

<p>But that is the case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>It is assured in some instances. Port Elizabeth for instance is assured of I think something like 40,000,000 gallons a day, but the Minister has not made a comprehensive statement and that is all I am asking for at present, just a statement from the Minister as regards his policy in supplementing the water supply of the towns and cities in the areas which fall under the Orange River water project. At present it is estimated that in spite of our artificial lakes and numerous dams for municipal and individual farming purposes and our extensive irrigation scheme, something like 20,000,000 acre feet of our annual run-off in the whole of the Republic is lost to the sea, and this amounts to 15,000,000,000 gallons of water a day. These figures illustrate the advantage to our country if this water could be retained for general development and even to raise our water table, or supplement evaporation to improve thunderstorm conditions in this country. I fully agree with the late Professor Schwartz that if we had more conserved water in this country it would affect our climate and our rainfall, but it is quite ridiculous to look, for further resources of water, to the Zambesi while we possess more water than we can cope with which is now running to waste in the ocean. Now the Orange River project drains two-thirds of the total area of the Republic and in the Orange River project we have the first serious attempt to retain the greater bulk of our surplus water and the millions of tons of our top soil which find their way to the sea annually. I would like to compliment the hon. Minister and the Government that, in the Orange River project, our greatest river will be harnessed in a comprehensive multi-purpose scheme, embracing the whole of the system of this great river, something which has never before been undertaken, even with regard to our smaller rivers, in this country. Never before has a Government undertaken to harness the potential of any particular river to the extent of the present planning of the Government as regards this scheme. Now as regards my little endeavours in the earlier years, my motions before the House, proposed the creation of an Orange River authority similar to that of the Tennessee River valley and, for reasons of economy, it only proposed small dams on the Orange River to assure freedom from silting up. But the present Government scheme rises far above anything in my earlier anticipations and the present system comprising high dams and extensive silt control extending into the areas which feed this river, as envisaged by the Minister, opens up avenues of development beyond my earlier conception, and I have no doubt that a scheme of this gigantic nature is going to stabilize the economy of this country. People prattle about increased food surpluses. But we must realize that a country&#x2019;s wealth lies in its ability to feed its population adequately, for the foreseeable future, and I would say that our present food surplus is more a problem of maldistribution and because the average income is not adequate to meet the present cost of living. The Orange River project will be a factor in raising the average wage and in its comprehensiveness it will extend benefits to every section of our population throughout the Republic. Our present surpluses would disappear if adequate food subsidization, like in the case of bread, were provided, and this expenditure would in no way embarrass the taxpayer because all sections would benefit.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, in regard to the 5,000,000 acre feet, the estimated supplementation of waters to the Orange River project from Basutoland, we need have no anxiety at all. There is no extent of irrigable soil in Basutoland to warrant any major irrigation scheme, and besides that our Republic holds an international prescriptive right on the waters of Basutoland and in regard to the disposal of this water. I only make this remark, but perhaps the hon. Minister can supplement it. But we enthusiasts behind the scheme, are always confronted with this question: &#x201C;What about Basutoland, what about buying their water?&#x201D; Sir, it is the water of our own great river and we have as much right to that water as the people of Basutoland, but they would have a right to use it economically for their needs. As I have stated, however, there is no irrigable soil in any part of Basutoland to warrant any irrigation scheme of major importance. So we need have no fear in regard to the limited amount of water from Basutoland, which is 5,000,000 acre feet, affecting this great Orange River project. Of course this is a matter the Minister may refer to, but because he may regard it as a delicate international question, I felt I would be justified in making a few remarks on this claim which is being pushed up to us in the Press by individuals who do not know what they are talking about.</p>

<p>The Ruigte Valley Dam will be the key to Orange River development from which all water supplies will be regulated, and it will also provide the facilities of an inland lake. I do not know if the Minister stated this, but I <span class="col_6259_6260" refersTo="page_0462"/>want to say that when you have a permanent source of supply, very much less water is necessary for irrigation because it can be rationed out more logically and when particularly required, and when a water supply is permanent, the Minister may even find in some places that it will be necessary to introduce compulsory spray irrigation, which is the best type of irrigation.</p>

<p>You only need a fraction of water as compared to the ordinary flooded irrigation, it is more beneficial, it draws in the properties of the air, it has the effect more or less of rainfall which is much better than the ordinary flood method, and it will bring about a much lower use of water. You see, Mr. Chairman, we have to think about this water from the Orange River because we realize that it will have to be available not only for irrigation purposes, as most people think. I imagine that two-thirds of the water of the Orange River will have to be used for industrial and human purposes. As I have said, we have anxieties and questions regarding the carrying out of the Orange River project, and therefore we would appreciate a statement of a comprehensive nature from the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>On our Estimates the Minister of Lands has been provided with some millions of rand for the purchase of land to be submerged under the Orange River project, and I want to ask the Minister of Irrigation if he is satisfied that this land will be available in time for him to absorb the R3,700,000 voted for his particular Orange River project works. One does regret that in a matter of this nature the responsibility comes under several Ministers. We have the Minister of Health, and the Minister of Lands and the Minister of Water Affairs, and even other Ministers who all have to share in this responsibility, and that always is a delaying factor. We would be very happy if the Minister were to say that he has no doubt that he is going to spend the R3,700,000 in regard to the Orange River project during this coming financial year. We would appreciate it if the Minister would inform the House that, in view of the numerous other schemes under departmental control, if the Orange River development works are to be carried out by contract and if international tenders will be invited. We would also appreciate it if the hon. Minister could say how soon the Minister expects to be able to advertise for tenders. The country has had its imagination fired by this great proposition, and if the Minister will give us as much detailed information as is available regarding his plans and the estimated time in which the various stages of the scheme will be completed, it will be very much appreciated. The public are hungering for information. This is one of the greatest development projects ever envisaged in this country and it embraces so much that I do appeal to the Minister to give us all the information he can. He has been very, very good in the past. I must say he has made no secret of his intentions. But even if we accept his sincerity and the correctness of what he has said, a little repetition for the benefit of the public would be of particular value. We realize the enormous amount of work that has been thrown onto his staff and the overtime many have had to put in, and we are deeply appreciative of this work and the great achievement of the Department to bring in the plans of this project. We appreciate the expedition with which they have provided these plans and specifications, and we deplore, with the Minister, the limited staff and the limited increase that has been brought about in the personnel. If the Minister can give us any encouraging information regarding the response for the advertising for engineers in this country and overseas, we would be pleased. We would like to know if the remuneration offered by the Minister compares favourably with that say of Great Britain. Perhaps the Minister could explain his scheme regarding bursaries for engineer-pupils. Are these in any way bound to the Department by contract? We notice that the Minister provides bursaries for a two-month period of study each year for about 60 engineering pupils. The sum voted is such that there could be two batches of 60 pupils in one year, and I wonder if the Minister could inform us whether the bursaries are going to be applied to two batches of students per annum, and if in any way these students will be committed to serve the Minister&#x2019;s Department, and if an individual student perhaps would be able to participate, in one year, in the two periods if such are provided.</p>

<p>I do not want to delay the House any longer because this is a very interesting subject, and I would like everyone who wants to speak to have an opportunity to do so. But quite apart from the scheme I would like to ask the Minister to give us some information in regard to our underground water supplies. We do think of course that the Orange River project is going to be of material value as regards the raising of our water table and improving our underground water supplies. I hope people will appreciate that. Unfortunately people who bore for water imagine that their source of underground water is from the Zambesi whereas it is only from the local area. The Minister now has returns regarding every borehole made in this country, and I wonder if the Minister is having a report prepared by his Department as regards our subterranean waters, especially with a view to preventing over-boring and the waste of water. I imagine that surplus water from boreholes should be run back down the borehole. I even think that it is possible where there are water supplies, that one cannot make any further use of, one can direct them underground and supplement our underground stored waters which are moderately free from vaporation. But I do feel that people should be impressed by the limited extent of our underground waters in certain areas, even in the Kalahari where the water underground has accumulated <span class="col_6261_6262" refersTo="page_0463"/>over thousands of years and, in many instances, it is being pumped out at a very much higher rate than the source of present supply can stand. But I do not want to expand on a question of minor importance when we are anxious for the Minister to rather spend what time he has in this debate on the Orange River project and to enlighten us, wherever he can, and encourage us and build up the enthusiasm which is necessary in every way, even as regards the financing of the scheme. A lot depends on the general enthusiasm of the public and that is one reason why I do feel that we can assist this great endeavour by having the whole of the public behind us, no ideas of rivalry between sections. We have one great project in view and we are all going to stand by and support it being carried out, regardless of minor disadvantages some people may have to suffer in a development of this nature. Our sympathy goes to the people who perhaps have to lose their land, who have to sell land which will fall within the submerged areas, etc. But above their private needs, there is the great national need, this great national scheme as envisaged by the Minister, and we look forward to the reply of the Minister to this debate.</p>

<p>During the discussion of the Votes of this hon. Minister, a number of requests and representations have already been made to him and I expect that more will follow. I also want to make two requests of the hon. the Minister. My first request is in connection with the Van Rhyneveld Pass Dam. My request is that the hon. the Minister should give his immediate attention to having the wall of that dam raised. After a long dry period when there has been very little water in the dam, when there has been a water shortage, it has happened over the past two years that the dam has twice overflowed. It was wonderful to watch the water flowing over the top of the dam and it was a reassuring sight to the users of that water because they knew that they would have water for a long time. But what was shocking and tragic to see was how the water that flowed away was lost. If one considers that that water could perhaps have been conserved, it is even more shocking to think of the waste of that water. When that dam was originally planned and designed and built, it was built in such a way that its wall could be raised. We know that provision is made under the Orange River plan for the raising of that wall as well. That is why I am sure that I am not asking the impossible. You know, Mr. Chairman, that when that dam was built its capacity was fixed at 64,000 acre feet. Since that time it has silted up to such an extent that its capacity is now only about 42,000 acre feet. It is possible to raise the height of that wall and if the wall is raised by from six to ten feet, it is estimated that this will bring the dam back to its original capacity. Once the dam has been brought back to its original capacity and is filled during a good rainy season, we will have sufficient water to last us until the Orange River flows into the Van Rhyneveld Pass Dam. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give us the assurance now that he will not wait until the Orange River eventually does flow into the Van Rhyneveld Pass Dam but that he will have that dam wall raised in order to assist us until such time as that water flows into the dam.</p>

<p>My second request deals with the subsidization of irrigation dams. According to the old formula we know that a one-third subsidy to a maximum amount of R600 per dam unit can be granted. This formula has been used now for many years and we feel that the formula is no longer suited to the times in which we live because when that formula was drawn up this work could be done far more cheaply. To-day a dam costs twice or three times as much as it cost to build a number of years ago. Because of floods in my constituency a number of dams in the district of Murraysburg were washed away. Subsidies were paid on those dams. The flood took place in 1961. Great damage was caused and the farmers sent a stream of requests to the Department. The Nucleus Committee considered the matter and the Cabinet decided to assist those farmers and to pay them a higher subsidy to repair those works. But fate struck again and on 17 January of this year the same dams were washed away and greater damage was caused than was caused in 1961. Now they are back again on the old subsidy and the farmers feel that they have not had the benefit of those dams. Not only have they suffered damage but in the meantime they have experienced a severe drought. They are now asking the hon. the Minister to increase that formula. I do not want to prescribe to the hon. the Minister how that formula should be increased but we ask respectfully and urgently that he should consider raising the subsidy per dam unit. We hope and trust that these two matters will receive the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I want to deal firstly with the question of pollution, not so much in relation to the sea&#x2014;I want to come back to that&#x2014;but in connection with the new Orange River scheme and the development which is foreshadowed up there. I think one must realize that as that scheme develops, raw materials will be produced in that area (I think it is fair to say that) and these raw materials will draw industries to the areas of production, because that is the tendency all over the world. If raw materials are produced in quantities, processing plants of all sorts then tend to go to the areas of production&#x2014; because that gives them an economic basis. In this connection I would like to ask the Minister what attention has been paid to that aspect of the future industrial development associated with the Orange River scheme. I leave the agricultural side of it alone for a moment because the agriculture will provide the basic raw materials. But what attention has been paid to the aspect of pollution of <span class="col_6263_6264" refersTo="page_0464"/>the river waters? You know, Mr. Chairman, it was once said before the Select Committee on the Water Bill when we were sitting as we did for some three years, and it was said in a spirit of jest, but I am wondering whether one of these days someone is not going to take it seriously, and that was that the suggestion was made that in respect of some of the industries where difficulty was arising and there was trouble in respect of their effluent, because of the difficulty of getting a suitable chemical formula to provide for the adequate purification of the effluents, it might be desirable to provide that effluents from a factory must be returned to the river source above the point of intake of the factory concerned so that it would bring back into its own circulation system the effluents which it was itself producing. That was put up originally as a joke, but I think that one of these days we are going to find that it is not so funny after all, and somebody is going to say: The only way of getting past this difficulty of finding chemical formulae to provide for adequate purification of the water is to make the factories consume their own effluents, and if they do not purify that water to a standard which is going to permit of re-use, then the answer is that they themselves will have to suffer instead of making the public suffer. I am not putting forward the suggestion that the Minister should give practical implementation to it at the present time, but I do realize that if the development of the Orange River scheme is to follow the lines that have been indicated, then a very early application by the Department concerned of the principles of the purification of water from the industries which of necessity must establish themselves in that area, will have to be attended to.</p>

<p>I want to now, if I may, come for a moment to this question of the pollution of the sea. I am not going to deal with individual cases, or any particular instance, but I am just simply going to say that I think that since the Water Act was put on the Statute Book we have come to realize some of the difficulties which the Minister and his Department have to contend with, and as a matter of fact our Select Committee realized at the time that these difficulties would be experienced. I do not know how far sea pollution can continue before there will be a much louder outcry than there is at present.</p>

<p>I am not suggesting that any industry is worse than any other industry in that respect. I am dealing with the principle of pollution in general. My point is that there seems to be growing up in some quarters a belief that if you are in trouble about polluting the rivers one way of overcoming the difficulty is to take it into the sea by a long pipeline and there is no provision in the law which permits the Minister to schedule industries on the basis that their effluents have a toxic effect on either marine life or aquatic life&#x2014;not necessarily on living organisms but a toxic effect on the flora, on plant life, which is a very important aspect, as against the other category of industries whose effluents are not toxic either to the fauna or the flora. Therefore the Minister&#x2019;s Department must make the dividing line simply <i>ad hoc</i> in respect of every individual case which comes before them, on the basis of whether it has toxic qualities in its effluent or not. But effluent discharge far into the sea does not lose its toxic qualities. Now that we have reached this stage in our industrial development, I should like the Minister to do something about making it clear that we will not stand for the discharge of toxic effluents into the sea simply because that is the way of overcoming the complaints which are raised when it is discharged into the rivers or into the area of turbulence on our coasts. The fact is that some of the effluent being discharged into the area of turbulence is discharged much too close to the shore, and if it is only taken deeper into the sea we do not know what effects it may have on our fish life. It is something we cannot view with equanimity. I think the Minister should make a statement on it.</p>

<p>This brings me to the next point and that is that the Minister will realize that with the political developments taking place on our eastern seaboard, on the whole of that seaboard from north to south, the bulk of the major rivers run through the Bantu areas and control of those rivers and of the industries to be established on those rivers is likely to pass out of his hands. Not only will the control of the effluent pass out of his hands, but also the control of the water and I want the Minister to bear that in mind when he looks at his future policy for the Republic as a whole. Here is a situation developing where history will repeat itself in exactly the same way as we have seen in other countries and we need go no further than to see what took place in regard to the waters of the Indus and the disputes that arose in regard to the Nile waters. Here we are facing conditions which we created ourselves, where the bulk of the water running to waste on our eastern seaboard will be beyond our control and perhaps the Minister will make a statement in that regard.</p>

<p>As important as the provision of water is for the development of agriculture in the irrigation areas, is it important in those tested stock-raising areas for the development of the stock-raising industry. The development of agricultural industry under irrigation has reached wonderful heights during the past years and has become very profitable. There has been fantastic development in our crop-producing areas, the wheat-and maize-producing areas and we know that the highest agricultural income is to-day derived from maize. The development of our best stock-raising areas has, however, continually been hampered by a lack of water. Droughts which were precisely more prevalent in those areas have seriously hampered the development of our stock-raising industry in both the Cape Province and in the Transvaal. The most important problem to the stock farmer is to have water on every farm and in every camp for <span class="col_6265_6266" refersTo="page_0465"/>his stock and if he has that it is also the most effective counter-measure against the tramping out of his veld and against erosion of his veld. The Department of Water Affairs has done a great deal lately in this connection and we are very grateful when we think of it that the State has been responsible for 20 per cent of the drilling operations in the country, that generous subsidies are provided, that research is continually conducted in regard to the provision of drilling machines, especially the pneumatic drills. I wish, however, to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that a very important statement is expected of him in regard to the revision of the new and stringent drilling regulations which came into operation last year. As the hon. the Minister knows those regulations caused an upheaval in the proclaimed areas and voices were raised everywhere against them. The regulations to which exception was taken were, <i>inter alia,</i> the following: firstly, the doing away of dry drilling units at State expense, as was the position in the past; secondly, the almost drastically high tariffs which are far higher than private drilling tariffs in most areas of the country; the elimination of small farm units of less than 30 morgen as proclaimed drilling areas; the elimination of drilling units under 100 feet for subsidies. Those were the matters in regard to which serious objections were raised. The farming group of the National Party in this House knew of the widespread and serious objections raised over the whole country and a small committee, the Drilling Committee, was appointed with instructions to submit a memorandum to the Minister. That was done under the leadership of the hon. member for Vryburg and myself and on the occasion of a visit by the Minister to Lichtenburg a representative deputation approached him under the leadership of the hon. member tor Lichtenburg and myself and they submitted well-motivated suggestions to him and asked, <i>inter alia,</i> that the new drilling regulations should be revised and relaxed in their entirety; that the drilling tariffs, which were absolutely too high, should be revised and reduced at least to the level charged by private drills in those areas; that the State should once again as in the past undertake the costs attached to dry boreholes or that a scheme should at least be evolved whereby tariffs should be determined on a sliding scale based on the strength of the water and the depth of the borehole and that the State should, in this way, once again carry a share of the costs of dry boreholes. As an alternative it was suggested to the Minister that there should be an arrangement whereby the State paid for the first dry water hole and that the farmer should contribute, on an increasing scale, towards the succeeding holes. More geologists were also insisted upon. It was emphasized that any positive concession should be of retrospective effect so it would not have a discriminatory effect on those people who had drilled in the meantime. The people affected in the dry stock-raising areas are anxiously awaiting an announcement by the Minister. During recent visits to those areas various farmers&#x2019; unions have insisted that if he revised the new drilling regulations any concessions by the Minister should be of retrospective effect. If it is impossible to make them of retrospective effect we should like to have a very clear explanation from the Minister why that is not practically possible. In the first place they want an explanation in regard to the wiping out of the imaginary line which has been dividing the country since 1910 between proclaimed water drilling areas and unproclaimed areas and the effect of that on the financing of State drilling in the Republic. It would be greatly appreciated if the Minister would give the facts in this regard in his reply.</p>

<p>Then I want to raise another matter which is always very dear to my heart, namely, that the Minister and his Department must observe and apply the principle when new irrigation schemes are considered for irrigation purposes always to give preference to the smaller schemes over and above larger ones because that means that more farmers throughout the country get the benefit of State irrigation schemes for agricultural purposes.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Before lunch I had dealt with three matters on which I asked the Minister to reply in due course. Now I come to another matter, and that is in connection with the control of amenities and facilities in connection with the dams built by the Irrigation Department. There are a number of these dams providing very fine stretches of water. I think, e.g., of the Sand River Dam in the Free State, which is the central feature of the Willem Pretorius Game Reserve, and the wonderful manner in which the Free State Administration has developed it and made it into one of the show places in South Africa. The land comes under the Minister of Water Affairs, and not under the Lands Department, and I merely ask for a statement from the Minister as to whether consideration is still being given to the future control of these areas, or whether a decision has been arrived at. I say that because I know various Departments are involved in the matter and some meetings have taken place. The Minister of Education, Arts and Science actually established a committee to investigate the use of these areas for recreational purposes. Then the provinces come into it and the Lands Department and also the Department of Health, for providing proper health facilities, but the control is vested in the Minister of Water Affairs.</p>

<p>One last point. I wonder whether the Minister will tell us precisely where we stand in regard to the Hluhluwe River Dam and the whole of the St. Lucia Lake system. This dam involves a far great problem, namely the future of the St. Lucia Lake system which is fed by a <span class="col_6267_6268" refersTo="page_0466"/>number of rivers, or rather I call them rivers through courtesy because in the main now they have ceased to flow because water has been drawn off by various people and in any case in the dry years these rivers tended to be very low. The St. Lucia Lake system provides one of the big attractions not only for South Africans but for people from overseas. It is the biggest salt lake in the Republic and as far as the amenities are concerned they are of more than normal public interest. May I say in passing, so that hon. members will not think that I am adopting a parochial attitude, that we in Natal do not look upon St. Lucia as being our private property but as something which is held in trust for the nation, and I think it is in very good hands, the hands of the Provincial Administration of Natal. The future of that area is not a matter which should be determined lightly with inadequate investigation and insufficient facts on which to base a long-term policy. The Natal Parks Board was on the point of establishing a marine biological survey on the whole system to see how far the deprivation of fresh water from the lake system would lead to the building of up salinity in the main lake and the adjoining water areas and whether that would have a deleterious effect on marine life. If the Minister can tell us the present position, he may perhaps set our minds at rest, and perhaps he can establish a Government policy which we can all support. There is nothing that worries me more than to find that there are divided counsels in regard to the preservation of this important heritage of ours. I hope I will have the backing of all hon. members when I say that in a matter such as this we should go ahead very carefully, step by step, and only after a careful survey has been made by a qualified scientist. If that is done, we may all be able to put our weight behind Government policy, secure in the knowledge that we have had the best advice possible.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to a problem in my constituency&#x2014;the Waterval River irrigation scheme. There are 84 families living along that river who irrigate 2,677 morgen with water from the river. There is usually sufficient water in the summer months but in the three dry months, from August to October, the water in the river dries up and those people suffer a great deal of damage because the crops on the lands can no longer be irrigated. Unfortunately, these three months are the most important months of the year to those farmers. Citrus fruit, wheat and vegetables are the main crops produced there. These people have been agitating now for the past 30 years for a storage dam to be built in the river. Various sites have been investigated over the course of years but four of them appeared to be uneconomic for the building of the dam because the catchment area was not large enough. But three years ago another site was investigated, the last site in the river, which has a very large catchment area, and according to the investigation that was made that site will be able to supply the needs of those people. According to statistics that were compiled and investigations that were made, those farmers need about 1,000 morgen feet of water to assist them over the three difficult months. This dam will be able to supply those 1,000 morgen feet and the estimated cost of the dam wall is r200,000 which will bring the cost to about R 100,000 per morgen, which is very economic. The Department is now investigating that site. The Department has always been very sympathetic and has helped where it could. If the result of this investigation is favourable, this work will be placed on the list of approved works. Then it will be the duty of the hon. the Minister to see that that dam is built. If that investigation is favourable, I want to ask him now to approve of that work as soon as possible so that a start will be made on the building of that dam as soon as possible. Millions of rand per annum are spent on the rehabilitation of farmers and here a large farming community can be assisted out of its difficulty at comparatively small expense. A little over 2,000 morgen can then be irrigated under that dam. The whole river irrigates 2,677 morgen but the rest is above that dam site. I want to make a very earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to assist us to ensure that that work is carried out as soon as possible. There is another community in my constituency which is smaller than the one I have just mentioned. This affects 27 farmers and plus/minus 800 morgen. I am referring to the proposed Vyfhoek scheme. This scheme is still being investigated. The conditions there are very difficult. Most of those farmers have already left their land. They have gone to seek a living elsewhere. They work there on the local mines and on the roads because they cannot stay on their farms any longer. The position has of course been particularly difficult there over the past few years but in normal years the people there do not have sufficient water either and they can also be assisted out of their difficulty at reasonably small expense. We will really appreciate it very much indeed if the hon. the Minister can help us in this by ensuring that these works are accelerated and built as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Before I come to the main subject which I want to raise this afternoon I want to speak about the Minister&#x2019;s new policy in regard to the putting down of boreholes and the subsidization of boreholes. Previously it was the policy of the Department to let a farmer pay for the cost of drilling where water was found in a borehole. I believe that that has been changed and that the farmer now has to pay for every borehole whether water is found or not. This is a matter of considerable concern to the farmers and I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he should consider going back to the old policy, which is to make the farmers pay perhaps an increased rate for boreholes in which a satisfactory amount of water is actually found.</p>

<p><span class="col_6269_6270" refersTo="page_0467"/>Then, secondly, I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to something in connection with the Vaalhartz irrigation scheme, something which has been brought to my notice by people living there, and that is that people who are in possession of plots there at the present time say that if they wished to buy a second plot they are allowed to do so, but the point is that they do not get an allocation of water for the second plot, so there is no sense in their buying it. Of course, their complaint is that farmers come from other areas and buy plots there, and any outsider who buys a plot there gets an allocation of water, but if he already possesses a plot and finds that he cannot make a good living because in most of these cases, as the hon. the Minister will agree, as the Minister of Lands has done, these plots are on the small side, then if he does manage to buy an adjacent plot, he cannot get an allocation of water for the second plot. I should like the hon. the Minister to give his attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The subject which I really want to raise here this afternoon, is the question of the Tugela River and the conservation of water in the Tugela basin. I need hardly remind the Minister that a former Prime Minister of this country spoke in glowing terms of the Tugela valley and of the possibilities in that area. He will know of the report which has been brought out in regard to the Tugela basin, which points out all the possibilities in that area. The Prime Minister to whom I have referred, the late Mr. Strijdom, talked about settling 6,500,000 people in the Tugela basin. The report which I have here, the Thornton Smith Report which is a very interesting document proves that that is true. This Tugela basin has a huge potential for farming under irrigation, which can be done without prejudicing any long-term industrialization proposals&#x2014; and that only with the water which comes from the upper catchment are of the Tugela River. This report says that the water coming from the upper catchment area alone is sufficient to supply all the principal cities and towns of the Republic and would meet all industrial and population growth for the next 35 years. There are also vast coal reserves in that area; the anthracite alone is thought to be ample for the next 140 years, and the basin is well suited to accommodate industrial development on a very large scale. In these circumstances I think the Minister will agree with me that some attention must be given to that river. Sir, I know that the Minister&#x2019;s Department is very busy indeed with the Orange River scheme. I do not want the Minister&#x2019;s Department to apply itself solely to the Orange River scheme, because, as I have said, no less a person than a former Prime Minister of this country has pointed out the huge potential of the Tugela basin. May I just quote from this report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Lying beneath the scenically magnificent wall of the high Drakensberg, the catchment receives the lion&#x2019;s share of the run-off of the berg. At Ladysmith is the main railway junction of inland Natal, with lines leading off to the port of Durban and the goldfields of the Witwatersrand and the Orange Free State&#x2026;</block>

<p>It goes on to say that the water in this area &#x201C;is still sufficient if devoted entirely to urban use, to support the catchment&#x2019;s 8 First Stage Industrial Projects, 10,500 acres of Second Stage Projects, and a dependent population of over 6,250,000 people&#x201D;. Sir, this is a matter which should be regarded as of very great importance indeed. I raised this matter some years ago with the hon. the Minister. I have seen a report here and there but I am sorry to say that I have seen no evidence of large-scale attention that the Government is giving to this vast catchment area in what is one of the biggest rivers in South Africa, one of the rivers situated, as this report says in beautiful scenic surroundings, in an area where the land is most fertile. I think with the expenditure of a minimum amount of money on it, this basin could support a vast population. Sir, it is my firm belief that a minimum amount of money would be needed for this project, when one compares it to the Orange River scheme. I think one will find that one does not need to spend half the amount of capital which it is proposed to spend on the Orange River scheme. I would go so far as to say that one would only have to spend a quarter of that amount. The development of this basin would mean a very great deal to South Africa. It would mean a very great deal to the towns in that area, and as I have said already if it is sufficiently developed, it will have enough water for industrial development over the next 35 years. There is coal in abundance there; there is an abundant supply of labour and the land in this basin is most fertile.</p>

<p>When the Orange River scheme was announced last year, everyone was impressed by the thorough planning that was behind that scheme on the part of the Department of Water Affairs. A year has now gone by and we are approaching the initial stages of the development of the scheme. Quite recently the hon. the Minister announced who the consulting engineers were who would be involved in this matter. I want to thank the hon. the Minister and his Department for the careful planning that has gone into the allocation of this work and for the share that our South African engineering firms have received in the great task that lies ahead. I express this gratitude to the hon. the Minister and his Department on behalf of a profession in our country which is not always recognized, a profession that does good work but which works in silence, <i>a</i> profession whose work actually forms monuments but a profession which receives little credit for that work.</p>

<p>The Orange River scheme is not the first nor will it be the last large water scheme in our country and we are also pleased to know that it is the policy of the hon. the Minister and his Department not to forget the other <span class="col_6271_6272" refersTo="page_0468"/>schemes. That is why the opportunity of having a share in the Orange River scheme gives our engineers the chance to gain experience, together with the experience that is obtained from abroad, for the great tasks which lie ahead in respect of water conservation in our country. One of the areas of our country which has not been water conservation conscious in the past and. which has had to rely upon its natural rainfall, is the Boland, the winter rainfall area. For this reason there has been little demand in the past for water to be conserved in this part of our country. Apart from the requests that have been forthcoming recently from that part of the country to conserve our water, I want to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister and his Department for their far-sightedness in realizing that this part of the country which has a more or less regular rainfall during each winter can also be developed far more if some of the water that runs into the sea during the rainy period can be conserved and if that water can be utilized. During the past year or so various new works have been announced in the winter rainfall area. Last year we heard of the raising of the wall of the Olifants River Dam at Clanwilliam; a few days ago certain new works were again announced. Last year there was also the dam in the Hex River Valley and recently the scheme at Montague was announced. So there are also other parts within the Western Cape winter rainfall area where the conservation of water which can be added in the dry summer months to the winter rain that we receive more or less regularly, can lead to great developments in this area. That part of the country has in the first place to rely upon its agricultural resources to carry its population, and any industries that may arise there, as far as we see the position to-day, can only be those industries that can be based on the agricultural products cultivated there. For that reason, if we want to see our population increasing in this area and if we want a larger number of our people concentrated on the platteland of the Western Cape, then it is clear to us that the best use will have to be made of the rivers in the winter rainfall area. We are grateful to know&#x2014;representations have been forthcoming from various districts and various quarters&#x2014;that the hon. the Minister and his Department view the matter in a very broad perspective. In other words, the Western Cape is seen as an area which must be developed as a whole. I want to ask the hon. the Minister and his Department to see the matter in this light&#x2014;that no particular scheme within the Western Cape should be the only sceme that should be tackled but that the Western Cape must be seen together with all its comprehensive requirements; that the various schemes lying within this area and holding possibilities must be planned together, just as the Department planned the Orange River scheme in a comprehensive manner, a scheme that will be to the benefit of a large part of our country.</p>

<p>I would like to refer in the first place to the question of the supply of water on the irrigation lots at the Vaalhartz irrigation scheme. If my information is right, up to 1948, 24 inches of water was supplied annually to these irrigation lots, and round about 1949 the supply was increased to 30 inches per annum, and recently it was reduced again by 25 per cent, which brings it down to inches. Sir, I find it very difficult to understand why after years of experimenting and after years of experience at Vaalhartz the Department after having increased the water supply from 24 to 30 inches, should now reduce it to 221/2 inches. [Interjection.] I do not know why the hon. member should think that he is the only person who has anything to do with Vaalhartz. We are also interested in South Africa, and it is not the sole prerogative of the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) to take an interest in Vaalhartz. He is not the only one who is interested in the people of South Africa. At any rate, he will have an opportunity to reply. I want to say quite candidly that it would appear to me that somewhere round about 1948 election promises were probably made. We know that all irrigators are not satisfied with the amount of water which the Department of Water Affairs recommend. Usually they want more water. They are seldom satisfied and pressure is always exerted to increase the supply of water. I am not trying to insinuate anything; I am saying bluntly that it would appear to me that political pressure was brought to bear in order to get an increase, and now after a lapse of time the water supply has again been decreased.</p>

<p>&#x0129; want to make a few remarks about another matter which was raised last year by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), and that is in connection with the diversion of water from the Orange River to the Fish River. Let me just shortly recapitulate the facts. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs mentioned in this House in March 1959 that the Government had no intention whatsoever of diverting waters from the Orange River to the Fish River valley, and thereafter the Department bought up the land from certain plot owners along the Fish River valley at round about &#x00A3;150 per morgen. Shortly thereafter the scheme was announced and there was, of course, tremendous dissatisfaction amongst those people who had sold their plots. The Government then announced that they could buy back their plots at the price which they had been paid. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) reacted very strongly to the case put forward by the hon. member for Yeoville. He said that the hon. member for Yeoville had not painted the picture correctly; that he had not mentioned the fact that the Minister had said that they could buy back their plots. This is what the hon. member for Vereeniging said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar sou substansie in sy argument gewees het indien die Regering so &#x2019;n lelike ding gedoen het om &#x00A3;150 vir grond aan te bied wetende dat hulle binnekort water <span class="col_6273_6274" refersTo="page_0469"/>daarheen gaan bring wat die waarde sal opstoot tot &#x00A3;475. Ek s&#x00EA; dit sou die laagste ding gewees het wat die Minister kon gedoen het. Maar nadat die Minister sy skema aangekondig het, het hy ges&#x00EA;: &#x201E;Ek het vir julle &#x00A3;150 per morg betaal vir grond wat sal opgaan in waarde tot &#x00A3;475, &#x00A3;400 en &#x00A3;500, en van julle wat dink ek het julle onbillik behandel, kan julle grond terugkoop teen dieselfde prys as wat julle daarvoor betaal is.&#x201D;</block>

<p>As I was saying, the hon. member for Vereeniging reacted very strongly and this is what he said. The hon. member for Yeoville replied to that and said that that promise was valueless. Sir, what was the promise? The promise was that they could buy back their plots at the same price. I want to quote now from the <i>Landbou Weekblad</i> of 17 July 1962 (after this debate): This is what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Cradockse boer wat by die Departement aansoek gedoen het om sy besproeiingshoewe van die Staat terug te koop, is meegedeel dat sy aansoek op die volgende voorwaardes oorweeg sal word: Die prys vir die terugkoop sal die prys wees wat deur die Staat aan hom betaal is, met byvoeging van oordragkoste en die rente op die kapitaal sedert hy dit ontvang het; die koopsom moet in kontant betaal word by registrasie van oordrag; die plaas sal voetstoots verkoop word soos dit nou is, sonder enige waterregte en die koper sal sy eie reelings vir water moet tref en die voornemende koper moet binne drie weke amptelik aansoek doen om terug te koop. Aangesien die Visrivier-besproeiingsraad reeds bekend gemaak het dat hy nie uitgekoopte plase weer vir waterregte sal skeduleer nie, is daar maar min hoop dat die boer wat sy grond terugkoop, binne afsienbare tyd water sal kry. Boere verklaar dat niemand volgens hierdie voorwaardes daaraan sal dink om hul grond terug te koop nie.</block>

<p>I want to make the point that the hon. member for Yeoville was perfectly right when he said that that promise, in view of the conditions attached to it was valueless, because those plots are of no value to the owners if there are no water rights attached to them. The hon. member for Yeoville was perfectly right therefore, and I repeat that this whole process was a scandal.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to a few matters. I think that he will agree with me that it is generally accepted that the industrial potential of northern Natal, is practically unlimited. The difficulty there lies in the shortage of water. We have two fairly large rivers there, the Buffalo River which carries down silt and the Pivan River, one of the finest, one of the most constant and non-silt-bearing rivers in northern Natal. I want to ask the hon. the Minister&#x2014;I think that they are busy with it&#x2014;to complete the survey of the Pivan River as soon as possible. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that there was such a water shortage last year in Vryheid, one of the most important towns in northern Natal that industry practically came to a standstill. There are persons who are anxious to set up industries there but they cannot do so because sufficient water is not available.</p>

<p>Another matter which is very serious is the pollution of the Black Umfolozi by the coal mines. This pollution has been taking place for some years now. Action is taken against the mines and they do rectify things for a while but with the first storm, those rivers become so polluted that if sheep walk through the river, the wool on their stomachs falls off; all the fish die and the farmers simply cannot irrigate their citrus orchards and other lands. The water is not slightly polluted. It is so badly polluted that when I myself collected some water in a bottle just below Louwsburg, there was a deposit of about three inches of coal ash in the bottle. The farmers inform me that when there are storms, particularly in the Coronation area, the river is not merely slightly polluted but black deposits are left right down to its mouth. This not only affects the vegetation and the people living on the banks, but it also affects the fish life in that river. I have again been informed that the river has again been seriously polluted and I will greatly appreciate it if the hon. the Minister will put his foot down and compel those mines to take the necessary steps to ensure that no pollution takes place there in the future. It is of no avail for the mines merely to use a purification process. Their slag heaps are placed in such a way that when there is a storm, the storm water carries those slag heaps with it and it all finds its way into the river. Not only must they ensure that those slag heaps are not washed into the river but all the future slag heaps of the mines must be situated in such places that it will not be possible for the storm water to carry the slag into the river.</p>

<p>I think that the Orange River scheme has been hailed with great satisfaction in all parts of the country and there is no doubt that the scheme has very great possibilities. But there are signs today that under the administration of this Government the danger exists that this scheme can degenerate into a worthless thing in the near future if matters continue as they are at <span class="col_6275_6276" refersTo="page_0470"/>the moment. I think mat the hon. the Minister should consider the advisability, as we on this side have suggested, of bringing an Orange River authority into being for this great scheme like the Tennessee Valley authority in America. When an authority of this nature is established, we do not want to see the control over the Orange River scheme being taken away from Parliament. To tell the truth, I would like to see parliamentary control being strengthened by, for example, regularly referring the essential parts of that scheme to a Select Committee of this House, as we have a Select Committee on irrigation matters. We can retain parliamentary control but we can also ensure that the whole scheme is properly administered if we have something similar to the Tennessee Valley authority&#x2014;an Orange River authority.</p>

<p>I notice from the Estimates that up to 31 March a sum of R500,000 has already been spent in the form of capital. Where are the works on which that R500,000 was spent? Where are those capital works? On what was that amount of R500,000 spent? We want to know what has been done with the country&#x2019;s money up to the present. We have known about that scheme now for more than a year and let us admit that the Government have hardly done anything about it as yet. The appointment of the consulting engineers was delayed; there was delay with the plans; a delay in all respects.</p>

<p>The whole thing got off to a bad start because the hon. the Minister never consulted the important Economic Advisory Council which the hon. the Prime Minister specially appointed. There are representatives of the Federated Chamber of Industries, the Institute of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce and the agricultural unions serving on that council. That would surely have been the appropriate body to consult in working out this scheme, not only from the point of view of the Department of Water Affairs but from the point of view of all the various Departments who are interested in this great scheme. That was the first mistake that was made. When the hon. the Prime Minister explained the scope of his Economic Advisory Council to this House he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The new machinery need only function when the implementation of my own responsibility as the co-ordinator in the Cabinet demanded it, and this was usually, in fact, only problems which do not clearly or exclusively fall within the sphere of a particular Department only but affect more than one Department.</block>

<p>This is clearly a matter for more than one Department. Of all the wrong signs that we see on the horizon in connection with this great and fine scheme, the mistakes which have been made are to be found in the granting of contracts. I believe that the South African contractors and South African consulting engineers did not receive their fair share of these contracts. I believe that insufficient notice was given throughout South Africa to consulting engineers to enable them to apply for a share in this scheme. I know that the professional and official organizations were informed in this regard but when the hon. the Minister advertised for civil consulting engineers abroad, he also advertised in the newspapers overseas and he asked all the professional organizations to ask their members to participate in this scheme. I want to know how those contracts were entered into. The standard professional way in which a contract of that nature is entered into is to make use of consulting engineers, of consulting engineers who then approach large construction firms. I have heard that in this case many of those contracts with consulting engineers were entered into not in a professional way but through other persons who were appointed, possibly by the Department of Water Affairs. I want to know what happened in connection with the contracts that were concluded; I also want to know how they were concluded I know how much was paid to the persons concluding those contracts. I make no accusation, but I want to know how the contracts were concluded, what commission was paid and what expenses were incurred in connection with those contracts.</p>

<p>I do not want to mention any names but I want to mention one example of what I have in mind. I have here a confidential report in connection with one of these overseas&#x2019; firms that was appointed. In this report I find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The firm has not until very recently supervised the construction of work in the strict legal sense as required in the contract documents and in the traditional manner. Arising from their mode of practice they are incredibly weak at interpretation of contract documents and at the advance estimation of budgetary items of expenditure and total cost. They are therefore inclined suddenly to spring large increases in costs on the client which is not in accordance with the modern system of tight financial control pioneered and insisted upon by the World Bank.</block>

If no such body is forthcoming the hon. the Minister is going to find within the next year that he no longer holds the reins of this scheme in his hands and he will have to prepare himself to face tremendous chaos in connection with this scheme which can be such a wonderful scheme for the whole of South Africa.</p>

<p>Now I wish to say only this to the hon. member for Orange Grove: It is very clear to me now why as a party political propagandist he did not really achieve much where he occupied that position. One should make sure of one&#x2019;s facts before one draws inferences, especially in a House such as this. The hon. member puts the cart before the horse. He charges me in the first instance with having struggled for months on end before we appointed our consultant engineers. But we have appointed them now. Now I should like to know from him which construction contracts we have awarded? We are at the first stage where we have appointed consultant engineers who will now collaborate with the Department of Water Affairs in regard to planning, the drafting and the preparation of contracts. Then we shall issue those forms of contracts for tenders, internationally and in South Africa</p>

<p>Apparently the hon. member was in another place, or he was dreaming; he does not know what is going on in South Africa. If he has charged us with not having reached the contract stage yet, I would not have blamed him. But he comes along, mind you, with chapter and verse and proof and says we have already done this, that and the other thing, which is completely untrue and incorrect. I think the hon. member ought to show a greater sense of responsibility than that. I take it amiss of him. We know this is a scheme that is going to mean much to South Africa. That is why it has attracted the attention and the interest of the whole population; it has attracted the notice of everybody with a knowledge of something great in the world. The hon. member must not try to be so obsessed with his own party, perhaps for party political gain, that he cannot see South Africa. Let him rather follow the example of the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) who introduced this debate in a dignified manner. I just want to tell the hon. member his information is completely wrong. There is not a word of truth in it. We have not awarded a single contract. Up to now, since 1910, the Department of Water Affairs has itself tackled all Government works and major irrigation works in this country. We have never given it out on tender. This is the first time we have departed from that policy and there are good <span class="col_6279_6280" refersTo="page_0472"/>reasons for doing so. One of the reasons is because we do not wish to delay the implimentation of this great scheme, and secondly because we do not wish to tackle it at the expense of other essential works which have to be carried out in this country in the interim. The third reason is because we saw an opportunity in this to integrate the best and the greatest experience from overseas with the best and the greatest experience of our local engineers. From all quarters I have had nothing but thanks for the manner in which the Government has decided on the consortiums who have to do the consulting work for the various projects allotted to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question? Contracts were entered into with the consortiums were they not?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>A contract is entered into with a consortium to execute a certain piece of work and that contract is entered into on the basis of established formulae and established rules of ethics that have been drafted by the various consulting engineering organizations, which in our own country correspond closely with those of other countries. The hon. member for Orange Grove referred to contracts that have been awarded, contracts for construction works. The hon. member obviously does not know the difference between a contract for a consulting engineer and one for a construction engineer. But I do not wish to spend any more time on that now.</p>

<p>I wish to thank the hon. member for Albany cordially for the positive manner in which he introduced this debate, and for the appeal he has made to everyone to make a contribution to the promotion and the fulfilment of this scheme. The hon. member also referred to Basutoland which really forms a part of the catchment area of the Orange River. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) also referred to that and the hon. member for Albany has asked whether any arrangements have been made with that Government. He also said that according to his information not much of that water is used for irrigation purposes. My reply is as follows: Even if Basutoland were to make every possible use of the water entering the Orange River through its territory, it will not make any substantial difference to our planning for the development of the Orange River. He then asks whether I think that the land that has still to be expropriated will be available in time for the construction of these projects, and my reply is &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet referred to individual dams that could be constructed in his constituency. The hon. member for Lydenburg-Barberton spoke in the same vein. Both of them made out a very good case. I just want to tell those two hon. gentlemen that the Department is engaged on the planning of each of those possible schemes; we shall continue doing all the necessary research so that we may be well informed when the time comes to consider them. I should like to tell the hon. member for Graaff-Reinet specifically, that the dam he has referred to has been included in the Orange River project for raising later on. However, I cannot promise him that the raising will occur before the water gets there or before it is necessary.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast raised some very interesting matters, particularly with reference to the pollution of water. Before I get to the hon. member for South Coast I should like to dispose of the hon. member for Albany. He asked whether we were taking into account the expansion of industries under the Orange River planning, and whether water would be available for possible urban and industrial expansion that may fall within the scope of that project. I want to assure him that we are definitely taking into account the industrial as well as the urban consumption demands on that water. The scheme has been so planned that it is flexible and may be adapted to needs that may arise and which we cannot even visualize at the present time.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove of course has already heard the reply of the hon. the Prime Minister on his Vote in respect of the establishment of an Orange River Authority Board on the lines of the Tennessee Valley Authority Board. The Government has decided not to adopt that course. The Government feels, having full regard to the enormous scope of the whole scheme, that it is still more essential that the State should be held responsible for all the planning, and for control over the planning, and certain measures will be announced soon whereby provision will be made on the highest level for the development and the planning of the entire project&#x2014;apart from the construction that has been allotted to Water Affairs over and above construction works that are directly related to the provision of water, there are so many more things to be done that are of much wider ambit, and the Government is geared to that and it is creating organizations and bodies that will be announced soon by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Next I come to the hon. member for South Coast.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast asked me whether I paid attention to the possible pollution by industries to come in that area. The reply is that the policy is to implement the intention of the Legislature that municipal and industrial effluents should be purified to prescribed standards and returned to a suitable public stream for re-use. Permits for complete or partial exemption from this requirement will only be issued provided the industry can make out a sufficiently strong case on economic or other grounds to satisfy myself and the Department that the exemption is war-rented. Water is too precious a commodity in South Africa to dispose of effluents in evaporation plants or by irrigation wasteland or by irrigating crops by persons who are not <span class="col_6281_6282" refersTo="page_0473"/><i>bona fide</i> farmers in competition with such farmers. Regional standards under the Water Act which cover the whole of the Republic were promulgated in April 1962 and these will be applied within the origin of the complex to ensure conservation of water supplies and purity of rivers.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also referred to the pollution of the sea. In that regard I agree with him that it is wrong to think that water that has been polluted can just be allowed to flow into the sea, and that the sea will purify it. Under this same Act of 1956 the Minister and the Department of Water Affairs are being held responsible for the protection of marine fauna and flora and marine plant life. I agree with him that there is certain material that contains toxin poisonous material that cannot be permitted to enter the sea in an unpurified state, and which may have a detrimental effect upon the sea and plant life. I wish to assure the hon. member that we are not losing sight of that aspect, and that we propose, as we obtain more information in connection with the research that is being conducted, relative to sea life and the reactions of marine fauna and flora to those poisonous materials, to apply more strongly and to an increasing extent, our protective measures in respect of the pollution of the sea.</p>

<p>The hon. member raised another matter and that was the control which we had over the water coming from our eastern borders. The policy which is followed at the moment is as follows: Where a river lies within a Bantu area which extends up to the coast the Department does not undertake the construction of water works unless approached by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development to do so. In the latter case the Department of Bantu Administration and Development finances the work. Pollution control will not be exercised unless the Department of Bantu Administration and Development calls on the Department of Water Affairs to undertake this. That is where the whole catchment area of the river up to the coast falls within the boundaries of a Bantu area.</p>

<p>Where a river enters European territory after traversing a Bantu area the Department will assume responsibility for storage or other development or pollution control in the European area. Should storage or diversion or other works be required in localities within the Bantu area in order to supply water in the European area below, the necessary arrangements are made on behalf of Water Affairs by the Department of Bantu Administration and Development. We are now consulting with the Department of Bantu Administration in respect of the question of these water resources which are partly used maybe by a newly developing Bantu state and then flowing into the Republic. I hope we will be successful in framing suitable amendments to the Water Act, if necessary, as well as to the Act governing that territory. But we are giving this matter consideration. I also hope to be in a position next year to make a further statement in this regard.</p>

<p>Now I should like to come to the Hluhluwe Dam. The hon. member for South Coast and I have had several interviews and we have also had various differences on the effect of the Hluhluwe Dam on the Hluhluwe Game Reserve and particularly on the St. Lucia Lake. Of course the Hluhluwe River is one of many rivers, as the hon. member for South Coast himself has said, that contribute to the waters that are carried down to the St. Lucia Lake complex, which really consists of three different smaller lakes, with outlets into the sea. The total contribution of the Hluhluwe River to the water that flows into the St. Lucia Lake annually&#x2014;and this was actually taken before the Umfolozi River was diverted so as to flow into the sea and no longer into the lake&#x2014;was 19.6 per cent. There are indications that the saline content is increasing; there are clear indications to that effect at the lake, and I agree that we must take certain measures to see whether we cannot preserve it as a nature resort and a beauty spot and an attraction for tourists for generations to come. As I have said, there are indications that the water is becoming more saline at times. I do not know whether it is becoming permanently more salty or whether it depends on the influx of fresh water. However, there are indications of deterioration in the animal life, in the fish life, possibly accompanied by a deterioration in the bird life also, and possibly in the plant life of those lakes as well. The construction of the Hluhluwe Dam has the effect of reducing the flow of the Hluhluwe River at that lake by only 2.2 per cent of all the water flowing into that lake. Therefore I cannot subscribe to the view that the building of that dam must be held responsible for the possible dreadful deterioration and destruction of all that is fine and beautiful and worth preserving at the St. Lucia Lake. I am at the moment drafting a memorandum to the Cabinet asking for the appointment of a commission of experts, well trained scientists together with representatives of the Departments interested in the matter (I am thinking of senior officials and possible experts in the Departments of Bantu Administration Forestry, Agriculture, Water Affairs, Nature Conservation, Tourism, Industrial Development) and scientists in the various spheres of biology and ethnology, together with officials, to make a thorough study of conditions there. I am thinking for instance, of a few terms of reference I should like to insert, <i>inter alia,</i> whether in the course of time increasing salinization of the lake has taken place, and if so, to what extent that has had, or is still having, an adverse effect on the ecology of the lake, the causes of the salinization, the adverse consequences of changes that may take place there; what measures should be taken to preserve as far as possible the St. Lucia Lake as a natural asset for the future, having due regard to all sectors of the national interest such as, <i>inter<span class="col_6283_6284" refersTo="page_0474"/>alia,</i> represented in the Departments I have just mentioned, and perhaps a few more to be added.</p>

<p>I think it is necessary. Yes, I shall see to it. I think it is very important that if we have an inquiry of this nature, it should be a thorough inquiry, and I also think it will be an inquiry that will take some time. It may even extend to beyond a year if it is to be properly done. That is what we have in mind. Of course I cannor say what the Cabinet decision will be, but I have every reason to assume that Cabinet approval of the memorandum I am going to submit to them will be obtained with the next few weeks.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S M. van Niekerk) said she had understood from the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) that water for only one plot can be given at State settlements. She is quite correct. The only control we have at the present time to prevent State settlements falling into the hands of a large chain or syndicate of a few wealthy people, and to ensure that they will be preserved for the purpose for which they have been established namely to provide as many people as possible with a proper livelihood, is the control we have under the Water Act, namely our being able, in the case of a man holding more than one plot, to deprive him of the water rights in respect of the second plot. But that is a power we have been applying judiciously. For instance, at Boegoeberg, where the hon. member for Gardens is also acquainted with the circumstances, we have the position that on the southern side of the river there are plots that are very small, and on the northern side the plots are bigger. We have consolidated there. But the Water Act provides that when a person buys two plots, then I do not immediately say that he cannot have water for the two plots. No, then I have to call in the Land Board to investigate and make a recommendation to me as to whether I should give the man water for his two plots, and as to whether I should deschedule the one or not, and I must act in accordance with their recommendation. That is what we have always done, but we apply the provision wisely and judiciously and with discretion. But we have to retain control in order to ensure that her where the State has spent a lot of money, it does not fall into the hands of just a few rich people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) referred to the development of the Tugela River area. We realize that development is inevitable there, and that it is in fact imperative. However, I should like to point out to the hon. member that we are at the moment tackling the development of the Umgeni River (which will cost no less than R7,000,000), as well as the Pongola River development (which will cost approximately R36,000,000), and so I think the work we have to do at the Tugela River must be left in abeyance for the time being. The hon. member for Gardens has told me he has now discovered that we first increased the water quota fixed for Vaalhartz, and that we have now reduced it again. The hon. member is wrong. The fixed quota at Vaalhartz of so many inches per morgen is still exactly the same as it has always been, namely 30 inches per morgen per annum. What has happened now is that we had to reduce it because we were compelled to introduce rationing for the whole Vaal River owing to the dry season, and because the Vaal River, which has to supply such an extremely important part of our country with water, at the present time contains only about 55 per cent of its capacity. In other words, the water level is lower than it has been for many years and that is why we have now reduced the quota, but it is a form of rationing. Rationing has to be introduced when there is insufficient water.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>Only temporarily. If for instance we were to have rain now and the dam filled up, we would increase it again as much as possible, but if it has to stand over till next year, I am afraid we shall not be able to increase the quota for irrigation. We shall hardly be able to maintain it there. We have fixed it in this way in the hope that we shall be able to maintain it at that level, and then we warn the farmers in advance so that they will understand the position and know how to plant and how to organize so as to adapt themselves to the circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg as well as the hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) asked me a question in connection with drilling services. It is correct that two years ago we did away with an inequality in our country. The country was divided into two parts, on no scientific basis. There was a proclaimed drilling area and a proclaimed non-drilling area. The farmers living on the one side of the line in the proclaimed areas enjoyed much greater privileges and received more State aid when drilling for water, with Government drills as well as with private drills, than the others. We have now equalized that position, and I have consulted the Cabinet and explained that it will involve the State in greater expense, but they were kind enough at the end of 1961, to approve an additional expenditure of R300,000, but that the changes I wish to make should fall within the framework of that expenditure. The new regulations which then came into operation provided for this, namely that where this discrimination and difference between proclaimed drilling areas <span class="col_6285_6286" refersTo="page_0475"/>and proclaimed non-drilling areas existed, they were equalized. Secondly, that necessarily meant, on the other hand, that certain people who had enjoyed certain privileges in the proclaimed areas had to be restricted to some extent in order to make possible the equalization with their fellow-countrymen on the other side of the line. In the meantime we had a number of problems and difficulties, particularly because it also meant that farmers holding less than 30 morgen were also excluded from any benefits under the new scheme of last year. Secondly, it meant that people who had drilled to a lesser depth than 100 ft. were eliminated as far as the successful as well as the unsuccessful holes were concerned. Thirdly, it meant that the man who drilled a dry hole with a State drill also had to make a payment for the unsuccessful drilling operations in the same proportion as for the successful one where he found water. We went into these matters and I went back to the Cabinet. I may just say that prior to 1961 or 1962 the State annually contributed a subsidy of R2,000,000 per annum to assist the farmers in meeting the expense connected with drilling operations. The additional R300,000 they granted me last year increased it to R2,300,000, and this year I have received an additional R500,000, which means that the State since 1961 now contributes R800,000 more in subsidies to the farmers and assists them more with their drilling operations than ever before. We are now drafting regulations soon to be published, as to how it will now work. But broadly, I may say that farmers holding from 10 to 30 morgen of land, the small farmers, will also qualify now, or will again be eligible for Government aid in the form of the subsidy; people who have to drill to a depth of less than 100 feet but more than 50 feet for water will also become eligible; we now want to differentiate there so that a man with an unsuccessful hole will pay less in proportion to its depth for the drilling services completed than is paid for a successful hole in proportion to its depth. It will be on a sliding scale, according to a sliding tariff. Now there has been a request that we should make it retrospective, but that is quite impossible. If the principle of retrospectiveness were accepted, where would it end? If, for instance, the Minister of Finance were to increase taxation, and he made it retrospective for a few years, would the public be satisfied with that? They would of course be satisfied if he were to reduce it retrospectively. That is the position and I regret I cannot accept it.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Just to come back to the Orange River scheme for a moment&#x2014;the Minister digressed into other fields of activity &#x2014;&#x2014;I want to say that the object of the Orange River scheme was to conserve the water that we have been losing over so many years and which perennially flows away to the sea. Now we have a scheme which I am sure is going to be of great benefit to our country and it will certainly play a very big part in the economy of our country. But the point that I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister is a matter which he almost touched on but did not entirely develop and that is whether the time has not come now that the scheme has been enshrined in the legislation and the finance has been arranged and the technical experts have been sought for, to evaluate from a scientific and economic point of view the use of the water for the best purposes. That is an important step which the Minister will be obliged to take in the very near future. I understand that a great deal of the conservation of the water will eventually be used for large irrigation projects and other projects of a similar nature, and I believe that it is of paramount importance that the exploitation of this water potential should be characterized by the principle of the most advantageous economic use of the water to serve the largest number of people and also for the longest period of time.</p>

<p>Certain interesting figures have been given by the C.S.I.R. with regard to the use of water and what it can produce. For instance the market value of R1 of lucerne requires on the average about 16,000 gallons of water; potatoes produced under irrigation schemes will require for a similar value of R1 market value, 4,000 gallons; mealies produced under irrigation schemes would require 17,000 gallons of water per marketable R value. As against that we find that in the industrial field to produce R1 s worth of marketable steel would only require the use of 60 gallons of water; oil-from-coal, 600 gallons of water; pulp, 300 gallons of water; cheese, butter and milk-powder, 200, 300 and 300 gallons respectively. So the problem that does arise is how is one to make use of this water, to what length must the irrigation schemes go, and whether the time has not come to integrate the whole system of irrigation schemes with the system of dryland farming and pastoral farming. That is the problem which is exercising the minds of those who are scientifically interested in the best use of water in our country. I do not know that the Minister has dealt with this problem at all, because in the torrent of words to which we have been subjected, we have heard a great deal about the benefits that will result to the whole of the community. Of that I do not think there can be the slightest doubt, but in the emotional upheaval of what we have achieved or are on the threshold of achieving, I think we must give a much more sober thought to this important factor. I do not want to deal at too great length with the subject, because it is a highly technical subject, but I do know this that at a recent gathering, I think in Bloemfontein, certain experts, amongst whom was one of the C.S.I.R. representatives, papers were read which dealt specifically with the subject, the question of providing what the Minister for instance wants to refer to a specific commission in regard to St. Lucia. I do not think that that even would have the priority that is necessary here, namely, to establish the necessary committee of <span class="col_6287_6288" refersTo="page_0476"/>these scientists who could deal scientifically with the evaluation of the economic use of water. I feel that that is a very important factor to take into account in dealing with the Orange River scheme, something that should not be lost sight of and I think in that respect the hon. Minister should give us some information as to what thinking he has had in that direction.</p>

I hope that when Parliament reassembles, we may perhaps get some further interim-statement from the hon.

<p>There are a few matters I should like to raise. One is in connection with the utterances of the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan). When I made an interjection, I was told by him that I do not have the sole right to talk about Vaalhartz. I readily concede that, but I should like to give him the piece of advice that he should not talk about something he knows nothing about. It is a bad thing to do so. He said certain things here in regard to the water available for Vaalhartz that were incorrect. I need not reply to that, for the Minister has already replied to it. But the hon. member said he understood certain election promises were made in 1948.</p>

<p>I immediately noted it. He said it was 24 inches, and then it was increased to 30 inches and now it has been reduces to 22 inches. Then he said that in 1948 certain election promises were made in connection with water. No I should like to tell the hon. member that the election promises did not emanate from the National Party, although they did emanate from the United Pary when water was promised by building weirs in the Riet River.</p>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>How does that concern Vaalhartz?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member referred to election promises. At Vaalhartz not a single election promise was made in connection with water. The fact of the matter is that 24 inches of water was granted. A commission was appointed by the late Advocate Strijdom to investigate the water needs at Vaalhartz, and after that Commission had reported and recommended that the quota should be raised from 24 inches to 30 inches, it was raised to 30 inches. No promise was made. An election promise was made in regard to Riet River, where sand, stones and everything were carted away to build weirs, and the hon. the Minister is giving effect to that to-day. That is the promise made there at the time. I should like to suggest to the hon. member that when he discusses Vaalhartz again, he should first acquaint himself with the facts. Then he will be able to talk about it, and he will be able to do the Vaalhartz farmers a favour.</p>

<p>I should like to point out to the Minister that he ought to have a survey made regarding the water needs of Vaalhartz. The position unfortunately is that there are holdings that could probably do with 20 inches of water in a year, holdings which have, as the farmers call it there, become acclimatized (&#x201C;die klimaat opgedoen het&#x201D;). But then there are sloping holdings, and many sloping holdings that cannot possibly come out on that water. There is too little water for those sloping holdings to enable the farmers to raise a proper crop on it. Now provision is made for those farmers of Vaalhartz to buy extra water if the normal quota of water has been consumed. In the first application they can buy 4 inches of water at a fixed price of 59.6c per inch. There are farmers who have to purchase that amount of water in order to save their crops. But having used this water, if they still need water, and there are such farmers, they may buy a second quantity of 4 inches of water at 89.8c per inch. There are farmers who have to buy that additional water too. Then they may purchase a further 2 inches at 119.3c per inch. The normal price of water for the normal quota work out at R4.25, but if it is taken into account what the 10 inches of extra water they may have costs, it works out at R8.35. I think the Minister will agree that that price is too high. The normal quota is R4.25 and the extra 10 inches of water works out at R8.35. In this connection I should like to ask him to have an investigation made to see whether anything can be done. Mr. Chairman, the farmers of Vaalhartz are somewhat uneasy. They are aware of the water in Vaaldam at the present time, and they are also aware of the requirements of water from Vaaldam. But should those parts meet with a catastrophe so that the water supply is not augmented, and if later on there were to be a further cut in the temporary quota they are now receiving, the people at Vaalhartz are going to be in a difficult position.</p>

<p><span class="col_6289_6290" refersTo="page_0477"/>All I am asking is that should something like that happen&#x2014;and let all of us hope it will not happen&#x2014;the Minister will then give them timeous notice of the imminent danger in that regard. I hope he will do that, because when the people cultivate their holdings&#x2014;they do not have supplementary incomes&#x2014;they have to get every cent they can from the holdings and if there is a total crop failure because of a water shortage those farmers will be in a very difficult position.</p>

<p>There is a further matter at Vaalhartz I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. There are poplar trees along the canals and their roots pass under the canals and penetrate into the fields. I personally made an investigation, and found that the roots impair the fertility of the soil next to the wire fence for a distance of 30 paces into that holding. When it is assumed that the holding is only 30 morgen in extent and 30 paces of the full length of the holding is impaired by the roots, that make the soil unfertile, the Minister will realize the losses it is causing the farmers. I want to urge him earnestly to take steps. I have a soft spot for a tree, and do not like to see a tree destroyed, but when the livelihood of a farmer is threatened, I think the owner has the right to ask the Minister to devote attention to it, and if there is no other alternative, those trees will have to be destroyed. I am sorry to make this recommendation, but it is my duty to point out what a threat the trees constitute.</p>

<p>Now I should like to know from the Minister: When the Orange River scheme, the dam at Norvalspont and the tunnel are built, there are farmers, and I am one of them, who feel very uneasy about the labourers that will be employed for the construction of the canal. Shafts will have to be sunk, and it must be expected that a considerable number of Natives will probably be used to do the work. How are those people going to be controlled? If the shaft is sunk on my farm&#x2014;and that possibility exists&#x2014;and the Natives working there are not properly controlled, and as we have jackalproof fences around the camps in which the stock roam freely day and night, I think the Minister can imagine what will happen there. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not propose to follow the hon. member for Kimberley (North), save to say that as the late Mr. Strijdom found it necessary to investigate the position at Vaalhartz, that suggests that there is at least some truth in what the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) has said. But I propose to deal shortly with the questions which arise in connection with the Jossini Dam at Pongola. The hon. the Minister was asked in the Other Place last year whether a survey had been made to ascertain what crops could most beneficially be grown on the land to be irrigated under the Pongola scheme, and if so, what the result of the survey was. His reply was that an Inter-Departmental Committee into the agricultural potential of the area was appointed in April 1961 and he further said that the Committee had submitted a report which recommend that an experimental farm be established to investigate the cultivation problems, the crops and the diseases. Now that Committee was appointed more than two years ago and one presumes that something has been done. I shall be glad if the Minister will tell the House what has been found out in regard to the possible crops to be grown there. It has never ceased to amaze me that in 1963 we can invest over R36,000,000 in a dam without knowing what crops will be suitable. It seems a short-sighted policy. I raised this matter with the Minister of Lands and he said that the building of that scheme had been slowed down. I should like this Minister to give us some information in that regard as well. Is it correct that the building of the scheme has been slowed down, and if so, why? The Minister of Lands raised another point which I found interesting. He said that he was considering the possibility of reverting to the original idea of growing sugar there. This is the first time I have heard it said officially that it was ever the intention to grow sugar there, but we are now told that that was the original intention. Does the Minister agree with what the Minister of Lands said, that the reversion to the idea of growing sugar was being considered, and was the growing of sugar there one of the matters considered by this Committee, and what are the results of any experiments made? I hope he will tell us, if sugar is not to be grown there, what other crops it is intended should be grown there.</p>

<p>I was very glad to hear the Minister say, in reply to the hon. member for South Coast, that he was going to recommend to the Cabinet the establishment of an Inter-Departmental Committee to investigate amongst other things, the effect on places like St. Lucia, the damming of the waters there. I believe it would serve: a very good purpose indeed. One merely regrets that this was not done, as was suggested, three years ago, because we have now reached the stage where the dams have been implemented, and what do we do now if this Committee finds that those dams are detrimental&#x2019; to the St. Lucia scheme. It underlines the point that the wise course would have been, as this side of the House suggested, to have appointed such a Committee before the Hluhluwe Dam was commenced. But my interest this afternoon is mainly in the Pongola Dam, and&#x2019; I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to indicate just what is taking place there, be&#x00BF; cause the report of the secretary for Water Affairs, the latest one available, is for the period ended 31 March 1961, and there, is reference in it to the Pongola scheme, but of course it is more than two years out of date,, and that is greatly to be regretted, that we-have to consider the Minister&#x2019;s Vote when we&#x2019; have merely a report from the Department: I which is so out of date.</p>

<p>I would like to clear up one point. I think there was a misunderstanding when I apologized to the Chair. I think you, Sir, thought I was apologizing to the House; I must apologize to the House and not to you. I hope that point has now been cleared up, and I do so.</p>

<p>There are a few things. I heard here to-day which hurt me very much. When the Orange River scheme was announced in this House, everybody in South Africa rejoiced. I remember the days when this scheme was priority No. 1. It was said at the time that water was worth more to South Africa than gold and diamonds, and I agreed. But now we hear a few discordant notes, and I am very sorry about it. I called the hon. member for Orange Grove a certain name and I just want to tell him that the people of South Africa will settle accounts with him for the statements he made in this House. We are not dealing here with political horse-trading, but with the soul and the bread and butter of South Africa, and with people who have endured hard times for years. Whilst we have the greatest confidence in the Department of Water Affairs and the wonderful work they have done in this short time, so much so that even Mr. Shand said it was astonishing that they could have worked out all those statistics in such a short while, I also want to pay tribute to another great man, the Prime Minister, who gave the green light and said that he did not want to build small dams but that he wanted to do something which would save South Africa, and the Orange River will save a large part of South Africa. Although the Minister of Water Affairs is being belittled to-day, I can tell him that the people of South Africa pay tribute to him as a man who has done much to promote this scheme. If the people know how little the hon. member for Orange Grove did in regard to this matter, they will certainly not pay tribute to him for the attitude he adopted here to-day. The farmers of the Fish River Valley are very grateful for what the Government has done. In that valley the people were almost poor Whites. It is significant that hon. members opposite all flee from the rural constituencies, like the hon. members for Green Point and Gardens. The hon. member for Gardens made certain remarks here in regard to the scheme in terms of which the Government bought out that land. I wonder whether he realizes that those people were so poor that they could hardly buy food, and that the Government did them a special favour by buying their land, which saved them from ruin and enabled them to buy other land and to make a living. The land which was bought out was purchased with the full consent and co-operation of all those people. It was a voluntary scheme and they were not forced to sell. Therefore I deplore the fact that outsiders tried to drag these people through the political mire. There we have the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). I want to thank him for the kind things he said, and in future we will not fight with each other, but we will co-operate to turn this scheme, the largest of its kind in the world, into a paradise. From a poor area we will convert it into a land of milk and honey. By means of all the hydro-electric power generated the Eastern Province will be completely changed. They talk about the Tennessee Valley, but the Eastern Province and the whole of the Free State will become the Tennessee Valley of South Africa. I am not referring only to the land which will be irrigated. We are concerned here with great industrial development. The Tennessee Valley scheme was not tackled merely to irrigate the land; power was also generated, and whereas it was the poorest part of America it is to-day the richest area. Therefore we rejoice about the Orange River scheme and we hope to get the best brains in the world to help us to carry it out. Just think of the money which will be put into circulation. Those districts which became so impoverished that half the population had to seek refuge in the cities will be given new life. Those small towns will become large cities in 10 or 15 years. Therefore I cannot understand that whilst the United Party in general sided with the Government in getting this scheme under way, discordant notes are now being sounded and there is misunderstanding, and that it is being exploited. This Parliament has to deal with the bread and butter of the people in the interior, and we are surprised to hear such discordant notes like those we have had from the hon. member for Orange Grove. I never would have thought that possible from a man with so much intelligence. The day when the Orange River scheme was announced was a greater day to us than the day when diamonds were discovered in Kimberley, or gold on the Rand. To us the river and its waters are something sacred. Those areas will again be able to afford a living to large sections of our population which to-day have to go to the cities as unskilled labour. It will also assist the gold mines and the industries. Therefore we ask that the Government should not allow speculation to take place, but that it will implement its policy. There was also opposition to the Tennessee Valley scheme, and I should not like to see the same opposition here. Therefore we ask that the Government should proceed with it step by step, and we have every confidence in the Government and the Minister.</p>

The hon. member for Gardens does not know what went on, and I do not blame him for not knowing what the position is, and the stupid interjection made by the hon. member for Yeoville while the hon. member for Cradock was talking, asking what happened to these people&#x2019;s water rights, just shows how little he knows about water. The land of these people was bought together with the water rights, and in this case the State did it with a specific object, not only to assist the farmers who could not hold out until the water of the Orange River could get there to assist them, but also to assist the farmers who remained behind. Therefore it was general knowledge that if we bought the land the Department of Lands would become the owner and it would immediately deschedule that land, so that the water which was scheduled for that land would be made available to those people who remained behind. There were some propagandists who tried to sow dissension, but they did not achieve much success, and the hon. member for Yeoville still feels unhappy about it. I then said: I heard this story that we had bought the land too cheaply. Before we stepped in no farmer could get an average price of R150 per morgen for his land, and the State bought it at an average price of R300 per morgen, and we did not expropriate it, but it was sold to us willingly. That is why the majority of those people sold their land. When we made the offer, the intention was not that the offer should remain open for two or three years before we bought the land. To those people who felt that they had made a mistake I said that if they wanted their land back, I would do my best to let them buy it back at the same price that the State had paid for it.</p>

<p>No, let me explain. Do hon. members know how many applications we received? Two, out of a hundred. Only two wanted their land back, and we gave it back to them. Because we had given them notice that it would be descheduled, they again had to apply to have it scheduled, and in the case of both of them the board recommended that it be scheduled, and the application was granted. That was what all the fuss was about, as if these people were very unfairly treated. I have purposely replied on this point to make the matter clear.</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. member and the House and the whole country the assurance that when we made this offer to those people we told them that it was part of the whole plan to take the water of the Orange River to the Fish River, and the questions put to me were as to how long it would take, and I said at least seven years as from that date, but I put it too low, because from that date it may be eight or nine years. The people knew that there was that possibility and that that was part of the Orange River plan, and in spite of that they acted as they did. That is also the reason why only two of them said they had made a mistake, and both were prosperous people who could have held out for much longer than seven years, even though they had no income from their land because of other sources of revenue available to them. Consequently it cannot be said at all that people there were under a misapprehension or that the State tried to cheat them. The whole object was to save those people who would have been ruined.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) spoke about the Pongola Poort scheme and said that in 1962 already I had appointed a committee to make certain investigations there in regard to which products could be cultivated, and he thought the matter was rather delayed and that it showed a lack of foresight. I do not blame him, because he came into this House only recently and therefore he became interested in the matter too late. The fact is that my predecessor instructed the Natural Resources Development Board to advise the Government as to which of the two rivers, the Pongola or the Orange, should be investigated first. The council investigated the matter and recommended that the Pongola Poort scheme should be developed first, and together with their report they delivered a supplementary report dealing with sugar. In <span class="col_6295_6296" refersTo="page_0480"/>that supplementary report they advanced reasons as to why the Pongola Poort scheme should receive preference, and it was because they foresaw that by the year 1978 we would be facing a sugar shortage. When the scheme was announced, it was announced mainly with the object, as the hon. the Minister of Lands Las said, to produce sugar there. Thereafter we had this upheaval in the sugar industry, and then we felt that we should ascertain what crops should be planted there after the completion of the scheme. It is also mentioned in the White Paper dealing with the Pongola Poort scheme that it is a scheme which was planned, at that stage, to be completed by 1978; only then would the scheme be completed, i.e. in 16 years&#x2019; time. In 1962 I decided that an experimental farm should be established there so that we could conduct experiments, and so that when settlers are put there we would be in a position to give them practical guidance. In the meantime, in view of the sugar position, and also for other reasons, and also with a view to the increased tempo of development of the Orange River scheme, we decided that we could very easily spread the development of this scheme over a period of 20 years instead of 16 years. That is what the hon. the Minister of Lands meant when he spoke about &#x201C;retarding the process of development But I quite agree with him in regard to the possibilities of developing this settlement into a sugar-producing settlement. At the moment there is a team of soil-testers of my Department who are analysing the soil intensively over the whole area&#x2014;and it is approximately 65,000 morgen in extent&#x2014;so that we may know precisely what the different types of soil are and how the various products can be adapted to it. I hope that answers the hon. member&#x2019;s question.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for their contributions. I even want to thank those hon. members who do not deserve thanks for their negative contributions, but actually I want to thank everybody who contributed for their positive contributions. They have proved that the representatives of our people in this House are all anxious to join forces and to put their heads together in respect of this most important and most valuable natural resource we have, namely water, and to assist in developing our water resources in the best interests of the people and the future of the Republic.</p>

<p>Sir, quite recently I had the opportunity and the privilege of congratulating the Department of Education, Arts and Science on the production of their Annual Report for the calendar year 1962. They produced that report some weeks ago in time for the discussion on the Vote. That has now become the traditional policy in the Department of Education, Arts and Science. Coming now to the Department of Bantu Education we have received another report, the annual report of the Department for the year 1961. This is the first report and we received it a few days ago. I realize that there has been some difficulty in the Department in finding a routine for presenting <span class="col_6297_6298" refersTo="page_0481"/>these annual reports, but I think if the report is going to be late, as it is now&#x2014;not the 1962 Report but the 1961 Report&#x2014;I would suggest that it should be prepared by the beginning of the Session so that we could have an opportunity of perusing the report and of discussing it. However, I have tried to peruse it. I wish to make only one or two cursory remarks about this report. This is the first report; the others were educational publications that were presented earlier. I wish to refer to the introductory remarks in Chapter I on the first page&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An encouraging sign which deserves mention is the fact that there is a growing realization among the Bantu communities of their individual and joint responsibility for the training and education of their youth. This is illustrated by the fact that during 1961 the communities contributed more than half a million rand towards the erection of school buildings and towards salaries of privately paid teachers.</block>

<p>This poorer section of the community made contributions for their own education, not indirectly through taxation but directly. The White section of the community are not asked to do that. Then the report goes on to say that there has been criticism of this system&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such criticism as is still occasionally heard usually has a political complexion and seldom a pedagogical basis.</block>

<p>I should like to say to the Minister and to the Committee that the criticism you will hear today will be political and pedagogical. It will be both; we will cover the whole field as well as we can. Sir, the other report is a report by the Commission of Inquiry into the language medium through which children in the Transkei should be taught and to what extent they should use Xhosa, their home language, as their medium of instruction. I am not satisfied with the manner in which this report has been published. There were four Africans on the commission and two of our inspectors of education as assessors. They met for the first time at the end of July last year and reported expeditiously in October last year, but the report did not appear in our boxes until the 8th of this month, seven months later. Sir, I realize that there are difficulties of translation in South Africa, and now that English has become a translation language, as we are told by the Department of Education &#x2026;</p>

<p>In ths case it was a translation into Afrikaans, otherwise it might have been ready sooner.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I realize that there may have been some difficulties accounting for some delay, but surely a delay of seven months is inexcusable. What I object to most of all is that while we were waiting for this report and looking forward to it, the hon. the Minister was using the contents of the report in his speeches. He was telling the country how the commission had reported while members of this House were not in possession of the report itself. I have now had an opportunity to read the report, although we received it only about a week ago, and having read it through I realized it was only necessary to read one of the paragraphs on the back page, on page 32. After that it was not necessary to read further. Witnesses were asked when the second language, the White man&#x2019;s language should be introduced, and they gave an unequivocal answer. Question 16 of the questionnaire was: &#x201C;If the child&#x2019;s medium of instruction is to be changed from the mother tongue what stage is in your opinion the most suitable for effecting this change?&#x201D; 83.6 per cent of the replies received said that it should start at Std. Ill or earlier. For the rest I should like to discuss the report in detail. I may have an opportunity of saying a word about the report later. Sir, this year in the discussion on Bantu education, we usher in a new era in Bantu education in South Africa. To-day we have one Minister of Bantu Education; next year we shall have at least two. We shall have a Minister of Bantu Education for the Republic, excluding the Transkei, and we shall have another Minister of Bantu Education in the Transkei. During the discussion on the Transkei Bill we tried to ascertain to what extent education would be handed over; what would be the financial implications and so on; where would the responsibility of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education end. But naturally we were out of order because the substance of the Transkei Bill provided for the handing over of Bantu education to the new Cabinet of the Transkei; it handed over the functions, the responsibilities, of Finance, Justice, Education and so on to the Transkeian Government. That being the case it means that in the Transkei we may have a different philosophy and method in education; we may have the Transkei applying methods which are not approved by our Minister. We shall have two systems of education for the Transkei children. The Minister has his philosophy of a Bantu education; it has been adumbrated in this House from time to time; we know what it is: You should be educated on your own lines, not on the lines of the White man. I think a fair picture of the Minister&#x2019;s policy is obtained from some of the advertisements which have been placed in newspapers overseas. The Government have been explaining to the world what our policy is in Bantu education. I am quoting now from an advertisement which appeared in the London <i>Sunday Times.</i></p>

<p>No, these advertisements are placed on behalf of this Department. They set <span class="col_6299_6300" refersTo="page_0482"/>out the policy of this Department. These are just one or two short extracts. Speaking of the change that has taken place in Bantu education they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa a fundamental change in the state of affairs was wrought in 1954 with the introduction of the Bantu Education Act. Attempts at Westernizing individuals made way for a concerted process of civilizing Bantu peoples.</block>

<p>Can anyone explain to me what is the difference between &#x201C;Westernizing individuals&#x201D; and &#x201C;civilizing Bantu people&#x201D;? Surely Westernizing is civilizing or at least we hope so, unless they wish to go to the communist creed for their inspiration. Then we come to another extract from this statement setting out the Department&#x2019;s philosophy of education&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu Education Act is now history. Equating &#x201C;superior&#x201D; with European and confusing education with Western civilization the critics charged that education for the Bantu would in future be &#x201C;inferior</block>

<p>Well, when we come to discuss whether it is inferior, I think we can apply a very good test, a financial test. We do not say in this statement that the cost per Bantu child per annum is R13 and that the cost of a White child in a Tansvaal school is R90 per annum, seven times as much; and that the cost of a White child in a Transvaal high school is R141, eleven times as much. I do not know whether Bantu education is inferior in quality; it is certainly very much inferior from the point of view of the money that is being spent on it. Let me quote just one more. In this statement we see discussed the university education of the Bantu, the New Deal that the Bantu have received, and it says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These three university colleges will soon develop to full university status under the guidance of the University of South Africa.</block>

<p>What a whopper that is! We know that they are not going to develop soon to university status. We know that Fort Hare, drawing on all non-Whites in the country, after 40 years had not developed to that stage, but was on the verge of becoming a university when this Government destroyed the Fort Hare of those days and created a Bantu tribal college. We have three of these tribal colleges to-day, and anyone who says that they will soon become universities is saying something which we in South Africa know is not true. But how does the hon. the Minister, and the Government, in stating their policy hope to deceive people overseas with the story? The man who reads the London <i>Sunday Times</i> or the other papers in which they have advertised, can never be deceived by this stuff. As a matter of fact, the London <i>Times</i> while placing the advertisement has written articles criticizing the policy. The Government has spent over R10,900 in putting this across to the London <i>Sunday Times</i> over the period referred to in my question. That is only 20 per cent of what they spent in advertising our system of education overseas, and how the Government is governing. They have spent over R50,000 on that. Do they think this deceives anybody?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member wants to ask a question I am quite prepared to answer it. I have the privilege of the half-hour. My next point is this: We are handing over the education of the Bantu child to the Transkei, and I want to ask a simple question now: Have we made any preparation for that; how have we prepared the way for the transfer? We are in fact making the same mistake as the Belgians did in the Congo and as Britain made in some of her Colonies in handing over without proper preparation. Sir, for some years I have placed a question on the Order Paper asking the hon. the Minister what progress was being made in preparing Bantu education for the Bantu, because I think we are all agreed in this House that Bantu education should be education of the Bantu, by the Bantu, for the Bantu. I have asked for many years what the education should be and what preparation has been made for handing over, and this is what I find: Of the 143 senior posts, professional and administrative, in the Bantu Education Department not one is held by the Bantu. It is no good telling me they are not capable of holding these posts because a graduate from Fort Hare, from our own college, is an inspector of schools in Rhodesia. Mr. Senden is an inspector of schools there. Another graduate from Fort Hare is a lecturer at the Rhodesian University. There are men who have the ability, and I think we are all agreed that under this Government&#x2019;s system we are going to hand <span class="col_6301_6302" refersTo="page_0483"/>over this education. But nothing is being done. You see, we have stated a philosophy of education and we are not carrying out our system. All we have done has been to sneer, as we did in this advertisement, at the educated Bantu. We talk about &#x201C;pseudo Europeans&#x201D;, &#x201C;quasi Europeans&#x201D;, &#x201C;Westernizing individuals&#x201D;, &#x201C;European orientated&#x201D;. I want to know how you become orientated any other way if you are going to be civilized. I want to quote the view of an African on education, in contrast to the philosophy of the hon. the Minister and this Government. I am quoting from the days when there was no anti-Communist Act; there was no talk of agitators; there was no talk of &#x201C;liberaliste&#x201D;. I am talking of 1937, and I am quoting from the proceedings of the Parliament that was given to the Bantu by General Hertzog, by the whole House, by the United Party and the Nationalist Party, in the 1936 Act. I quote from a speech made in 1937 by Councillor Thema before the Native Representative Council. Nobody would ever say that the late Councillor Thema was a communist or an agitator. I want to give you his views on education&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are told we must be given an education which will conform to the lives we are living. If nobody had come here we would still have been developing along those lines. We would still have been killing one another, we would be struggling amongs ourselves. But, Sir, to a very large extent we are grateful for their coming here. We have no opposition to their coming to South Africa or Africa, but we do say that in regard to developing along our own lines, where is a race that has developed along its own lines?</block>

<p>Then he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We think there is no education which belongs to a certain race. How can we remain stationary, how can we not be Europeanized in a European Africa? How can we not be Africans when Africa is changing? If Africa were still Africa, naturally we would say we will develop along our own lines. But it is changing, it is changing together with the European areas. If we must live we have to go and find out how the White men do things. We think if we have education it must be an education which will bring about harmony and peace in this country. We do not want an education that is different from the European education.</block>

<p>Sir, I think of the years that the locusts have eaten. If we had Africans to-day who spoke like that, we would say, &#x201C;we can work together.&#x201D; But we missed an opportunity, and when finally General Smuts found that the members of this Natives&#x2019; Representative Council were unhappy, especially on the question of education, he said, &#x201C;we must try another method, another plan&#x201D;. I feel that even to-day we can still save the situation. We have not helped the people of the Transkei to establish their own system.</p>

<p>The next point I wish to raise with the hon. the Minister is this. Now that the Transkei has its own self-government what is the position of Fort Hare? Are we going to say to the Transkei, &#x201C;You will have control of primary education and secondary education, your children will matriculate, and they will then go to a university college but not under your control.&#x201D; It seems perfectly obvious to me that if we contend that university education must remain under our Minister, we will introduce a bone of contention right at the beginning. I would go much further as far as university education is concerned and say that university education should not be defrayed from the Bantu Education Account. It was intended originally for primary and secondary education, but the Bantu Education Account was not intended for university education.</p>

At last we have made some progress. But I should like the hon. the Minister to tell us what is going to be the position with the Fort Hare University College. <span class="col_6303_6304" refersTo="page_0484"/>We were told when the Fort Hare University College was established that it would be their own college, that they would make greater progress, and that there would be greater satisfaction than in the past. But that has not been the case. To my amazement I saw the other day that a lecturer at Fort Hare University College had been charged under the Sabotage Act; it was most disturbing. We did not have these incidents before. It seems to bear out what the Leader of the Opposition has told the House, that we must have a change of policy. I think it is essential in South Africa that we should consider that very seriously.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I come back now to the matter which I raised at the beginning, the Commission of Inquiry. I am quoting now from one or two of the findings of this very important Commission of Inquiry which, I think, made some frank recommendations. The recommendations which the hon. the Minister used prematurely in his speeches are here, but there are many others as well, and I want to quote one or two. How are they to decide on a White man&#x2019;s language as the official language they are going to use? Up to the present we have said that they will commence their education in Xhosa and then will have both White languages. My hon. friends on the other side have always argued against dual-medium education. They have told us that dual-medium education is not a satisfactory system. Let us see what the commission says. I am quoting now from the second column on page six&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The official language to be introduced in sub-standard A to be decided by the school committee and the principal in consultation with the circuit inspector.</block>

<p>That is the recommendation. This is what the commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moreover, the commission favours a system giving the parent a greater say in the subjects his child is to be taught. The choice of official language to be introduced in substandard A cannot in any way be compared with the question of the medium of instruction since there is no educational principle involved at all.</block>

<p>There is the idea that the parents are going to decide. I want to ask the hon. the Minister this simple question: If the plan was to hand over education to the Transkei he must have known in 1959 and subsequent years what the policy of the Government was. If they are going to hand over education I take it that the policy in Transkei education is to be determined by the new Minister in the Transkei. &#x2014;or will the hon. the Minister decide his policy for him?</p>

<p>My point is this Sir: Surely the hon. the Minister must have known what the policy of his Government was, that they were going to hand over the Transkei? And if they were going to hand over the Transkei then any commission appointed would be reporting to our Minister and not to the Minister of Bantu Education in the Transkei. I think it is very unfortunate that the Government have-done that. I think it was a mistake in policy.</p>

<p>My final point, Sir, is this: Xhosa education in the Transkei, I take it, will come under the Minister of Education in the Transkei. Who will be responsible for Xhosa education outside the Transkei? Will our Minister be responsible or the Minister in the Transkei? If our Minister is to be responsible are we going to have two systems of Xhosa Education; one for the Transkei and one here; in what is called the &#x201C;blanke gebied?&#x201D; As we know there are going to be more non-Whites in this White area than Whites. Who is going to decide what the policy is to be for Bantu education for the Xhosa people outside the Transkei? I am anxious to know that. I think my hon. friend, the member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) will see the difficulty here. It is rather like saying to a child on the platteland: &#x201C;You are to have a different system of education in regard to language and medium from the child in the city&#x201D;. If he is Afrikaans-speaking in the platteland what education is he going to have in the city? It must be uniform. I should like to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views are on that-[Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened attentively to the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) and I consider it a great pity that the hon. member spoke so derogatively about the attempts made by the Government in regard to Bantu education, and in that way also besmirched the name of our country. The hon. member complained because this support was not made available timeously. Well, I am sure I received the report at the same time that the hon. member did, and I have had a reasonable opportunity to study it and to draw my conclusions from it. Then the hon. member, <i>inter alia,</i> complained that the hon. the Minister had made use of data contained in that report <span class="col_6305_6306" refersTo="page_0485"/>before the report was tabled. For the rest, the hon. member said that to be &#x201C;westernized is civilized&#x201D;. That is just where we differ from the Opposition. The Opposition wants to make the Bantu a Black westerner. He must be an inferior imitator and must be compelled to follow in the footsteps of the White westerner. I wonder what the educated Japanese will say about this speech of the hon. member&#x2019;s, in which he says that it is only the person who is westernized who it civilized. I do not believe that the Japanese or the Chinese, with their ancient civilizations, will agree with the hon. member.</p>

<p>In addition, the hon. member spoke somewhat derogatively of the Bantu university colleges. If I understood him correctly, he spoke, <i>inter alia,</i> of &#x201C;tribal colleges The hon. member ought to know that those university colleges are examined by the University of South Africa, and also that the standard achieved there is a very high one. If he does not want to believe it, I can prove it to him. At Fort Hare the percentage of passes in the first year in 1962 was 64 per cent; in the second year it was 70.8 per cent, and in the third year 52.3 per cent. That compares very well with the examination results at other universities. In the northern universities the percentage of passes in the first year was 67 per cent, in the second year 73 per cent, and in the third year 55.5 per cent. That also compares very well with the White universities. In the case of the university college in Zululand the percentage of passes in the fisrt year was 65.6 per cent, and in the second year 91 per cent. There were 29 first-year students, of whom 19 passed; in the second year 12 wrote and 11 passed; in the third year six wrote and four passed, i.e., 66.6 per cent. These results repudiate that statement and the derogatory remarks of the hon. member for Kensington.</p>

<p>I just want to comment on one other thing that was said by the hon. member, and that is in regard to the control of Bantu education outside the Transkei. As an ex-educationist and an ex-inspector the hon. member ought to know that the Transkei cannot prescribe for the different schools in the Republic. The hon. member surely knows that in the case of the Transvaal we have for many years had students from Rhodesia, and still have them. We have, e.g. students from Swaziland there in the White schools and they simply have to follow the curriculum of the Transvaal schools. Surely the hon. member ought to know that. They cannot demand that the Rhodesian curriculum should be applied for them in the Transvaal schools, or the curriculum of Swaziland&#x2019;s White schools. That is surely obvious.</p>

<p>The commission of inquiry investigating the suitable language medium for the education of Bantu children in the Transkei unequivocally expressed itself as being in favour of the mother tongue as the medium of education. Despite the fact that there was a certain negative reference to this report, I want to say that I regard it as a thorough investigation, and that this report is particularly informative. It means that the commission desires&#x2014;and I emphasize this&#x2014;that the Bantu children in the Transkei should not receive their education through the medium of Afrikaans or English, but through the medium of their own language. They add that the lessons in Afrikaans and English should always be of a high standard, and that these two languages should receive particular attention. Indeed, that runs like a golden thread throughout the report of this commission.</p>

<p>I find two particular characteristics in regard to this report. In the first place the commission which issued this report consisted of expert educationists, and secondly, it consisted of Bantu. Therefore the findings of this commission are not the findings of laymen, but of experts in the sphere of education, people who are perhaps more expert than the hon. member for Kensington and I or others who may still participate in this debate. It is not the findings of a particular racial group which wants to enforce its desires on another group, or wants to indoctrinate another group with its views. These Bantu educationists worked on their own and decided on these matters, and they framed a thoroughly considered report. Under normal circumstances this report would not have told us anything new, because the idea of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction is a very old one. It is a standpoint supported by many educationists throughout the world. In that respect, Sir, it is only logical that those people came to this conclusion. What I find important is that in the circumstances this recommendation in fact has news value. It is of particular interest because during the course of the years certain persons and certain bodies stated that the Bantu should not receive his education through the medium of his mother tongue, but through the medium of English. But what is even worse, Sir, is that some people maintained that having a Bantu language as the medium of education was really a measure of oppression. Others again said that the Bantu languages were not suited to the media of education. The Bantu languages, in other words, were regarded as being inferior, and the people who were to receive education through the media of those languages would be receiving inferior instruction and education and would really be doomed to perpetual inferiority.

<p>On Clause 2,</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>At the second reading we made it clear from this side of the House what in the main our objections were to this Bill, but as the main provisions of the Bill in respect of which we raised objections are contained in Clause 2 I would like to say at once that we do not propose to have a long-drawn-out debate on every clause of this Bill. We shall oppose Clause 2 and call for a division on it because it is the kernel of our objection to the Bill. The fact that we do not speak on and oppose the subsequent clauses does not mean that we approve of them, but we feel that we want to centre our objection in Clause 2, and for that reason I would like just briefly to put the position so far as this side of the House is concerned. Sir, we are much more concerned with the public statement issued by the Minister in regard to how he proposes to use the powers to be conferred by this Bill and which are contained in Clause 2 because these powers provide for expropriation of land. That is imported into certain sub-sections of Clause 2 which provide for the proclamation of certain areas as Native locations. The Bill has two sets of powers of appropriation, one under the Housing Act and one under the Slums Act but there is also provision here for the Peri-Urban Areas Board to be a local authority in respect of certain of these areas. The powers of the Resettlement Board are imported here, and they also have powers of expropriation. In the main this is concentrated in Clause 2, and I want to say that we on this side of the House are concerned about the freehold title of people in areas such as Alexandra. I do not want to limit the discussion to Alexandra; the Minister rather complained about that in the previous debate. However, this principle is being established here and we believe that it is unnecessary. We believe that under existing legislation and the other provisions of this Bill, power already exists to clean up Alexandra and similar areas. The powers provided for in this Bill are therefore unnecessary. We have no objection whatsoever to the clearing up of those areas. The Minister has also made it abundantly clear that he proposes to establish, in place of the existing dwellings which are owned in freehold, certain blocks of flats to provide for altogether 20,000 single housing units or bedrooms in that particular area.</p>

<p>While I am on that may I just say this to the hon. the Minister. I noticed that he rather took my colleague to task for having said the flats which the Government intended to establish were very undesirable. The hon. the Minister went so far as to say that the Johannesburg City Council would not thank my hon. friend, the member for North-East Rand, for the line he had taken and that the Johannesburg City Council were very much in favour of those blocks of flats. No sooner had the hon. the Minister taken my hon. friend to task than he quoted from a letter which he said he had received dated 18 April this year. That letter destroyed his whole case. Let me read to the hon. the Minister what he said. This is a letter from the Town Clerk of Johannesburg to the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was also resolved to indicate to the Minister that, while appreciating the fact that the Bill is a step towards the erection and the control of hostels for single Bantu in Alexandra, the Council is of the opinion that the area should be planned for family as well as hostel accommodation.</block>

<p>That was what they said, Sir, and the Minister read it out as proving his case that they wanted hostel accommodation. Then the Minister himself went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They refer to the property rights which they do not want the Bantu to lose. We know this is a point of principle with them.</block>

<p>Precisely, Mr. Chairman. The hon. the Minister was proving our case for us. It is a matter of principle; we agree with them. He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, they would also like provision to be made there for families. They insisted that hostel accommodation should also be provided.</block>

<p>That is precisely the point. What we want from the Minister is proof that there is going to be provision for family housing, that freehold is going to be undiminished as far as the Bantu are concerned and that the hostels are going to be more in keeping with the requirements of the people in that area and that he will not carry into effect the idea contained in his statement that there are going to be 20,000 female and male Bantu living in these vast rabbit warrens. In the absence of anything to the contrary we must oppose this clause. We are quite in favour of cleaning <span class="col_6309_6310" refersTo="page_0487"/>up the area; we want to see it under proper municipal control. We think the City Council of Johannesburg agrees with us; we want family life as well as hostel life under proper control. In the absence of an assurance on that score we must oppose this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am going to vote against this clause as well. It is, as the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has said, the very kernel of this Bill. I have three objections to this particular clause. The first is that I believe it to be a complete betrayal of undertakings which were given by the Government to the African population of Alexandra Township on several occasions in the past. I shall quote my sources in a moment, Sir. One was given in 1957 by the then Minister of Bantu Administration, the present Prime Minister. Later, in reply to a question put by the then member for Parktown, Mr. Cope, further assurances were given that freehold title would not be affected. Although not in those specific words, the understanding was clear enough from what was said, and that was confirmed at a later stage when the hon. the Minister made statements as to the fate of Alexandra Township. I believe that the present Bill is designed mainly to move not only the surplus inhabitants from Alexandra Township but also gradually to take over the freehold properties of the Africans living in that area; and I believe it to be a betrayal of those undertakings of the past. Although specific statements were not made I think it will be clear to anybody who interprets language in the normal way, what was meant by those statements. In 1957 the then Minister of Bantu Affairs, the present Prime Minister, stated that there was no intention to remove Alexandra completely as had been necessary in the case of Sophiatown; that it was necessary to reduce the number of inhabitants to reasonable limits. He said nothing whatsoever in that statement, which was an official statement by the then Minister, that there was any intention whatsoever to touch freehold rights. People were entitled to assume, since the hon. Minister did not mention the removal of freehold rights, as had clearly been done in the case of Sophiatown, that there was no intention to touch freehold rights in Alexandra. In reply to a question put by Mr. Cope in 1959&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whether owners of immovable property and their families would be required to move and whether compensation would be paid to them, and, if so, on what basis?</block>

<p>the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Alexandra was not being evacuated. Owners of property who are lawfully entitled to remain there are not being disturbed. If, however, an owner, for some reason or other, has to leave Alexandra Township, the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board would be a buyer at market value and the second question falls away.</block>

<p>In other words, the section dealing with the compensation. The clear inference from that question and the reply given by the hon. the Minister was that property owners would not be affected. Even more recently statements were made to the effect that this was simply a slum clearance scheme. I put it that this is not a slum clearance scheme. It is a scheme with several objects, firstly, to reduce the number of people. [Interjections.] It is still a slum despite the efforts of the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board to which everybody has paid such glowing tribute in this House; so therefore the slum clearance side has not been implemented at all. The number of inhabitants has certainly been reduced drastically in some respects. But the object is to remove freehold rights because this is another Black spot in a so-called White area in the eyes of the Government. The other object, of course, is to turn the whole of Alexandra into an area for single people, whether married or not; people who are destined to be single as far as the Government is concerned. In other words, the setting up of hostels. My third main objection is that the arrangements which are made for expropriation are grossly unfair. I have here an example to prove my contention. There is a Bantu property owner in that area who in 1951 was granted a first bond of &#x00A3;950 on his property. Later, in 1956 and in 1958, he was granted two further loans amounting to &#x00A3;1,400. So that the total amount of his bond amounted to &#x00A3;2,350. The property is valued at a minimum of &#x00A3;3,000 and the amount still owing under the bond is &#x00A3;1,500. The Peri-Urban Areas Board, which is the only purchaser of property in that area, the only purchaser who is allowed to purchase in that area, so it is not a matter of free choice of buyer and seller, has offered &#x00A3;657 for that property. [Interjections.] This property is valued at &#x00A3;3,000 and &#x00A3;657 is the amount offered by the Peri-Urban Areas Board which is the only legal purchaser of property in that area.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The stand is valued at &#x00A3;3,000; that is the official valuation by the estate agent; it is the official valuation of the land.</p>

<p>The purchase price in respect of another stand valued at &#x00A3;2,000 is &#x00A3;800. So I claim it is grossly unfair to force sales in Alexandra Township. My third objection is the same as that raised by the hon. member for South Coast, namely, that I am completely against this idea of dormitories set-ups in our urban areas, this housing of vast complexes of single Africans, males or females. A lot of attention was paid to a recent report by the Government. The Government has conveniently forgotten other commission reports headed by, I should say, at least equally illustrious Judges, commissions which found both in the case of the Dube riots and the Cato Manor riots that one of the main causes of those riots was the <span class="col_6311_6312" refersTo="page_0488"/>concentration of large numbers of single Bantu in urban areas. I am not saying that family life <i>per se</i> is being broken up by this, because I quite understand that the family units are being moved to other areas. But in so far as the whole of Alexandra Township is now being set aside completely for the dormitory type of labour for compound labour, for barracks labour, to which I have the strongest objection, on sociological grounds, I am going to vote against this clause.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to repeat what I said on a previous occasion namely, that we appreciated the attitude of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). We are grateful for the measure of support we are getting from the Opposition that an undesirable urban area like Alexandra should be cleared up, that it should be better equipped for housing purposes, that it should be better administered and that this Bill is necessary for that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast has raised two points in regard to which I should like to enlighten him a little. I do not blame him for not understanding the position completely because this is a difficult Bill to understand. There are numerous cross-references. The hon. member has qualms about the reference to the Resettlement Board. The hon. member will notice that Clause 2 (4) (d) refers to the possibility of co-operation with the Resettlement Board. It is clearly stated that that co-operation with the Resettlement Board will be possible in terms of Section 10 of the Urban Areas Act. That means that the local body, the Peri-Urban Board which controls Alexandra, will be able to regard the Resettlement Board as a local authority with which to conclude an agreement. I want to remind the hon. member that an agreement has already been entered into with the Resettlement Board. Over the past few years the Resettlement Board has already been assisting in removing the surplus inhabitants from Alexandra and in settling them in the south-western areas. It is only to make such co-operation possible in future that that has been inserted here. But it will not be possible to use the legislation governing the Resettlement Board, i.e. the Resettlement Act to expropriate in Alexandra.</p>

<p>It will not be possible to use the machinery of the Resettlement Board, i.e., the Resettlement Act of 1954, for expropriation in Alexandra. I want to repeat what I said during the second-reading debate, namely that we hope it will not be necessary to resort to expropriation. So far it has not been necessary to expropriate in Alexandra. I want to stress, however, and this is something the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) should also bear in mind, that right up to the present it was possible to expropriate in Alexandra without this Bill, had it been necessary. It was not necessary, however, and we hope it will not be necessary in future. We cannot give any guarantees in this respect. Should we have to expropriate in future it will not be possible to do so in terms of the Resettlement Act. It will have to be done in terms of the Housing Act as was stated during the second-reading debate. I should like to correct the hon. member for South Coast in that respect and I hope he accepts it because that is the position. The second point in regard to which I want to correct the hon. member for South Coast is in respect of the hostels. It is in this respect that his Whip from the Transvaal has made the position somewhat difficult for him. After I had asked the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) the specific question, after he had said so by way of interjection, he said that nobody wanted hostels in Alexandra. That was what the hon. member for North-East Rand said at a moment when he was not thinking what he was saying. I then quoted from the two letters from the Johannesburg City Council to the effect that they did want hostels plus family quarters. I did not ignore the last aspect; I mentioned it. But the hon. member for North-East Rand said that nobody wanted hostels there. I want to remind the hon. member for South Coast that in addition to their wanting family quarters there, the Johannesburg Municipality also wants hostels there, <i>inter alia,</i> for the accommodation of single people from the northern areas. So we have that in common with the City Council of Johannesburg and I hope with the hon. member for South Coast, although not with the hon. member for North-East Rand.</p>

<p>*I think I replied to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) a few weeks before she put her question. Unfortunately she was not here during the second-reading debate.</p>

<p>You have read it, but to listen is always more beneficial than to read. I replied to the question of the previous member for Parktown, Mr. Cope. I must say that the hon. member reads it completely incorrectly if she reads into it that there will not be expropriation. The reply was that &#x201C;Alexandra is not being evacuated. Owners of property who are lawfully entitled to remain there are not being disturbed Disturb means that those 500 property owners who have already sold will not be disturbed. [Interjections.] Mr. Chairman, I hope it will never be necessary for me to sing in the same choir as that hon. member. I want to repeat what I said during the second-reading debate, namely that we were not anxious to expropriate on a large scale. In practice so far there have been voluntary sales, on a reasonable basis. I totally discard the idea of the hon. member for Houghton that those acquisitions have so far been &#x201C;forced transactions&#x201D;. The figures she quoted <span class="col_6313_6314" refersTo="page_0489"/>in connection with the valuation of properties carry no weight. Why did those people sell voluntarily? I think the hon. member is exaggerating. We know what her attitude is in this connection. There is a fundamental difference between us. It is no use arguing much with her. Having said this, Mr. Chairman, I think I have said enough.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister if he owned a property in Roodepoort and wished to retain that property and if he was told that if he did not sell to the one person who was prepared to buy it at the price laid down by that purchaser, his property would be expropriated and that if he wanted to own any property in return he would have to own it at a point at least 50 miles away from Roodepoort, he would not be &#x201C;disturbed Of course property owners are being &#x201C;disturbed&#x201D;. What does the Minister think this word means? What does he think the property owners of Alexandra read into that reply to Mr. Cope&#x2019;s question? What does he think the property owners of Alexandra understood when they were told that property owners who were lawfully entitled to remain there would not be disturbed? All property owners in Alexandra Township now understand that if they do not sell their property voluntarily, the property will be expropriated. Therefore they are selling and in some cases, as I have shown, at a great loss to themselves. [Interjections.]</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>He might on occasion make a contribution to the debate, Sir, instead of just interjecting. I say that that is disturbing property owners whether the hon. the Deputy Minister wants to get out of it the way he has tried to or not. I say equally that when the present Prime Minister said that Alexandra Township was not to be removed as Sophia-town Township had been removed, everybody understood that to mean freehold property since that was the cardinal point in regard to the Sophiatown Township removal.</p>

<p>I have another point I wish to raise with the hon. the Deputy Minister. I wonder whether he would be kind enough to tell us whether it is his intention to disturb or not to disturb some of the very fine institutions that have been set up in Alexandra Township, and set up for the specific purpose of dealing with the families and the children in Alexandra Township. I refer to the child welfare clinics and to the schools. According to figures given to me in this House earlier this year there are 10,618 married couples, that is, 21,236 people, and they have about 20,799 children. All these people presumably are going to be disturbed; they are going to be moved. Because it is not the Government&#x2019;s intention to allow families to remain there unless they are prepared to be split up and live in single quarters, which obviously they would not want to do. What is to happen to their children in those circumstances I do not know. So I presume they will all be moved to Diep Kloof or somewhere else where the Government will resettle them. I want to know what is going to happen, for instance, to the Alexandra Health Clinic, to the University Centre, to the Family Welfare Centre and, of course, to the Holy Cross Mission School. All these are large and well-established institutions catering for children and family welfare. What is the Minister&#x2019;s intention here? Is he going to leave these institutions undisturbed? Could we have language which is a little bit less ambiguous, language which not only we can understand, but which the Africans of Alexandra Township can understand and the owners of the clinics and of the schools can also understand, unequivocally and clearly.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>As hon. members are aware, the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act of 1945 is one of the most important Acts whereby Parliament delegates authority to the provinces to legislate in such matters as Parliament deems expedient. In this proposed amendment Bill it is suggested that authority be granted to the provinces to legislate in respect of four matters of a diverse nature, and I shall deal with the four different matters under the relevant clauses.</p>

<p>Clause 1 relates to the establishment of a Central Bursary Fund. Sub-sections (a), (b) and (c) of Section 18 provide for the training of teachers and nurses, but sub-section (d) of the same section deals exclusively with the award of bursaries to persons who wish to qualify themselves to hold professional or technical posts in the provincial administration or in any institution controlled, aided or subsidized by the administration. Since the incorporation of this sub-section in 1959, the provinces, the Public Service Commission and the Treasury have come to the conclusion that this is not advisable for each provincial administration and then also the Public Service Commission to receive applications for bursaries from qualified persons and thereafter to negotiate with the universities or other educational institutions in regard to the administration of such bursary schemes. It has therefore <span class="col_6317_6318" refersTo="page_0491"/>been arranged with the Treasury and the Public Service Commission that the amount which the provincial administrations are prepared to provide for the awarding of bursaries to persons who wish to qualify themselves to hold professional or technical posts in the administrations be deposited in one central fund under the control of the Public Service Commission, and the administration of only one scheme be undertaken by the Commission. For the awarding of bursaries, the needs of provincial administrations will of course be kept in mind. The provincial administrations are, however, not legally empowered to contribute to such a Central Bursary Fund, and at their request it is now proposed that subsection (d) be amended to grant them such authority. At the same time it is realized that occasions may arise when the provinces on their own may want to incur expenditure even if it is only for the purpose of making a small donation to one or other studying official. It is for this reason, Mr. Speaker, that the authority at present vested in the provinces is not being curtailed, but is rather enlarged to permit such donations, subject to consultation with the Public Service Commission, and authority therefore being obtained from the Treasury.</p>

<p>Clause 2 deals with the contributions by the provinces to the funds of the regional councils for the performing arts. As hon. members know the Government has taken active steps to advance the performing arts in the Republic, that is music, opera and ballet.</p>

<p>One of these steps is to undertake the subsidization of a R2 for R1 basis of the organizations to be established. The four provinces are in agreement that through a combination of unforeseen circumstances it may happen that they will of necessity have to render financial assistance, but due to the provisions of the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendment Act, as it reads at present, it will, however, not be possible for the provinces to do so. In the nature of things it amounts to this that the respective provinces will be very closely associated with the whole project that they will have to take care of in a great measure and will have to further its interests and that they will have to approach local authorities, such as municipalities and divisional councils falling under their jurisdiction, for funds, while they themselves as regards the financial aspect will be unable to assist even though the organization should find itself in financial embarrassment because of the inadequacy of available funds. This can happen for example as a result of a shortage of subsidies which the regional councils must find themselves or even because the funds which are collected, together with the Government subsidy, may prove to be inadequate. Such circumstances would place the provinces in an unenviable position in the eyes of all the other external bodies to whom the provinces will have to appeal for aid. It is therefore suggested in view of the foregoing that the 1945 Act be so amended as to enable the provinces, should it become necessary to place funds at the disposal of the regional councils for the advancement of the performing arts, subject to the conditions as set out in the clause, namely that such contributions by the provinces are not to be taken into account when the Government subsidy is determined&#x2014; that these contributions will not be taken into account when determining the subsidy to the provinces out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and that it will be possible to render such assistance only with the approval of the relative provinces.</p>

<p>Clause 3 deals with the contributions to the 1820 Settlers Memorial by the provinces. As hon. members are aware the 1820 Settlers Memorial Trust is responsible for the erection and upkeep of the 1820 Settlers Memorial, a national monument in honour of those of our forefathers who are known as the 1820 Settlers. The Government has set an example by donating R 100,000 to this fund, and the provinces felt that they also wanted to contribute towards this fund. Unfortunately their request last year reached the Government too late for the introduction of the necessary legislation, but the Government informed the provinces that it would approach Parliament during the present Session to obtain the required authority with retrospective effect. It is therefore now being proposed that the provinces be granted authority, with retrospective effect from 1 April 1962, to contribute towards the funds of this trust and to incur expenditure outside their respective provinces in connection with the 1820 Settlers Memorial. On several occasions in the past similar authority was granted to the provinces, for instance in the case of the Van Riebeeck Festival, during 1952, and the Centenary Exhibition in Rhodesia during 1953.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 4 which deals with the safeguarding against prescription of land vested in or under the control of local authorities. In the State Land Disposal Act of 1961 (Act No. 4) provision is made to safeguard State land being acquired by prescription, because the State is the owner of large pieces of land which are sometimes situated in inaccessible mountains and which often cannot be controlled as far as trespassing is concerned. The administrators of the four provinces decided at a conference in August 1961 to request the Government to empower the provinces by way of an amendment to the Financial Relations Consolidation and Amendmend Act to make ordinances whereby land under the control of local authorities can be safeguarded from being acquired by prescription. The administrators are of the opinion <span class="col_6319_6320" refersTo="page_0492"/>that local authorities are no more able than the State to take adequate precautions against the acquisition of land by prescription under their control, as for instance nature reserves, parks, open spaces, roads and streets. The administrators are, in addition to their responsibility, to further the interests of local authorities, directly concerned with this as the provincial administrations contribute large amounts towards certain local projects, the cost of which are often increased by compensation for prescription claims. Section 3 of the State Land Disposal Act of 1961 stipulates that no person may acquire State land by prescription after a period of ten years has lapsed from the date of commencement of the Act. At the time when the State Land Disposal Bill was introduced it had no provision for a grace period of ten years, but this was incorporated in the Senate by the Minister of Lands to meet the <i>bona fide</i> occupiers of State land whose occupations stretched over a long period. Otherwise a person who had only a few years left to complete the period of possessive prescription would experience that his whole life&#x2019;s task was of no avail. The Act came into operation on 28 June 1961. In other words, any person whose period of acquiring State land by prescription is completed before 28 June 1971 will retain his rights. It is therefore suggested in Clause 4 of this Bill that the provinces be empowered to make ordinances to safeguard against the acquisition of land by prescription which is vested in or under the control of or which is being held in trust for a local authority after the expiration of a period of ten years from the date of the coming into operation of the ordinances.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. Deputy Minister has given a very clear picture of the contents of the four clauses of this Bill. On this side of the House we are prepared to support the second reading, but there are one or two points that I would like to have cleared up, and perhaps when the hon. Deputy Minister replies he will make a point clear in regard to Clause 1. I listened carefully, but I did not quite follow the hon. Minister in regard to the new (d). Sir, in the case of 1 (b) it is clear now that there will be established a central fund for the purpose of paying scholarships and bursaries and so forth, the training fees for certain persons who wish to increase their qualifications, mostly academic qualifications, pursuant to their employment in the service of the State. I understood from the hon. Minister that in the case of sub-section (d) that was put in because there was no intention to deprive the provinces of their right to make such grants themselves to people who, outside of nurses and teachers, are in the service of the province. In terms of this clause, the province concerned would first have to get the approval of the Treasury, after consultation with the Public Service Commission. The crisp point I would like to ask the hon. Minister to reply to is: As this clause is set out now, does it mean that, subject to the approval of the Treasury, after consultation with the Public Service Commission, there is no hindrance on the provinces continuing to subsidize by way of scholarships or bursaries the training of people who are within their own service other than teachers and nurses? I understood the hon. Minister to say that that was the case, but I would like to make sure, because in common with other parts of the administration, the provinces of course are woefully short of trained personnel, and it seems to me that where we have people who are willing to go on with their training after they have come into the Civil Service, and who are willing instead of taking time off to go to bioscopes and so forth, to get down to studies so as to increase their academic qualifications and professional qualifications, we should encourage that by all means in our power. I can quite realize that as far as State Departments are concerned, it might be extremely desirable, and in fact we on this side have no quarrel with the idea that there should be a fund from which will be defrayed for the purpose of the Civil Service and State Departments such expenditure as may be necessary to give these young folk that further training and education. But where it comes to the provinces, their requirements vary, and one is not able to, shall I say, earmark the students, you cannot put a brand on them, they are people whom you want for a specific purpose and who are willing to train themselves for that purpose in a provincial administration, which has many and varied interests and activities. For that purpose some provinces will find that they require people of a certain type and certain training, and others will be requiring people of a different type and a different training. And if it is clear that the rights of the provinces remain undiminished to provide for the necessary funds to assist in the training of these people, we will find this provision satisfactory.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 2, the payment for the advancement of opera, music, the stage and ballet, and so on, by means of performances in the province in question, this is an issue that has been knocking at the door of the provinces for very many long years. This is a permissive clause, and I think the hon. Deputy Minister will realize that its implementation by the provincial administrations is going to cause a considerable amount of administrative difficulties, and that we are going to have the same trouble that we have had in regard to other matters, namely that if you get a province that is financially well off, if it has got members on the Executive Committee who are patrons of the arts, and there is a feeling that the money is there and that something could be done in the way set out in this particular clause, and if they cut the ice and create a precedent, then the other provinces will have it quoted against them and they will be asked &#x201C;Why do you not appreciate art and why are you not prepared to assist us in the same way as province X is assisting?&#x201D; You will get that kind of thing very easily. I say it has been knocking at the door for many years. It was knocking at the door when I was in Pietermaritzburg, <span class="col_6321_6322" refersTo="page_0493"/>and that is 15 or 16 years ago, and it had been knocking on the door for a long time before that. The trouble will not fall on the shoulders of the hon. Minister. May I say that I congratulate him in this respect that he has passed the buck, the ballet buck, to the provinces, and he will stand back with a halo around his head as being the bringer of all good things to the arts, and he will have none of the troubles of administering and finding the money to meet the demands of these people, more so by reason of the fact that, as the Minister quite frankly said, of course any money so paid out will not rank for subsidy from the Central Government. It will be on the provinces&#x2019; own shoulders for them to find the money from their own taxpayers.</p>

<p>With regard to Clause 3, I am going in the main to leave it to the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) to put the point of this side of the House. I know that this is a matter which is very dear to his heart, and I will leave it to him to say those things that represent the view of this side of the House.</p>

<p>With regard to Clause 4, the right to acquire land by prescription, I wish to say that I think we were all pleased when in the Other Place, in 1961, the hon. Minister of Lands provided a ten-year period during which persons who were acquiring a right by residential servitude, or by occupational servitude, should be given the opportunity for that right to come to fruition for the necessary period (I think 33 years), to give them an opportunity to assess the position. If the period would not come to fruition within the period of ten years, they would have to make some other arrangements. Here the Bill is before us at the request of the municipalities, and I know that many of them have had very great difficulties. We have had difficulties as far as the provinces are concerned as well as the Government, but our interests were taken care of at the same time that the interests of the provinces were taken care of in 1961 when a Bill was passed. Now the municipalities are in this trouble, and I again would like to say that I think that a ten-year period in which people who are occupying municipal land will be given the opportunity to assess the position is satisfactory. If the period of prescription is not going to be completed during the ten years ahead of us, then it is up to them to do something about it. Acquisition of land by prescription, Sir, is a very old concept, but it is a concept that is falling into disuse in terms of modern conditions, and probably quite rightly particularly where public-owned land is concerned. But curious circumstances arise from time to time where pieces of land are completely lost sight of for one reason or another, and now the municipalities will have the same powers as the provincial administrations and the Government in that respect as they are also experiencing the same difficulties. Therefore we want to give this Bill our blessing and we have no objection to the second reading being taken.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we on this side of the House deeply appreciate the stimulation the provisions of Clause 3 of this Bill will give to the 1820 Settlers Monument project. The descendants of the 1820 Settlers to-day claim to stand on the same national footing as if their forebears had landed with Van Riebeeck. Although they came over 160 years later and only comprised about one-tenth of the White population they came here as the second wave of civilization to our eastern frontier, after the Afrikaans pioneers. In the wake of the 1820 Settlers followed the privileges of modern civilization, self-government, religious and educational advancement, agriculture, trade, industrial development and, above all, the unity of our races in a new homeland. Since that time we have drifted apart, but this monument is designed to be the third wave to ensure that our traditions and history will not only be depicted as part of our South African structure, but will further the cause of unity, on which the maintenance of our Western civilization depends. In the national drive for contributions from all sections of the community, and to ensure building a people&#x2019;s monument, it is of the utmost importance that our provincial councils are aligned with this idealism. The 1820 Settlers Monument Trust is deeply appreciative that the combined provincial councils made representations for this legislation, and it is also grateful to the Prime Minister and his Cabinet for promoting this great endeavour and for introducing the Bill now before us. I can assure hon. members that the proposed 1820 Settlers Monument will not only be designed to depict 1820 Settler history, but to open up avenues for research into a period of our history which is now being neglected. Amongst its component parts this monument will ensure the preservation of the rich and unique indigenous flora of the Eastern Province in a 62-acre garden. It will comprise a museum for which relics are waiting, and there will be a library. It will be a utility monument in that it will provide for and inspire advancement and enlightenment, and it will even promote the arts and sciences. An organ will be installed in the central structure. Contributions from individuals and institutions will be inscribed in a golden book, and out of the inspiration of the past and mutual pride in our common tradition, this monument, to the 1820 Settlers, will be a beacon indicating the course along which we as a nation should shape our future.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk on this Bill in the interests of the Coloured people whom I represent. Clause 1 deals with the opportunities which will now be afforded to the Public Service Commission to assist persons to study for professional and technical posts. Take the case of a Coloured man who wishes to take up a professional legal post. Apparently there is no opportunity for such <span class="col_6323_6324" refersTo="page_0494"/>a person to obtain a bursary. Whilst I am very happy indeed that this Bill will now enable White youths to obtain financial assistance, I do feel that the time has arrived that there should also be a <i>quid pro quo</i> for Coloured students who are most anxious to become professional men. Particularly is that the case in view of the fact that the Minister of Justice last year indicated that if there were Coloured men who were proficient in the legal profession he would be only too happy to have them in his employ. Unfortunately there appears to be no opportunity for these Coloured youths to obtain bursaries and there is a bottle-neck. I hope that the Minister will try to persuade the Cabinet and the Minister of Coloured Affairs, who unfortunately is not here now, to give the same opportunities to Coloured youths. Many of them are most anxious but they just do not have the opportunity. It seems unfair, and it is to be regretted that the same opportunities are not afforded to the Coloured youths as are now to be afforded to the Whites.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 2, I remember that two or three years ago when I was still a member of the Cape Town City Council, a conference was held in Pretoria in connection with a South African dramatic or operatic society, with the same object in view as indicated in Clause 2. Here again I want to ask the Minister whether there are any strings attached in this clause to the benefits which will be given to these organizations which are recognized by the Minister as advancing the interests of ballet or art by means of performances. The conference in Pretoria failed, I believe, because there were strings attached. Those strings were that these performances could not be given before mixed audiences. Will the hon. the Minister tell me whether any of these organizations which are to be assisted by the provincial councils through the Government will be entitled to perform to mixed audiences, and if they do not agree to that condition, whether their subsidies or grants will be withdrawn. We have a case already on record of perhaps the most outstanding operatic company in South Africa, the Eoan Group.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>It has this to do with the Bill, that financial assistance will now be given to dramatic or ballet societies for performances, and the Coloured people in every province contribute to the revenue of South Africa in more than one way, and I therefore want to know from the Government whether this Bill will attach any strings in respect of the type of audience to which these people can play. The Bill is silent on the point. I was dealing with the Eoan Group and I referred to it as perhaps the most outstanding operatic company in South Africa. There is not a person in this House who can deny that they have raised the cultural standards of South Africa in opera. They are outstanding in their performances and they are known throughout South Africa, but they had to paddle their own canoe because of the fact that the subsidy which the Government gave them was withdrawn because they refused to comply with the condition that they should not play to mixed audiences. It is germane to this Bill to point out to the Minister and to the Government that this cultural organization has been able to surmount all its difficulties because of the support given to them by the people of South Africa, Coloured and White. They have played to mixed audiences and nobody has been prejudiced by it, but the Government refuses to recognize this brilliant cultural organization because it insists on conditions which the public of South Africa, I venture to say, reject. I think it would be a thousand pities if the same conditions are going to be attached to the provinces as have been attached to the Eoan Group. I should like the Minister to tell me whether that is so, because if so, I should like to move an amendment to make it applicable to all people, that everyone who wants to attend a performance can do so, and that there will be no division on lines of colour.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support this measure has received in this House. To me it was like a fresh breath of air to hear the appreciative words expressed by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). When you are told on the one hand how much the Government has done and you see on the other hand the measure of co-operation which exists, it seems that after 300 years we have at least made some progress. A few matters have been raised to which I should like to reply briefly.</p>

<p>I should like to tell the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that it is not the intention to deprive the provinces of the right to contribute towards the study fund of their own officials whom they would like to subsidize. They will be able to do so subject, of course, to consultation with the Public Service Commission. That is merely the procedure but it does not affect the principle that they will be allowed to contribute to the studies of their own officials.</p>

<p>No, not after obtaining the permission of the Public Service Commission. The hon. member also referred to the performing arts and expressed the opinion that we have passed the buck to the provinces. Well, all I can say about this passing of the buck is that I hope the provinces will handle this with discretion, because I think the performing arts need some local stimulation. So I hope they will treat this matter with enthusiasm and with the necessary discretion.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) is very concerned about those Coloureds <span class="col_6325_6326" refersTo="page_0495"/>who, on the one hand, would not get enough bursaries and, on the other hand, would not get sufficient recognition by mixed audiences. As far as bursaries are concerned there is nothing in this measure which limits them to Whites only; they are there for all deserving cases and if there is a deserving case of a Coloured in the employ of the province his application for a bursary will enjoy the same consideration as that of a White person. As far as mixed audiences are concerned, the hon. member wanted to know &#x201C;whether there are any strings attached to this clause&#x201D;. No, I am unaware of any strings attaching to it. All I want to say is that it will be the task of the provincial authorities concerned to decide. It does not state that it is limited to White audiences, but I do not hesitate to express the hope that where it will be the responsibility of the provincial authorities to decide about a performance they will give due consideration to the racial pattern in this country and our traditions. I hope they will do so and I think they can do so without doing any injustice to any Coloured audience. They can do it in such a way, for instance, that it will not offend the White audiences in Cape Town but that it will be a pleasure for them to attend these performances and at the same time give the Coloureds the opportunity to see the same performance. I have no doubt about it that they will exercise sound discretion.</p>

<p>I should like to discuss the question of the medium of instruction under the Minister&#x2019;s policy, although I wonder&#x2014;I hope the Minister will enlighten me&#x2014;whether it is worth while doing so at this stage, particularly when one bears in mind the fact that he will soon have to relinquish Bantu Education as the result of the new legislation that we passed recently. I cannot pursue this matter but I just want to refer to this in passing; as a matter of fact the Minister himself admitted it.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I am only talking about the Transkei at the moment. Perhaps you will permit me, Sir, to say a few words about the thorny educational problem of the medium of instruction, particularly in pursuance of this enlightening document that we have before us, the report of the Commission of Inquiry in connection with the use of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction in the Transkeian primary schools.</p>

<p>But before dealing with that I should like to refer to this report that we have before us, particularly in connection with certain figures and statements which appear in it, and with special reference to English A, the teaching of it and the quality of the tuition. I want to refer particularly to page 3. In paragraph (e) it is stated that the percentage of failures in English A in the Junior Certificate examinations in 1959 was 5.3, and in comparison with that, the percentage of failures amongst White children in the Cape Province was 1 per cent, while in the case of Coloured schools it was 3 per cent. In 1960 the percentage of failures in Bantu schools was 2.4, 4 per cent in the case of Whites and 7 per cent in the case of Coloureds. In 1961, the last year in respect of which the figures are given, the percentage of failures in the Bantu schools was 2.4, in White schools 4 per cent and in the case of the Coloureds 5 per cent. It is evident from this that the standard of teaching of English must have been very high and excellent if these figures are correct, and I have no reason to believe that they are not correct; secondly, the figure compares very favourably with the number of passes or failures in the White schools and in the Coloured schools; and, thirdly, what disturbs me is the fact that this rather contradicts what the Commission says in connection with the extremely poor quality of English in the Bantu schools. On page 4 the Commission says that the standard of English is extremely low. I leave it at that and I should like to hear the Minister&#x2019;s views in that regard.</p>

<p>I should like now to deal with the question of the medium of instruction. The Commission deals fairly fully with the question of the medium of instruction, and in this connection if we want to dictate to the Transkei as far as the medium of instruction in concerned, or if we want to give the Transkei the best advice in connection with this matter, I should like to issue a note of warning that we must be careful, particularly having regard to what is stated at pages 17 and 18. You will permit me, Sir, to quote a few extracts from those two pages. <i>Inter alia</i> the Commission says [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Commission cannot recommend, however, that English should be introduced at an early stage as the medium of instruction with the object of improving the knowledge of the language (i.e. English).</block>

<p><span class="col_6327_6328" refersTo="page_0496"/>Lower down the page it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The contention that there is no future for the Xhosa language is one which must be rejected by the Commission.</block>

<p>Then in paragraph 7 the Commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Very few entirely reject the mother tongue as the medium of instruction. The vast majority are in favour of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction.</block>

<p>I assume that by &#x201C;most people&#x201D; the Commission means the majority of those who gave evidence. In paragraph 7 (b) the Commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reasons for this incontrovertible educational principle are not always well understood.</block>

<p>Then I want to turn to page 31, question No. 9: &#x201C;Sixty-three per cent supported the principle of mother tongue instruction only as far as Std. II.&#x201D; Then I come to question 10: &#x201C;Do you regard Xhosa as a suitable medium of instruction in primary schools?&#x201D; Then there seems to be a contradiction of what was stated under question 9: &#x201C;Up to Std. II 22.1 per cent &#x2014;no, 34.1 per cent&#x201D;. Then it continues: &#x201C;If your reply to No. 10 above is &#x2018;no&#x2019; can Xhosa be developed into a suitable medium of instruction in primary schools?&#x201D; To this question 25 per cent replied &#x201C;yes&#x201D;, 49.9 per cent replied &#x201C;no&#x201D; and 25 per cent were uncertain. Surely that is inconsistent! The arguments advanced here are conflicting.</p>

<p>As far as we Afrikaans-speaking people are concerned the position is that we pleaded right from the start that the mother tongue, or the language of the family, should be introduced as the medium of instruction. That was opposed. Here we have the peculiar position that we want to introduce the mother tongue as the medium of instruction but that the people concerned oppose it; they do not want it. [Interjections.] It seems to me that they want us to recommend that Xhosa should not be introduced as the medium of instruction; in other words, that unlike ourselves they do not want that principle to be introduced.

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>The previous speaker has referred to this very important document before us, this report of the Commission of Inquiry, and no matter how he tried to put it anybody who has read this report calmly and objectively will have concluded that it is nothing else than a great triumph of teaching through the medium of the mother tongue. He has referred to pages 17 and 18 but if I can take this House step by step through the report hon. members will agree that apart from what a large number of Bantu parents may say, educationists emphasize the absolute necessity that if you want to offer real education teaching should be through the medium of the mother tongue. On page 18, in support of his attitude, the commission quoted from the memoranda by Dr. P. A. Duminy of the Educational Faculty at the University College of Fort Hare in which he says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We should see that the child learns to know, with a knowing embracing the whole personality, but this knowing will be an impossibility while the young child is being deprived of the only means in which he can express and crystallize his total experience in life, namely his mother tongue.&#x2026; One of the main reasons why the schools had to rely on that crude factual knowledge is because these facts had to be retained in a language that was not their own. Where the Bantu child is now confronted with strange facts in a strange language, it is hardly surprising that downright memorization remains the only way out.</block>

<p>The commission then finds that the reasons for mother tongue education are so strong that they are unassailable and that if in fact the mother tongue is not available as a medium of teaching it must be developed until it is suitable for that purpose or else another mother tongue should be accepted. That is why I say that this report is nothing else than one of the strongest proofs of that which we have always pleaded for on this side of the House, namely, that the Bantu child should be educated through the medium of the language which he best understands, namely, through the medium of his mother tongue. Other speakers who follow me will get deeper into this matter. I just want to emphasize that as far as I am concerned, this report proves three things very conclusively: In the first instance, the necessity for mother tongue education and in the second place the progress which is made in the field of Bantu education with the development of the language and the actual training of the Bantu child in developing his insight and in the third place the necessity for research and planning in the various educational fields which have been opened up. Where I refer to these three things I want to plead in the first instance this afternoon with the hon. the Minister to see to it that his Department develops along much stronger lines. We are pleading for more experts at the head office of Bantu education with a view to planning. The progress which is being made is so extensive and so comprehensive that you require many more experts to undertake the planning. I speak subject to correction but I understand that there is only one professional assistant with five assistants at the moment; the hon. the Minister can tell us whether that is right. That is by far insufficient for this gigantic building programme which must be tackled. Let me mention just two things in support of this: The Bantu Education Advisory Board will shortly submit suggestions which will call for investigation. That Advisory Board will be an active board which will make many suggestions in connection with the transfer of education to the Transkei and experts <span class="col_6329_6330" refersTo="page_0497"/>are required to give advice in the various fields to effect that transfer. That is why the hon. the Minister will have to see to it that more professional men are appointed to his Department. Furthermore, one of the most important branches of education remains technical training to which reference is also made in this report, and with a view to the establishment of border industries it will be necessary for many more Bantu children to undergo technical training. More should be done in regard to the technical training of the Bantu child. Then you have the question of the establishment of psychological services. Every educationist will agree that it is impossible to carry out a real educational programme unless you introduce the necessary psychological services and we know that the multitude of tests which we can apply in the case of the White child to-day will be of no value whatsoever in respect of the Bantu child because his reaction is totally different and his problems should be approached in a different light. The tests which we apply in the case of the White child cannot be applied to the Bantu child. The tests in the case of the Bantu child must be standardized and that is why it is necessary, as far as psychological services are concerned, that much more should be done. At the moment only a small team is active in that field where a great amount of work has to be done. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. member who has just sat down that so far I have expressed no opinion in connection with the question of the medium of instruction. All I did was to warn that we must be careful. He says that all the experts recognize that the use of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction is the only principle that ought to be applied. There I differ from him, of course. Although we in South Africa have always recognized the mother tongue or the home language as the medium of instruction and although it has become traditional to do so in this country, I know of no scientific ground on which that is done. Other methods are followed with great success in other countries of the world as far as the medium of instruction is concerned. May I refer the Committee to what is being done in certain countries of the world. I do not want to lay down a hard and fast rule here; I have already explained what we do in South Africa. I repeat that in South Africa it has become the convention, where it is possible to do so, to use the mother tongue as the medium of instruction. We encourage the parents in this direction; I personally did so for many years. We advise parents to have their children educated, as far as possible, through the mother tongue as the medium of instruction, and it seems to me that that is what is suggested here, but there are other countries in the world where this principle does not apply, and as far as I can ascertain the fact that this principle is not applied has no detrimental effect on the children.</p>

<p>In Quebec in Canada, in Southern Canada, for example this principle is not followed.</p>

<p>I do not know that there is more trouble in Canada between the French-and the English-speaking Canadians than there is in this country, for example between the Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking sections. I know of no trouble there at the moment, but what I am discussing here is the principle; I am not discussing any quarrel between two racial groups. In Quebec we find that the language of the Church becomes the medium of instruction. The language of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada is French, and all children from Roman Catholic families are educated through the medium of French.</p>

<p>I should like to know from the hon. member whether he is aware of the resolution of the International Conference in Brussels in 1948 with regard to mother tongue education and the fact that they recommended it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I have no quarrel with that resolution. I have already said that that has become the convention in South Africa but we cannot contend that because it has become the tradition, it is scientifically and educationally correct and that it is the only correct method that can be followed, because in other countries such as Canada, for example, a different principle is followed.</p>

<p>But let us look at the position in Switzerland. There you have three different language groups and the medium of instruction depends on the language of the municipality in which the child finds himself. If the language of the Municipality is French, then French becomes the medium of instruction in the schools in that municipality. Where the language of the municipality is German or Italian, then German or Italian becomes the medium of instruction. If a child is French-speaking in a German municipality, then the medium of instruction is German. If a child in a French area is Italian-speaking, then its medium of instruction is French. As far as Switzerland is concerned therefore there is no fixed principle of mother-tongue education. As the Commission points out in its report, there is no scientific basis for our view in connection with the use of the home language as the medium of instruction.</p>

<p><span class="col_6331_6332" refersTo="page_0498"/>But the best example is America. There we have millions of Italians and Germans and French and Irish, but there the language of the country is the medium of instruction, and I refuse to accept that the American nation is inferior because of that fact or that the American children do not receive education which compares very favourably with the best in the world.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>The point I want to make is that we should not try to dictate to the Transkei what its medium of instruction should be; that we should rather advise them and that we should also bring to their notice the fact which I have just mentioned here, and that is that scientifically it is not necessarily a mistake not to introduce the child&#x2019;s mother tongue as the medium of instruction. I repeat that that has become the convention in South Africa but there are no scientific grounds, no educational grounds, to support. Personally I too say that we should continue with mothertongue instruction in South Africa, particularly in the early stages of the child&#x2019;s schooling. Let us also advise the Bantu to use the mother tongue as the medium of instruction in the initial stages, but we must not dictate to them what they should do. We should leave the decision to them. The vast majority of the Xhosa people in the Transkei do not want Xhosa as the medium of instruction. They want to use one of our official languages as the medium of instruction. It is in that spirit that I put forward the suggestion that we should view this matter in a broad perspective and we should not try to force upon the Transkeian Territory what has become the traditional policy in South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will forgive me if I say that I could not make head or tail of his argument. I think his argument amounts to this that he does not want Xhosa to be introduced as the medium of instruction. If there are Xhosa who do not want to have their own language as medium they have simply been misled just as many Afrikaners were misled in the past. There was a time when it was considered etiquette to write letters in English only and when English was preached everywhere in our churches. People did not know any better and they were misled all the time as they still are in Natal to-day. A great number of the Afrikaans parents there are being misled. And that is precisely what the hon. member wants; he says we should only give them advice but that we should leave it to them to decide. I do not know how the hon. member can quote America as an example. What is the percentage of German-speaking people, for example, in America as against its own population?</p>

<p>Yes, take the Italians and the Dutch and the other races; what percentage do they constitute of the whole population? Here we practically have an equal number of Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking people and that is why we have two languages here. But where we have two languages we still say it is sound principle to use the mother tongue as medium. I again want to return to the Brussels conference. Mr. Chairman, the representatives to that conference were not picked indiscriminatorily; you had there the most outstanding educationists in the whole world and they unanimously decided that the only sound educational principle was that the child should be educated through the medium of his mother tongue.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the second half-hour? Firstly, I want to reply to what the hon. member for Vryheid (Mr. D. J. Potgieter) just said when he compares the question of the home-language medium, as adopted by the Brussels Conference, with which I must immediately say that I am not fully conversant, with the position as it has developed in South Africa. I am perfectly certain that the Brussels Conference could not have been considering the position of a tribal society with a vernacular which had not even, until recently, reached the stage of being a written tongue nor, I am sure, were they considering the position of a society <span class="col_6333_6334" refersTo="page_0499"/>which was rapidly attempting to adapt itself to modern industrial society and the needs of such a society. It is quite a different proposition to discuss the need to educate children through the mother tongue in a society where modern industrialism has already developed and where the people have developed along with it. But here we have a completely different situation. We have a tribal society with a vernacular completely unsuited to the needs of a modern society, and these people themselves are not striving to return to tribal society but quite the contrary; they are seeking as fast as possible to be absorbed in the industrial society where they know that they and their children will have the best economic opportunities. Sir, I may not know anything about the Brussels Conference but I do know something about the desires of African teachers because I have made it my business to attend conferences of African school teachers. I know that the almost unanimous opinion of the teachers, certainly in the urban areas, is that the vernacular should not be used over and above the first few standards, where they admit that it is easier to start off in the mother tongue of the child, but they want a progressive discarding of mother-tongue vernacular in the higher classes&#x2014;not, as is the policy of this Government, an ever-increasing use of the vernacular as the medium of instruction. The reason why those teachers want that, Sir, is very clear. They have stated over and over again that their own language is simply not capable of being adapted to the needs of a modern industrial society; that they do not have the necessary vocabulary and the necessary scientific background.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Were those not exactly the same arguments used against Afrikaans at one stage?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member is doing Afrikaans an injustice because Afrikaans is based on Western tongues. It is based on all the root tongues of the German, English and Dutch languages. These are European tongues of countries which themselves were being industrialized. Afrikaans was an adaptation of various tongues, and it was a developing language. You cannot compare Xhosa, which is a vernacular with no roots in Europe, with no roots in the industrial and developing civilizations, with a language like Afrikaans. Afrikaans had a very much broader field from which to choose for its evolution and for its new vocabulary. [Interjection.] Sir, I have answered the hon. member&#x2019;s question and I hope he will now keep quiet and allow me to get on with my speech. The vernacular is in a different position altogether, and therefore I disagree entirely with the argument of the hon. member for Vryheid.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the Bantu Education Department <i>per se.</i> I want to raise several matters with the hon. the Minister and first of all I want him please to explain to this Committee&#x2014;and I hope I will have a more courteous reply from him than I had from his colleague in a previous debate this afternoon&#x2014; why it is that his Department in two previous years according to the last available reports of the Auditor-General, has under-spent the amount voted to his Department by nearly R2,000,000. He might have seen an article referring to this interesting phenomenon where the Department under-spent the amounts voted to it by this great amount, a Department which has a need for expanding its services, not for contracting its services, an article written by an authority on the subject, Dr. Ellen Hillman. I want to know why this should have happened. Many of us in this House have repeatedly complained of the manifestly unfair position whereby the amount spent from general revenue on Bantu education has been frozen at R13,000,000. I want to say at once that I am very glad that this year a change has been made in that higher education has now been removed from that limit of R13,000,000, so we have a little more for primary and secondary education for African children, but of course, the basis remain R13,000,000 for primary and secondary education. It is a frozen amount, and I have pointed out and other members have pointed out over and over again that it is manifestly unfair to make the remaining amount come out of taxes paid by the poorest section of the community. This does not apply to any other colour group in South Africa. It does not apply to the White group or the Indian group or the Coloured group, although fears have been expressed in this regard since Coloured education has been taken over by the Department of Coloured Affairs. There is no such provision whereby the colour group concerned has to provide out of direct taxation the amount to be spent on education. I think it goes against all the principles of equitable budgeting that the poorest group should be responsible for any additional amount spent on education. What astonishes me is that despite this amount and despite the fact that anybody who knows anything about Bantu education knows about the overcrowding in the schools, knows about the numbers of children clamouring for admission into the schools and who cannot be admitted because of lack of accommodation, knows that teachers have to cope with 50 to 55 children in a class, that teachers have to repeat sessions for children, that books and writing materials are severely restricted and that in fact there is no provision for the free supply of books to children, other than language books. Yet the Department has underspent the amounts voted to it for the years 1960-1 and 1961-2 by R2,000,000. The amount underspent in 1961-2 was R968,751, and of that amount, according to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report, R160,000 was underspent on supplies and services. The Accounting officer tells us that the decrease was due to savings in respect of school requisites and the maintenance of schools and hostels. Why could this money not have been spent? The Minister could not have found it difficult to have found schools which <span class="col_6335_6336" refersTo="page_0500"/>are in a deteriorating condition and which are terribly inadequately supplied with the necessary school requisites on which he could have spent this amount of roughly R969,000. It is palpably absurd to say that there was any reason for such savings. Hardly a week goes by without the newspapers coming out with some story about these appallingly dilapidated structures in which children are having lessons&#x2014;children sitting on the floors, children using broken slates. I have three examples here which I have simply taken from a big file of cuttings which I have on this matter. Here is one quotation: &#x201C;School for many means a seat on the floor. Pupils being taught in unfurnished classrooms&#x201D;. As I say, hardly a week goes by without some article appearing in the newspapers showing that the schools are indeed very badly furnished with the necessary requisites.</p>

<p>The hon. member must not reveal his blank prejudices in such a way! Yet we have this report saying that zealous officials in the Minister&#x2019;s Department have managed to save R160,000 on supplies and services. They have managed to save R18,000 out of the miserably depleted school feeding fund; the whole amount allocated is R80,000 and out of that miserable amount for school feeding they have managed to save R18,000 and the explanation given is that school boards have elected to give up school feeding in the interest of education. Of course, why they should ever have had to choose between supplying education and supplying a meal for children who are grossly malnourished, is quite beyond me. No doubt this is another way of reducing racial friction; simply let the school boards decide whether they would rather feed the children or supply more educational facilities. But even so this R18,000 was saved. Could the Minister not have said to one of these schools, &#x201C;I have an additional amount, out of the R80,000 allocated for school feeding; you need not make the choice; your school is situated in a particularly poor area; here is R18,000, which otherwise would go back to general revenue; you may have this for school feeding&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister told a meeting in Bloemfontein in October last year that there was now 3,000 Bantu school teachers who did not receive a subsidy from the State and who were paid for by the Bantu themselves. Here again, why should the poorest section of the community have to pay for its own teachers? Why has this amount of nearly R2,000,000, according to the recent reports of the Auditor-General, been surrendered to general revenue. Why could the Minister not have spent that on salaries for Bantu teachers instead of making the Bantu communities pay for their teachers? School boards were asked to provide bursaries for indigent students out of the funds that they collect from parents, and yet out of R40,000 that was set aside for the provision of bursaries, half has not been spent; half is going back to general revenue. Why could the Minister not have found indigent students to whom he could have paid out money for bursaries? Because I can assure the Minister that there is no shortage of indigent Bantu children desperately wanting bursaries to enable them to continue with their studies. In fact there was an article in the <i>Star</i> of 11 January of this year which tells the story of a huge pile of applications for bursaries from hundreds of African children, received by a private bursary fund. The Isaacson Memorial Bursary Fund, sits there with its committee sifting out hundreds upon hundreds of applications from African children for bursaries, but the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is unable to find children to whom it can give bursaries out of this amount of R40,000. Only R20,000 have been spent. The same thing applies to this question of school books. I asked the hon. the Minister whether there were any funds for the provision of books, which after all are a vital necessity for children attending school and he told me that he was now giving instruction that indigent children could apply for books. I do not need to point out that White children, of course, are in fact supplied with books free of charge. The African children only get a free issue of books as far as language text books are concerned. Again may I suggest to the hon. the Minister that instead of turning this money back to general revenue, he should instruct his Department to make available more books to children free of charge. I want to point out that of the total amount of R21,000,000 which is spent on Black education, as against R97,000,000 which is spent on White children, it is absolutely absurd that nearly R1,000,000 last year, and R1,000,000 the year before should have been surrendered to the general revenue account.</p>

<p>Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he thinks it is equitable that while expenditure per White child has risen from R99.84 per annum in 1950 to an estimated R163 per child per annum in 1959, the expenditure per African school child has steadily been going down. I want to point out that when Bantu Education was introduced in 1954, the expenditure per Bantu child was R17 per annum. According to an answer given to me by the Minister on 5 March this year in relation to expenditure last year, I note that the expenditure per child dropped to R12.03 per child. I might say that this figure would have been even less had the 120,000 children who are going to church and private schools been included in the Minister&#x2019;s Estimate. I want to ask the Minister whether the Government has <span class="col_6337_6338" refersTo="page_0501"/>discovered some miraculous way whereby education can be improved or whereby the quality is not reduced while the amount of expenditure per child is reduced? Will the hon. the Minister tell us the secret of his success in this regard. If in fact he has discovered a secret, why then is this secret not passed on to the Department which deals with the education of other races? As far as I am concerned there can be no such secret. The real answer, of course, is that the quality of education given to the Bantu children, despite the flowing tributes paid by the hon. member there earlier this afternoon, is unfortunately deteriorating and not improving. There is a tendency in this House for people constantly to say that because South Africa spends more per head on education for African children than any other African Territory, that is in itself testimony that this must be the very best education that is provided for African children. So I could use the same standards; presumably, the fact that only R12.3 is spent per child this education must be a good deal inferior to the education which was given to a child when R17 was spent in 1954. But I do not agree with the argument that South Africa is doing so very well because, as I have pointed out over and over again, you must relate expenditure to income. It is just as silly, I believe, to compare the amount spent by Kenya for example which has a national income of R64,000,000 per annum as compared with South Africa which has a national income of R665,000,000 per annum as it would be to compare the expenditure on entertainments for example by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) with somebody whose income is 100 times less than his. So this is a meaningless comparison. By real international standards South Africa should be spending 5 per cent of her national income on the education of her children. Actually we are spending 3 per cent on the education of our children and on the education of African children we are spending less than one-third of 1 per cent of our national income. These are the international standards by which I think we should judge what we are doing.</p>

<p>What should be concerning the hon. Minister is not so much how to increase and expand the vernacular education, of how to reduce the amount spent <i>per capita</i> on Bantu children, how to save money on his Bantu Education Vote, how to turn back hundreds and thousands of rand which this Vote has voted him on what I believe to be a hopelessly inadequate budget, but the fact that 1,500,000 African children are not attending school at all. 1,600,000 are attending school. Is that right? The hon. Minister looks surprised. [Interjection.] All right I stand corrected for 100,000. But a little less than half the number who should be attending school, are not attending school. I hope the hon. Minister understands me correctly: I am not referring to the pre-school age children but those who should be attending school; in other words, children of school-going age. The vast majority of African school children leave school after Std. IL I think the hon. the Minister gets my point now. My contention is that those children should not be leaving school but that they should continue to a higher standard of education. Not only to the benefit, may I point out, of those children themselves but to the benefit of the whole community because an educated community is a valuable community; it is valuable to everybody, White and non-White. An uneducated community is not a valuable community. It is therefore in the interests of everybody that we extend the years at school in the case of Bantu school-children. I want to point out to the hon. the Minister that only about 70 per cent of the Bantu children get as far as Std. II; about 25 per cent of all the children at school are in Std. III and only 4 per cent finish Std. IV; 1 per cent reach matriculation standard. I am not going to go into the question of the number of failures. The number of failures in matriculation has decreased but nevertheless only 362 out of 911 who wrote matric passed. It is better than the 1960 figures where only 182 passed out of 957; it is better than the 1961 figure where 212 passed out of 839. The figure is still bad however, in that nearly two-thirds failed. As far as the other standards are concerned I am afraid the percentage of failures is also very high. I have the figures here. Of the 9,679 pupils who sat for J.C. only 5,224 passed. That is just over 50 per cent. Very few schools can say that they have had really good results. A high percentage did pass in Std. VI but it is not nearly as high as it should be; most of them passed in the second and third grade. I believe that the lower educational standard which shows itself in the high percentage of failures, especially in matriculation, must largely be attributed to the fact that the teaching is of a low standard. The teaching is of a low standard because the teachers are badly trained. The vast majority of teachers simply have Std. VI plus a lower primary teachers&#x2019; course of two years. I think the Minister has said that he intends doing away with this.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased to hear that but up to last year that was the position. The vast majority of teachers who are still teaching only have that qualification so it will take several years to derive any benefit from the new policy which is being pursued, namely to raise the standard of the teachers. Unfortunately, of the 28,000 teachers in the employ of the Department of Bantu Education, 15,000 only have the lower primary qualification so it will be some considerable time before the advantages of the new policy will be felt. 9,500 teachers out of 28,000 have the Std. VIII qualification and only 900 have matriculation and less than 900 have degrees. These figures, I am afraid, reflect a low standard of qualification amongst the teachers. Of the 3,964 teachers who are undergoing training at the present moment only 109 are taking post <span class="col_6339_6340" refersTo="page_0502"/>matriculation courses and only 27 are taking post-graduate courses. These are the Minister&#x2019;s own figures. So I say there is no question about it but that the whole standard of teaching should be raised before we can raise the standard of education amongst the children. I sincerely hope the Minister will make bursaries available to teachers so that they can take post-graduate courses and that we will not be scanning the Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report next year, or the one which we will shortly be scanning this year, only to find that the Minister has been able to save nearly R1,000,000 on the Vote which this House granted him for his Department. The hon. the Minister should spend every last penny of the money voted to him because enough money is not being voted if we wish to train and educate our Bantu population which, after all, is the source of our labour requirements and constitutes the greater percentage of our population. It is no good bluffing ourselves that we shall be able to do without Black workers in future. We all know that we are not going to do without them. Whether they are called migrant labourers or stabilized workers they are still going to be here and we want them to have the highest education possible. I am now talking from a purely economic point of view. Producing a semi-literate people with only superficial knowledge is not going to help us in South Africa to develop at the rate at which this country should be developed economically.</p>

<p>I want to point out that according to the Natural Resources Development Council it is estimated that in the year 2000 we shall have a population of 36,000,000 people of which 26,000,000, or 72 per cent, will be Africans and 5,000,000 will be White. The rest will be Coloured and Indian. In other words, of every seven South Africans one will be White, one will be Brown and five will be Black. So that we are going to be more than ever dependent on Black hands to see that this country develops economically if our standards of living are kept at a rising standard, which is what every single person in this House wants to see despite the ideological and philosophical adoption of policy. There will certainly never be enough Whites to do these jobs. As we know there is practically full employment amongst the Whites to-day. I believe the Minister&#x2019;s policy requires radical changes if the lack of trained men in this country is not to retard our growth. It is absurd for us to go ahead with this concept that there should be no &#x201C;place for the Native in the European community above the level of certain forms of labour&#x201D; to quote a former Minister of Bantu Administration. That does not make sense in the face of what South Africa is going to require in the way of trained workers in future. We have vast schemes such as the Orange River scheme, Iscor, Sasol, let alone all the private schemes which are all going to require a greater integration of semi-skilled and skilled labour. We have not got the White hands to perform this labour. I can quote the statement made by Mr. Rousseau, the chairman and managing director of Sasol, in which he said that South Africa was in the throes of a labour crisis and that it was urgently necessary to train Bantu and other non-Whites to do more advanced work than they were doing now. He said that South Africa had a relatively small effective population. Unless you have a properly educated population you cannot train people to be semi-skilled and skilled technical workers. I believe that this semi-literate, illiterate Bantu population, trained through the medium of the vernacular, is grossly ill equipped to be trained to do any sort of technically skilled work. If South Africa wishes to develop at any decent sort of rate in any way which will measure up to our vast natural resources, we have to change our educational policy radically. I think changes are needed. Vernacular training should not be extended into the senior classes. On the contrary, the use of the two official languages, which are the languages of modern industrial South Africa, which is what Bantu teachers wish and which Bantu parents wish, is what should be the policy of the hon. the Minister. In other words, a decrease in the vernacular education and not an increase. Secondly, schools in urban areas should be encouraged and not discouraged. I want to ask the Minister what the idea is of proposing that the greater percentage of secondary schools should in future be located in rural areas. This is obviously absurd in view of the fact that industrial development in South Africa, despite border industries, will continue in the industrial complexes of South Africa simply because of the economic factors which always have and always will determine the location of industry in this country. It is absurd therefore to locate secondary schools in the rural areas. All these new restrictions on children returning to the urban areas after they have been to school in rural areas are going to militate against those children going on to secondary schools. They will be frightened to give up their stake in the urban areas by leaving those areas to attend rural schools because after a certain time they will not be allowed to come back. They are therefore not going to take advantage of the offer of secondary education in the rural areas. I do hope the hon. the Minister is not going to make this a basic principle of policy in regard to the establishment of secondary schools.</p>

<p>Finally. I want to emphasize again that better trained teachers have to be provided. I want to congratulate the Minister on the fact that he has already started on this particular pattern. I believe that is an improvement. But I want to point out to him that if he wants better trained teachers he must pay them better. The salaries of African teachers are appallingly low. Not only is it appallingly low in the case of those teachers who have Std. VI plus two years training but teachers in the higher grade are also very badly paid indeed compared with the teachers in the other racial groups who are not sufficiently paid either. So that shows you how underpaid I regard Bantu teachers to be. Again, the hon. Minister must <span class="col_6341_6342" refersTo="page_0503"/>not hand back any money to general revenue please. Let him rather spend that money on paying better salaries to those teachers who urgently require better salaries. Far more teachers are required; not only a better quality but far more teachers. It is absurd to have two sessions; it is a tremendous strain on teachers as anybody who has done any teaching will be ready to admit in this House. It is absurd to expect the teacher to take two sessions per day where classes range from 50 to 55 pupils. In that case it becomes practically an impossibility. No teacher can work efficiently in those circumstances. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>As I do not have the privilege of the half-hour I shall leave it to the hon. the Minister to reply to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) in regard to the amounts being spent and the numbers trained. I want to discuss the question of the language medium briefly. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) very pertinently put the question, by way of an interjection, whether all the arguments used by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) and the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) against the use of Bantu languages as the media of instruction at schools, were not the same arguments that were used formerly against Afrikaans. [Interjections.] Exactly the same arguments were used at the time. Afrikaans was then not sufficiently developed, they said; it was hardly a written language; it was a kitchen language, and for that reason it could not be used as the media of instruction! To-day they are singing a different tune. The reply of the hon. member for Houghton was that Afrikaans is derived from the Western languages, and that therefore it could be developed and used. Now I should like to ask her: What about Hebrew. Hebrew is not a Western language. Hebrew is one of the oldest and most ancient languages, but it is used in Israel as the medium of instruction at schools and in universities. It has no modern vocabulary. Words have to be coined. Their concepts are of things that existed before the time of Christ. They do not know what television is; they do not know what a radio or a telegram is; they had to coin words. But Hebrew is used because it is the mother tongue. I think that is a conclusive reply to the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>I should like to revert to the question raised by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), namely that the University College of Fort Hare is a tribal college, and is so backward. I should like to point out to him that, in the first place&#x2014;I am doing so as a member of the Council of that university college&#x2014;Fort Hare has never in all its history had a teaching staff such as it has at the present time. Never in its history has it had anything approaching what it has to-day as far as its numbers and its standard are concerned. I should like to point out to him that the examinations of Fort Hare are to-day conducted by the University of South Africa.</p>

<p>That ensures that the standards at that university college to-day equal those of any White university in this country. Fort Hare to-day has many more faculties than it had before its transfer. I should like to read from the Year Book of the University College for 1963 [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The University College is still offering all the courses offered before the take-over by the new regime. In addition a Department of Commerce has been established so that students can now enrol for the B.Com. degree. The Department of Law has been extended and students can now qualify for the LL.B. degree. In 1962 the Departments of Greek and Sociology also came into being, and the first students have enrolled for the B.Sc. degree, Pharmacy.</block>

<p>These are faculties which that university college never had before. When the hon. member for Kensington alleges that Fort Hare prior to its transfer to this Department was on the threshold of becoming an autonomous university, he is making a very big mistake. I can assure him that this hon. House would never have permitted Fort Hare, in the condition in which it was, to become an independent university. However, at the present time Fort Hare is moving rapidly towards becoming an independent university. The hon. member need only go to Fort Hare to see not only the new faculties which have been established, but the extra buildings that have been erected there, the bigger and better teaching staff, etc. The hon. member for Kensington should note what we inherited at Fort Hare. The other university colleges had the good fortune to be able to start from the beginning. We however inherited a lot of spoilt material, material we had to thin out and which we had to redirect into the right channels. The hon. member for Kensington referred almost with melancholy to Masombo who had committed sabotage. He was one of the lecturers; that was one of the things we inherited. Masombo always had those inclinations but he did not have the courage of Professor Matthews to admit it and to say that he would continue to belong to the A.N.C. He remained there as a lecturer and what did he do? For a long time we suspected that he was one of the inciters until the police, in an extremely smart piece of work, caught him in the act of sabotage committed by him. Now the hon. member for Kensington comes along and he is almost a defender of Masombo who committed that crime. That was one of the things we inherited; that was one of the things we had to contend with at Fort Hare. We had to tear ourselves away from the past of theirs. Today Fort Hare has a future such as it has never had before.</p>

<p>I should like to mention one example to show what happened at the University College of Fort Hare. As I am particularly interested in the teaching of Greek, I checked on the records. Under the old regime one student out of eight passed in Greek. Under the new professor we have there and under the new regime seven out of seven students passed. I think one passed in the first class. Greek is one of the most difficult courses you can take at a university. That shows the standard that has been achieved there. What a future there is for that university and what a future there is for the young Bantu men and women who go to that university to be trained for service to their own people.</p>

<p>I think I should now reply to the questions which have been put, because as you know Mr. Chairman, there is an old adage to the effect that a fool can put more questions in one minute than a clever man can reply to in an hour. When clever people like the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) and the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) and the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) have put to me the numerous questions they have already put, and I am not even a clever man at that, it is going to take me still longer to reply if I have to wait for more clever people opposite to put still more clever questions. That is why I think I should first reply to some of the questions. I want to begin with the hon. member for Houghton, because I think I can very briefly dispose of the questions she asked, because the answers in all cases are clearly self-evident. She has made a basic error in her arguments as to the amounts of money that have been voted by Parliament for the Bantu Education Account, and which were not spent in the relevant years, by assuming that those sums of money are paid back into the Consolidated Revenue Account, and are therefore lost. That money is not lost to Bantu Education; it remains standing to the credit of the Bantu Education Account and is available in the following financial years. In that respect the position is otherwise than in the case of other Departments of State. That is why the Bantu Education Account is a separate account, because unspent amounts are not forfeited, but remain credited to the Bantu Education Account and thus are available for the succeeding years.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The fact remains that it remains available to the Bantu Education Account and it is available for expenditure in the next year. For that reason hon. members will see that in the Estimates for Bantu Education, it is indicated regularly what the balance carried forward from the previous year is. I hope the hon. member is following me. The balance carried forward is indicated and accordingly it is available together with the R13,000,000 plus the taxes collected during the year. That then constitutes the revenue from which the expenditure must be met. The reason for the saving is not attributable to the fact that officials of the Department are zealously trying to economize here and there, but there are problems connected with a great Department such as Bantu Education. Hon. members must remember that as regards education and the administration of education, the Department of Bantu Education is bigger than the White education departments of the four provinces together, as regards the number of schools, etc. There are many problems to be dealt with. For instance, there is the question of the provision of supplies to schools. That is an item on which there has been a saving. I have to budget for what we expect the schools will requisition, but it is a matter of requisitions by the school boards. Frequently those requisitions reach head office too late to make the payments in that particular year, and in consequence there is a saving on the Vote. It is not a saving because we want to spend less, but it is a saving because the payment could not be effected during that particular year.</p>

<from><span class="col_6345_6346" refersTo="page_0505"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>For that reason we have specially appointed a number of administrative organizers to help the school boards with the work of filling in the forms and drafting the requisitions.</p>

<p>We do everything in our power to assist them, but sometimes it takes a long time; it sometimes also happens in respect of the payment of teachers; a new teacher is appointed, but because the people are not quite versed in the procedure they have to follow, it may take quite a few months before the requisite forms reach head office and the payments can be made. So it is not a matter of wilful saving, of stinginess, but of administrative problems. The saving on school feeding is there also because provision is made in accordance with what it was in the previous year. There is the policy adopted years ago, and I am not prepared to dispense with that at this stage, that the schools which have had school feeding, may retain the amounts they received for school feeding, unless they themselves prefer to obtain additional teaching staff or to utilize the money for additional classrooms that have to be built. The saving under school feeding simply means that a number of the schools which had school feeding in the past, decided in the course of the year to abandon school feeding in order rather to obtain teachers and classrooms. I maintain, and I believe it is a sound policy, that when regard is had to the tremendous back-log in regard to Bantu education, and the problems in respect of feeding the Bantu, it is not the task of a Department of Education to look after the feeding of the population. If something has to be done in connection with feeding, and I think it is necessary, then it is the task of another Department, namely the Department of Health. And the Department of Health is doing it. They are conducting experimental schemes throughout the whole country to see what is the best method to provide in a proper manner and in the cheapest and most economical manner, a food that could prevent disease among the Bantu children in particular. I think that is a task for the Department of Health and for Bantu Administration when there is starvation and distress in an area. I do not think I can provide some children of the Bantu with education and food, while I do not have sufficient money to provide them all with education.</p>

<p>The next saving the hon. member has referred to is in regard to bursaries. She asked why there should be a saving on bursaries now while there is such a shortage of trained teachers. Actually there is no shortage in the number of candidates offering themselves for training in the pre-matriculation course, the higher primary education diploma and formerly also the lower primary education diploma. The number of candidates offering themselves for training in those courses is far greater than the number we are able to accommodate, and for which we can make provision in the schools. This particular item referred to by the hon. member relates to bursaries for that group of teachers, and it was specially provided because there is one Bantu national group where an insufficient number of pupils have offered themselves for this course, namely the Venda group. This money has been made available specially to encourage the young Venda children to take a teacher&#x2019;s training course.</p>

<p>Can it not be transferred to one of the other groups?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>In the other groups there are quite enough pupils offering themselves for the courses. We know the Venda group is one of the poorest Bantu national units in the country, and this money is being kept there specially to attract them to the training schools, and if it is not utilized in any one year, it is not lost. It remains in the Bantu Education Account, and it is available the next year. While referring to this, I should like to point out that the hon. member has referred to the shortage of teachers with post-primary training, post-matriculation training. It is true we could have more of them, but bursaries are being made available for the training courses at university colleges where post-matriculation training is taught, and the number of bursaries made available for that is taken up fully. So there have been no savings in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked what magic formula we have discovered to improve education while the expenditure <i>per capita</i> is reduced, and she said we must please convey the formula to the other education departments, if it is a magic formula that is not prejudicial to the education of the children. If the hon. member were to analyse the figures of attendance at schools, she will see that in recent years, since Bantu education was transferred to the State, the emphasis has been laid on the point on which in my view the emphasis ought to be laid, namely on the eradication of illiteracy among the masses of the non-Whites, and when a small group of Bantu pupils are brought to schools in which quite a large percentage go on to the higher classes where the number of children per teacher is less than in the lower classes, the unit cost from the nature of things is higher than it will be when you get a vast mass in the lower primary schools where one teacher can indeed handle a large number and where the pyramid therefore tapers steeply upwards. That is the reason for the reduction <i>per capita.</i> It is not a case of us effecting savings here and there or having special formulae, but it is because the number of children in the lower primary schools has increased tremendously in recent years, and the number of children per teacher in the lower classes is greater than the number of children per teacher in the higher standards, and the teachers in the lower standards receive less remuneration because they have not had such advanced training. Thus the increase of teachers is found in the lower standards and the largest increase of children is found there <span class="col_6347_6348" refersTo="page_0506"/>also, and in consequence the unit cost is so much less. Of course this does not mean that the education of the Bantu in the higher primary and post-primary schools has deteriorated. On the contrary, the numbers in the higher primary and the lower primary schools have increased considerably in recent times, but the increase in the bottom layer, Sub-A up to Std. II&#x2014;was proportionately greater than in the post-primary schools. I think it is a good thing that this is so, because in the higher primary and the post-primary schools we must begin to train people to perform specific tasks in their communities, but the task of the lower primary school is to bring literacy to the masses. That is why I think Bantu Education has in the past seven or eight years performed an enormous task in the Republic as regards the eradication of illiteracy. I recently saw a Report of UNESCO in which reference is made to the progress in one of the South American States, and in that report they say that the number of children who attended school in 1950 in that State, was approximately 35 per cent of the total number of children in the State. That particular country had made a special attempt and the 35 per cent of the children who in other words received some form of literacy, was pushed up to the splendid figure of 55 per cent in 1961, and they laud it as a wonderful achievement of that South American State. But what have we done in the Republic of South Africa? According to our estimate in 1954, when we took over Bantu education, approximately 45 per cent to 50 per cent of the Bantu children attended school for a longer or shorter period, but we have raised that until last year, according to our calculations, at least 75 per cent of the Bantu children attended school for a longer or shorter period, an achievement that has not been matched anywhere in the world. That is one of the reasons why the unit cost dropped, because we have so greatly extended the base of the pyramid. So it is not a magic formula but only a sound policy that has achieved this.</p>

<p>The hon. member as well as the hon. member for Hillbrow referred to the poor results. The hon. member for Houghton said that the poor results must be attributed to poorly trained teachers. I agree with that to some extent. The better trained the teacher is, the better will be the results of the schools. No system of education can be better than its teachers are. But here we had to cope with a peculiar problem, namely the tremendous thirst for literacy among the Bantu. We had to provide schools for them, and we had to obtain male and female teachers for the schools. We did not have teachers of the calibre we would have preferred, and rather than give them nothing we gave them the male and female teachers with the lower primary education certificate, namely Std. VI plus an extra two years teacher&#x2019;s training. However, we have now reached the stage where a sufficient number are passing the junior certificate so that we can now abolish the lower primary course, the emergency measure we had to adopt. We can now begin to provide better qualified teachers. We shall adopt other means too in this regard, and one is as a result of the report on the teaching of languages, from which the fact emerged that the Bantu, as all of us know indeed, experiences difficulty in expressing Afrikaans and English properly, and even the pronunciation of the teachers of both the languages leaves very much to be desired, particularly that of those who do not possess very high qualifications. I think the time has now arrived in view of the extension of the F.M. Radio services throughout the country, that we should now make available a special schools programme on the radio. I have already given instructions that surveys should be made, and that radios should be provided to the higher primary and the post-primary schools, and that an educational programme should be given to the schools by means of radio broadcasts. I think that will help a tremendous lot for instance to encourage correct pronunciation and grammar. Thus we shall utilize other means to improve the quality of the education.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow also referred to the examination results and said that he finds almost incomprehensible these figures mentioned in the report and he quoted a number of figures. He says he finds it almost incomprehensible that the results of the junior certificate examination compare so exceptionally favourably&#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; whereas in the matric examination it compares less favourably. You know it is difficult to compare figures, as regards examination results. The hon. member will know that examiners and moderators have a method of drawing graphs according to their work. But I can assure the hon. member that I ensure that the standard of the examinations conducted by my Department, compare favourably with the standard of the examinations in the other White education departments. I achieve that by appointing examiners and moderators for the examinations from the Provincial Education Departments, and not only from the Department of Bantu Education.</p>

<p>Do they not write the same examination for the Junior Certificate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>No, the Junior Certificate is our own examination, it is the Bantu Education Junior Certificate Examination, but the examination paper is drafted and moderated by examiners and moderators drawn from the other education departments also. I think the hon. member will agree, and this report in fact confirms this, that as regards the syllabuses there are no deficiencies as regards the Bantu Education syllabuses. Indeed, it has been said that the syllabuses compare more than favourably with the other syllabuses in the Republic. So I cannot say why there should be the particularly <span class="col_6349_6350" refersTo="page_0507"/>favourable comparison. All I can think is that in the Junior Certificate more emphasis may be laid upon grammar and reproduction purely, whereas in the matriculation examination there is more independent study, more study of literature and that kind of thing that may be somewhat beyond the people speaking other languages. I think Afrikaans-speaking people also have a fairly difficult time with English A when they reach matric. If you are dealing only with grammar etc., there is progress, because then you can still learn things by memorizing them, but when it comes to the matric examination, and the pupil has to know more than only the grammar, and when more than mere reproduction must be done, it seems to be beyond most of those who do not use that language at home. But as regards standards, I say that the syllabuses compare well with each other. We have proof of that. The examination papers and the allocation of points at the examinations are correlated inasmuch as we draw examiners and moderators from the other departments of education to ensure that the standard does not fall below that of the others.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question. Why is the standard of English according to the report so low throughout, whereas the examination results as regards the Junior Certificate A are extremely high and good. That is a thing I cannot understand.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that the majority of the candidates sitting for the examinations are selected by the schools; the principals hold back the candidates who they think cannot pass. They do not permit them to sit for examinations unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Before I come to two important matters that have been raised, namely the question of mother-tongue education and the matter of the transfer of education to the Transkei, and how it will work, I should like to deal with some of the general matters raised by the hon. member for Kensington on Friday. He made a great fuss about the tremendously long delay there was in Tabling the Report of the Commission of Inquiry in regard to the Teaching of the Official Languages etc. in the Transkei. The hon. member rightly said that the Commission reported to me in October, 1962. That report was drafted and signed in English by the Commission and in accordance with the practice in the Public Service, my Department itself was responsible for the translation of the report, and thereafter the translated version was submitted to the Translation Bureau, because they check the translations. Now you must understand that for the translation I had to employ the services of my professional officers, but October, November and December are the busiest months really for these people because then it is examination time. Consequently they could not attend to this extra work before as late as January, and the translated report was completed in February; then it was checked and thereafter we had to wait on the Government Printer who had a tremendous quantity of work in connection with parliamentary business. There was no wilful delay on our part. I did everything in my power to have the report Tabled as soon as possible. But now the hon. member has charged me with having made unauthorized use of the report. I do not know on what he bases that. It was not a report to Parliament; it was not a commission appointed by Parliament. It was a commission appointed by me at the request of the Transkeian Territorial Authority. That also provides the answer to the other question of the hon. member, namely why, while I knew at that stage when I appointed the commission, that education in the Transkei would at some time or another be transferred to the Transkeian Government, I still appointed a commission of inquiry to investigate their educational position? The answer is that they requested me to do so. Indeed, the members of the commission were not appointed by me on my own. I consulted the Chairman of the Transkeian Territorial Authority and asked him: &#x201C;You submit to me the names of people in whom your people will have confidence,&#x201D; and he submitted to me the names of the Bantu members of this commission. I originally never thought of some of the members, but when he submitted the names to us, my Department and I immediately appointed the people. I for my part appointed only the two White assessors, and they were not, as the hon. member said, officers of my Department. One of them is an officer of the Department of Education of the Natal Province who was kindly seconded to us by the Provincial Administration of Natal for this specific purpose. Now the hon. member has asked me what the value of this report is in view of the fact that the Transkei will shortly have self-government and then will itself control education? Of what value is the report to me, if they are going to apply a wholly different policy? The value is this that the findings of this commission in respect of the Transkeian schools apply to a very large extent to all the Bantu schools in the Republic, and it is a good random test of what has happened in our schools in respect of Bantu education, and the report contains valuable information and suggestions which will be investigated further by my Department. Various recommendations have already been adopted, and I propose to refer a number of the other recommendations to the Bantu Education Advisory Council which I am now constituting to see to what extent we can apply it throughout the Republic in order to effect the necessary improvements that may flow from it in all Bantu schools. This report has its value to Bantu education in general, but for the Transkei it of course also has its value because I believe and anticipate that the Transkeian Government, once they have been constituted, certainly will take notice of this report by people enjoying their confidence and who were appointed to that commission at their request.</p>

<p><span class="col_6351_6352" refersTo="page_0508"/>Then the hon. member asked me what the position is going to be in regard to education in the Transkei once the Transkei gets self-government. What will be the division then? Will I still dictate to them how they should organize their education? My reply is that the education of the Bantu in the Transkei as a whole will fall under the control of the Transkeian Government and the Transkeian Minister of Education. That is why the syllabuses may differ from what we have here in the Republic. Then the Xhosa in the Republic&#x2019;s area will still fall under the syllabus for Bantu education applying in the Republic.</p>

<p>The hon. member has asked what an untenable position it will bring about, but the hon. member for Pretoria East (Dr. Otto) has replied adequately to him, and the hon. member knows also that the syllabuses of the Transvaal, the Free State and Natal also differ from one another. However, what is important is not whether there are differences in the syllabuses, and whether there are differences of policy here and there, but whether standards will be maintained, and that will be our great problem of the future, to try to help in maintaining standards in the Transkei, in spite of the fact that they will control their own education and will determine their own education policy. I hope the Bantu Education Advisory Council we are constituting will also contribute towards that. As I shall be using this Council as a valuable channel of consultation between the Bantu areas and the Government, I hope the Transkeian Government will find it possible to make use of the same Council or perhaps another one that could co-operate with this one, at least to ensure that the standards for Bantu education will be the same throughout the whole country. They will have to take into account that the products of their schools will have to secure admission to universities or university colleges, and therefore it is in their own interests to see to it that standards are not lowered. As long as that is so, I have no quarrel with what they do. They asked us for advice, and that our White officials who are presently concerned with Bantu education in the Transkei should be seconded to them in the transition period. We shall make those arrangements. We shall retain those officials on our establishment, but second them to the Transkei for as long as they are needed there, and they do still need them in many places, particularly in the secondary schools and the inspection of the work in the secondary schools, as well as in connection with the highest administrative positions. In the transition period they have asked for assistance, and we shall give them that assistance.</p>

<p>The hon. member has also asked what arrangements we have made to enable the Bantu to control his education himself. He said that in the course of time he has asked a number of questions which indicate that throughout the years my Department and I have reserved all the highest positions for White people only, and I did not enable the Bantu to take over. But the hon. member is completely wrong. He ought to know that it is Public Service practice that there are different salary structures for the various racial groups, and every time, every year, when the hon. member puts his question, he draws the notch on which he puts the question, just above the highest scale of the Bantu. Just compare how the figures he asks, the income group to which he refers, vary every year. At the outset he had it at a certain notch, but subsequently, as the salary scales changed, and more and more Bantu were introduced into the high position, he artificially raised his notch every time to just above the top of all the Bantu.</p>

<p>In the service of my Department, there are at the moment, professors earning a salary of R3,400 per annum. There are 49 sub-inspectors performing inspection work in the primary schools and who assist with the inspection in the secondary schools. In the Transkei alone there are eight of them. There are caretakers of schools, all of them posts we created in recent times. There are 162 caretakers, 29 of them in the Transkei. There are 470 school board secretaries, 45 of them being in the Transkei. There are 92 clerks in the regional offices and in the head office, 24 of them being in the Transkei. There are 12 superintendents of works. There are 23 university lecturers altogether, all Bantu. It can be seen how we have gradually permitted the Bantu to take over Bantu education. The total number of teachers in Bantu Education is 28,852, and 28,350 of them are Bantu, and only 480 are Whites. Then the hon. member insists we are not giving the Bantu an opportunity to prepare himself for his task. I think I have now said enough to indicate how we are preparing the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member has asked about Fort Hare, and he asked what the position will be once the Transkei gets self-government. But Fort Hare is not in the Transkei. It is in the Ciskei. It is not in the picture at all. Or did the hon. member not know this? Did he not go to Fort Hare with me one day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>In those days Fort Hare was not a tribal college. It now belongs to them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>But it is wholly inconceivable to give the Transkeian Government control over an institution that is outside its borders. What can be done, and we have already done so is to appoint representatives of the Transkeian Territorial Authority on the Advisory Council, people nominated by them. In other words, we bring about liaison between the controlling body of Fort Hare and the Transkei. The hon. member has also said, in regard to Fort Hare, it is quite wrong for anybody to state, as was stated in the pamphlet of Information, <span class="col_6353_6354" refersTo="page_0509"/>that the Bantu colleges are going to be independent. He said everybody knows that these colleges will never become independent, because they are under the control of the Government. Of course that is so at this stage, but that is precisely where the difference lies between the viewpoint of those hon. members and our viewpoint. It is the easiest thing in the world to establish a college, and to give it an independent Council, and then it is only a replica of a Western University, but then there will actually be a monstrosity that will never fit in there. I wonder whether the hon. member is aware of the illuminating address given by Sir Eric Ashby in December, 1961, during an international seminar on Inter-University Co-operation in West Africa. On that occasion he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are no West African universities yet. There are British and French universities in West Africa, but they are importations. They are no more indigenous than motor cars. They have minor modifications, of course, just as motor cars have sun hoods, but the West African university has still to be born. A hundred years ago a similar assertion could have been made about the universities in America. Indeed, it was made. This is what C. W. Elliot, who became president of Harvard, wrote nearly a century ago: &#x201C;A university in any worthy sense of the term must grow from seed. It cannot be transplanted from England or Germany in full leaf and bearing. It cannot be run up like a cotton mill in six months to meet a quick demand. When the American University appears, it will not be a copy of a foreign institution, but the slow and natural outgrowth of American social and political habits.</block>

<p>That was said of America 100 years ago, and Sir Eric Ashby says the same of the universities in West Africa, and we are determined not to make the same mistake here by establishing an institution here on Western lines and soon giving it independence in such a way that it does not have its roots in that area of the community it has to serve. It must grow like a seed in that area and it must be fertilized with the knowledge and the civilization of the West, of course, but it must first establish its roots in the traditions of that community before it can grow to independence. That is why it is our policy to grant autonomy to those colleges, but it is not something we shall do in too much of a hurry. It is not a thing that should become a danger to the Bantu in the future. It must be something that will be of service to the community when once they have attained their independence, and which should be within the community, the centre of their cultural life and of their social, economic and political life.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I was very surprised to hear the hon. the Minister quoting Sir Eric Ashby. Surely it is the same Sir Eric Ashby who made a violent attack on this Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to higher university education for the Bantu, and who objected to the open universities being closed. Is the Minister also prepared to accept that criticism of his, where he criticized the very same system which the Minister is trying to defend to-day?</p>

<p>In regard to the development of the Transkei, it is a fact that one-third of the Minister&#x2019;s whole Department will become redundant, because a third of the Bantu children are in the Transkei, and the Minister&#x2019;s reply on that point was very unsatisfactory. He did not tell us what would happen if the Transkeian Government demanded that a different language than the mother tongue should be used as the medium of instruction. He did not say what would happen to all the hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of school buildings which would be taken over by the new Government. He did not say what would happen if curricula were introduced which were inimical towards the Whites. His reply was completely unsatisfactory. I remember that he said two years ago that his Department would come to an end, and I see this as the first step in that direction.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with something else, and this year again I want to object to the Department of Bantu Education having become the dumping-ground for inferior literature printed by Nationalist Party Presses. You will remember, Sir, that last year I objected to the sale of copies of a certain pamphlet called <i>Bona,</i> which is disseminated gratis in the Bantu schools falling under the control of the Minister. The year before last no fewer than 241,800 such copies were distributed at a cost of R14,000, and I expressed the hope that this state of affairs would not continue, because <i>Bona</i> was not something which I regarded as desirable literature for Bantu schools. An Afrikaans edition of it would not be desirable literature for White schools either. But instead of the position improving, it has deteriorated, and last year even more copies were purchased, no fewer than 252,000, to be distributed gratis, at a cost of R16,321.</p>

<p>This pamphlet is printed by Bona Pers Beperk and it falls under the Dagbreek Trust. I have here a very nice photo of all the members of Dagbreek Trust, on which appear, <i>inter alia,</i> the Prime Minister, Mr. J. H. Steyl, M.P.C., Minister Albert Hertzog, Minister Schoeman, Mr. F. Odendaal and Minister Jan de Klerk. They are the power behind <i>Bona</i> which is now being offloaded on to the Department of Bantu Education as a gift, to raise the circulation of this pamphlet so that it can attract more advertisements in order to make it possible for the directors of Dagbreek to boast of the fact that Bona Pers is doing so well.</p>

<p>But that is not all. Since referring to the matter last year, another new pamphlet has appeared, and whereas in the past 250,000 copies of <i>Bona</i> were distributed, 750,000 <span class="col_6355_6356" refersTo="page_0510"/>copies of this new pamphlet are being distributed gratis in the Bantu schools. It is called <i>Wamba.</i> It is also published by a subsidiary company. Its name is Via Afrika-boekhandel, but at the back of it says that Via Afrika-boekhandel is a branch of Nasionale Boekhandel Beperk, 42, Keerom Street, Cape Town. Here we have Keerom Street&#x2019;s contribution to the Department of Bantu Education, and 750,000 copies are distributed at a cost of R37,000. And the Government is not even given a discount. It costs 5c in the retail trade, and the Minister pays 5c per copy, whereas he pays at least 6&#x00BD;c per copy for <i>Bona,</i> which costs 7&#x00BD;c in the retail trade. The Nasionale Pers has made a much better bargain than <i>Bona,</i> I think this is a very unsound state of affairs. Here we have a pamphlet with a circulation of 62,000. In other words, if the Government had not agreed to buy this publication there would never have been a <i>Wamba,</i> or it would have gone under. This is a direct subsidy from State funds paid by the Government to the Nationalist Party printing works, and a stop should be put to it. I should like to know what arrangements were arrived at before <i>Wamba</i> was distributed to the Bantu children. Who asked for it? If the Cape Times were prepared to print a monthly periodical for Bantu children, would the Minister agree to buy 30,000 copies of it? It is a scandal. With a circulation of 62,000 this pamphlet can now attract more advertisements, thereby swelling the profits of the Nasionale Pers.</p>

<p>The Minister may perhaps ask us whether a periodical for the Bantu children is not necessary, but I say that something may be done in that regard, but then full opportunity must be given to all persons issuing pamphlets of this nature, and there should not be negotiations with the Nasionale Pers alone, nor should it be necessary to pay the full price for it. When the hon. the Minister buys books he gets a discount, but here the Nasionale Pers gets the full amount. I hope that a stop will be put to this, and that if I raise the matter again next year we will not find that a third and a fourth pamphlet, also printed by the Nationalist Party printers, is being distributed amongst the Bantu. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I just want to refer to one other matter, and that is the way in which books and periodicals are purchased for the Department of Bantu Education, or rather by the schools through the medium of the Department. Such strict rules are laid down to-day as to what books and periodicals may be bought for the Bantu schools that it practically amounts to brainwashing these Bantu children. A special list of approved books is drawn up by the Department, and only those books may be bought, and only those books receive the 50 per cent subsidy from the Department, and it is a very restricted list. Then it is said, further, that the schools may in fact purchase other books, but they must first be approved by the Department, and those books receive no subsidy. To make it even more difficult, it is laid down that there should be an equal number of books in English, Afrikaans and the Bantu language. Again I see in this an attempt to benefit certain Nationalist Party printing companies when it is laid down that one-third of the books practically has to be supplied by those companies. That is an unhealthy state of affairs and I hope that a stop will be put to it.</p>

<p>The number varies according to the number of schools, and the basis was laid down at that time that so many copies were to be distributed per school, and there has never been any deviation from that basis. The only ones which were distributed additionally was at the time when <i>Bona</i> appeared, and thereafter still another one was published, <i>Utlwang,</i> the only publication in Tswana. One cannot buy just any periodical for the schools, <span class="col_6357_6358" refersTo="page_0511"/>and one must provide literature. There must be literature over and above the ordinary textbooks, and these pamphlets are available, and if these people have the initiative to publish books of a reasonable quality, it is only fair to take them. That is why <i>Utlwang</i> and <i>Bona</i> and <i>Wamba</i> are being purchased. The hon. member says <i>Wamba</i> would not have been published if it were not for the fact that my Department negotiated with that company beforehand and made promises to them. That was his insinuation. But when the provincial administrations at the time subscribed to these pamphlets, they were under United Party r&#x00E8;gime. Apart from that, even though that was the case, I say again that even though we subscribed to those publications anew I would still have done so if they provided reasonable literature for which a need exists. But do hon. members know what the other printing companies in this country do? They do not issue newspapers or periodicals in the Bantu languages. They must all be in English, because they want to make all the Bantu Black Englishmen. Because it is absolutely essential to provide other literature as well, apart from the ordinary textbooks, we must buy these periodicals. White schools also do so. There is a lack of suitable literature in the Bantu languages for these children, particularly in the lower classes, and one must make use of every possible aid. I wish to conclude by saying that I think the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude deserves the greatest contempt, and on this subject I will never again reply to any further questions put by that hon. member.</p>

<p>The disclosures made by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) make my remarks about the precarious state in which the Bantu Education Account is even more relevant. The hon. the Minister certainly got very hot under the collar but he gave few facts and very little information in reply to the statements made from this side of the House. In other words, he brought forth a considerable amount of heat but he shed no light on the complaint put forward by the hon. member for Orange Grove. Sir, I will leave that matter there and allow the Minister to calm down and to give us the facts instead of merely stirring up heat.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That was not the gist of the complaint of the hon. member. His complaint was a very different one. He quoted who the printers were and he dealt with the matter on an objective level which calls for facts and a definite reply, not an evasive reply such as that given by the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>Sir my colleague, the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said on Friday that it was indeed satisfactory to know that criticism and comment from this side of the House had produced some good effects and had resulted in getting the Government to change its outlook to a degree and to be slightly more generous in meeting some of the costs of Bantu Education from general revenues. I am sure, Sir, that you will agree that the Bantu Education Account is one of the most complicated bits of accounting mechanism in our system of public finance, and it is also a subject about which some legislative action has had to be taken practically every year since the Account was established in April 1955. Moreover, I think you will agree that this is the only opportunity which the House has to discuss the policy of the Government in meeting the cost of Bantu education and also to examine the solvency or otherwise of the Account. Two years ago I pointed out that the Government had changed its policy and had changed its mind so often about what expenditure should be met as a charge against this Account, that it is exceedingly difficult to keep abreast of those changes. But as I said at the outset there is this satisfactory evidence that certain criticism from this side of the House has produced good results, and I want to commend two changes in the Government&#x2019;s outlook in regard to the voting of supplies for Bantu Education. But before I do so I would like to ask the hon. the Minister two questions. Firstly will the Minister explain why it was considered necessary by his Department in June last year to include provision in the Finance Act for an expected deficit on the Bantu Education Account to be met temporarily from the Loan Account. I refer to Section 3 of the Finance Act, No. 77 of 1962. The relevant provision reads&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) Any deficiency arising during the financial year ending on 31 March 1963, in the Bantu Education Account&#x2026; may be met by means of interest-free recoverable advances out of the Loan Account.</li>

<li>(b) Any such advances which are on the said date still outstanding, shall form a first charge upon the moneys accruing to the said Bantu Education Account during the ensuing financial year.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>That, of course, is during the current year. Secondly I would like to ask the hon. the Minister what the exact state of the account was as at 31 March 1963. Accurate information should now be available and I think the Minister should disclose to the committee whether in fact there was a deficit or a surplus and what the extent of that deficit or surplus was. Sir, I ask that question because according to a note on the Estimates for 1963-4, the state of the Account at the time these Estimates were prepared seems to indicate an expected surplus of some R500,000. Seemingly someone has erred or someone has had second thoughts, and on the evidence before me at present it seems that it was entirely unnecessary to burden Parliament last <span class="col_6359_6360" refersTo="page_0512"/>year with the provision which I have just quoted. I believe that the hon. the Minister was correct when he said in reply to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) that any amount left in the Account at the close of a year was not surrendered but was carried forward to the next year. But the hon. member for Houghton was fully justified in making the deduction which she did because the accounting officer, i.e. the Secretary of the Minister&#x2019;s Department at the foot of his appropriation account, says, &#x201C;surplus to be surrendered&#x201D;, and he gives the figure. In regard to the year 1960-1 he makes the specific statement, &#x201C;the surplus of R901,000 on Bantu Education Account for the financial year 19601 has been surrendered&#x201D;. I said just now that it seemed to me that someone had erred, and if the Minister is correct then someone erred again because the conventional term &#x201C;surrender&#x201D; means, of course, to surrender to the Revenue Account of the Exchequer. I put these two questions to the hon. the Minister because I think they are questions which should be answered at this stage and because we are dealing here with one of the most complicated bits of accounting mechanism that this House has ever seen.</p>

<p>That then brings me to the two bright spots in the Government&#x2019;s change of policy that followed on criticism from this side of the House. Firstly, for the first time last year, that is to say in 1962-3, and again this year, 1963-4, the Minister&#x2019;s salary and certain staff salaries have been charged to Revenue Account, i.e. to Vote 30 which we dealt with last week. To that extent, there has been some relief, since the full burden of those charges do not now fall on the Bantu Education Account as happened in previous years. Then, secondly, the hon. the Minister of Finance in his Budget speech this year made this confession; he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since the annual contribution from the Revenue Account to the Bantu Education Account was fixed at R13,000,000, the latter Account has had to assume considerable further obligations, particularly in respect of higher education.</block>

<p>Sir, that is a plea that we made from this side of the House for two years in succession. I say it is satisfactory to note that that has now been accepted by the hon. the Minister. The Minister of Finance then went on to say that an amount of R2,000,000 will be transferred to the Account in 1963-4 to cover expenditure on higher education up to 1962-3. Thereafter there will be an additional annual contribution not exceeding R1,500,000 but for the year 1963-4 there will be a contribution of R1,250,000. This special grant of R3,250,000, which is shown on page 6 of the Estimates, has still to be included in Supplementary Estimates which are still to be Tabled. So far so good, but instead of leaving the financial position of this Account fluid, it is quite clear from what the hon. the Minister of Finance went on to say that this additional contribution is again going to be a fixed statutory appropriation in spite of the fact that the Government recognizes that the charges to the Account will go on increasing year by year. The Minister of Finance then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> The Finance Bill, 1963, will accordingly provide for the transfer of R3,250,000 to the Bantu Education Account.</block>

<p>I think he really meant R1,250,000. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) will forgive me if I do not deal with his arguments in detail. I just blame him for his remark when he said, &#x201C;The disclosures made by the hon. member for Orange Grove&#x201D; after the hon. the Minister had already replied to it. The hon. the Minister has also saved me the trouble of replying to the hon. member for Orange Grove. In the short time I have been in this House I have learnt to regard him as an expert in ferreting out sinister information. If Afrikaans interests were not concerned in these printing companies the hon. member would never have taken the trouble to ferret out all these details.</p>

<p>But I want to confine myself to the remarks made by the hon. members for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) and Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) in regard to Xhosa as a medium of instruction. The hon. member for Houghton, <i>inter alia,</i> said: &#x201C;The Bantu vernacular is unsuitable for the needs of a modern society&#x201D;. The hon. member for Hillbrow contended: &#x201C;There are no scientific and no educational grounds for mother tongue education&#x201D;. I hope I understood her correctly. I should like to put this question to the hon. member: Does he, as an ex-educationist, believe that education should be concentrated on the child? I want to ask him whether he agrees that there are more educationists who agree with this proposition of mine.</p>

<p>Very well, it stands here, but the hon. member must now give his personal opinion as an educationist, and not the opinion of his party. Does he agree that education should be directed at and centred on the child, and not so much centred on the subject or on the language where the child has to learn a strange language by using it as the medium of education? Then I just want to refer to what was said by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) last Friday, with which I agree. The hon. member for Kensington, <i>inter alia,</i> said that he agreed with the idea of education of the Bantu by the Bantu for the Bantu. Well, that is nothing else but education centred on the Bantu child. There is ample proof of it here, and the hon. member will have to agree with what is stated here. I want to refer him to para. 7 On page 18.&#x2018;The hon. member very conveniently read just one <span class="col_6361_6362" refersTo="page_0513"/>line. The hon. member read the following in 7 (a)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Very few people completely rejected the mother tongue as a medium of instruction. The large majority are in favour of the mother tongue as the medium of instruction up to Std. 2.</block>

<p>And then it says, further, &#x201C;See Appendix 1 The further data are given there, and I do not want to weary the Committee with it, but it also says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reasons for this incontrovertible educational principle are not always clearly understood.</block>

<p>I agree with that, and I think the hon. member will also agree with the following remark&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The mother tongue is more than merely a language in the life of a small child. It constitutes an integral part of the child&#x2019;s behaviour pattern.</block>

<p>The mother tongue is the expression of his personality; it is the language in which he thinks. The mother tongue is the only means by which the child can express his experience of life. It is the only language in which he can crystallize his thoughts. If the hon. member had just read a little further he would have seen that an educational statement is made which he must support. He referred here to what was done in Canada and the United States, but he forgot to refer to what is being done in Wales, where they also have the difficulty in regard to two languages, English as against Welsh. In para. 7 (c) this statement is made, and it is quoted from a pamphlet published in 1954 by the Department of Education in Great Britain. I want to read it out because in my opinion it is an incontrovertible statement. The hon. member nods his head affirmatively.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I want to bring it to the notice of the hon. member once again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where Welsh is the mother tongue of the pupils, the Welsh teacher&#x2019;s task will be similar to that of the teacher everywhere for the importance of the mother tongue in the Primary Schools particularly is absolute and unchangeable. It is not so much a subject as the body and vital principle of all school activity.</block>

<p>Then it says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In spite of many factors that continued to operate against the use of the Welsh language, there can be no doubt that from a strictly educational, as opposed to an administrative standpoint, the argument for using the Welsh language in the schools was proved.</block>

<p>In that way one proposition after the other is stated to prove that the statement that the introduction of the mother tongue as the medium rests on a scientific basis. Sir, the biggest difficulty is that the impression has been created by certain people in the mind of the Bantu that he should despise his own language and that it is not good enough to serve as a medium of instruction. That idea has been instilled into his mind over the years. As early as 1846 Earl Grey, the British Colonial Secretary, wrote to the then Cape Governor, Sir Henry Pottinger, as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every attempt to reduce the Kafir tongue to writing as a medium of instruction should be carefully avoided and discouraged.</block>

<p>I repeat that over the course of the years this idea has been fostered in the minds of the Bantu, and that is why the Bantu have that idea; it was instilled into them from outside. Other people told them that they should despise their own language as the means of education. The recommendations of this Commission show clearly in the first place that the education rule which is valid in other parts of the world also applies to the Bantu, and, secondly, that the pride every nation has in its own spiritual and cultural assets, of which the language forms a very important part, is also present on the part of the Bantu and also applies to him. The hon. member for Kimberley-South (Dr. Venter) also quoted from this report, and I should like to emphasize just one portion of it on page 18, para. 7 (e)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In fact, if the mother tongue is not suitable as a medium of instruction, then it should be developed until it is suitable, or else these people should adopt a different mother tongue.</block>

<p>Then the report says, further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and in view of the fact that the Commission has found no convincing proof that the Xhosa people want to change their mother tongue, the only solution is to develop the mother tongue.</block>

<p>There is convincing proof by scientists and educationists that the mother tongue as the medium of instruction is the only sound basis&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am sure the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow on the remarks made by him to the Committee. I asked the hon. the Minister two questions and I have one further <span class="col_6363_6364" refersTo="page_0514"/>question to ask him. But before doing so I want to point out that there is a further unsatisfactory feature in regard to this Account, because although on paper it seems to be in a sound state, in actual fact it is far from being in a sound state and is really in a state of insolvency. The full extent of the expenditure commitments on this Account are not reflected in the Estimates before us. Because all capital expenditure on Bantu Education, both for university colleges and for primary and secondary education, is advanced from the Loan Account and recoverable from the Bantu Education Account, it means that the Bantu Education Account is indebted to the Loan Account in a substantial sum. At the end of March 1962 that indebtedness was just over R5,000,000, and by the end of March this year, 1963, that is at the end of the current financial year, it is likely to be nearly R7,000,000, and therefore your current receipts in the Account are mortgaged to the Loan Account to the extent to which I have indicated. By the end of March this year they will be mortgaged to the extent of more than half the normal contributions of R13,000,000 from the Revenue Account. This special contribution of R3,500,000 establishes moreover that the Bantu Education Account will continue to have to meet charges not only in respect of primary and secondary education but also in respect of university college education. I think the Minister should clear up the position and make a categorical statement as to how the expenditure in regard to these two types of education is going to be dealt with. Will each be dealt with separately on an accounting basis and shown separately on estimates or will these continue to be simply a globular account dealing with all three types of education&#x2014;primary, secondary and university education? I think the main difficulty is the unsound principle of making contributions from general revenue on a fixed basis while the cost of education must inevitably go on increasing year by year; that is very unsound, and while that remains, the Account will remain in a precarious state. It does not seem to be unfair therefore to ask the hon. Minister to indicate precisely what effect the transfer of Education to the Transkei is going to have on the Account. There will obviously be some saving in expenditure and there will also be some loss of revenue. I think it is a fair question to put to the Minister that he should say at this stage how these figures are going to affect the Account in the coming year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) referred to the position of the Bantu Education Account. He asked why it was necessary, by means of a loan last year, to provide for an anticipated deficit in this account, whereas in fact there seems to be a surplus of R500,000 this year. The reason was that we at no stage knew what revenue we would derive from Bantu taxation. One can estimate what Bantu taxation should bring in, but one does not know to what extent one will be able to collect that taxation. Various factors determine to what extent the Bantu pay their taxes. Whilst the Bantu Education Account was rather depleted and Bantu taxation was not coming in reasonably, or was less than expected, a deficit could easily arise, and that is why provision was made to cover such an eventuality.</p>

<p>What are the figures now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>I do not have the final figure of the balance, but we expect it to be in the vicinity of R500,000 as at 31 March. It is, as the hon. member said, a new fixed limit we now have in regard to university education; it is a repayment of what was more or less our current expenditure since taking it over, plus the expenditure for this year, and then it is fixed for the future at a maximum of R1,500,000 as an additional contribution to the Bantu Education Account especially for university education, but it does not mean that a separate account will be kept. It will all go into the same account. This is just an extra contribution, with the intention that the expenditure on the university colleges should not be more than that amount. That is done in an attempt to keep the expenditure of these colleges within certain limits. We consider that in so far as the university colleges are concerned, the large-scale expansion which cost a tremendous amount of money without resulting in much revenue from study fees, etc., has now really reached the high-water mark, and that from now on the position should be better; that the expenditure will increase to a lesser extent than the revenue increases. We think that by fixing it at R250,000, more than this year&#x2019;s expenditure, we will in any case for many years be able to provide the necessary services at the university colleges. I do not think that in so far as that is concerned we will have any difficulty in future. But I want to point out to the hon. member that another important concession has been made in regard to the Bantu Education Account, namely that in future not only four-fifths of the Bantu taxation but the full amount of Bantu taxation, will be put into that fund. This is a very great concession which will result in a large sum of money for the Bantu Education Account in the years to come; and if hon. members bear in mind that last year not even 50 per cent of the Bantu taxpayers paid their taxes they will realize that if all the Bantu pay their taxes we will be able to do much for Bantu education. I think in future the emphasis must fall on the collection of Bantu taxation. There is a special committee which will now work in that direction.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me at this stage to say more about the question of mother tongue education. The matter has been discussed over and over on various occasions and various hon. members on this side have dealt with it fully.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, through you, I should like to address my remarks to the Treasury Benches and members of the Government. A year ago the hon. the Minister had assumed the responsibility of this portfolio and I remember that on that occasion we said that we realized that he had not had time to get the harness well round his neck and that it would be unfair on our part to ask him what his Department&#x2019;s policy was. But he has now had 12 months to get a grip of his Department. One sees statements and news items in the Press from time to time. We are not going to judge the Minister on the strength of statements which appear in the Press. We should like the hon. the Minister to be very frank with us this evening and tell us what his policy is in regard to one or two matters on which I shall elaborate presently so that when we discuss Indian affairs we can do so in the light of the policy he has enunciated. In fact, Sir, we believe, that the Minister will welcome an opportunity, having been in office for 12 months, of putting his policy before this House and the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>It has come to our ears that the Minister is negotiating in regard to political matters associated with the Indians and that there are talks going on about the political parts which Indians are to play in future in this country. Perhaps the Minister would be so good as to tell us how he sees the political destiny of the Indians in Natal and in the Transvaal. In regard to the other matters, I need not go any further than the Sunday paper which appeared yesterday where a statement appears to the effect that the hon. the Minister recently travelled to Johannesburg to meet a committee or group of Indians where various matters were discussed. I do not know how far that report is correct but on the assumption that there is some basis for this report I should like to put it to the hon. the Minister that we shall be grateful to know whether he did go to meet this group of Indians; whether the report in this Sunday paper is substantially correct and whether in regard to group areas discussions took place on the basis of the establishment of what is called a fact finding committee staying in permanent session. That is the phrase that is used. The suggestion, at any rate in the newspaper, is that a committee of two or three people, including members of the Minister&#x2019;s staff, should be in permanent sitting with a view to discussing group areas. I cannot discuss group areas under the Vote of this Minister because group areas fall under another Minister, but there is no doubt whatsoever that the application of the Group Areas Act and the policy of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s colleague are matters of great concern to the hon. the Minister of Indian Affairs because the Group Areas Act impinges very sharply on the policy and the work of the Department of Indian Affairs. So we should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he would tell us whether he proposes establishing such a committee and if so what is his attitude with regard to group areas. According to this report where Indian traders are unable to find other accommodation with similar trading rights, where there is a similar opening for business, notwithstanding the fact that the period of their permit had elapsed under the Group Areas Act, no prosecution would take place and that they would be given further time to try to find an opportunity of re-establishing themselves without being prosecuted.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of job reservation. According to this statement, as far as job reservation is concerned, the hon. the Minister will make it his business to see that Indians are not, through the application of job reservation, kept away from their employment; but that on the contrary, provision will be made for the training of Indians in skilled jobs by the amelioration of the provisions of the Apprenticeship Act and that when they are trained the Minister will see to it that they get those jobs from which they would otherwise have been excluded because of job reservation.</p>

Will he tell us what is his attitude towards job reservation, even if that was not discussed, and the training of Indian youth as apprentices for the purposes of playing a part as trained artisans in whatever sphere it may be that his policy determines they shall take part in hereafter. Because we have a Minister of Indian Affairs these are all things we can bring to one man. As I have said, he has had 12 months and I hope he will be able to give us, at any rate in broad outline, the picture as he sees it for the political, the economic and the residential development of the Indians who will no doubt find him a most sympathetic Minister in attending to their welfare and their cares.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>With the greatest respect, Mr. Chairman, I am confining myself to the Vote because I am talking about our relations with the Indians in South Africa, and this is one of the most important aspects of race relations in this country. I want to express my appreciation to the hon. member for South Coast for the fact that he did no more this evening than to ask the Minister what progress he was making in connection with this question of our relations with the Indians in South Africa. I hope that this discussion will continue in that spirit because this question of our relationship with the Indians in South Africa is in many respects perhaps one of our most difficult racial problems. I say that it is one of our most difficult racial problems because it has certain characteristics which are not to be found in our other racial problems. As far as the Bantu are concerned, that side of the House has a certain policy and we have a certain policy. We also differ as far as the Coloureds are concerned; the Party over there has a certain policy with regard to the Coloureds and we have our policy. But when we come to the Indians in South Africa, we are dealing with a group of people, many of whom still look to their own mother country. That is why I cannot take any exception at all to the attitude which the hon. member for South Coast adopted here this evening in simply asking the Minister for information as to his approach to the Indian question. It is not necessary for me to say what our approach is. We of the National Party have stated perfectly clearly that we have abandoned the idea of solving this problem by way of repatriation. Years ago both parties felt that it could be solved along those lines, but we have abandoned that idea and I think the United Party have also abandoned it. This problem simply cannot be solved along the lines of repatriation. The main reason why we no longer consider the idea of repatriation is because in the first place the country to which they would have to be repatriated refuses to have them, and in the second place they do not want to go because they are so very much better off in Verwoerd&#x2019;s hell of oppression than they would be in Nehru&#x2019;s paradise. They are having a much better time in this devilish South Africa than Nehru&#x2019;s little angels have in India.</p>

<p>Very well, they are South Africans. We have all decided that they are South African citizens. The question that now arises is what we are going to do with these people. As far as this side of the House is concerned we say that in the first place we must determine what their economic needs are, their educational requirements and their medical requirements and that we should lead them as far as possible along that road before we look after their political needs. Hon. members on the other side of the House will forgive me if I ask what their attitude is. I do not do so in a provocative way. The hon. member for South Coast adopted a very reasonable attitude, all he did was to ask the Minister what progress had been made with regard to this question of our relations with the Indians. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) must not interrupt me now. We can do one of two things as far as the Indians are concerned. We can either follow the policy that we are following in the case of the Coloureds or we can say that they must be given representation in this House. I very carefully studied the statement of the Leader of the Opposition which appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> a little while ago but it is not clear at all from that statement what he proposes to do with the Indians of South Africa. As far as I can discover&#x2014;I do not think I am doing him an injustice in saying this&#x2014;he stated that they would discuss the matter with the Indians to find out how much representation they wanted in this House. The fact of the matter is that all the Indians were offered representation in this House. That representation was offered by General Smuts when he confined the Indians to certain areas. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) will probably remember it very well. At the time of the passing of the Pegging Act he and I were both good United Party supporters, the only difference being that he was not quite as good as I was. At that time General Smuts under the Pegging Act offered the Indians two representatives in this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow wants to know which Vote this is. Has he still not discovered which Vote it is? I suppose he will discover it somewhere around 9 o&#x2019;clock. The old United Party under General Smuts offered the Indians two representatives in this House and a number of seats in the Provincial Council, and what was the attitude of the Indians? They simply rejected it. They wanted to have nothing to do with it. They said they wanted to have nothing to do with any representation in this House. All that one could get out of them at the time was that they wanted what all the most extreme Leftists desire and that is full representation in this House on a basis of equality with the White man. Neither that side nor this side, with the exception of the hon. member for Houghton <span class="col_6369_6370" refersTo="page_0517"/>(Mrs. Suzman), is willing to accede to that request.</p>

<p>What is the attitude of this side of the House? We are faced here with a problem; we have decided that these people cannot be repatriated and we have to give them some place in South Africa. What place can we give them? As far as we can see the position is this, we say that we are prepared to develop the Indian community along the same lines as the Coloureds. And that is not such an easy task. The attitude of the Government is that we must establish an Indian Advisory Council as we did in the case of the Coloureds. But because these people are so reluctant to cooperate, that process will be a much slower one than it was in the case of the Coloureds. The Indians are reluctant to co-operate for many reasons&#x2014;for religious reasons and because they still have a mother country other than South Africa, which does not apply in the case of the Coloureds. The problem of dealing with the Coloureds is a very much easier one. But we say that we are willing to develop the Indian community along the lines that we are following in the case of the Coloureds. I hope that the Minister will succeed&#x2014;I know that he is already doing so&#x2014;in establishing an Indian Advisory. Council as soon as possible along the lines of the Coloured Advisory Council that we had in the old days. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) says that the development of the Indian people should be on similar lines as those of the Coloured people. Does that mean that we are going to have four people in this House to represent the Indians? You see, Sir, the hon. member for Vereeniging tried to create a diversion. He even went so far as to say that the repatriation of Indians was a dead-letter. Obviously he has not read the Estimates because there provision is made for R5,000 for the repatriation of Indians. This hon. member, instead of studying the Estimates tried to create a diversion in which he has been unsuccessful. Sir, I think we are entitled to know from the hon the Minister what his attitude is towards this problem. According to this report in the newspaper the Indian people can expect far-reaching concessions. What we should like to know from the Minister is this: Does he propose to make any concessions and if yes, what concessions does he propose to make? Do the concessions which he proposes to make involve legislation? Will they involve a more sympathetic administration if they do not involve new legislation of existing laws which affect the Indian people? If they involve a more sympathetic administration of existing legislation why is the Minister only now administering that legislation more sympathetically? The Indians are concerned with the administration of existing legislation particularly as far as it affects their economic life.</p>

<p>We are interested to see that the deputation which met the Minister consisted of some Indian merchants. Does the Minister propose to go on meeting deputations of this kind and can he tell us how these people were appointed? If he is going to deal with the Indian people in future what kind of a body will he meet? Will it be the merchant class? In what way will they be appointed? What will he regard as representative? I submit, Sir, that it is not only the merchant class which represents the Indian people; you have the teacher class, the professional class and the working class. The working class has a lot to say, Sir. I want to know what practical assistance the Minister is going to give to the Indian people. I refer particularly to his Welfare Department. His Welfare Department will be eased if something is done to the unemployed Indians. We in Natal are particularly concerned about the number of unemployed Indians. We have the biggest Indian population in South Africa. It is all very well for people outside to talk about the Indian problem but the majority of the Indians in South Africa are in Natal and they are particularly the responsibility of Natal.</p>

<p>May I refer the Minister to a survey made recently by the University of Natal. I think the Minister has seen that survey and I should like to know whether he accepts the findings of that survey. If he does not accept their findings, will the Minister institute a departmental survey. That survey shows that about 15,000 adult Indians were unemployed and were actively seeking employment in January 1962. This figure represents 12.3 per cent of the Durban Indian population and 27.7 per cent of the Indian working population. The report goes on to say that the average number of dependants of an Indian worker was 4.2, so that on the average a worker&#x2019;s earnings had to support 5.2 persons. It says that the average weekly wage earned by a worker was R10.56. It says that unemployment was particularly marked amongst people under the age of 25 years and over the age of 56 years. Mr. Chairman, one of the tragedies in the peri urban areas of Durban to-day is the number of Indians with the junior certificate and the matriculation certificate walking the streets looking for work. I have met many of them who have been out of work for six months up to 18 months; they are willing to work but they cannot get work. It is all very well hon. members of the Government appearing to be unconcerned about that, but every unemployed worker is a burden on the State; every unemployed person is a burden on the taxpayer of South Africa. This report goes on to say that the percentage of unemployment is highest amongst the workers of low educational attainments, being as high as over 30 per cent amongst workers who have passed Stds. Ill and IV and the lowest amongst workers of <i>a</i> higher educational standard being under 8 per cent amongst workers who have gone beyond Std. VIII and nil amongst workers who have matriculated. Over 90 per cent of the unemployed have not passed Std. VI <span class="col_6371_6372" refersTo="page_0518"/>and half of these did not go beyond Std. IV. Unemployment is most concentrated amongst those trained in skilled industrial occupations and amongst the unskilled workers about 32 per cent. With the exception of the building industry, where unemployment is high, industrial workers suffer less unemployment than non-industrial workers. It is this whole question of unemployment which has been a canker in the life of the Indian community of Natal. I presume the position is the same in other parts of the country and. I think it warrants the special attention of this Minister. I want to know whether the hon. the Minister is going to do anything about it. Is he going to make representations to the Minister of Labour? What assistance does he think he will be able to give this section of the community?</p>

<p>Another matter which deserves the attention of the hon. the Minister is the question of the administration of the Group Areas Act. It does not actually fall under his Department but it has been decided to form a new township outside Durban in terms of the Group Areas Act. The Minister knows that that township, the Chatsworth Township is going to involve a considerable amount of money. Housing without transport, Mr. Chairman, is not the answer, We do hope the Minister will use his influence with the Minister of Railways, whom I am glad to see in the House to-night, to ensure that transport and housing go hand in hand. Without adequate transport those people are going to be put out in the bush and they will suffer a hardship, no matter how good the housing is if their transport becomes an economic burden which they cannot bear. I hope the Minister will go into the whole question of the housing of these people, into the effect of the Group Areas Act on their domestic and economic life and into the question of unemployment which affects the community as a whole. Now that it is his special responsibility the Indian community will not be satisfied with assurances in a newspaper to the effect that special concessions are going to be given to them unless they see something tangible, something which means bread and butter and economic relief to them. I think all sides are agreed that this section of the community has been neglected for a long time, particularly under this Government. This Government came into power in 1948 with the solution of the Indian problem in their pockets.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I cannot reply to the questions of the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell). He put those questions to the hon. the Minister and I take it that the Minister will answer all those questions when he replies. The hon. member insinuates that it is the sole prerogative of hon. members who represent Natal to discuss Indian Affairs. It seems to me that if any person wishes to discuss the subject, he is first expected to advance reasons as to why he arrogates the right to himself to participate in the debate. I just want to say to the hon. member that during the period that I served on the City Council of Pretoria I was chairman of the non-White Affairs Committee and that the Indians also fell under that group. Pretoria&#x2019;s Indian population at the moment is 6,064, and I therefore claim the right to participate in the discussion on this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred in passing to an inquiry which was instituted by the Indian University College in Durban&#x2014;a thorough inquiry, as he described it. I should like to say a few words about that University College, and I want to do so because these university colleges are always referred to as being possibly inferior institutions. This university college for Indians was the last of the series of institutions for higher education which the Government established during the past few years. The establishment of this college was a direct outcome of Act 45 of 1959, the Extension of University Education Act. On the one hand it is the outcome of the Government&#x2019;s policy to introduce parallel development for the various racial groups and on the other hand it is the outcome of the cry to introduce democracy in education. The idea of the establishment of university colleges for non-Whites is that they are to serve their own communities, communities which have not previously had that opportunity. Mr. Chairman, it was against this background that the University College at Durban came into being. I must admit that Durban is the right place because there you have the greatest concentration of Indians.</p>

<p>I should like to point out that at the beginning attempts were made to boycott that university. The Government&#x2019;s effort was viewed with suspicion. Misgivings were expressed with regard to the staff, with regard to the buildings, with regard to the standard of the work and the examinations. The university had to start in an atmosphere which was actually hostile. It is true that the first few students were confused and uncertain and the suspicions of the Indian community were aroused through criticism in the newspapers. To crown everything, Mr. Chairman, the standard demanded for admission to universities was raised in 1960, and the first 120 students, may of whom were extra-mural students, who went to that university panicked because an unsympathetic Press and other bodies had made all sorts of dire prophecies. Then there was also the difficulty in connection with the courses. To begin with the students could not choose the courses which they were anxious to follow. But, Mr. Chairman&#x2014; and this is my important point&#x2014;in due course that wall of suspicion, distruct and prejudice was broken down. The Indian community came to have greater faith in this institution and accepted it because the State was making every endeavour to give those people the best education. Indeed that is proved by the fine laboratories which have been established and equipped there. The growing number of students affords practical proof of the acceptance <span class="col_6373_6374" refersTo="page_0519"/>of that university college by the Indian community. In 1961 there were 114 students at the university; in 1962 there were 291, in 1963&#x2014;this is the latest figure&#x2014;there was a phenomenal increase in the number to 681, of whom 474 are full-time and 207 part-time. I understand that it is anticipated that next year the number of students will be in the vicinity of 800, and when we bear in mind that the number of pupils in the secondary schools is also increasing, it stands to reason that there will be a further increase in the number of students at the Indian University in the future. Sir, we should like to express our thanks to the University of South Africa which is the examining university for the Indian University College. When we look at the figures in connection with the Indian University College, we find that last year 47 per cent of the students passed the first-year course and 69.6 per cent the second-year course, a very fine result. I regard this confidence which is reposed in the university college as symbolic of the break-through of confidence on the part of the Indian community. We know that generally speaking the members of the Indian community view each other with distrust and that they have not trusted the Government&#x2019;s efforts either, but here we have evidence of a break-through. Sir, we know that the elements among the Indian community who stir up trouble consist of only a small group of Indians, the so-called Congress groups, and although their influence amongst the Indians is confined to perhaps no more than 3 per cent of the Indian population, it is those elements who still continue to look to India and Pakistan for assistance and who try to stir up feeling against South Africa at UNO. As soon as we succeed in breaking the influence of this small group of rich Indians, we shall have greater co-operation from the average Indian, the ordinary working class Indian, to whom we are very sympathetically disposed. But the important point is that our Department has broken through this wall of distrust, and in this sphere the university college has set the example.</p>

<p>I think it will be in the interest of these discussions if I put a few matters in the correct light and if we can get a little clarity in this connection, but I must say at once that after having read the report to-day in yesterday&#x2019;s <i>Sunday Times</i> I wished that the hon. Senator Sutter was here so that I could address a few suitable words to him, because I have seldom come across such a complete misrepresentation as that published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> about the interview which I gave in Pretoria and in connection with which reports had appeared previously in other newspapers. It is simply scandalous that journalism in South Africa should descend to the level to which this report descends. Sir, do you know what the <i>Sunday Times</i> tries to do here? It tries to create the impression that my Department and I can be used as instruments of the Indians to act against the Department of Community Development as far as Group Areas are concerned. This is what the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to informed sources the Department of Indian Affairs is now trying to win over the Department of Community Development&#x2026;</block>

<p>Just imagine, the Department of Indian Affairs is allegedly trying to win over the Department of Community Development&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which administers the Group Areas Act to a new policy of removing economic grievances and assuring the Indians that the Government recognizes them as belonging in South Africa.</block>

<p>In the first place there is an accusation here against my colleague and his Department that they do not regard the Indians as belonging in South Africa; that they are regarded as foreigners. And then the paper says that I am trying to persuade them to regard the Indians as South Africans. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Group Areas legislation will be eased so that Indians whose homes are removed to their own residential areas will not necessarily have to give up their businesses in White areas.</block>

<p>This is supposed to come from the &#x201C;informed sources&#x201D; of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> But what appeared in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> immediately after the interview which I gave to this deputation? There it was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Replying, Mr. Maree made it clear, according to Mr. Joosub&#x2026;</block>

<p>The <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> has the decency to mention the source of its information, and because it gives the source of its information its report is fairly correct&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Replying, Mr. Maree made it clear, according to Mr. Joosub, that Government policy was inflexible and that all Indian traders would ultimately have to go from White areas.</block>

<p>It is clear that that statement was not made by me but by Mr. Joosub who was the leader of that deputation and who gave this statement to the newspapers after the interview. In spite of that statement, which had been published in the newspapers, the <i>Sunday Times</i> publishes this report in which it suggests that I am the person who is trying to persuade my colleague, Mr. Botha, to change his mind and to allow the Indians to remain in the White areas where they are at present. I resent that because it raises hopes in the minds of the Indian community which cannot be realized. It must be clearly understood that it is not the function of my Department to administer the Group Areas Act or to take over the administration of the Department of <span class="col_6375_6376" refersTo="page_0520"/>Labour in connection with job reservation, etc. That is the function of those two Departments. In this connection my Department is only a liaison Department through which the Indians can bring their problems to the notice of the Government because they do not always know which Departments to go to and because frequently their problems are problems in which various Departments are involved and because it is difficult for them to go and see all these Departments. That is why my Department acts as a link in this connection. But it is not the function of my Department to try to persuade other Departments to abandon their policy or to apply a different policy.</p>

<p>What I am doing is set out specifically in the statement issued by me. The hon. member for South Coast has asked me what happened on this occasion and whom I met. Let me give the Committee the whole history. I received a request from Mr. Joosub, the president of the Pretoria Traders&#x2019; Association, to interview a deputation of Indians and I then arranged it. There were 12 delegates, not only traders but also others whom he had invited to come along, because he told me that he did not wish to create the impression that the interests of the Indian traders were not the same as those of other Indians. They spoke to me in connection with certain problems. They asked me to appoint an independent commission of inquiry to go into the implementation of the Group Areas Act. I informed them at once that I could not support such a request for a single moment but that I was prepared&#x2014;and that is how my statement in this connection which appeared in the newspapers reads&#x2014;to appoint a fact-finding committee. Let me quote the statement which I issued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This deputation of Indians of the whole of the Transvaal has asked for a commission of inquiry into the implementation of the Group Areas Act. That request cannot be acceded to. But I have undertaken to appoint a two-man inter-departmental fact finding committee in collaboration with the Minister of Community Development, Mr. P. W. Botha. This committee will only examine and determine the facts, for the information of Minister Botha and myself, in those cases where Indians have made representations to my Department and where it appears that there are <i>bona fide</i> cases of hardship as a result of the implementation of the Group Areas Act, and where the information of the Department of Community Development differs from the information furnished by the Indians who made the representations.</block>

<p>The position is this: The Department of Community Development has certain information at its disposal and it takes certain decisions on the basis of that information.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>What happens is that the Department of Community Development takes certain decisions on the strength of information which it has at its disposal and that Indians affected by those decisions then make representations through my Department to the Department of Community Development, but then they present me with information and facts which differ entirely from the information at the disposal of the Department of Community Development. That happens repeatedly. In order to enable me to satisfy the Indians and to enable both Minister Botha and myself to satisfy ourselves that the decisions arrived at were based on the true facts of the situation, it was decided to appoint this standing inter-departmental committee consisting of two men. Only those cases where the information submitted to my Department (which is used as the channel for making representations) differs from the information which he and his Department have, will be submitted to this committee for investigation to ascertain the reasons for this difference and to furnish us with the correct facts. That is the only decision that was taken. I want to add that the Indians are satisfied with this. They feel that they will have achieved something if there is some channel through which they can bring to our notice the facts in connection with cases of hardship. As a result of this the Indians decided&#x2014;and Mr. Joosub in fact said so, according to a statement which he gave to the newspapers&#x2014;that however difficult it was to do so, they must accept that the pattern in South Africa is one of separate development and that they must adapt themselves to that pattern. In that connection I want to make it perfectly clear that I informed the deputation on that occasion that I often gained the impression that the Indians were adopting delaying tactics in connection with the implementation of the Group Areas Act because they were hoping that something would happen to cause the Government to abandon its policy or to unseat the Government. They are doing everything in their power to cause delay. I said to them that they could take it from me that all <i>bona fide</i> problems would receive sympathetic consideration from all departments provided there are signs that they are willing to co-operate and that they do not intend to adopt delaying tactics. The result is that I have now received offers from Indians from various parts who wish to establish bodies or associations or groups in an attempt to persuade their fellow-Indians to shift in accordance with the provisions of the Group Areas Act. I mention this merely to make it clear that it is not my function and the function of my Department to lay down policy in respect of the Group Areas Act, nor is it our function to determine the policy in respect of job reservation. My department is simply the link through which the Indians can make representations to those <span class="col_6377_6378" refersTo="page_0521"/>departments. Any attempt such as that now being made by the <i>Sunday Times</i> to play me and my Department off against my colleague and his Department can only be described as reprehensible, particularly since it is entirely in conflict with the facts.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) has asked with whom we are having discussions; whether we are only having discussions with the traders. I have adopted the attitude from the beginning that in making contacts with the Indian community one must bear in mind the fact that there are not only different religious groups but also different interests, and that I am not going to accept any particular group which only represents a particular interest or a particular religion as the mouthpiece of all the Indians. If a group of traders ask for an interview with me, then in the nature of things I must meet them if they put forward a reasonable case. Similarly my doors are open to any deputation of workers or of teachers or of other interest groups in the community. But I have always insisted that when members of the Indian community wish to come and see me with regard to the interests of the Indian community as a whole, they should try to make the deputation which comes to see me one which is representative of all the different interests. I have in fact on various occasions met deputations which have included traders, teachers, waiters, factory workers and others. My Department is making fine contacts with the Indians in all the various professions and occupations and with Indians of all different classes in the country.</p>

<p>In this connection I want to refer to job reservation and the training of Indian artisans referred to here by hon. members. I say again that it is not my function or that of my Department to lay down policy in this connection. The policy in this connection is determined by the Department of Labour, but my Department does help to try to obtain information and to bring about the necessary co-ordination. That also applies in respect of unemployment.</p>

<p>May I say that I have no reason to doubt the figures contained in the report of the University of Natal because we have no other information at our disposal. But it is because we know that the position is serious that my Department keeps in touch with the Durban Chamber of Industries, the Chamber of Commerce the Department of Labour and also with the Municipality in an attempt to find employment for the Indians. But we cannot lay down the policy in connection with the implementation of job reservation, etc. We can only try, within the framework of the policy laid down by other Departments, to find avenues of employment. We have already done this with a fair degree of success. In the building industry, for example, we have succeeded in persuading building contractors to make use to a much greater extent of Indian workers and Indian artisans in the building industry when they build in the Indian residential areas. The training at the technical colleges, of course, falls directly under my Department. We have already asked the Department of Education, Arts and Science to make a socio-economic survey for us in connection with the Indians through its Social and Educational Research Bureau. It is, of course, an almost impossible task to make a socio-economic survey in connection with Indians throughout the whole country simultaneously and immediately. That is why the survey is being made in different regions and areas. In Natal we are being assisted by the Department of Sociology of the University College for Indians in co-operation with other Departments. In Johannesburg the survey at Lenasia has already been completed, but the information still has to be sifted. I expect to receive the first report within the next five or six weeks. Once we get these socio-economic surveys we shall really be able to start to conduct fruitful negotiations with the other Government Departments to see what avenues of employment can be created for these people. So much with regard to the question of unemployment and group areas. I might just say that as far as Chatsworth is concerned the hon. member for Pinetown referred to the problem of transport. There again it is not my Department&#x2019;s duty to make provision for transport, but my Department, which was aware of the circumstances, immediately got in touch with the relevant departments and discussions then took place between the Municipality and the Railway Administration and the Department of Transport to see in what way this transport problem could best be solved, whether it should be tackled by way of rail transport or by way of bus transport or air transport. All the possibilities are examined by the technical people of the various departments with a view of finding the best solution. I may add that where transport services which have to serve Indians have to be instituted, my Department insists that preference should be given to Indian transport contractors when it comes to the granting of licences, that is to say, when all other things are equal, of course. We feel that this offers an opportunity to create more avenues of employment for Indians. There are quite a number of Indians who operated between the Cato Manor area in Durban and who lost numbers of their clients as a result of the removal of the Bantu from the Cato Manor area and who then obtained licences to operate in the Chatsworth area. In this way we are trying to look after the interests of the Indians to the best of our ability.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has asked me to give some indication as to the nature of my negotiations with the Indians with regard to their political future in South Africa. I made it perfectly clear to the Indians&#x2014;and they know that this is so&#x2014;that the Government&#x2019;s policy in this regard was perfectly clear, and that is that we do not hold out the prospect of parliamentary representation for the Indians but that for the rest the pattern which applies in respect of the Coloureds will also be applied to them, <span class="col_6379_6380" refersTo="page_0522"/>that is to say, they will be able to have their own municipalities or management committees in their own residential areas; in other words, they will be able to manage their own local affairs. In addition to that, there is the possibility that eventually an Indian Council may come into existence, a council which will have legislative and administrative responsibilities in respect of all matters directly affecting the Indian community. We are already beginning, as a preparatory step, to take over certain services for the Indians. Hon. members will notice that as from this year we are responsible for the university and higher education of the Indians and also for welfare services and pensions. These services have all been taken over this year. Similarly my Department will gradually, step by step, take over all the services which have to be rendered to the Indian community so that eventually it will be easier to transfer these obligations and duties to the Indian Council when it is ultimately called into being. I do not think it is necessary for me at this stage to deal with this matter in any detail. The policy of the Government has been dealt with and discussed on so many occasions in this House that if hon. members still do not know what that policy is, then I doubt whether I shall ever be able to assist them in this connection.</p>

<p>Before we can proceed to constitute such an Indian Council it is necessary, of course, that we should satisfy ourselves that it will be possible to constitute the council in such a way that it will be representative of all the various interest groups of the Indian population. That is why I do not want to be overhasty in constituting the council. I want to make proper contacts first with the various communities. I want to build up the necessary goodwill first and I hope that we shall be successful in obtaining that goodwill. We are getting the goodwill of the Indians to-day to an ever-increasing extent. As soon as we feel, in consultation with them, that the time is ripe, the council will be established but I do not think that this is a matter in which one should be overhasty. We must take our time because we are dealing here with so many different interest groups, religious groups, etc. We must make sure that we satisfy everybody and that we do not handle this matter in a way which draws one group towards us but alienates another group. I want to give hon. members the assurance that the contacts which my Department and I have made with the Indians in recent times have produced very excellent results, to such an extent that we can testify to the fact that to-day there is a growing goodwill on the part of the Indian community.</p>

<p>I think the hon. Minister is being a little optimistic if he thinks that he is ever going to build up goodwill between himself and the Indians in South Africa on the basis that he has described. He told us that it is not his function to look into the question of job reservation it is not his function to investigate the policy of group areas. Job reservation, he says, falls under the Department of Labour and group areas fall under the Department of the Interior. It so happens that these are the two matters which of course gravely affect the lives of the Indian community. I have found it difficult to understand exactly what the function of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department is in view of the fact that he has disclaimed all responsibility for the two matters that most specifically affect the Indian community in South Africa. He calls himself a link. Of course it crossed my mind that he is somewhat of a missing link because I do not know what he is linking up with. He is certainly not linking up on the important issues, the two most important issues that I have mentioned. What is more, he is a very expensive link, indeed.</p>

<p>Well, his functions are missing but his Department exists, and leaving out the social welfare side of it, his Department exists to the tune of R230,000. That is what the missing link costs us. Of course social welfare could just as well fall under the Department of Social Welfare, unemployment could be done by the Labour Department and education, technical and otherwise, could fall under the Department of Education.</p>

<p>A lot has been said about goodwill and all the rest of it, and everybody coming to terms on this question of the Indian population in South Africa. Evidently the fact is now being recognized on both sides of the House that the Indian community is here to stay, that they are South Africans, and that in fact they have been here for a hundred years. That of course should have dawned on people a long time ago. But better late than never. It has now dawned on this House generally that Indians cannot be repatriated and that they are in South Africa to stay. Of course we have not got much further in deciding what is going to happen to them thereafter. Both sides are still unsure about the political future of Indians. One thing we know is that Indians are not going to get any political representation in this House under the Government&#x2019;s policy, although the hon. the Minister contradicted himself almost immediately after making that statement by saying that the Government&#x2019;s intentions as regards the Indian population are to follow the same pattern as in respect of the Coloureds. And of course the Coloureds do have four representatives in the Lower House. Now I do not know what the intentions of the Opposition are as far as the political future of Indians is concerned. This is still open to consultation, although the Indians have been here for a hundred years, and the United Party has been in existence for 30 years; therefore it is time that the consultations started so that we can all know what the intentions are.</p>

<p>I constantly pleaded for the extension of rights of non-Europeans, whether Coloured or Indian or anything else. The policy that I support is that individuals should be treated as individuals and not as members of racial groups. In other words, if they have reached <i>a</i> certain stage of responsibility, they should be given rights and privileges as any member of any other racial group. In other words Common Roll representation for Indians throughout South Africa, males as well as females, who have reached certain educational or other qualifications.</p>

<p>I want to come to the question of the Indian Congress which created such a furor in the breast of the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto). He dislikes the Indian National Congress. Now irrespective of whether he dislikes them or not, or whether I dislike them or not, which is quite irrelevant to this debate, I want to ask the hon. Minister whether certain facts presented in a report drawn up by the Transvaal Indian Congress are in fact true facts or false, and if they are false, perhaps he will show us where they are false. This report was produced this year, and it shows that out of a total population of Transvaal Indians of 48,892 people something like 38,000 people have to be moved under group area proclamations, which the hon. Minister says is no concern of his. Now I am not asking him for an explanation of policy, but what I want to know is what the effect is of the policy, and whether it is correct as the Transvaal Indian Congress states that something like 38,000 out of 48,000 people are going to have to be moved when the group area proclamations are actually implemented.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister is head of the Department of Indian Affairs and I put it to him that it is his specific responsibility to seek the welfare of those people, and if there is something which is gravely affecting their entire livelihood, their whole future mode of living, it is indeed his concern. He should use his influence to see what can be done about these people, and I am very sorry indeed that he says that there is no truth whatever in the <i>Sunday Times</i> report. I am sorry there is no truth in it because I saw in it a ray of hope for the Indian people that the hon. Minister had met this delegation and was going to do his best to intervene on their behalf, both as far as group areas are concerned, and secondly as far as job reservation is concerned, because these are the two factors that most grievously affect the lives of the Indian community. Sir, it is no accident or fate that the majority of Indians in South Africa earn their livelihood as traders, and on the traders depends the livelihood of about two-thirds of the rest of the Indian population. It is no accident, because they have been prohibited either by the apprenticeship regulations or by job reservation or by the customary colour bar, which in many ways acts just as harshly on people of colour as statutory regulations, but whatever the reason may be, Indians in fact are virtually prohibited from taking up any occupations other than menial occupations, or going into trade and becoming self-employed.</p>

<p>I say that for a number of years we in this House have become accustomed to it that any colour, except White, excites that hon. member to such an extent that she cannot contain herself, she then causes a flutter in the dovecot and on every occasion she tries to befuddle the issue and to disturb race relations. If I interpret the atmosphere in this House correctly to-night. Sir, I think it is in a mood to approach this very difficult problem in a calm and objective manner because we are faced with an exceedingly difficult problem. When they were in power the United Party also made a serious attempt to tackle this problem of the Indians, particularly the Indians of Natal, but there was simply no co-operation on the part of the Indian population and even to-day they are not prepared to co-operate. Encouraged by people like Dr. Dadoo and Dr. Naicker and others the Indians were unwilling to co-operate with the Whites to try to find a solution and to establish better race relations. Let us see what the real position is. I challenge any person, including the hon. member for Houghton, to go to the Johannesburg market, the Pretoria market and practically every market in South Africa and see what the position is there. Those markets are controlled by the Indians, by the Indian retailer and wholesaler and they do it in such a way that it gives great offence to both the Whites and the non-Whites. Hence the race riots which we had at Cato Manor. It is a fact, is it not, that the Bantu rioted against the Indians and the Whites had to protect the latter against annihilation. But will the hon. member for Houghton admit that? On no, she pours fat on to the fire. Why she wants to fish in those troubled waters remains a mystery to me. What does she and others like her want? Anybody in his right mind will admit that we cannot have a second Pakistan or a second India here in South Africa. It cost India the lives of 19,000,000 people to obtain partition but what is 19,000,000 out of 500,000,000? Where we have been forced into this unfortunate position by these people themselves, I repeat that we cannot bring about separation between Indian and Indian. South Africa is too small for that. But do we get any co-operation from that hon. member? She and I came here together in 1953 and right from the outset she did nothing but disturb race relations. She misrepresents everything as long as she can disturb relations and fish in troubled waters. Heaven only knows what she wants. The Opposition must say the same. We should tackle this problem as responsible people. I have listened to the speeches from that side and I take it that they feel as we do namely that this is a problem that must be solved. It is very difficult for us to fit the Indians into the pattern of this country. When the White man came here he found the Hottentot in the Western Cape. To-day we know them as the Coloured people. Further east he came across the Black man. They are indigenous to this country and we who have been here for 300 years must surely be recognized by the world as indigenous to South Africa. The Whites, however, or rather my dear friends in Natal, imported the Indian to come to work in the plantations and the position gradually got out of hand and to-day the Indian controls Natal and the Transvaal and the Cape Province in parts as far as trade is concerned. Retail trade as well as wholesale trade is in his hands. Let me give an example. The silk trade&#x2014;and which lady does not like wearing silk&#x2014;is in the hands of the Indians. The fruit and vegetable trade is in the hands of Indians and I challenge anybody to get up and say I am wrong. A former mayor of Pretoria has just spoken. I am a producer. I have been to the Pretoria market and let me tell you what happens there, Sir. Vegetables or fruit come to the market. Nobody except the Indians bid for it. He takes the whole lot and distributes it as he wants to. The market master and the other White buyers are powerless against those closed ranks. [Interjections.] I have seen beautiful watermelons being sold for fourpence each and five minutes later they are sold for 5s. each. I repeat that throughout South Africa the markets are in the hands of that element and where do we find them? In the Transvaal, with the exception of two towns, we find them in the main streets of every town. In those two towns you only find them on the outskirts of the towns. [Laughter.] That hon. member laughs, but he laughs through sheer embarrassment, because he does not want that either. It gives offence to the Whites and to the non-Whites. I want to know whether that is a desirable state of affairs. We are not children in this House. Let us think about this matter. If the trade in respect of a certain commodity is in the hands of one race alone will the other races be satisfied with that? No, then you get what happened at Cato Manor. Exactly the same position obtains in Kenya. The position in Kenya to-day is that the shopkeepers, the men, are still there but the women and children have left because they expect the worst to happen the moment the Natives take over.

<p>I cannot say that the hon. the Minister has done much of his homework in the 12 months he has been the <span class="col_6385_6386" refersTo="page_0525"/>Minister. I have known the Minister for a long time and I honestly thought he would be able to do better than this. What does it all boil down to? It boils down to his saying: I am a link between X and Y; I have no influence with anyone, but I have appointed a committee with my friend Mr. Botha, and I have appointed one member of the committee and he has appointed one member, and that committee of two people will hear objections raised by the Indians and listen to their troubles and then we will see what can be done about it. Sir, there are 95 members on his staff. The sum involved is R2,800,000. And I am not even counting the Minister as one of the staff; he is the head. The Minister says he is a link, and he will not say that he has any influence in regard to this matter or that matter; there are laws dealing with those matters and it has nothing to do with him. But on this Vote there is the matter of education. However, the Minister is not the Minister of Indian Education and one whole facet of education he has not taken over.

<p>It seems to me that his capital expenditure comes from this Vote. The hon. the Minister nods his head; he agrees. The capital is defrayed from revenue, but the whole of the aspect of education other than university education and technical education the Minister does not have. He is not even the Minister of Indian Education. He is only partly the Minister of Indian Education, and otherwise he is just a link. I know his difficulty. I remember the Prime Minister not long ago saying in regard to unemployed Indians that that is not his responsibility. Nevertheless, and in spite of the fact that the Minister has to-night been, as the Scots call it, havering, he will not get down to grips. I do not know whether he knows his own portfolio. Just what purpose will he serve? Surely he will do more than appoint a committee of two people in 12 months when he is spending R2,800,000 and has this big staff? He must surely do something as the result of a policy he has enunciated. He is the Minister of Indian Affairs. Indians are entitled to go to him with their difficulties. It is no good the hon. member for Houghton trying to cross swords with the hon. the Minister of Transport, because he employs a whole lot of Indians. But wherever they may be employed, is this Minister going to say that they must go and see their own employer? Where does he fit into the scheme of things? It is true that he has taken over Social Welfare, which previously fell under another Department, but what is the Minister going to do? Let us try to get a clear policy now so that we will know precisely what path the Minister is following. If Indians come to him with complaints, what will he do? Will he send them to this committee of two men? The position is that we have this legislation and other Ministers like the Ministers for Housing and Community Development and Coloured Affairs and Bantu Administration have their laws on the Statute Book and they have their powers and they just go straight ahead, and if anyone gets in their way they get ploughed out of the road. But this Minister does not even have a plough. He can do nothing because he is hamstrung by the legislation of his own Government. I want the Minister to stand up and tell us where he will use the Indian in the scheme of things in South Africa, in the economic sphere? What part has the Indian to play? Never mind whether we like the Indian or not. Hon. members claim that this is one of our most difficult problems, but the Minister finds no difficulty; he simply says it is not his problem. If it is job reservation, it falls under the Minister of Labour. If it is marketing, it falls under the Minister of Agriculture. If it is residential matters, it falls under the Minister of Community Development. How can he be Minister of Indian Affairs under those circumstances? Surely he must have a goal he is aiming at; he must have an objective. He must not grouse because the Indians pay tribute to him in the Press and say they look upon him as a man with a sympathetic outlook. What he does is to say that the Press is telling lies. The Indians are trying to play along with him, but the Minister repudiates them. Where do they go? I hope the Minister will be brave. He must not run away from his portfolio. Let him stand up and say: I am the champion of the Indian in South Africa and I will do my best for him. But the Minister is bashful. He will slink out of the Chamber in two minutes if we are not careful. I hope he will be bold. Let us have some of this &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D; we have heard so much about.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has referred to the hon. the Minister as the liaison Minister. I do not think that is the way in which we in South Africa will solve this extremely difficult problem. I do not even want to talk about the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). She referred to the hon. the Minister as the missing link. The trouble with the hon. member is that she is continually travelling through the air in a vacuum in a weightless state and she has no hope of ever again putting her feet onto political soil. I think the hon. member for South Coast, indeed every member from Natal, realizes fully how difficult this problem is. The hon. member and his party also made mistakes in connection with the Indian problem but I am not reproaching them. Even the National Party was wrong when they thought they could repatriate the Indians. [Interjections.] I think the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) should listen to what I am saying. He has never yet tackled the racial problem seriously. As far as the Indian problem is concerned he should rather remain silent and leave it to the Natal members on his side. I say we have all made a mistake <span class="col_6387_6388" refersTo="page_0526"/>in regard to the Indians and this is not the time to reproach one another for mistakes that were made in the past; we should look at the problem as it presents itself and realize that politics is the science of what is possible. It is no good trying to apply anything impossible. Even in a race federation the Indians will continue to be a problem because they differ so widely from the other races in South Africa. The Bantu, the Coloured and the White are indigenous to South Africa. They have an outlook on life which you recognize immediately but the Indian has a totally different outlook on life.</p>

<p>A second aspect which we should always bear in mind is the fact that a large section of the Indian population still regard India as their fatherland. They are still prepared&#x2014;I do not say all of them but a great many of them &#x2014;to receive guidance and advice from India. Thirdly, we are faced with this problem that the Indian Prime Minister, Mr. Nehru, not long ago publicly issued instructions to the Indians in South Africa that the only way they could justify their presence in South Africa was to make common cause with the Bantu and many Indians listened to him. I will not be surprised to find that many Indians in South Africa hope that if they make common cause with the Bantu agitators that will lead to their salvation. All these are problems which we have to face up to.</p>

<p>What is our task? Is our task to try to steal a march on each other? That will not get us any further. That will not help us in finding a solution for the Indian problem. In the first place we have to see to it that we follow a course, as far as the Indians are concerned, which will fit into the traditional apartheid policy of South Africa and if we do not do that we are looking for trouble because that race does not fit in with the Whites. The hon. member for South Coast knows that as well as I do. Nor does he fit in with the Bantu and the Bantu will never absorb him, nor does he fit in with the Coloureds. The first thing we have to do is to make sure that we choose a course as far as the Indian is concerned which fits in with our apartheid pattern. Unless we do that we are heading for trouble.</p>

<p>The second task which rests on our shoulders is to ensure that through goodwill on our part&#x2014;and it will take a long time before the Indian realizes that the White man is well-disposed towards him&#x2014;we wean the Indian completely from his fatherland. If he wants to be a citizen of this country and enjoy the privileges of citizenship it is essential for the Indian to become weaned from his fatherland. Thirdly, we must get them to realize that the direction indicated to them by Nehru will lead to their own destruction, because we know, and the hon. member for South Coast knows this as well as I do, that if they have to join forces with the Bantu it will only be for the time being and the one to suffer will be the Indian as happened in 1948. That feeling against the Indian is still there. We must get the Indian to realize that the road indicated to them by Nehru will lead to his own destruction. I want to tell the Indians to-night that the sooner they get rid of the idea of making common cause with the Bantu agitators, the better will it be for them. They should rather apply all their mental power and financial ability to the well-being and welfare of the Indian population itself. That is not the task of the National Party alone. That task also rests on the shoulders of the United Party and on every White man in South Africa. It is no good our trying to steal a march on one another and to try to belittle the Minister. I do not envy him his task. The hon. member for South Coast knows it is a difficult task to gain the confidence of the Indian and to place him on the right road. The handling of the Bantu or of the Coloured is child&#x2019;s play in comparison with the handling of the Indian. I want to appeal to hon. members to give the hon. the Minister a chance and to give the Government a chance. The hon. member for South Coast says I must be brave and indicate a course immediately but you can easily make a mistake which you cannot remedy later on.</p>

The hon. member for South Coast, in particular, has made mistakes, but I do not hold that against him because that will get us nowhere. I do think, however, we have the right to appeal to the hon. member not to make belittling remarks about the Minister and the Government and to ask us to adopt a course hastily so that we can make mistakes over which they can gloat later on, because that will not get us anywhere, If the hon. member for South Coast and his party want to be brave there is only one moral thing they can do and that is to say to the Minister and the Government: You have our sympathy where you are honestly trying to solve this problem in a peaceful way.</p>

<p>I should like to say immediately that the hon. member who has just sat down reminds me of Rip van Winkle, but I am glad to see that apparently the Government is beginning to wake up. Hon. members like the hon. member for Vereeniging have referred to the question of repatriation, but they have known for years that it is impossible. This gentlemen&#x2019;s agreement goes back to 1922, and in 1927 Dr. Malan also indicated that something would be done about the matter, but it does not help us to go back to those days. The previous Government attempted to meet this <span class="col_6389_6390" refersTo="page_0527"/>position, but they got no assistance from hon. members opposite. There was recognition of the fact that the Indian population is permanently in this country, and it is a fact we must face up to. I had hoped that when the Government passed the Citizenship Act nearly 15 years ago and recognized the Indians as South African citizens they had woken up, but I would like to express my disappointment that after the Minister has studied this matter for a year he has come before this House to-night with nothing of any consequence at all. One had hoped that there was going to be an attempt to deal with one of the most difficult problems we have, but quite clearly the Government has been anything but &#x201C;kragdadig&#x201D; about it. They do not seem to have made the slightest progress. The Minister&#x2019;s reply to the hon. member for South Coast is one of the most disappointing replies I have heard in this House. Other hon. members have raised the question of Indian businesses, but I do not know whether it is in order to discuss it, but in passing I want to say that the Government ought to face up to this question, because the air of uncertainty in which the Indians have been left is something which does South Africa no credit at all. I sincerely hope that now that there is a Minister, even though he seems to have very little power, he will see to it that something is done to relieve the state of uncertainty which has existed all too long. This is a matter of very serious importance for this country and I say that the Government is simply not facing up to it in a realistic way, judging by the speech of the hon. the Minister and other hon. members opposite. I say that in the interest of South Africa the Minister ought to take this matter to the Cabinet and ask the Government, in the interest of the good name of South Africa, to face up to this question and to deal with it and to come before this House with a realistic statement of policy.

<p>I am surprised, not at the mouthpiece of the Transvaal Indian Congress whom we have here in the person of the hon. member for Houghton, but at the speeches of the hon member for South Coast and the hon. member for Germiston (District). Let me first deal briefly with the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>All she did this evening was to give further publicity to the generalities, the vague unproven and propagandistic statements of the Transvaal Indian Congress.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must not make stupid interjections. Of course a large number will have to be moved. In any case, the future of certain areas in Johannesburg still have to be determined. Final decisions have not yet been come to in connection with a number of these matters. The Transvaal Indian Congress, however, take it that every one of them will have to move. That is a complete misrepresentation.</p>

<p>The same applies in the case of the hon. member&#x2019;s reference to job reservation. In this regard I want to say that the job reservation determinations made in terms of the relevant Act by the Department of Labour as far as the Indians are concerned have so far only been to the benefit of the Indians. The Indians have not suffered as a result of a single job reservation determination. I challenge the hon. member to mention one instance where an Indian has lost his job as a result of job reservation. At the same time I want to challenge the hon. member to prove that it has not been job reservation which has protected the Indian in Natal in the refreshment trade. I challenge her to prove that throughout they are not protected against being ousted by the Bantu. But in that case she will again plead for the right of the Bantu to enter that trade. She wants her bread buttered on both sides.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>As I have said not a single Indian has lost his job as a result of job reservation. Let me take the building industry in Natal in this connection. The quota which is reserved in the building industry for the Indians in Natal is so high that not a single Indian need lose his job. We went even further and exempted all proclaimed Indian areas from the provisions in regard to job reservation. In other words, in the developing Indian areas an unlimited number of Indians can be employed in the building industry.</p>

<p>That is why I say that job reservation has not so far caused a single Indian to become unemployed. On the contrary, regulations have been issued in this regard which have been to the advantage of the Indians. I do not think it is necessary for me to react to the stupid remarks of the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Natal (South Coast) and the hon. member for Germiston (District). The fact that they wanted the House to believe that I was supposed to have said that I and my Department had done nothing else than to appoint a two-man fact-finding committee was nothing else than a misrepresentation of what I had said earlier. The appointment of the fact-finding committee was one of the things which resulted from a discussion which took place on a certain occasion between the Indians and myself. In the course of my remarks I also drew attention to the gigantic task which had been undertaken on <span class="col_6391_6392" refersTo="page_0528"/>the initiative of my Department, namely, a broad socio-economic survey as far as the Indians were concerned. This is only one of the tasks which we have undertaken. I referred to the fact that the officials of my Department acted as liaison officers between the Department and the various chambers of trade and commerce, municipalities and other bodies with the object of providing employment for Indians. I may add that their work has been very fruitful and has yielded good results. The work that they are doing is also appreciated. As a matter of fact, it seems to me that the Indians are more appreciative of the work we are doing than the hon. member for South Coast. Wherever I have met Indians in Durban, Johannesburg or Pretoria they have expressed their appreciation to me for what the Department has already done for them simply by working in co-operation with other Departments. Hon members must consider this fact that other Departments do not always view the broad problem against the background of the peculiarly difficult position in which the Indians are. That is where the task of my Department lies, namely, to bring the particular problem which faces the Indians, as it fits into the wider set-up of things, to the notice of the various Departments. And that is also what we are doing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>But what did you do?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I say we are acting as a liaison with good results. Let me refer to another sphere. Last year I referred to the fact that Indians, although they had the necessary capital, did not always have the opportunity to invest that capital. As a result of representations which we made in this connection, an inter-departmental committee was appointed to investigate the question of establishing industries for Indians. The Ministers concerned will in due course make announcements in this connection. We have, however, made very good progress in this matter due to the investigations made by the officials of my Department.</p>

<p>Then we have the problem in connection with the development of residential areas for the Indians. There we are likewise faced with problems connected with transport and the obtaining of all kinds of licences, etc. It is the duty of the officials of my Department to see to it that the Indians enjoy those privileges to which they can justly lay claim. This task has been undertaken with very great success.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of Indian education and I want to ask the hon. member for South Coast, who so boldly called me a pseudo Minister of Indian Education this evening, to be equally bold and to answer the following question: He knows as well as I do what a big chunk of the finances of the Province of Natal goes into Indian education. He also knows that it is a heavy burden on the taxpayers of Natal because the number of Indians who have to be educated is very big in relation to the number of taxpayers in the province. Personally I am of the opinion that purely for financial reasons it should be the task of the country as a whole to provide for the education of the Indians. It should not be the task of the taxpayers of Natal alone. I am therefore also prepared to be a full Minister of Education for the Indians. Will the hon. member support me if I ask for it? Will he get his province to support me if I make that request? Or will he again make a political issue of the matter?</p>

<p>If the hon. member will support me and assist me in getting the Indians to realize that it is in their own interests that that be done, I give him my word that I shall ask for it to be transferred. But then the hon. member must promise me these two things: Firstly, the support of his party in regard to the transfer and, secondly, to put the matter in the right perspective as far as the Indians themselves are concerned. If he gives me an assurance on these two points, I give him my word of honour that I shall take Indian education over. But he will not do so because he wants to wait for me to decide so that they can exploit it for all sorts of propaganda purposes.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not running away. I am prepared to take Indian education over as a whole. I have already been requested by a certain Indian teachers&#x2019; association to do so. There has also been a similar request by various Indian groups. I also know that there is a strong feeling amongst certain Whites in Natal for the Central Government to take Indian education over. Do not let us be petty in regard to this matter. I think it is in the interests of both the Whites and the Indians in Natal that more attention be paid to Indian education than is paid by the province to-day with its limited resources. There are this and other conditions to which the hon. member must agree.</p>

<p>We must, however, bear in mind the malicious propaganda which can be made out of it if we were to take such a step. Will the hon. member for South Coast now give me the assurance I have asked for? Can I prepare the necessary legislation during the recess with a view to introducing it next year? I shall do <span class="col_6393_6394" refersTo="page_0529"/>that if the hon. member will promise me his party&#x2019;s support so as to remove any misrepresentation which may exist.&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_indian_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has provoked me. He said I was only a pseudo-Minister of Education. He wanted to know why I was only taking university and technical education over and not the rest. I am now telling him that I am prepared to take the rest over as well; he must only assist me, not in my own interests or in the interests of the National Party, but in the interests of this important matter and in the interests of the good name of South Africa. It is the duty of every one of us, whether we sit on this or on that side, to establish good relations between White and non-White. He must assist in removing any distrust which may exist. I am even prepared to have discussions with his party as to the manner in which it should be taken over.</p>

<p>Will the hon. member now assist me to do so without it causing a terrific political hullabaloo, because that is the only thing which deters me. I think it is in the interests of everybody that Indian education be taken over but so many incorrect things are said about South Africa that we must go slowly. If he makes me that offer, however, I shall be prepared to take immediate steps to carry out my side of the undertaking.</p>

<p>I hope hon. members realize that during the short time my Department has been in existence it has done a tremendous amount to assist Indian communities in various directions. From the nature of things we are faced with problems which call for thorough investigation before a solution can be offered. For the first time in the history of the Indians in South Africa proper investigations are being conducted. Surely it is necessary first of all to conduct proper investigations before you can come to a proper decision. That is exactly what my Department has been doing and is still doing with a great measure of success. Let me tell the hon. member this that with the few officials at our disposal we have created such a measure of goodwill amongst the Indian communities that it is to the great credit of that small group of men. If I personally have not done anything, as alleged by the hon. member, my officials at least have done a tremendous amount to assist Indians with the practical problems which face them. To try to belittle their work by attacking me is unfair towards those officials. These officials work much longer hours than they are expected to work. Their heart and soul are in this work and they have made it their life&#x2019;s task. In this respect I wish to pay tribute to the Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs. As a result of his work his health has suffered to such an extent that he has to spend a number of months in hospital. We wish him a speedy recovery. He and his officials do a tremendous amount of work and it is unfair towards them to belittle their work by attacking me.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister seems to have been upset because he says this side of the House has belittled his Department and himself. But this is not what we did. On the contrary. Throughout this debate we have tried to find out from the Minister what the functions of his Department are. But we have not yet had a clear answer, despite the fact that the Minister has participated in the debate at least three times. All that we have had so far from the Minister is that his Department forms a link with the other Departments, or, as he put it himself on another occasion, that it forms a mouthpiece for the Indians. Now, if this is to be the only function of the Department of Indian Affairs then I submit there can be no justification for the large expenditure by his Department in this connection. The Indian community can just as well go to the other Departments direct. They can just as well approach the other Departments themselves&#x2014; for instance, the Department of Community Development, the Department of Labour, the Department of Housing and others. There is absolutely no justification for a separate Department if that is to be its sole function.</p>

<p>Moreover, I find the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statements in this matter most extraordinary in the light of the statements he made last year in the Other Place as well as in this House. I want to read from the statement the hon. the Minister made in the Other Place and I do so because when he spoke on his Vote in this House he said specifically that he was not going into detail again in view of the full statement he had made in the Other Place. In regard to the functions of the Department of Indian Affairs he said the following on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A further task which the Department has is the special attention which will have to be given to the economic and social development of the Indian community.</block>

<p>He proceeded to say how impressed he had been by the particular problems and requirements of the Indian community. He then dealt at length with the problems of the Indian community&#x2014;problems arising out of the implementation of the Group Areas Act, the problem of unemployment, of housing, etc. With these matters he dealt at length. Now, what object was there in dealing with these matters at all or of dealing with them at such length if his Department was not responsible for them?</p>

<p>Again in this House, on 17 May 1962, the hon. the Minister, according to col. 5815 of his Hansard speech, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Department has been charged with the implementation of all existing legislation as far as it affects the Indians directly.</block>

<p><span class="col_6395_6396" refersTo="page_0530"/>In col. 5818 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Department is also giving particular attention to the whole social and economic position of the Indians.</block>

<p>He then said that a socio-economic survey was being conducted by the University College for Indians in co-operation with the Department of Labour and at top of col. 5819 he gave us the reason for that, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This is something which we must do. We must create more employment opportunities for Indians.</block>

<p>Now, if these are the tasks of the Department of Indian Affairs then surely they are also the responsibility of that Department even though the responsibility may be shared with other Government Departments, otherwise I fail to see what the objects of this Department are.</p>

<p>I wish to deal particularly with the problem of unemployment amongst the Indian community in Durban. Last year the Minister said that he appreciated that there was serious unemployment amongst Indians in Durban. He went so far as to say that according to some estimates the number of unemployed Indians was as high as 25,000. He added that the matter was being investigated by his Department. Since then the survey to which the hon. member for Pinetown referred has been published. This survey, which is both extensive and reliable, will, I hope, contribute to a better appreciation of the problem and will help to solve it. At any rate, according to this survey there are at present 15,000 unemployed workseekers amongst the Indians in Durban. This is an appalling waste of human resources. Part of the responsibility of finding work for these people rests on the Government, and here we would like to know what particular Department is responsible in this matter. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat is a very courteous member and therefore I would very much have liked to reply to what he said. This, however, I am unable to do as I do not realize exactly what it was he wanted to say.</p>

<p>I want to refer to what was said by the hon. member for Germiston (District). He appears to think it was scandalous that the National Party decided that repatriation would be an impossible task. But the fact is that the National Party came to this conclusion more or less at the same time that his party did! I remember that in the days when I was still a member of the United Party repatriation was our policy. Hon. members will find that up to 1946 General Smuts&#x2019;s laws still made provision of R100 or more to be given to any Indian who wanted to leave the country, as well as a free passage. Eventually that party also realized that repatriation was an impossible task.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Natal South Coast tried to be facetious in this regard. He referred to the Department of Indian Affairs as a liaison Ministry, and as a Department which does not know what its duties entail, and so forth. The fact, however, is that every Government in this country has been reluctant to tackle the Indian problem. The hon. member was for quite a while the Administrator of Natal. During that time, what did he do in connection with the Indian problem?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hon_members">

<from><person refersTo="hansard_za">*HON. MEMBERS</person>:</from>

<p>Nothing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>What did he do for the Indians when he was the Administrator of Natal? Nothing, except to try to remove them from the municipal voters&#x2019; roll. But as far as the United Party itself is concerned: What did they do in regard to the Indians? The first step they took in this regard was, in 1946, in connection with the so-called &#x201C;Pegging Act&#x201D;. When that Act was passed by this House in 1946, all the members for Natal walked out because they would not vote for it. The hon. member for Natal South Coast was not here yet. At that time he was still the Administrator. It was only later that he became a member, in the fond hope of becoming a Minister. But he was mistaken! But the Natal members on that occasion walked out because they felt that too much was being done for the Indians. In terms of that legislation, General Smuts limited Indians to certain areas and offered them two Senators, three members in the Assembly and two members in the Provincial Council of Natal. What happened to that overture? Why did the Indians not get that representation? Because they refused to accept it. General Smuts was unable even to succeed in getting a voters&#x2019; roll drawn up for them. The Indians simply refused to co-operate. The hon. member for South Coasts knows how they marched through the streets of Pietermaritzburg, Johannesburg and Durban with placards saying: &#x201C;Reject this Ghetto Act!&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p><span class="col_6397_6398" refersTo="page_0531"/>The hon. member now asks what our policy is. I will now enlighten him in that regard. The establishment by this Government of a Department of Indian Affairs is the first constructive attempt that has been made to cope with the problem. It is the first serious attempt that has been made in this connection. The Opposition, on the other hand, has not the faintest idea as to how they would handle the matter. The furthest they are now prepared to go is to say that if they get into power they will consult with the Indians to see what they will be able to do.</p>

<p>I am not ashamed of that concept. It is the only way in which this problem can be solved. The establishment of this Department is on the same basis as the establishment of the Department of Coloured Affairs. This Department has just as little to do with work reservation and group areas as the Department of Indian Affairs, but is there to-day a single member opposite who is prepared to say that the Department of Coloured Affairs is not becoming a great success? Is any one of them prepared to say that they would like to do away with the Department of Coloured Affairs? The fact is that the Minister of Coloured Affairs has within a very short period succeeded in extending this Department into one which enjoys the enthusiastic regard of not only the Whites, but the Coloureds as well, because here one is dealing with an indigenous population group. That is why that Department is becoming the pride of the Coloureds. The Coloured Advisory Council is in the same way busy developing into a full-fledged legislative body.</p>
