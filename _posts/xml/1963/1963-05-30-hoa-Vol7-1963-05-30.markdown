<p>I do not want to object to the introduction of the Bill at this stage. All I want to ask is whether the hon. the Minister will reassure those of us who do not feel happy about this Bill. After the Bill appeared in the <i>Government Gazette</i> in April, certain rumours were circulated in the Press and outside&#x2014;I understand that the newspapers this morning also contained reports to this effect&#x2014;that the original Bill had been changed. We do not know whether these reports are correct or not. That is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will give those people who are interested in this matter&#x2014;and there are more of them than he imagines&#x2014;the opportunity to study the Bill carefully so that they can frame amendments if necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in connection with the questions put to me by the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop), I want to inform the House that after this Bill was published all interested bodies had the opportunity of making representations. They made use of that opportunity and they did make representations and as the result of that a considerable number of changes were made in the Bill; that is to say, the Bill which is now being introduced differs in some respects from the Bill as originally published. Because I am not the Leader of the House, I cannot give the hon. member the assurance that he wants from me, but I take it that the hon. the Leader of the House will bear in mind the request of the hon. member for Mossel Bay.</p>

<p>First Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Patents Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill has already been introduced in the Other Place in the beginning of the Session, but was withdrawn during the second reading after representations were received from the Institute of Patent Agents. The proposed amendments in the Bill envisage in the first place the amendment of the present legal provisions in regard to the appointment of an Acting Commissioner of Patents. Although the present Act provides for acting appointments in the post of Commissioner of Patents, it does not cover cases where such posts fall vacant as the result of the demise of commissioners. Acting appointments recently had to be made on the demise on 5 February 1963 of Advocate Retief, who served as Commissioner of Patents. In order to legalize this appointment, and also to cover similar incidents in future, the amendments contained in Clauses 1 (1) and 1 (2) are being proposed. The object of Clause 2 (1) of this Bill is to prohibit the public and agents from making copies of patent documents in the Patents Office by means of photostatic and similar machinery. Section 69 of the Patents Act, No. 37 of 1952, makes provision for access by the public to patent documents, and in terms of Section 70 any person may demand copies of such documents on payment of a reasonable fee. The fees are very low&#x2014; it is at present 15c per page for a photostatic copy. About three years ago these provisions in the Act were interpreted by the Appeal Court as meaning that the public are allowed to make copies of documents themselves by means of photostatic and other machinery. At the moment there are four such machines in the office, facilities and electricity for which are made available, and it may be that appreciably more of these machines will be introduced there by private organizations. That is obviously an undesirable practice.</p>

<p>In order to make copies of patent specifications which are bound together, those documents must be taken apart; the particular page of which a copy has to be made is detached and it is then handed over to private clerks. From the very nature of the matter it is impossible to keep proper supervision over such persons. They sit in a corner of the office where this work is done and thereafter they themselves collate the documents again and hand them back to the Patents Office. These are important documents which ought not to get into the hands of private persons in this way. I think hon. members will agree with me that steps should be taken to put a stop to this practice.</p>

<p>The patent agents objected to this on two grounds. The first was based on the decision of the Appeal Court. That Court decided that although it is not contained in the Act, the tight to have access also includes the right to make copies. It is not the intention of the Bill to prohibit the public from scrutinizing these <span class="col_6963_6964" refersTo="page_0814"/>documents and at the same time to make notes. Facilities for this purpose and the right to do so have been in existence for many years already. The object of the Bill is, as I have already stated, merely to prohibit the use of machines for this purpose, and furthermore it will also enable the Patents Office to make photostatic copies and to supply them to any applicant, as was the real intention of the Act.</p>

<p>I come now to the second objection raised by the patent agents. They allege that the Patents Office will not be able timeously to deliver the copies applied for. In this regard funds have already been made available in the Estimates for the purchase of three more machines, and staff will be trained for this purpose. It is for this very reason that the Registrar of Patents requested that this Act should only come into operation after promulgation. That may mean a delay of approximately three months, but it is clear that the necessary apparatus cannot be acquired until such time as this measure has been passed.</p>

<p>I may add that the Patents Office has been doing this type of work for years already, but if it now also has to do the work which is at present being done by the agents, extra machines and staff will be required. I have been informed that if all this work is done by the Patents Office it will probably be cheaper for applicants than is the case at present. It is not the object to make any profits out of the supply of these copies, and if it is found that the cost is lower than the fees charged at present, the tariffs will be amended accordingly.</p>

<p>This amending Bill is acceptable to this side of the House for the reasons advanced by the hon. the Deputy Minister but we would like to move that the prohibition in Clause 2 should not be an absolute prohibition. I refer to the prohibition against the making of copies by mechanical means. At the Committee Stage we will move an amendment to the effect that in order to avoid delays in certain cases the Registrar should be given the discretion to grant the necessary permission for copies to be made in the Patents Office by outside bodies, and we hope that this amendment will be acceptable. I think that the hon. the Minister is already aware of the amendments that we intend moving at the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to make it quite clear at the outset that I accept the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s explanation and I have no quarrel with the first amendment to Section 4 of the Patents Act, 1952. The substitution, I accept, is merely an extension of the existing sections of the Patents Act, and it is necessary to insert it to cover the position when the Commissioner is precluded from doing his work owing to illness or if he should die, as happened in this case. When the late Commissioner died there was no provision in the section for a temporary appointment, and this amendment is necessary therefore to legalize the position. I would like to say, however, that I am very seriously concerned about the principle involved in the second portion of the proposed amendment. May I say that in the original Bill the established rights of the public to view and to take notes of documents in the Patents Office were entirely removed in the original amendment, which was withdrawn by the Deputy Minister in the Other Place. The original amendment entirely removed these rights of the public, and so were the established rights of patent agents to make copies by way of photostat machines of all documents and patent specifications in the Patents Office in Pretoria. This right, as the Deputy Minister has said, was incorporated in Section 69 of the Patents Act, 1952, which allowed the public to copy documents in the Patents Office in Pretoria. I would also like to emphasize very strongly here that this right is incorporated in the Deeds Registries Act, No. 47 of 1937, which deals with the inspection of records and the supply of information and allows the public to copy documents in the Deeds Office. I wish to draw the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that these wide implications will not interfere in any way with other Acts. Has the Deputy Minister consulted with the Side Bar and the Law Societies; has he taken into consideration the precedent that the insertion of this clause will create? The second point that I wish to emphasize is that the patent agents themselves only installed their machines to make copies of patent specifications when it took a long time to have such copies made in the Patents Office in Pretoria itself. Here I would like to stress the reason why patent agents have to have their copies with as little delay as possible. The situation in South Africa as far as patent rights are concerned is that our patent agents have helped to build up goodwill and foreign trade to a certain extent between South Africa and countries abroad. Documents are sent to South Africa because the patent laws here involve the least delay. In the United Kingdom it takes three to four years to register patents; in the U.S.A. it takes three to four years or longer, and here in South Africa it usually takes a maximum of 18 months. When inventions are patented in South Africa only a period of three months is allowed in which objections may be lodged against the registration of that patent. It is essential therefore that the patent agents should be able to get copies immediately so that they can send them back to those clients who have applied for copies. That is one of the main reasons why the patent agents felt that they had to provide their own services. Copies of patent specifications are also required for general information to enable a person to protect his position when a patentee has threatened to sue him or has instituted infringement proceedings against him. The right of the public to take their own notes is of great value in the patent world. If the proposed original amendment <span class="col_6965_6966" refersTo="page_0815"/>which the Deputy Minister introduced in the Other Place had gone through, it would have meant that the public would have been precluded from making copies and would have been forced to incur heavy expenditure sometimes. It is of great importance that copies should be made available with as little delay as possible. For example, a farmer might very innocently build some equipment for himself. He is then sued or he is threatened with prosecution for an infringement of the Act. If the original amendment had become law then he would not simply have been able to go to the Patents Office and make a copy of the patent in question; he would have been forced to order a copy and wait until he could get a photostat copy sent to him by the office in Pretoria. I feel that the present amendment is a great improvement on the original one which was introduced in the Other Place and then subsequently withdrawn. Under this amendment the rights of the public are still guaranteed. They will still be able to take notes, but they will not be able to utilize mechanical means in copying these documents. I appreciate that in the past there may have been some difficulties between the Department and those firms which install their own machines, firstly because their clerks cluttered up the office and secondly because having extracted documents from files which sometimes contain 600 documents, they may have failed to replace them. Some of these difficulties were perhaps attributable to the firms which installed the machines; others may have been due to the Department itself. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether the improvements which he has outlined in his second-reading speech can be instituted immediately. I understand that the Estimates provide for the acquisition of three additional machines for this office. At the moment there are three machines in use, one copyright machine and two photostat machines. Will the Minister be able to provide at the same cost the same service which the agents who installed their own machines were providing themselves? Or does the hon. the Deputy Minister propose to institute the same type of service which they have in Canada where 25 copies of every patent document are made immediately the document comes into the office and then kept in the file so that interested parties can buy them without delay? I would like to recommend this system to the hon. the Deputy Minister. I feel that it would have great advantages. The only point that I can see against it is that there might be a wastage in respect of patent specifications which might not be required again. This system is used not only in Canada but in six other major countries in the world to-day and I would seriously commend this system for the consideration of the hon. the Deputy Minister, because the main concern of the patent agents themselves is speed and efficiency of service to their clients at a low cost. If sufficient photostat machines and copyright machines are installed and if there is sufficient clerical staff in the Patents Office in Pretoria, then there will be no necessity for the practitioners to install their own machines. If the extended service which was outlined by the Minister in his speech cannot be provided then in order to safeguard the rights of the general public and of the practitioners, I intend in the Committee Stage to put forward a further amendment which will provide that if through circumstances beyond his control or through extraordinary circumstances the Registrar is unable to furnish the required copies without undue delay, he may at his discretion permit any person to make the necessary copies by mechanical means. Delays might well be caused through a shortage of personnel, through a shortage of photostat paper which has to be imported from overseas or perhaps through a breakdown of the machines, and in those circumstances the Registrar would then have the discretion under the proposed amendment to allow mechanical means to be used by the practitioners. I would commend this amendment to the hon. the Deputy Minister for his very serious consideration, and with the addition of such an amendment this clause would then be acceptable to us.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss), after having had an interview with the Registrar, consulted me in regard to the proposed amendment, and I then already indicated that we would accept the amendment which would be moved in the Committee Stage. The hon. member also asked whether a similar provision should not apply to other Departments also in regard to the making of copies. The position is that a similar right exists in the Deeds Offices, the Master&#x2019;s Office and also in the Supreme Court. The right already exists to peruse documents and to make copies in those offices. As far as I know, it has never happened in any of those Departments that attorneys have installed a photostat apparatus there to make their own copies. Copies are available on demand and on payment of a small fee. In the Patents Office matters unfortunately went further in regard to the installation of photostat machines. This amendment has reference only to the Patents Office; it has nothing to do with the other offices. In fact, most of the other offices where the same procedure is followed do not fall under this Department, and I am not aware that any problems arose there similar to those which arose in the Patents Office.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of the speedy delivery of copies. It is clear that patent agents often hurriedly have to make copies of the necessary documents, and that is the very reason why we want to make provision for the installation of three additional machines. They will then replace the four machines belonging to private organizations. These three additional machines will have a greater capacity than the other four which are used only by the agents concerned: there are <span class="col_6967_6968" refersTo="page_0816"/>times when they are not in use, whereas these three machines which will be installed will be permanently and full time at the disposal of the Registrar. We therefore consider that the three additional machines will in fact meet the requirements. The cost is very low at the moment. We have proved that the fees which clients have to pay to patent agents for copies made by them are much higher than the fees they would have paid had they obtained the copies directly from the Department.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the practice in other countries, namely to make copies of a patent simultaneously with its registration. The Registrar is busy investigating the possibility of simultaneously with the registration immediately to make a number of copies which can then be issued practically on demand against payment of the fee fixed. That will save time in regard to the issue of copies, but it will perhaps, as the hon. member herself said, lead to wasted costs, and those wasted costs will have to be recouped by increasing the present fee. I have already indicated that there will perhaps be a reduction in the fee if copies are made on a large scale, but the whole question of the making of a large number of copies which will then be available on demand is already being investigated by the Department, and I hope it will be done if it is in any way possible to do so.</p>

<heading>TRADE MARKS BILL</heading>

<p>Second Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Trade Marks Bill.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>I am convinced hon. members will welcome the introduction of this Bill. The existing Act has been on the Statute Book since 1916 and has become obsolete in so many respects that it no longer complies with present-day requirements. With a view to remedying this undesirable state of affairs a special committee was appointed approximately two years ago to revise, amend where necessary and to consolidate the existing Act as a whole. That committee consisted of the Registrar of Trade Marks as Chairman, the Deputy Registrar of Trade Marks, a representative of the Bar Council of South Africa, a representative of the South African Law Society, and two representatives of the South Africa Institute of Patent Agents.</p>

<p>The matter was widely publicized and various patent agents, the Federation of British Industries, the industrial section of the Board of Industry of the United Kingdom, the Associated Chambers of Commerce of South Africa, the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut and the Institute of Patent Agents in Britain submitted memoranda and comment. The representations submitted to the departmental committee were thoroughly and sympathetically considered and I believe there will be little or no objection to the Bill in its present from.</p>

<p>A great many of the existing legal provisions are retained in the proposed Bill although in an improved form while it contains a number of new principles. I shall refer to the most important of these new principles. In Clause 2 (1) the word &#x201C;trade mark&#x201D; which is the corner stone of this legislation is defined more clearly. The peculiar characteristic of a trade mark is that it does not only show the origin of a particular article but also the difference between the same type of article manufactured by one person from that manufactured by another person. The committee which went into this matter was of the opinion that &#x201C;origin&#x201D; was not as important as &#x201C;quality&#x201D;. The public in general is more concerned about the last-mentioned and when they buy they buy an articles with a trade mark known for its quality. The proposed definition makes these aspects clearer without, however, subordinating &#x201C;origin&#x201D; to &#x201C;quality&#x201D;. Furthermore in the existing Act the definition of &#x201C;trade mark&#x201D; is limited to origin alone whereas the proposed new definition puts it wider so that &#x201C;trade mark&#x201D; can also indicate quality.</p>

<p>Clauses 8 and 9 contain new provisions which have not existed in the past and their object is to limit the right of people, except attorneys and qualified patent agents, who may appear before the Registrar on behalf of other persons in this sense that such persons must have practised continuously on their own or must have been in the employ as trade mark agents of a firm practising as such for a period of at least two years prior to 1 January 1964. The provisions of this Bill have already been known generally since 1 January 1961 and those people who want to start to practise as trade mark agents or attorneys in this respect after 1 January 1964 will therefore have sufficient time to comply with all the necessary requirements. The motive is obvious, namely the elimination of charlatans, but anybody is still at liberty to state his own case to the Registrar.</p>

<p>Clause 10 lays down the requirements for the registration of a trade mark, as for example the name of the company, a coined word, signature, etc. What is of particular importance is the fact that provision is made for the registration of a distinctive container. The Committee investigated and discussed this matter very thoroughly and came to the conclusion that it was desirable to make provision for the registration of distinctive containers as trade marks. Overseas countries have come to the same conclusion. What we have in mind here, for example, are bottles of a special design for perfumes. Provision is, however, made that such a registration will not prevent an art of industry from concentrating on the creation of containers of the shape concerned. This clause also provides that the applicant will <span class="col_6969_6970" refersTo="page_0817"/>have a choice either of applying to court or to the Registrar to have a trade mark of this nature cancelled. The Registrar is, therefore, given parallel jurisdiction and the main object is to cut down the work of the courts and to reduce the legal costs to the applicant.</p>

<p>Clause 11 is a new clause and provides for a A and B register of trade marks. It is a requirement that trade marks for registration in the A register must be distinctive at date of application, while in the case of registration in the B register it must be of such a nature at the date of application that it can become distinctive, for example, a surname is not necessarily distinctive at a certain time, but it can become so through usage. Think of &#x201C;Mrs. Balls Chutney&#x201D; for example.</p>

<p>Clause 17 provides that the trade mark of one person cannot be registered in the name of somebody else as well and also that a new trade mark must not resemble an existing trade mark to such an extent that it may cause confusion or be misleading. The clause envisages, however, giving the Registrar jurisdiction, in a case of genuine simultaneous usage, to agree to it that identical trade marks or trade marks which are very similar in respect of the same or practically the same article may be used by more than one person subject to such provisos and conditions as the Registrar may impose. This too will cut down court work and costs.</p>

<p>Clause 19 is a new clause and its aim is to prevent a user of a certain trade mark which is registered with an open space in it which is obviously intended for the addition of additional marks in the form of words, designs, etc., from being used for marks which will change the character of the trade mark concerned.</p>

<p>The procedure to be followed in connection with the application for trade marks is laid down in Clause 20 and in this respect it gives the Registrar certain powers as well as the right to the applicant to appeal to court against a decision of the Registrar. These provisions are also contained in the existing Act but the wording in the proposed Bill has been improved.</p>

<p>Clause 23 is also a new clause. Provision is made in this clause for a parent company to have a trade mark registered in its name but to have it used by its subsidiaries. The reason for this is that a subsidiary company, although a legal person in its own rights, only serves the interests of the parent company and that it would not be right for a subsidiary company, instead of the parent company, to have a trade mark registered in its name. If that were possible practical difficulties would be experienced in cases where a parent company has a dozen or so subsidiary companies and where every one of these subsidiary companies has to be the registered holder of the same trade mark.</p>

<p>Clause 24 is a new clause. It only provides that an application for a trade mark should not be refused simply on the ground that the applicant himself will not use it. In such a case (a) he must satisfy the Registrar that he will cede the trade mark to a body corporate, and which is about to be registered at the date of the application, for use by that body or (b) his application must be accompanied by a further application for the registration of the name of the person whom he wants to allow to use the trade mark. This clause may appear drastic at first glance. In practice, however, it will facilitate matters much more than at present. The real object is that a person who wants to form a company, for example, can submit a trade mark while his company is still in the process of being formed so as to prevent somebody stealing a march on him by registering a similar trade mark. He must only satisfy the Registrar that he is indeed in the process of forming a company. In terms of the existing provisions a company must have been formed and registered before a trade mark can be registered.</p>

<p>Clause 28 is a new clause. Provision is made in this clause that in a court action where the registration of a trade mark is opposed the applicants will have the choice and may come to an agreement that it be heard either by a court or by the Registrar. Provision is made for a choice with the object of saving legal costs and time.</p>

<p>Provision is made in Clauses 32 and 33 for the Registrar himself or on the application of the user of a trade mark to make changes or improvements in the trade mark register. In terms of the existing Act the applicant must go to court, but now he applies to the Registrar himself with the right of appeal to the court. Changes and improvements to the register are also dealt with in Clause 33 but in this case it concerns applications by persons who feel aggrieved because of mistakes or omissions, etc., in the registration of trade marks. In this case the applicant will in future have a choice to apply either to the Registrar or to the court for such changes or improvements, whereas in terms of the existing Act he could only go to court.</p>

<p>I now come to Clause 35. Clause 20, <i>inter alia,</i> provides that the Registrar may accept a trade mark subject to certain conditions or provisos (for example: that it may only apply to goods of a specific nature or that it may only be used in certain areas, etc.). Clause 35 gives the Registrar or any aggrieved person the right, in the event of the holder of the trade mark contravening any of these conditions, to go to court. An aggrieved person may, however, if he chooses, put his case to the Registrar instead of going to court, but in terms of Clause 20 (6) such a person still has the right to appeal to the court. In terms of the existing Act he can only apply to court.</p>

<p>Provision is made in Clause 36 for the cancellation of trade marks on the application of an aggrieved person for the following two reasons: (a) that it was not the <i>bona fide</i> object of the applicant to use such a trade mark and that he did not in fact use it and (b) that no <i>bona fide</i> use has been made of the <span class="col_6971_6972" refersTo="page_0818"/>trade mark for a period of five years. In both cases the fact that the holder deliberately uses the trade mark within a period of a month from the date on which he has been notified of such an application for its cancellation is ignored. Without this provision the object of this provision would be nullified. According to this clause the aggrieved person will have a choice between applying to court or to the Registrar. In terms of the existing legislation he can only go to court. The clause also provides for the trade mark to be removed from the register on application if it appears that the person or company which holds it has died more than two years prior to the date of the application or has dissolved and that the trade mark was not ceded to anybody else. This provision is necessary in order to avoid embarrassment and delay in the event of new applications being made for the same trade mark by a person who is alive or by an existing company and the mark still appearing on the register in the name of the deceased person or defunct company.</p>

<p>Clause 41 is partly new. It provides that, if a trade mark consists of a word which is generally known to the public as the only practical word or description of an article or part of it or if it is used so generally in business by people trading in that article, it can no longer be regarded as a trade mark. In other words, the principle is being applied in trade mark practice that a word cannot be both the name and trade mark of an article. &#x201C;Linoleum&#x201D; was a trade mark at one time, but is no longer to-day. &#x201C;Vaseline&#x201D; is still a trade mark in South Africa but is not in many other countries.</p>

<p>Clauses 43 and 44 contain the rights of and the circumstances under which holders of a trade mark can take steps to prevent unauthorized use being made of their trade marks.</p>

<p>Clause 47 provides that a trade mark will be valid for ten years subject to the holder&#x2019;s right to have it renewed for further periods thereafter. In terms of the existing Act this period is 14 years. The reason for this is that in many instances it has been proved in practice that holders of trade marks no longer have any interest in the trade marks registered in their name long before the expiration of 14 years and in future the fact that the period of validity of trade marks is shortened will mean that the number of expired trade marks on the register will be considerably reduced.</p>

<p>Clause 49 is a somewhat amended version of Section 130 of the existing Act. Briefly it amounts to this that it will not be possible to cede a trade mark to a third party in circumstances which will lead to it that more than one person can use such a trade mark or one which is practically the same for the same article and furthermore that the same trade mark cannot be ceded or transferred to various persons in various areas. Or in the reverse, the clause provides that trade marks can be ceded or transferred while at the same time guarding against confusion and the misleading of the public.</p>

<p>Clause 53 is an important new clause. In terms of the existing Act it is only possible for a person to have a trade mark registered if he intends using it on the articles mentioned in his application. This means that he is powerless if somebody else uses the same mark on articles other than those in respect of which the mark has been registered. This clause will ensure, however, that such a holder of a trade mark will be able to have his mark registered in respect of goods on which he does not intend to use it provided he can satisfy the Registrar that if another person uses the relevant trade mark on those articles it will probably lead the public to believe that the articles emanate from him. Briefly the main object of this clause is to avoid misleading the public.</p>

<p>Clause 54 is a new clause. In terms of the existing Act the Registrar is obliged to hear all cases in Pretoria. In terms of the new clause he will be able to do so at other places as well provided he is of the opinion that it is in the interests of the parties concerned or for other justifiable reasons.</p>

<p>Clause 56 is also a new clause. It empowers the Registrar at any time prior to the registration of a trade mark to allow the documents before him in respect of an application or in respect of a case before him to be changed or to lay down such conditions in respect of costs as he may deem justifiable.</p>

<p>I now come to Clauses 63 to 69. Clause 63 is an amended and extended version of Section 137 of the existing Act, whereas Clauses 64 and 67 contain the same provisions which are contained in the existing Act to-day. Clauses 65, 66, 68 and 69 are new clauses. All these clauses deal with appeals against the decision of the Registrar and lay down the power of the court. As in the case of a provision in the Patents Act, Clause 63 (5) provides that parties may appeal direct to the Appeal Court against decisions of the Registrar. For the rest the clause is based on provisions which appear in existing legislation and does not really embrace any new principles.</p>

<p>Clause 75 is a new clause. In the past doubt has often been expressed whether the use of a trade mark in respect of goods which are only exported can be regarded as if the relevant trade mark is being used in South Africa for the purposes of the Trade Marks Act. This clause now states it very clearly that that is indeed the case and removes all doubts.</p>

<p>When the Bill was originally drafted paragraph (b) of sub-clause (1) of Clause 44 was included in the draft but after that the Committee met on three occasions and reconsidered this aspect and it has eventually been decided to delete this provision which extends the scope of an infringement action concerning goods in respect of which a mark is not registered. The reasons for the deletion of this paragraph were stated as follows by the departmental <span class="col_6973_6974" refersTo="page_0819"/>committee: &#x201C;Other persons in the trade are entitled to know the precise ambit of the statutory rights conferred by registration and that the proposed extension could only bring about a state of uncertainty.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It is, therefore, my intention to move the deletion of paragraph (b) of sub-clause (1) of Clause 44 when we come to the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Before I conclude I wish to refer to Clause 6 (2). It will be noted that provision is made for a Deputy and Assistant Registrar. The Registrar is also in charge of the Companies, Patents, Models and Copyright Office and there has already been an Assistant Registrar since 1952. The additional post of Deputy Registrar has been approved since January 1962. The three posts require legal qualifications and the present officials all have degrees in law. That is the reason why the references in Sections 120, 176 and 177 of the existing Act, which prescribes consultation with the legal adviser, have not been included in this Bill.</p>

<p>As far as the amendments and new principles are concerned, I think hon. members now have a fairly good idea of what is envisaged. In comparison with the existing Act it will be noticed that the provisions of the Bill appear in a much better chronological order and that they are clearer. I hope this Bill will enjoy the approval of the public and that it will succeed to convince industrialists and others of the advantages of trade marks. Hon. members will realize what part trade marks play in the economy of the country when I point out that approximately 150,000 trade marks are already registered and that applications are received at the rate of 4,500 per annum.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>The speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister shows how important this Trade Marks Bill is to the country and the vast number of changes that are being made to the existing Act. This Bill is both a consolidating and an amending Bill and deals with a very technical subject indeed. There are 83 clauses, Sir. The hon. the Minister appointed a committee representing everybody who was directly affected. It was very difficult to get hold of a copy of their report but this side of the House fortunately got one eventually and was completely satisfied that the report submitted amendments that were essential for the modern working of the Trade Marks Act of this country.</p>

<p>I am going to bless this Bill but I have quite a lot to say beforehand. There are 83 clauses which we have had to check. Considerable amendments are made. I am sure that this House does not subscribe to the suggestion that where a State Department comes to an agreement with any particular outside interest we must necessarily automatically confirm those arrangements. We are entitled to have matters submitted to us in a form in which we can give the necessary study to the matter and in the easiest possible way. That was not possible in this instance without a White Paper. I hope in all sincerity that we never have such a complicated matter as this brought to us again without an explanatory memorandum. It is not fair to us and it is not fair to Parliament that things like this should happen.</p>

<p>We accept this Bill. There is no question about it that it brings our legislation into line with the best of the legislation in the world to-day. The definition of &#x201C;trade mark&#x201D;, as mentioned by the hon. the Deputy Minister, is a very considerable improvement. The fact that people can now negotiate direct with the Registrar and agree beforehand that his decision shall be final on a matter is obviously a very great improvement. All the provisions in regard to appeals to the court remain, but this particular provision under which the parties can agree not to go to court and accept the Registrar&#x2019;s decision as final is obviously based on very sound business principles. In addition, as the hon. the Deputy Minister has said, the reduction of the period for which trade marks give protection, namely from 14 to 10 years, with an additional 10 years in place of 14, is in accordance with modern practice. There is one other matter I want to mention and that is the question of the Registrar being able to appoint deputies outside Pretoria. This will make it much easier for everybody.</p>

<p>With the strictures about the explanatory memorandum I wish to say to the hon. the Deputy Minister that I think his Department has done a good job of work but we are not very pleased with him on this question, of the lack of an explanatory memorandum.</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I am in general aggreement with the contents of this Trade Marks Bill put forward by the hon. the Deputy Minister. I should like to associate myself with the remarks of my colleague the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) and ask why no White Paper was presented to this House. This is a highly complicated Bill. It is a Bill with 83 clauses as compared with the 44 sections of the old Patents and Trade Marks Act of 1916. I feel that in a measure of this magnitude a short White Paper explaining where these 83 clauses differ from those of the 1916 Act would have been greatly appreciated by hon. members on this side of the House. That would have made it considerably easier for us to study this Bill in the short time available.</p>

<p>There appears to be only a very minor measure of criticism in this committee report that thas been referred to by the hon. the Deputy Minister. This committee was appointed by the Department of Economic Affairs in 1960. The hon. the Deputy Minister has already commented on the members who sat on this committee. It was representative of the law societies, the General Bar Council, the Registrar of Trade Marks, the then Assistant Registrar who is now the Registrar, and the S.A. Institute of Patent Agents. The Bill now before the House is not in conflict with this <span class="col_6975_6976" refersTo="page_0820"/>report. It is substantially 99 per cent what they recommended.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to certain clauses because the main innovation in this report is the division of the register into A and B sections which the hon. the Deputy Minister has already commented upon. This is a very important extention. It is an extension to the effect that trade marks which are not distinctive to-day may become distinctive in future. This is welcomed by the patent agents themselves. Clauses 19, 20, 28, 32, 33, 35 and 36 extend the jurisdiction to the Registrar of Trade Marks to hear cases and give judgment but retain the essential right to the applicant to go to the Supreme Court. Such clauses are to be welcomed. The applicant can then appeal against the Registrar&#x2019;s decision or he can elect to come before the Registrar. Clause 23 is also to be welcomed. It allows the parent company to apply for a trade mark for registration and that trade mark can now be used by the parent company and subsidiary companies, which was not possible in the past.</p>

<p>Regarding the very important Clause 44, that the hon. the Deputy Minister has already commented upon, may I say that I welcome hearing that certain sections of this clause are going to be expunged and amended. May I say that the Trade Marks Bill is approved in general by the S.A. Institute of Patent Agents except for certain desirable changes in Clause 44. They feel that 44 (1) should be amended by cancelling the words in brackets on lines 3 to 4, page 28, because if these words are left in, Clause 52 will not provide for infringement of certification marks. It is also felt that the whole of sub-section (b) of Clause 44 (1) should be removed from this Bill because it leaves the public and the trade in an uncertain position regarding infringement. A monopoly could be granted and it would cover the goods identified in the registration and also goods of the same description. This term has always created problems. I may draw the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attention to paragraph 39 of the committee&#x2019;s report where it gives the reasons why this sub-section was not recommended by the committee. I therefore welcome the announcement by the hon. the Deputy Minister that he is going to adjust this contentious Clause 44.</p>

<p>There are other amendments which can be welcomed such as the proposed use of a trade mark by companies about to be formed. It was not possible in the past to register a trade mark in the name of a company about to be formed and that may now be done. The clauses regarding distinctive trade marks have been strengthened. With Clause 44 (1) amended and Clause 44 (1) (b) removed I feel that this side of the House can welcome this Bill as a marked improvement on the many difficulties that the patent agents and the Registrar of trade marks, I have no doubt, have suffered over the years in using the old trade marks section of the 1916 Act.</p>

<p>Third Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Friendly Societies Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Depending on the basis of their constitution, there are, in the main, two types of mutual friendly societies. On the one hand there are those societies&#x2014;and they are the greater majority&#x2014;where the members are already associated in a group as the result of some other common factor, for example the employees of the same employer, or at the most, of a few associated employers, who generally in co-operation with the employer establish a friendly society, or the employees in a particular branch of industry, etc. In this type of society the membership as a rule is not very great and all the say in regard to the matters of the society rests with its members. The idea of mutuality consequently comes prominently to the fore with such societies, and members accept that the fate of the society, in the final result, lies in their own hands, and that consequently they have to be content with that.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are the societies which may be called the &#x201C;entrepreneur type&#x201D;. In this case one or more persons establish a &#x201C;mutual&#x201D; friendly society&#x2014;usually a medical scheme&#x2014;with the object of recruiting members on a large scale, sometimes even countrywide, and mostly by way of groups. Undoubtedly the prospect of earning managerial remuneration plays a role in the minds of the founders of this type of society.</p>

<p>The dangers inherent in the last-mentioned type of society are, e.g., that persons who do not have the necessary integrity, efficiency or financial means or support may collect contributions from the public on a large scale, and after having frittered away a large part of these contributions they find that they cannot fulfil their promises and simply give up. <span class="col_6977_6978" refersTo="page_0821"/>It may also happen that as a result of an unfortunate happening, e.g. abnormal demands being made upon it in the early stages of its existence, a society founders merely because it does not have sufficient funds available.</p>

<p>It is obvious that the idea of mutuality is practically completely absent in this type of society, and that members will be inclined to regard the relationship between themselves and the society as a strictly business one. If the affairs of such a society therefore go awry, apart from the damage which members may suffer, serious repercussions may possibly ensue which may adversely affect the whole movement and bring it into disrepute. It is therefore in the public interest that measures should be effected to try to ensure the security and financial stability of these associations.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur type of association is really not a mutual friendly society in the true sense of the word, but it falls within the definition of a &#x201C;mutual friendly society&#x201D; in the Act. There is, however, also room for this type of association to function in terms of the Friendly Societies Act, provided they comply with certain requirements. On the basis of the dangers inherent particularly in this type of society, it is essential in the public interest that the Registrar should be able to impose certain conditions when registering new associations, and also in the case of those which have already been registered preliminarily. The most important requirement envisaged is in respect of capital. The State actuaries support the idea that the entrepreneur type of friendly society should have available an appreciable amount of capital or guaranteees in order to ensure financial stability. That means that the society, particularly in the initial stages when revenue is still relatively low, should be able to defray certain items of expenditure such as its costs of establishment, managerial costs and claims. The basis on which this type of society does business approximates very closely to insurance where, in the case of medical insurance, for example, the insurer is required by the Insurance Act to deposit R10,000 with the Treasury and the Registrar, in terms of the discretion granted to him by the afore-mentioned Act, may require it to have an issued capital of R250,000, of which at least R110,000 should be paid up.</p>

<p>As the Act reads at present, the Registrar does not have the power to state any conditions before granting preliminary registration to a society. On receipt of an application for registration, accompanied by the prescribed documents, the Registrar is simply compelled to register the society preliminarily, irrespective of whether its establishment is in the public interest or not. It is only on final registration, i.e. five years after the preliminary registration, that the Registrar can impose definite conditions.</p>

<p>It is therefore necessary for the Act to be amended to grant the Registrar the necessary power to impose certain conditions in the case of new societies as well as in the case of those which have already been preliminarily registered. Because of the prevailing circumstances under which medical aid societies are being promoted and encouraged, also by the Government, the power now envisaged becomes urgently necessary to ensure that the movement will develop on a sound and steady basis. If mushroom societies are allowed to spring up, it will be appreciated that this movement which is being encouraged at present may experience an unnecessary setback which may have serious results.</p>

<p>In terms of the proposed amendment, the Registrar will have the power to do the following&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) In the case of new applications for registration, to insist that certain requirements be complied with before preliminary registration is granted, and</li>

<li>(b) in the case of societies which have already been preliminarily registered, to impose conditions which have to be complied with within a period determined by him.</li>

</ol>

<p>In the Committee Stage these amendments will be explained in detail, if necessary. The principle embodied in the Bill, to wit that the Registrar may impose certain conditions, is already contained in various other Acts relating to other types of financial institutions, e.g. the Banking Act, the Insurance Act and the Unit Trust Scheme Act.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday many questions were asked by this side of the House and very few were satisfactorily answered. I intend to ask <span class="col_6979_6980" refersTo="page_0822"/>more questions mainly about how migratory should a migrant be and how temporary are sojourners?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the main pillar of this Government&#x2019;s Native policy can fairly be stated to be that there must be no representation for the non-Europeans in the White area; any vote by a non-European is regarded as the thin end of the wedge of government by non-Whites. Secondly, all the political rights of Africans must be limited to those areas which are to be regarded as Black areas or homelands, eventually to become entirely independent Bantu states. Thirdly any African working or resident in the European areas is to be regarded as a migrant labourer or temporary sojourner and must eventually return to his own homeland. Fourthly, we cannot possibly live together in amity and peace, with law and order entrenched and willingly accepted if the Bantu get any political rights whatever or any say whatever in the government of White South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during this Session the hon. the Prime Minister has spoken much of discrimination by us, and he even accused my leader of ignoring entirely the &#x201C;gees&#x201D; of the Bantu, which he stated was very important, and of course it is important. Sir, the C.S.I.R. recently completed an investigation&#x2014;we have mentioned this before but we must keep on mentioning it&#x2014;and that investigation showed that 90 per cent of the Bantu on the Reef, excluding the mine Natives who are migrant labourers in the main, regard themselves as detribalized, with no interest whatever in their so-called homelands and no intention whatever of returning there. Mr. Chairman, an endeavour to get an answer from the Minister of Bantu Administration in regard to this difficulty which he is facing, brought only a plaintive plea in answer that I was being unkind and unpleasant and unfair to him, but no answer as to how this problem would be handled, or whether regard would be had to the &#x201C;gees van die Bantoe&#x201D; in this particular direction, and certainly he gave no answer as to why he had not made public in statements the facts disclosed by this C.S.I.R. report. Sir, this hon. Minister, plus the Prime Minister of course, is responsible for the policy of this Government, it is his brain-child and I want to read to him from this C.S.I.R. report so that there can be no doubt that he knows the attitude of the Bantu in the towns, the attitude of these Bantu to his policy that they are migrant labourers and temporary sojourners. For the hon. Minister&#x2019;s benefit, this is the seventeenth annual report of the C.I.S.R., published in 1961, page 25&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was found that approximately half of the large sample of over 1,000 cases could be looked upon as urbanized. Of those not fully urbanized, less than one-fifth still follow the migrant pattern.</block>

<p>In other words, as far as the Bantu are concerned 90 per cent of them consider themselves to be detribalized and not connected in any way with their homelands. To me it seems that the only methods to make people accept proposals like this and to accept the policy that they are really citizens of a distant homeland with which they have no tie and not citizens of South Africa, are two, firstly by force and secondly by convincing them and proving to them that it is in their own interests to accept this position. Mr. Chairman, speaker after speaker on the Government side has stressed that all the Bantu in the White areas are migrant labourers, temporary sojourners. You hear it like a chorus. It is the cornerstone, if not the keystone of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy, but the C.S.I.R. report tells us what the Bantu think about this assumption that they are temporary sojourners. I say that it is impossible to send them back now or in the future to their so-called homelands. It is impossible to get them to regard themselves as foreigners in the place where they dwell and work and multiply, and impossible to get them to regard themselves as nationals of these future sovereign independent states. All over the world, this point has been stressed before, the flow of the young people is from the country to the towns, and therefore this problem continually takes on greater dimensions. We see it in our own country with the depletion of the platteland as far as our own young people are concerned. It is happening all over the world. Of course I understand that the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration have decided that one day they will reverse this flow. Two King Canutes. I ask them how they propose to do it, because that is a most important question. There is another difficulty that faces the hon. Minister: The Africans in the town areas are encouraged to buy their houses. That is correct, is it not? They are granted a lease of a bit of ground for 30 years, they pay a deposit on the cost of the house which is erected on that piece of ground, they pay capital and interest for 30 years, and they pay a site rental which covers certain services. When the cost of the house has been paid off, only site rentals are payable. The interest in the house can be sold to any approved buyer, and may be inherited. That is correct, is it not, Mr. Minister? It cannot be cancelled easily, and to a well-behaved African citizen it is to all intents and purposes a lease in perpetuity. Now how you can reconcile perpetuity with temporary sojourning and with migrant labour, I do not know. Therefore as this problem is growing daily and is of tremendous importance for the &#x201C;gees van die Bantoe&#x201D; on the Reef and in all the towns, I would like to know from the hon. Minister how he proposes to get these unwilling temporary sojourners, who have a house where they live with their family, how he is going to get them back to their homelands in the future The only way would be to use force, because he will never convince them that it is in their own interests. How can you convince a man that it is in his own interests to get out of his house, his life&#x2019;s savings, where his children have grown up? Every few years there <span class="col_6981_6982" refersTo="page_0823"/>is another generation. How are you going to do that?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come back to the many speeches that have been made since yesterday on the subject of the removal of the Bantu from the western Cape, and I want to say that over the past 18 months this matter has been discussed exhaustively outside of this House, on political platforms and in the Press in this area. I think at this stage it would be very difficult to advance any new arguments. We can draw certain conclusions as far as the feelings of our people in this complex are concerned. I want to draw two conclusions. The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) is not here now but if he were here he would agree with me as far as my first conclusion is concerned and that is that if there is one area in which the United Party lost most ground because of its opposition to this attempt to Europeanize the White area in this province then it is in this particular complex. On the other hand I want to say that if there is one place in which the White man is determined to put an end to the threefold symbiosis of White, Brown and Black in this case, where there is continual friction, then it is here in the western Cape which is the cradle of the White man. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) wants the Government to make dramatic efforts in the Bantu homelands and here in the western Cape complex in order to dramatize its policy. That is not necessary. The hon. the Deputy Minister has pointed out what is being done in the reserves in this connection and I can tell the hon. member that as far as the western Cape is concerned we are at the moment mobilizing all our ingenuity and brainpower to implement this important idea in this area. I only hope that the fight which has been started in this debate will not end here but that the Opposition, other than has been the case over the past few months, will continue the fight outside on the political platforms. That will give us the opportunity to cause the further disintegration of the United Party. And where we are unable to do so, we will leave it, as in the case of Wynberg, to the two opposing political factions, the Liberals and the Progressives, to show up the United Party even further in its political nakedness and to continue its process of disintegration. Mr. Chairman, the whole basis of the arguments advanced by the United Party in the last few hours of this debate is that the economic interdependence of White and Black is the only cardinal reality of our South African way of life, and it is on that that the United Party builds all its arguments. That brings us to the policy of a common political society that it advocates in this country. And where does that in turn lead us? To two things. In the first place, the merciless undermining and breaking down of the authority of the White man in his own traditional homeland, a blatant indifference towards the property rights of the White man in his homeland and towards the political rights of the White man in his homeland. I want to refer here to a speech that was made last year at De Aar by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. member for Innesdale (Mr. J. A. Marais) has already referred to it. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said there that if the United Party were to come into power in South Africa to-morrow, he was going to do the following: He was going to repeal the Population Registration Act as well as the Bantu Education Act, the Prohibition of Interdicts Act, the Separate University Education Act, the Group Areas Act, the Immorality Act, the Industrial Conciliation Act and so on and so forth. He went on to say that as far as the Bantu were concerned, they would be given property rights in the urban areas. These wonderful urban areas, these pretty Boland towns which have been the cradle of the White man are now to be thrown open and the Bantu are to be given property rights there.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s leader said quite clearly in his speech at De Aar that as far as the Bantu were concerned they should be given property rights in the urban areas so that they can have a stake in the maintenance of law and order. He said that they should also be given some measure of self-government through the medium of various bodies there, as well as representation in Parliament on a special Voters&#x2019; Roll. He went further and he foreshadowed that these people would have to be given direct representation in the highest legislative body in our country. Viewed against the pattern of a common political society advocated by the United Party in our country, I ask you, Sir, whether you can imagine anything which more undermines the authority of the White man than this political pattern advocated by the United Party in our country.</p>

<p>But this thing has a second effect and that is that the Bantu in the White area is continually being encouraged by the policy advocated by the United Party to seek to achieve full political rights in our country. The National Party Government wants to canalize that basic urge for freedom on the part of the Black man; it wants to guide it in the direction of the Bantu homelands. But what is the United Party doing? The White minority Opposition is continually saying and whispering into the ears of the thousands of Bantu in the White man&#x2019;s homeland, that they can exercise <span class="col_6983_6984" refersTo="page_0824"/>their political rights, their basic rights, in the White man&#x2019;s homeland. What does that mean in practice? It means only one thing. In one common South Africa freedom for the Bantu does not mean a few representatives in this Parliament. No, freedom for the Bantu in the whole of South Africa means the eventual supremacy of the Black man in the whole of South Africa. That is axiomatic in our whole political reasoning.</p>

<p>This brings me to my second point. The Opposition contend that there is only one basis on which the decisions can be taken in this country&#x2014;that of Black/White economic interdependence. In this regard I want to say that this is a matter that we must bear in mind, but I say that there is another basic fact that is just as important, and, in my opinion, even more important. What is that fact? It is the irrefutable fact that the Black/White economic interdependence has not led to social and political equality over so many years, on the contrary it has led to increasing opposition to it. And nobody knows that better than members of the United Party themselves. It is this fact which has brought the United Party in the past to where it stands to-day. It is because of this that it has suffered one political defeat after another. It is because the United Party has not appreciated this fact that it finds itself in its present position. I admit that we have these two opposing, conflicting points of view in our South African political set-up. But I want to say this: There are two things which this Government will not do. Firstly, this Government is not prepared to build the economic structure of our entire country on a voteless Black proletariat. This Government is not prepared to do that. On the other hand, this Government is not prepared to accept economic interdependence of Black and White as the only fundamental reality in our South African politics. The Government&#x2019;s plan in this connection is the creation of a separate freedom for the Black man on the one hand and a separate freedom for the White man on the other. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>All might possibly be logical from the hon. member&#x2019;s point of view, who has just spoken, if what he is trying to stress as Nationalist Party policy would be of any practical significance. But it has no practical value at all. What struck me in his remarks, and in the remarks of many other hon. members opposite, is the sudden concern that the whole party has now for the unfortunate Coloured man in the Western Province. The fact that he is being uprooted from where he has lived for over a century in many parts of Cape Town, the fact that there is job reservation in regard to the Coloured man, the fact that he is being pushed around from pillar to post because of group areas, the fact that he is having differentiation in his education, that is something which is glossed over. All of a sudden the party is very concerned with the removal of the Black man from the western Cape because the Coloured man is being pushed out of his traditional form of employment and, of course, he is being seriously affected! Sir, the whole difficulty with the party and the hon. Minister who is trying to support his policy, is the fact that it is a complete pipe-dream&#x2014;the whole of the Government&#x2019;s policy is to-day hitched to the star of Bantustans, self-governing Bantustans, becoming independent states, and the policy of making the Republic of South Africa completely White. That has been the constant plea of hon. members on the Government&#x2019;s side: &#x201C;&#x2019;n Blanke Suid-Afrika.&#x201D; And if this fails, as no doubt it will, the whole of the Nationalist Party philosophy will collapse like a pack of cards. The influx to the urban areas at the moment is a natural economic movement of labour forces to the source of employment, and the reversal of this trend which according to the policy of the Nationalist Party should be attempted, is an impossible task which the Government wishes this country to accept as a policy. Reference was made to the building of homes and housing schemes in the Transvaal. In the Transvaal all development as far as the housing of the Bantu is concerned, has taken place around the large urban areas. No Bantustans have as yet been declared in the Transvaal. So far the hon. Minister and the Government have limited this to the Transkei, which is a natural political complex in respect of the Bantu and has been so over a century. No areas have been demarcated in the Transvaal and all the industrial development around towns like Pretoria, Pietersburg, Rustenburg and Vereeniging has drawn more and more Bantu labour there. It has been suggested that possibly the industrial complexes surrounding Pretoria, Pietersburg and Vereeniging will become the border areas for the so-called Bantustans, but they are virtually expanding industrial complexes with the objective of developing these towns and building larger and larger areas of industrial influence in the so-called White Republic. The result is that more and more housing schemes and accommodation are being provided for the housing of Bantu labour. All this is obviously inconsistent with the pipe-dream of clearing the White areas of the Bantu. Dr. de Villiers, who deals with the methods of work study in the Anglo American Corporation, where he is a consulting engineer, says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is estimated that the working population will have risen by about 1,400,000 workers in the decade ending 1971 and that a further 1,800,000 workers will be added in the following ten years.</block>

<p>This is a colossal figure. Even assuming that the Bantu homelands are well developed agriculturally, after 25 years, according to the Tomlinson Commission, they will only be able to support 2,300,000 of the estimated 3,600,000 inhabitants which were there in 1952. All the investment in the country points to only one thing, and that is that this is taking place in the so-called White areas. We talk of an investment of more than R2,000,000,000 over the <span class="col_6985_6986" refersTo="page_0825"/>next ten years and of an investment of R450,000,000 on the Orange River scheme, butwhere is it all taking place? In the established White areas, and it will expand the industrial complex and must continue to draw more and more Bantu workers or otherwise the expenditure will be completely unjustified. If they, the Government, are to achieve a reversal of this flow of labour back to the homelands, surely industries have to be established there to draw these people. Surely the Minister does not expect that he will gradually build up industries in those areas and hold back the economy of the country for this gradual building up of industries, because without the attraction of employment no force will be able to compel such a large number of human beings of their own accord to flow back to the reserves. It is not only economically impossible, but it is a completely unnatural state of affairs. What is the amount of money it is suggested will be spent in the homelands over the next five years? R114,000,000, i.e. R20,000,000 per annum. What does the Minister expect to achieve with that? The reserves will be what they have always been, reservoirs of labour for industry. One only has to listen to men like Dr. Norval, the ex-president of the Board of Trade and who is a man of considerable experience in these matters, and what did he say in an address to the Worcester Chamber of Commerce recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While I fully accept that quite a measure of employment will be given to the Bantu on the fringes of the reserves through the establishment of industries, I most definitely disagree that this will lead to a balanced, organic, economic development of those territories, which is urgently necessary if they are to become economically more viable. The converse would seem to me to be much nearer the truth.</block>

<p>He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Neither do I accept that the industries established on the borders will result in the Bantu gaining the necessary managerial and organizational experience to run his own industries in the reserves.</block>

<p>After all, that is basic to the whole issue. Dr. Norval does not even believe that industries on the borders will ever become sufficiently practical to achieve the object of this whole discussion, which is to bring about a White South Africa.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which is important. The Minister spoke about traders and businessmen going back to their own areas in order to invest their capital there, yet the Government is spending a considerable amount of money on publishing pamphlets and booklets in which it extols the valuable work it is doing in enabling the Bantu to develop their businesses in the present areas where they are living.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>To put the speech of the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) in a nutshell, it amounts to the fact that he cannot support the policy of separate development because demarcated areas do not exist in the Transvaal. Now he wants to suggest that what is taking place in the Transkei is merely a bluff. I want to tell the hon. member that one gets two kinds of complaints from hon. members opposite. The one complaint is always that we are applying separate development in the Transkei only and the other is that we are doing it too fast. The hon. member must make up his mind and tell us whether we are going too fast or too slowly. Once he has made up his mind I will be able to answer him.</p>

<p>Listening to the arguments raised over the past few days one has been struck by the fact that two main points were raised by hon. members opposite. The one was that there are such a large number of detribalized Bantu in South Africa that the policy of separate development is not practicable. I want to tell hon. members that I have never in all my life seen a detribalized Native. I do not think that any Bantu can ever become detribalized. When one takes the case of Dr. Hastings Banda who lived in Britain all his life and who cannot even speak the language of his tribe, then one remembers that on his return to his country he was just a Bantu who still had his tribal connections and who still believed to a large extent in witchcraft and the inherent customs of his tribe. If a man who has lived amongst civilized people throughout his life cannot become detribalized, then I cannot see how any Bantu who has lived for only a few years in Johannesburg or Cape Town can become detribalized.</p>

<p>But there is another argument. Just as soon as we pin hon. members opposite down on the policy of separate development, they ask: What about the 5,000,000 Bantu in the urban areas? I want to put this question to those hon. members. If it were not for those 5,000,000 Bantu in the White areas would they then support separate development? [Interjection.] Then the stumbling-block that they say is there does not exist. I know what the answer will be. They will say no; they will not support it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) is trying to get out of the difficulty. I want to put the question to him. If we did not have 5,000,000 Bantu in the White areas, would he then support the policy of separate development? No; none of them wants to reply. If they do reply they will say: No. In any case we will not support it. In other words, they must not come along with the argument that those 5,000,000 Bantu are the stumbling-block. Hon. members opposite are opposed to separate development in principle, and it makes no difference whether <span class="col_6987_6988" refersTo="page_0826"/>there are 5,000,000 or only five Bantu in the White areas. In principle they are opposed to the policy of separate development and to the policy of one White South Africa. In principle they are in favour of a multi-racial South Africa. These arguments about the 5,000,000 Bantu are merely raised in order to put up a smokescreen over that one important issue. In actual fact, in their heart of hearts they feel just like the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) feels. They are in favour of a multi-racial State but they dare not say so because then they will lose their supporters. They dare not move too far to the right because then they will lose some of their leftist supporters, like the former member for Wynberg. If they move a little too far to the left, they will lose some of their right-wing supporters. They are between two fires. They are sitting on the fence. As one hon. member said, they have to part their hair in the middle or otherwise they will move too far either to the one side or the other side.</p>

<p>After having listened to hon. members opposite for two days, one can only draw one conclusion&#x2014;that they are becoming afraid that the policy of separate development will succeed. If they thought that it would not succeed, they would not be so strongly opposed to it because then we would in any case have the position that they are advocating. But they are so strongly opposed to it because they realize that our policy is succeeding. I want to say that the world is revising its opinion of separate development and is starting to accept it. Originally the world was hesitant because people did not know whether the policy was practicable or not. But now that this Government has put the policy into practice in the Transkei, world opinion has changed to a large extent.</p>

<p>I want to quote very quickly from a very important report that appeared in a newspaper which has supported the United Party throughout. I know the editor of this newspaper personally. The report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A very old British weekly on South Africa has revised its opinion about separate development over the past few months. In the latest issue the editor printed an article in his own name in which he gave his full support to the South African Government. A year ago the newspaper was still making many attacks on the National Government. The name of this newspaper is <i>Southern Africa.</i> It was founded in 1889 and the present editor, Mr. Alan Gray, is a young man who took over from his father. He writes that if the confederation plan of the United Party is applied, it will make the Natives ask even more for general franchise. Partition has worked elsewhere in the world. We need just imagine what would have happened if there had been no partition in India. One of the lessons of Africa is that the system of qualified franchise always fails. Over the past years the Nationalists have derived their greatest strength from the fact that they have a long-term policy which is also being accepted more and more by the English-speaking people in the realization that there is no middle path between separate development and complete integration. The full application of separate development will not be achieved within the next 20 years and even then there will still be many loose ends. But what is really happening in South Africa at the moment is that there has been a widening of the acceptance of partition far beyond the borders of the ruling political party.</block>

<p>He shows further how English-speaking people and members of that party are all the more prepared to accept that policy. I have many such cuttings here to show that separate development is gaining ground even in South Africa. I also want to quote the hon. member for Houghton. According to a Sapa report she had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whites coming to South Africa from Kenya say that the Prime Minister knows how to treat the Native, Mrs. Helen Suzman, M.P. for Houghton, told members of the Progressive Party here last night. There is no dissatisfaction amongst members of the Nationalist Party nor are there any signs of a split in the party. Dr. Verwoerd is also strongly established.</block>

<p>Then she mentions the reasons, such as great economic prosperity and goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appears as though Dr. Verwoerd&#x2019;s prestige amongst his own followers and, alas, amongst certain sections of the English-speaking people, has never been higher.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe) raised a few interesting points. He asked one question repeatedly and told us that we would not reply to it. It was one of those impossible questions that was asked. He said: If it were not for the Bantu in the so-called White areas, would we accept separate development? I want to say this. If the Bantu were not here, we would be a White state and the Bantu would be in a Black state and so the question of separate development would not arise at all.</p>

<p>The hon. member also told us that the world was starting to accept the policy of separate development. I found that interesting because any South African who sees the pressure building up overseas is concerned about the future of South Africa. I wondered what wonderful examples that hon. member was going to give us. Do you know what examples he gave us? One English-speaking <span class="col_6989_6990" refersTo="page_0827"/>editor and the hon. member for Houghton &#x2014;out of the whole world, in which only 104 states are represented at UNO!</p>

<p>And he did so, well knowing that just about every Western state rejects apartheid. That is the sort of general statement that the hon. member makes and thinks that he will get away with it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) raised a brand-new argument and it was so interesting that I want to discuss it for a moment. He said this White-Black economic relationship&#x2014;I prefer to call it economic integration&#x2014;leads to friction in South Africa. If it leads to friction, when did it start leading to friction? Even during the 15 years of Nationalist Government the Bantu have streamed into the White areas in their thousands. Where has the friction taken place? But secondly, if it leads to friction, from whence comes the statement that it leads to social and economic and biological integration? According to the Nationalist Party, that is what we are in favour of. Now we have friction on the one hand and biological and social integration on the other hand. What is the truth? The hon. member wants to have his cake and eat it. But I do not think that that is being quite fair.</p>

<p>I want to come back to a subject that is very close to my heart as a resident of the Cape and that is the removal of the Bantu from the western Cape. This is an important matter to my mind and one asks why the Bantu should be removed from the western Cape. The reply of the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite is that we must remove the Bantu because we want to protect the interests of the Coloureds.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Why do we want to remove the Bantu? Nobody will ignore the interests of the Coloureds if he can help it. We are just as concerned about the interests of the Coloureds as part of the population as we are about the interests of the Whites. Why then the removal? Is the fact that the Bantu are here to-day not responsible for the Coloured being able to maintain a higher economic standard? Is it not true that the Bantu occupy the lower strata and have pushed the Coloureds up to a higher rung on the economic ladder? If we want the Bantu to leave this pyramid of labour, the pyramid will not sink any lower; the Coloureds will have to drop down and do the work that was being done by the Bantu, work that is to a large extent unskilled.</p>

<p>It is easy to say that one should not be ashamed of work, and I agree with that, but any person with some degree of realism knows that if the Bantu leave here the work that they have been doing will have to be done by the Coloured or the poor-Whites. The hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) asked what White man was ashamed of work, but it is not a question of shame. It is very easy for us to talk about work while we sit here, but if we have to do that same work we will not feel so happy about it.</p>

<p>But there is a second reason for the removal of the Bantu and this only comes to light on the political platforms. Then it suddenly becomes the protection of the White man. Then it is simply the old propaganda tale once again of the Black danger in a different guise. But how much truth is there in that argument? If the White man in the Cape is in danger because of the presence of the Bantu, are our friends in Bloemfontein also not in danger? Or have we as a nation become so selfish that we want to try and save ourselves here and leave the others to their fate? No, the real reason is that the National Party realize that if substance is given to their policy of separate development they must at some or the other stage start to divert that Black stream back to the Bantu areas and they know that the easiest place to start in this regard is in the Cape.</p>

<p>But now they add, however, that this will have to take place over a long period. I want to accept that fact but then I say this. If it takes a long time in the easiest place, namely, the western Cape, how long must South Africa wait before the Bantu have been removed from Johannesburg? Does the Government really think that time will stand still for South Africa and that there is sufficient time to proceed at a snail&#x2019;s pace with the removal of the Bantu?</p>

<p>Hon. members will now say that I maintain that apartheid is impossible; on the other hand I say that apartheid is dangerous. That is the tragedy exactly; that while these people know that it is impossible to remove the Bantu from the White areas timeously, on the other hand they are giving large parts of South Africa away where the Black man can establish his own states and in this way become an even greater danger to the Whites.

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will not resent the fact if I do not follow him. He is still reasoning as the United Party reasoned about six years ago and all his questions and difficulties have already been discussed and solved by this side of the House. I want to make a constribution to this debate and so he will forgive me if I do not follow him.</p>

<p><span class="col_6991_6992" refersTo="page_0828"/>When the hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred at the start of this debate to the &#x201C;Natives permanently settled in so-called White areas&#x201D;, he not only put the attitude of the Opposition but he also emphasized the unbridgeable gulf between the two parties as far as the solution to the Bantu problem is concerned. There is no such thing as a White area in South Africa as far as he, his party, his Press and that little tail which so often wags the United Party dog, the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) are concerned. At most it can be called a &#x201C;so-called White area&#x201D;. But they all admit that there is such a thing as a Bantu area in which no White person can settle permanently. In other words, the Republic is divided into Bantu areas and mixed areas. They also adopt the attitude further that these mixed areas belong equally to the Whites and the Bantu and that what we call the White areas are owned jointly by Whites and Bantu. It is very important for us to remember this if we want to understand their attitude. We on this side deny that. Historically the Bantu occupied a certain part of South Africa and they still possess that area to-day with the exception of those Whites who entered those areas and formed White islands, little islands of &#x201C;shopkeepers&#x201D;. If we interpret the course of history well enough, these are people who will after all have to disappear from that scene one of these days. Historically it is also a fact that the Bantu who had streamed into the White areas have come here as labourers and as labourers only, not as approved immigrants. If we accept the fact that these labourers must be accepted as part of the population on a permanent basis, then one cannot get away from the fact that one will eventually have to give them full civil and civic rights. The rules of our democratic system will compel us to give these people full citizenship and then, without influx control and without repatriation to their own areas, the result can only be non-White supremacy in the White areas. Now the Opposition ought to realize this but in spite of this fact they insist on the right of the Bantu to work here, the right of settlement just where they like in the White areas, the right to landownership, the right to freedom of movement, and last but not least, the right to stream in whether there is work for them or not. We on this side of the House do not admit that such rights exist. Our view of the matter is that the Bantu enjoy certain privileges in the labour sphere here but we also make conditions. We are not going to allow the labour market to be swamped by cheap Native labour; we cannot permit that to happen because it will not be in the interests of the Whites or the Coloureds. The hon. members who represent Natal sometimes amuse one when one listens to the manner in which they discuss this effort to remove surplus Native labour from the western Cape. They should read their history again. To-day it is the Coloured who, so we are told, cannot do certain kinds of work. In their case it was the Bantu who could not do certain kinds of work in Natal and so they imported the Indians. What is the position to-day as a result of that? Those Indians whom they imported have become a Frankenstein monster which to-day threatens to disrupt Natal completely. We cannot permit the Bantu to settle permanently in the White areas because the political implications are too dangerous. Nor can we allow them to receive civil and civic rights. As long as they conduct themselves in an orderly and peaceful manner, they are very welcome; we pay them well and their wages are increased from time to time. We look after their health by means of suitable housing and sanitation. We provide hospitalization for them; we care for their sick and their aged and we educate their children. We look after them in time of sickness and need and we do this on a scale that is unknown in the rest of Africa. It is these things that the hon. member for Houghton should well remember when she acts in this House like an agent of Pan-Africanism. Her enthusiasm for a cause that is dangerous to the State can also place her in danger. The world forces which she is helping to unleash against the White man will also strike her down unless she flees in time. I shall wager everything that she will flee before the fire that she has helped to start has taken a firm hold. The same thing holds good for the United Party which, to use the new expression, still consists largely of colonialists. But the difference between them and the Progressives simply lies in the rate at which the White man in this country will be undermined if they are given the opportunity.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making an urgent appeal to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and that is to accelerate the next issue of his Bantu policy a little because there are a few questions that we would like to have answered. The first question which is very relevant is how he can have any moral justification for the policy of White leadership in a multi-racial state in which the Whites make up only one-fifth of the population. I suggest that he delegate the task of replying to his question to his eggdancer-extraordinary, the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). The second question that we want him to answer is what his race federation plan will look like now after the failure of similar efforts throughout Africa and particularly in Southern Rhodesia.

He said that he preferred not to follow the hon. member and that he preferred to make no comments on his speech. Well, I do not think he expects me to comment on the great speech that he made. All that I can say is that if the hon. the Prime Minister had been present here this afternoon, that hon. member <span class="col_6993_6994" refersTo="page_0829"/>would have been appointed to the Cabinet immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to remind you of a statement that was made by Dr. Geyer a few months ago in which he said that the apartheid policy of this Government would be tested against the measure of success that was achieved in the removal of the Natives from the Western Province. He went further and he said that if this Government did not succeed in removing the Natives from the Western Province within a reasonably short time, they might as well admit that the whole policy of apartheid had failed and that it would never succeed. What Dr. Geyer said there is important. I do not often say &#x201C;thank you&#x201D; to the hon. the Minister, but I want to think him for something to-day and that is that he is doing nothing to remove the Natives from the Western Province. We need them here very badly and the hon. the Minister must not allow himself to be misled by the hon. members for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S.

Last year, according to a reply to a question that was asked, 2,153 Bantu males and 846 Bantu females were removed from the Western Province, and this out of a total of about 150,000 Bantu; in other words, not even 2 per cent. Fortunately the hon. the Minister himself&#x2014;and I want to thank him for it&#x2014;did at least recruit over a thousand Bantu in the reserves officially and we hope that he will continue with that policy. We need those people here; somebody has to do the work. It appears to me that there is an alliance between the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) because the hon. member for Houghton makes propaganda from the story that hundreds of thousands of Natives are taken by their necks here and thrown into the Transkei without work, and the hon. the Minister makes propaganda that that is what he is going to do. Both of them are doing South Africa a great deal of harm, particularly the Western Province. What is the position in the Western Province? Is the hon. the Minister aware&#x2014;let him discuss it with the hon. the Minister of Labour&#x2014;that we in the Western Province have such a shortage of farm labourers to-day that last year farmers at Paarl hired agents during the grape harvesting season to &#x201C;hi-jack&#x201D; Natives and Coloureds even in the middle of the night from one&#x2019;s farm? When one awoke on the next day one found that the labourers who had to do one&#x2019;s work had been stolen by farmers in Paarl and Robertson and other places. The hon. member for Malmesbury and the hon. member for Moorreesburg can tell the Committee whether this is the truth or not. Things were so bad that the co-operative in Porterville&#x2026;</p>

<p>I move amongst the farmers every day and I want to tell the whole of South Africa here and now that last year during the grape harvesting season farmers appointed Coloured agents in every town in the Western Province and these agents hired labourers and took them out of the Western Province towns at dead of night. Things were so bad that the co-operative at Porterville could not even load its train with wheat at Ceres one Saturday morning. Let the hon. the Minister tell me whether this is the truth. Let him tell the Committee how many requests he received to bring Bantu to the Western Province. He will receive more requests and he will grant more of them because what are the facts? We do not have sufficient labourers in the Western Province today to do our work and this tale of the two Ministers of Agriculture that the farmers have to make more use of machinery is so much nonsense. What machine can cut a vine or harvest grapes? No, these people just talk without knowing what they are talking about. All they are doing is to annoy the decent Bantu on the farm. Those Bantu who are willing to do their work are being frightened and annoyed. The Government is causing trouble where no trouble exists. Mr. Chairman, we cannot go on in this way. Things are said here&#x2014;I do not know what the political motives are for saying them&#x2014;which are obviously ridiculous. The hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe) for example told us that the whole world now realizes what a wonderful policy apartheid is and that the whole world now accepts it. He knows that that is not true. Why does he say such a thing? Have these people no more respect for the truth. [Interjection.] Of course he said it. I just want to tell the hon. the Minister that if the Government persists with a policy that is going to kill the Western Province&#x2014;and this policy will kill the Western Province economically if they remove any Natives from this area without making prior and timeous <span class="col_6995_6996" refersTo="page_0830"/>arrangements for other workers to take their place&#x2014;then they must never come along again and tell us that they care at all about the survival of the Whie man here in the Western Province. Mr. Chairman, hon. members on that side tell us on this side that we are selling our souls for this and that. When one is a Member of Parliament and is earning a good salary of R6,000 per year then it is easy to boast. But let them come and work on the platteland and earn that salary. Let them do something for South Africa. Do not simply waste South Africa&#x2019;s money. Somebody has to do our work and all the fuss that has been made by hon. members on that side has been so much nonsense. The hon. the Minister knows that he will not remove the Natives from the Western Province. He knows that we will need more Natives here, not fewer Natives. What will now become of this story of a Berg River scheme? Mr. Chairman, we have wine quotas in the Western Province that are twice as high as the quantity that we can produce at the moment. Who is going to do that additional work? Ask the hon. the Minister of Justice who the people are who to-day make up our labour forces in the Western Province. They are jail birds! Our farmers are farming with convicts.</p>

<p>Everywhere. Ask the hon. member for Moorreesburg what happened in his constituency. I will tell you what happened in Moorreesburg in regard to this question of the removal of Natives from the Western Province. We have a small cement factory at Riebeeck West. They asked for permission to employ 300 Natives there and the Minister refused. He said that it was contrary to the policy of the Government. What happened then? The then Minister of Justice (Mr. Erasmus) was also the M.P. for Moorreesburg. A meeting was held there under the chairmanship of the then member of the Provincial Council, Mr. van der Merwe. They met and decided to make convict labour available to the farmers. The farmers then pointed out that they could not farm by using convict labour. One cannot take a man from jail at eight o&#x2019;clock in the morning and bring him back at five o&#x2019;clock on the same afternoon. What did they do then? They are men of granite; they are inflexible; they would not admit 300 Natives, but they did admit 298! And those Natives are still there! This whole idea of removing Natives from the Western Province is a farce. It is political stupidity and the Nationalists are simply trying to collect votes in this way. Where is the logic in the argument of the hon. member for Moorreesburg who said that if we keep the Natives here it means economic dependence and leads to resentment? All these years we have been told that economic dependence and integration lead to political and social integration which again lead to the Bantu demanding greater rights. But what was the sum total of his argument? It boils down to this: We do not want to be integrated economically with the Native but we want to be integrated economically with the Coloured!

<p>My question is whether the Opposition are opposed to the development of border industries. Reference has been made time and again in this debate to the development which is taking place there, and strong objections have been raised in that regard. What they want is a great influx of Bantu, an uncontrolled influx into Pretoria and Johannesburg. My second question is this: In the light of the criticism that they have expressed against the hon. the Minister and the Government in this debate, are hon. members opposite prepared to repeal the 1913 Act and the 1936 Act? Do they want to shirk completely the responsibility which the White man accepted under those Acts in terms of which certain areas were set aside for the Bantu and certain further areas were to be purchased? If they do not answer these questions, I repeat that all their criticism has simply been a farce from start to finish. In that case they have simply been trying to waste the time of this Committee with all their clever talk and airy nonsense. Hon. gentlemen opposite are resorting to this clever talk in an attempt to put up a smokescreen. They continually ask why the <span class="col_6997_6998" refersTo="page_0831"/>numbers of Bantu in the urban areas are still increasing. They have been told time and again by hon. members on this side that our industries are expanding. We cannot close down our industries. Our industries will be dependent upon Bantu labour until such time as the development in the Bantu areas reaches the stage where those Bantu will be drawn back to their homelands. That is the process that will take place but hon. gentlemen opposite pretend that they do not understand it. They understand it very well but because they are opposed in principle to the policy of separate development in South Africa, they constantly hurl the accusation at us that the numbers of Bantu in industry in the White areas are increasing. We know that that is so and it is taking place because of our industrial development. The position must change and will change when we reach the stage where the Bantu areas have developed to the point where there will be avenues of employment for the Bantu in those areas. When that stage is reached the industries in the White areas will then have to depend upon White labour. But any sensible person who knows and understands the pattern of South Africa realizes that for many years to come the pattern will be that we will have to make use of Bantu labour in our industries and in our agriculture.</p>

<p>The hon. members must not ask me for how long. Who knows how long the world will last? Is there any person in his right mind who would dare to prophesy how long this process will continue? We know that the predictions of even the best economists do not always come true. If hon. members on that side will open their eyes they will realize that the urge for segregation will become stronger and stronger and that that segregation process will be accelerated as a result of pressure that will be exercised by the public outside. Even at congresses people are insisting that the tempo of segregation should be accelerated and that is why I say that in this connection I do not even think in terms of the year 2000. That process will be accelerated notwithstanding our planning. There are things in store for us which are going to accelerate the process of complete segregation between White and non-White and perhaps even carry it through in this decade. It is those things that will determine whether this process will take 20 years or whether it will take 100 years. Mr. Chairman, the United Party refuses obstinately to appreciate the necessity for the survival of a White South Africa, and if they continue to bang their heads against that hard rock, they are going to bleed to death. I predict that a better Opposition will one day come into being, an Opposition that will criticize the Government for not implementing the sound principles of this party quickly enough. When that day arrives, we will have a united White South Africa as they have in Australia where all the parties adopt one attitude and that is that come what may Australia is going to remain White. Within a very short time, Mr. Chairman, public opinion in South Africa will insist that this process of segregation be accelerated and it will be regarded as a crime for anyone to advocate the sort of thing which hon. members of the United Party and Progressive Party are advocating in South Africa to-day under the banner of a political party.

<p>Anyone who has listened to the whole of this debate from its commencement on Tuesday afternoon, with an outstanding speech from the Leader of the Opposition, in which he analysed and criticized most effectively the Bantustan policy of this Government (criticisms which I may say remain unanswered up to the present time), must have been impressed by two outstanding features, and they are, firstly, that with few exceptions the Nationalist speakers who have participated in this debate have all run away from their policies and have been afraid to discuss their policies. They have discussed everything else except their policies. In particular they have resorted to misrepresentation of the United Party&#x2019;s policy and have then gone ahead to discuss the policies which they so misrepresented. That is the first feature. The second feature is the fact that the few Nationalist speakers who have discussed their policies have shown an alarmingly unreal attitude towards the racial problems of this country, and what is more, an alarmingly unreal attitude towards the implications of Nationalist policies. We have in the past been used to the hon. the Minister going into orbit when he discusses his Bantu policy, but we now have this unusual feature that in this debate we find those Government members who have tried to deal with their policies, likewise going into orbit, and the result is that although this debate has been going on continuously since Tuesday afternoon the criticisms of the Leader of the Opposition and of other members on this side of the House remain, in the main, unanswered.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. I appreciate a remark like that from the hon. member for Vereeniging. Coming from him I must accept it as quite a compliment, although I am sure he did not intend it as such. Mr. Chairman, what in fact do we find? We find that the only answer which the hon. the Minister and other Government speakers have given to the serious criticisms made by this side of the House to various aspects of their policies is that we do not need to worry, commerce, industry, the farming community etc., need not worry; everything will be done in such a way so as not to disturb or to disrupt the economy of the country. The hon. the Minister said that the removal of the Bantu from the western Cape&#x2014;I <span class="col_6999_7000" refersTo="page_0832"/>assume he implied also the removal of the Bantu from the other White areas&#x2014;will be done in a &#x201C;mooi pragtige manier&#x201D;. Does the hon. the Minister think that he is a fairy godmother who can simply wave a wand and that all the troubles and difficulties will simply disappear? I think it is time that the Minister and other members on the other side of the House should stop talking such nonsense. All economists and other experts have told this Government that the Bantu cannot be removed from the western Cape without disruption and disturbance of the economy, commerce, industry, farming, etc. If the Government, as the hon. the Minister now says, is not going to remove the Bantu in a way in which it will disrupt the economy, he will not be able to remove them at all. I say it is time that he and other Government members were honest enough to admit that. If this is the position in so far as the removal of the Bantu from the western Cape is concerned, precisely the same applies to the removal of the Bantu from other White areas in the Republic of South Africa. It cannot be done without disrupting the whole of our economy. [Interjections.] I am glad that this interjection has been made; I am not sure of the hon. member&#x2019;s constituency. He asks me if I concede that there are White areas. This is typical of the unrealism of Government members. How can they talk about areas in which there are not only Whites but where there are a vast number of non-Whites, Bantu, Indians and Coloureds, as White areas. They themselves know and admit that these areas will continue to contain vast numbers of non-Whites for virtually all time. The Minister says that the number of Bantu in the so-called White areas will continue to increase to some extent up to 1978 and then, for some reason best known to himself&#x2014;a reason which he has not made clear to the country&#x2014;after 1978 the tide will be reversed and they will gradually go out of the so-called White areas to the Bantu states. Sir, this sort of attitude is unrealistic. Until such time as the Government adopts a realist attitude towards the racial problems in this country and towards the facts as they exist in this country, there is no hope of a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>I should like to examine briefly the consequences of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development. I think it is important to bear in mind when we discuss this policy what the object of it is. The object of it is, as has been stated by several Government speakers, that in their opinion it is impossible to avoid friction if members of various races live and work in the same area. So, therefore, one has to remove all the non-Whites to their own areas. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down referred to the United Party&#x2019;s criticism of the Government. What did that criticism actually amount to? They started by moving that the Minister&#x2019;s salary should be reduced. In former years they used this method to open the debate. To-day the position is different. To-day a motion of this nature is moved if the policy of the Government is viewed in a very serious light. The criticism of the Opposition is based on two main points. The first is the intention of the Government to move the Bantu from the Western Province. The second point that they mentioned was that the influx of Natives into the Western Province was continuing daily. The hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) thanked the hon. the Minister heartily for the fact that this influx was still continuing. If that is correct it means that what the United Party wants is still happening; why then are they dissatisfied? According to their arguments this influx is still taking place. I cannot see therefore why they moved a motion to reduce the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s salary. They are satisfied with the position as it is to-day. According to the policy of the United Party there is to be no separate development as advocated by the National Party but the Bantu are to continue to flock from the Native areas into the White areas. The United Party want a common society represented in one Parliament. According to their own arguments, that is what is happening today. That is just where we differ from them and always will differ from them. We must agree to differ. The policy of the United Party is one of a common society with each population group having a say in this Parliament while the policy of the National Party is separate development with the Native having no authority in this Parliament. The idea expressed at the Imperial Conference at the time was that if only concessions were made in this Parliament, there would be some hope of changed conditions in the future. The United Party continually draws attention to that hope in order to gain admission for the Black man to this Parliament. Let me refer to one part of the policy of the United Party. The United Party say that if they come into power there will be eight White Native representatives in this House. Let me say immediately that we know that the word &#x201C;White&#x201D; is merely a camouflage for political purposes; they know that they will not be able to carry this out. But let us accept that as being correct. They say that to begin with there will be eight White representatives in this House to represent the Natives. As far as further development is concerned, they will hold a referendum. We must remember that at that stage everyone will have the franchise although it will be on a federal basis. There will be various groups of votes. The Whites will have the franchise on a roll together with the Coloureds; the Indians will have the franchise and the Natives will have the franchise. In other words, at the stage at which they will hold a referendum, the voters will consist of Whites, Coloureds, Indians and all the Natives. I ask you. Mr. Chairman, what the result of such a referendum will be? I am sure that it is clear having a regard to world developments and the upsurge of nationalism in Africa, where the Black man is seeking a political platform, that under no circumstances will one be able to satisfy <span class="col_7001_7002" refersTo="page_0833"/>him by giving him representation in this Parliament through Whites. One can only satisfy his political ambitions by giving him a platform. That is where the great difference lies between the National Party and the United Party. The United Party wants to give him a political platform in this Parliament while the National Party says that under no circumstances will it do so. The National Party says that it will give the Bantu a platform in their own area&#x2014;and no matter how dangerous it may seen, it will not be as dangerous as it would be to give them that platform in this Parliament. Therein lies the fundamental difference between the two political parties. Under no circumstances can we bridge or eliminate that gulf between the two parties. That difference will continue to exist as long as the United Party follows this stupid policy of creating one common society. That is why the National Party says that this process of segregation will be a gradual one. It will result in the gradual removal of the surplus Bantu from the White areas. This removal process will of necessity have to be gradual. That is why we do not talk about a complete removal of the entire Native population to the reserves. That would be stupid and wrong. That is why this process will take place gradually as and when the country can afford to put it into operation advantageously.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to raise a matter again with the Minister which I raised a couple of days ago but I am not satisfied with the reply that he gave me. There was a report in the newspaper a day or two ago about a debate in the Transvaal Provincial Council&#x2014;the Minister may have seen it&#x2014;where one of the Provincial Councillors, Miss McLarty, raised the question of famine relief for the drought-stricken areas in the Northern Transvaal. She asked whether it was possible for the Administrator to make special funds available for the thousands of Africans, particularly African children, who were suffering as the result of a two-year drought. The Administrator of the Transvaal in reply said that he was unable to do so because there was no vote under which such an amount could be voted. He was then asked by another Provincial Councillor whether or not special funds could be voted for this particular form of famine relief. The Administrator&#x2019;s reply was: &#x201C;if the Government will allow me, I can do that&#x201D;. I want to ask the Minister whether he can in fact, through his colleague&#x2014;I presume this will have to come through the Minister of Finance&#x2014;see that special funds are made available to the Transvaal Administration to relieve the position of the people in the Northern Transvaal. I also raise this matter because there was an article in the <i>Financial Mail</i> of the 17th of this month. So this is still very topical; it is not a disaster which has come and gone; it is still with us. These are still the results of a two year drought which has hit the Northern Transvaal. It has not only hit Black farmers but White farmers as well. This in turn has made the position worse because the White farmers are sacking their labourers since there are no crops to reap and they themselves are in financial difficulties. The result has been that thousands of labourers are returning to the reserves with no subsistence either. Those areas themselves cannot support their own population and they must now carry the additional burden of those farm labourers. The matter was brought to a head again by the Gereformeerde Kerk which raised this matter in the first week of May and stated that deficiency diseases such as kwashiorkor and pellagra were rife&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Food was so short that many people, mostly mothers and children, could eat only three meals a week which was usually a thin mealiemeal porridge.</block>

<p>The statement goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After more than two years of serious drought, a general food shortage has arisen in virtually the whole area north of Pietersburg.</block>

<p>The report goes on to say that the five hospitals in the Northern Transvaal area had, from September to February, treated 301 cases of kwashiorkor, mainly naturally children under five, and 1,224 cases of pellagra. As any nutritionist will tell the hon. Minister, as he probably knows himself anyway, the number of open cases treated for these diseases is simply a fraction of the total number of cases of malnutrition. Nutritional diseases only become really evident and really chronic after a certain time and in the meantime thousands of people are suffering from sub-clinical malnutrition. This is a common thing in any community which suffers the ill effects of malnourishment and malnutrition.</p>

<p>I know the Minister mentioned that relief had been sent; that a certain amount of food had been sent up. I am not sure whether it was he or the Deputy Minister who replied to me, when I asked about the unspent amount on the Vote over the last two years, and who said that when the food arrived there, the officials found that the position had been thoroughly exaggerated and that they were unable to find enough people to use the supplies. There seems to be a conflict of opinion here between the Gereformeerde Kerk, welfare societies and the people who live in the area and who have reported the state of famine which exists there. I think the hon. Minister is not sufficiently informed in this matter. I think the whole matter requires much more intensive investigation. I understand that this month alone the Government has despatched 500 bags of mealiemeal and 150 bags of concentrated proteins to Pietersburg for distribution. I am very glad indeed that that is so. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether this is a typical desptach for a day, for a week, for a month or what his intentions are, because obviously it is going to be a long time before the whole area recovers <span class="col_7003_7004" refersTo="page_0834"/>from the effects of the drought, before crops are again planted and reaped. During the ensuing months one can expect the famine or the food shortage to continue. I want to know whether this is going to be a continuous process; whether the Minister will get himself better informed on this subject as there seems to be a conflict of views on the extensiveness of the famine and the drought and whether he will do something about ensuring proper distribution in this area.</p>

<p>I am also not satisfied with the reply that I got that work was being provided in the area at 10c a day. As I have already said, I think you must first cure people from the effects of famine before you can get them to do hard physical work. In any case, Sir, the number of jobs that are being provided is out of all proportion to the number of people who require assistance. For instance, last year in the Potgietersrust area, 150 jobs were provided by the Department for several thousand unemployed Africans at 10c a day. So that is not even beginning to touch the problem. At the same time we are storing surpluses of maize. I see no reason why the Government should not advance sufficient funds&#x2014;the Minister certainly has funds at his disposal under his Vote&#x2014;to purchase the maize and to distribute it. It seems absurd to me that we should store surpluses, that we export nutritious foods at a loss to the overseas markets whereas we have this dreadful position at home.</p>

<p>I want two replies: Firstly, whether the Minister will see to it that a continuous supply of food is kept up during the ensuing months to that area and, secondly, if he is not prepared to do that, whether he will see to it that sufficient funds are made available to the Administrator of the Transvaal who apparently is prepared to undertake this work, and believes that it should be done, judging by the reply he gave in the Provincial Council.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will pardon me if I do not follow her because she put two specific questions to the hon. the Minister. I want to say immediately that it was not my intention to participate in this debate. This path has been crossed and recrossed so often by the Opposition that we are tired of having to reply to the same things time and time again. I feel however that if I do not reply to the reckless tirade and even more reckless accusation of the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) in regard to the farmers of the Western Province, I shall be betraying those people whom I represent here. I want to tell that hon. member that he is quite in order in discussing swimming baths in Sea Point but when he comes here and poses as the mouthpiece of the farmers of the Western Province, he is completely out of his element. I admit that he is a farmer. I admit that he can speak on behalf of one farmer in Porterville. But he has come along here and made certain accusations. He says that the farmers of the Cape adopt a certain attitude and I want to refute his statement most emphatically. I want to quote to him what the farmers of the North-Western Agricultural Union decided at their congress. I think that this is a body which is qualified to speak on behalf of our farmers, unlike the hon. member for Sea Point. Those people held their congress from 23 to 25 April 1963, and the following resolution was adopted [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The congress supports the policy of the gradual removal of the Bantu from the western Cape and discusses the mobilization and organization of Coloured labour in that area.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member what right he has to repudiate a resolution of a farmers&#x2019; congress and to come and tell us that the farmers of the western Cape want this, that or the other thing? If he could interpret their wishes, they would have sent him to Parliament and it would not have been necessary for him to find refuge in Sea Point. As a farmer he has the right to attend these congresses. He has the right to stand up there as a farmer and to tell the farmers what he said in this House to-day. Mr. Chairman, if he repeats there what he said here to-day, the farmers will murder him. I tell you, Mr. Chairman, that the farmers of the western Cape support the policy of the Government. The farmers are grateful to the Government for the way in which these things are being done. The farmers are grateful that there is such sound co-operation between the Department of this Minister and the Department of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs. The farmers are grateful that they are cooperating in an effort to supply the farmers with labour as and when the Bantu labourers are removed. The farmers are fully conscious of the necessity to have labour. We realize that there is work to do; we realize that preparations have to be made. That is what the Government is doing to-day and there is the closest liaison between the various Government Departments. On behalf of the farmers this evening I want to tell this House on the strength of the congress resolution that I have just quoted that the farmers of the Cape support the policy of the Government to remove the Bantu from the western Cape. They are greateful for what the Government is doing inter-departmentally to train other labour and to make it available to the farmers.</p>

<p>I want to challenge the hon. member this evening to make that statement at an agricultural congress. I wonder what would happen to him? He would be rejected; I am sure that he would not even be able to find a seconder for that motion unless it was some or other United Party supporter who would only second it for political purposes. I want to say here this evening that that was the most arrant nonsense that I have heard for some <span class="col_7005_7006" refersTo="page_0835"/>time. I want to go further and say that even if he feels bitter towards the farmers because they threw him out and sent him to the city, it is not necessary to accuse the farmers of a most reprehensible thing&#x2014;of stealing each other&#x2019;s labour. There is only one thing that farmers regard as being worse than stock theft and that is to steal another man&#x2019;s labour. The hon. member accused the farmers of the western Cape of stealing each other&#x2019;s farm labourers. He used the words, &#x201C;steal at night&#x201D;. I think the hon. member was being most reckless in accusing the farmers of the western Cape of not having the honesty to live together as farmers and of stealing each other&#x2019;s labourers at night. I want to lodge the strongest protest against that remark this evening. Unfortunately, I am unable to tell the hon. member in parliamentary language what I think of him. The hon. member made an accusation against the farmers this evening for which I can assure him they will not soon forgive him. They are quite likely to throw him into the Sea Point swimming pool if the other swimmers do not object! I think it is very funny that the hon. member should come along here and say that the Government is making things impossible for the farmers and that the farmers will never forgive us. I think it was yesterday evening that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) said that we were advocating a great policy but that we were not prepared to make great sacrifices. He stuck out his chest and spoke about sacrifices and of the great things that were expected of us, but, he said, we were too cowardly to make those sacrifices. He had hardly uttered those words when he heard just the opposite. That is so typical of the United Party. We hear one story for Johannesburg, one story for Cape Town and another story for the platteland of South Africa. We have had two different stories from them in two days. The hon. member for Sea Point will now be able to go out of this House and say what he said and the hon. member for Yeoville will be able to go to some other place and say what he said. The United Party is quoted in various ways. Sir, we have a policy. Our policy is to remove the Bantu from the western Cape gradually and to replace them with the available Coloured labour. The Government has never lost sight of the industrial interests of South Africa. It has always acted judiciously. It has always acted carefully but what can one do when one has to deal with an Opposition that cannot decide whether it is dissatisfied because we are moving too slowly, or that it is dissatisfied because we are moving too fast, or that it is dissatisfied because we are &#x201C;kaffinboeties&#x201D; or that it is dissatisfied because we are slave-drivers? We have to deal with an Opposition that cannot formulate its own policy, we find the sort of thing that has been happening in this House&#x2014;that we discuss a single Vote for days on end and that we make no headway. I think if in the future the Opposition want to become an asset to the Parliament of South Africa, they should frame one policy for themselves, they should not court the voters of Houghton one moment and the platteland voters the next moment That is their problem and if they want to continue along that road, then I want to tell them that they will lose all support in South Africa, and their road will be a cul-de-sac. In any case, I want to ask them please not to allow the hon. member for Sea Point to speak on behalf of the farmers again because if they do, they will alienate the farmers from them for ever. The farmers are not going to allow themselves to be abused and insulted, as was done here by the hon. member who made insinuations and accusations against them which are devoid of all truth.</p>

<p>In the light of the official position occupied by the <i>Burger</i> in the control of the Nationalist Party, I feel that I am more than justified to-day in asking the hon. Minister to tell us how far the editorial in the <i>Burger</i> of two days ago is in fact the policy of the Government. I want to say, if I may put it this way, that in a sense I am happy to see the <i>Burger</i> article, because it now bears out what we have been saying for so many long months past. We have been saying for months past that the policy of the Government is to lead to Natal becoming a Black area under Bantu domination, and it is clear from the leading article in the <i>Burger</i> that that is the course that they are planning and a course which they say is unavoidable. I think it is very strange, very peculiar that the <i>Burger</i> in its article should use precisely the same language that people like Tom Mboya and Nkrumah and leaders of the Bantu states who recently met at Addis Ababa use, precisely the same language. We, Sir, in Natal in this article are told that we must expect the common fate of all colonialists. We are told that we cannot believe that the minority of settlers can indefinitely continue to rule over an emerging nation which is being incited all over the world to take its freedom. We are being referred to as settlers by the <i>Burger,</i> colonialists, as a colonial power, and so forth.</p>

<p>I repeat that it is curious that the language used by the <i>Burger</i> is precisely the same language as that used by the African states to the north of us, and so is the concept, the concept of the Bantu there being urged from all over the world to take their freedom. So far as the Republic is oncerned, Sir, the first reference to freedom was made by Government spokesmen, including the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. I have said repeatedly in this House that there was not a responsible Native leader who ever asked for independence and freedom in the Republic of South Africa, before the words were put in their mouth by Ministers of this Government. I have challenged the Minister repeatedly in the past to give us the name of one leader. He has failed <span class="col_7007_7008" refersTo="page_0836"/>to do so. He cannot even show that the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) is the man who led the Bantu to this.</p>

<p>The hon.

It is the most influential paper which in many respects deals in advance with Government policy and gives a lead to the Government. It presents the policy which the Government follows. It is not an apologist after the events, but it sets out the line of policy that the Government follows. That being so, I want to ask the hon. Minister to let us know clearly whether in fact this article represents Government policy. And the plan is that because we are in the United Party and we resent the Government&#x2019;s policies of fragmentation of Natal until the small pieces of White land that are left there are untenable by the White man, under the plea that we are settlers, and all these other terms that have been used, we have got to go. Is that in fact the policy that the Government is following? We have said for a long time past that it is so and now we have the evidence by the <i>Burger</i> article.</p>

<p>It is hard to kow just precisely what view the Government takes so far as the mass of the Bantu people are concerned. Do they look upon them as agriculturists and pastoralists all over the Republic, except when they come to work in our towns, except when they work in a border industry? Do they only become urbanized, Sir, when they go to a European area? That is the point. Does the Government not see them ever in their own towns? The Government has laid out towns for the Bantu, but they never developed. They have got nothing to develop on. They have got no industries, they have got nothing to occupy them, they have got no gainful occupation which they can follow. Mr. Chairman, I hope that this is not a copyright, this article from the <i>Burger,</i> because curiously enough at about 10.30 last night I was having a great discussion with leaders of the Nationalist Party in northern Natal, when I said that was precisely the Government&#x2019;s policy, and they denied it. I only wish I had had this in my hands 24 hours earlier. This would have settled the whole of their case. You see, Sir, for the Government to paint a picture now of the Bantu of Natal seeking freedom to live as pastoralists and agriculturists is nonsense in the context of 1963. The European long ago learned that if he was to become industrialized he had to live under urban conditions, and the Bantu have got to learn exactly the same thing, and for the Government to paint a picture of the whole of Natal being handed over to a Zulustan, and the White man to get out, as it was put in the <i>Burger</i> article here &#x201C;in the national interest&#x201D;&#x2026;</p>

<p>Because this policy is the policy of the Government and he was aware of it. Was it then the case that he simply spoke out of turn, that he spoke too early? Not that he was wrong in his deductions, but he possibly spoke too soon? Is that what the Government is driving at? Is it then true that when Mr. Kruger was a candidate for the Senate and tried to get Native votes to be a Native Senator some years ago and he issued that memorandum to the Bantu voters, whose franchise he was seeking, and he told them that if he should be elected one of the first things he would do in the Senate would be to seek to get the coastal lands of <span class="col_7009_7010" refersTo="page_0837"/>Natal being handed back to them because they belong to the Bantu and not to the White man&#x2014;is it true that that was actually Nationalist policy?

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>The motion that we are discussing here, that the salary of the hon. Minister be reduced by R5,000, compels me to put a question to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who is not here at the moment. I want to ask him whether he is not ashamed and whether his party is not ashamed to move a motion of this nature in this House after having voted unanimously for the so-called Sabotage Act which caused them to lose one of their front-benchers? There is a very close connection between the motion that we are discussing now and the action of the United Party in connection with that Bill which was placed on the Statute Book with their support, and I am going to tell hon. members what that connection is. It would not have been necessary to place that Sabotage Act on the Statute Book of South Africa if this hon. Minister and his predecessor, the hon. the Prime Minister, had not succeeded in creating peace and friendship and confidence between the Bantu and the White man in South Africa. If that had not happened, such an Act would not have been necessary because we had these movements in South Africa before the two hon. Ministers whom I have just mentioned were given the responsibility of the task that now rests on the shoulders of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. We had the days when the Communist Party was able to operate lawfully in South Africa; then we had the days when that party was prevented by legislation from continuing as a party; we had the days when the Communist Party and all its satellite organizations went underground. There is no denying the fact that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x2014;I say again that he was the successor of the hon. the Prime Minister who started this forceful effort to give practical effect to the policy of the National Party&#x2014; succeeded in creating peace and friendship and mutual confidence between the Bantu and the White man in South Africa, and in doing so he forced that subversive Communist Party to put out its head again just like a tortoise when its back is scratched. In the days when the Transvaal was threatened by a Jameson raid, someone put a question to the late President Kruger at a meeting. He asked: &#x201C;What are you going to do with the people on our borders?&#x201D; President Kruger&#x2019;s reply was: &#x201C;If you want to kill a tortoise, wait until it puts out its head and then chop its head off.&#x201D; The hon. the Minister waited. With the work done by him and his predecessor they succeeded in scratching the back of the tortoise with the result that it put out his head. The hon. the Minister of Justice then came along and introduced legislation to cut off the head of the tortoise, and the whole of the United Party voted for that Bill. We placed it on the Statute Book with their help; they lost one of their front-benchers because of that and now they come along and move that the head of the hon. the Minister, who is responsible for the fact that the tortoise has again put out its head in South Africa, should be cut off. Mr. Chairman, this is a ridiculous position. I just want to say that I came to know the hon. the Minister for the first time at the general election in 1938. I can well remember that at that time he was an organizer of the National Party in the Transvaal, and I went there to help him. On one occasion he held a meeting on the platteland and when he returned, the late Senator van Niekerk, who was the chief secretary, asked him: &#x201C;Daan, how did things go?&#x201D; His reply was: &#x201C;Very well; the meeting was small; there were only three people at the meeting but the spirit was very good.&#x201D; I want to say that the hon. the Minister knows the art of interpreting the spirit of the people of South Africa. Ten years after he had addressed a meeting of three people and had come back to report that the meeting was small but that the spirit was good, the National Party came into power, although in 1938 it won only one seat in the Transvaal&#x2014;Waterberg, the seat of the late Advocate Strydom. I repeat that the hon. the Minister knows the art of interpreting the spirit of the people of South Africa. Because he and his predecessor, the hon. the Prime Minister, have succeeded in creating peace and friendship towards, and confidence on the part of the Bantu in, the White man in South Africa, that underground movement has been compelled to come to the surface again. And now that it has come to the surface, every hon. member in this House can bear witness as to what has happened to it. We have lopped off the head of that tortoise. I want to say that instead of the Committee adopting this motion which proposes a reduction of R5,000 in the salary of the hon. Minister we should increase his salary by R5,000, and if the rules of the House had permitted me to do so, I would move accordingly.</p>

<p>He did not, but it would have been equally irrelevant if he had spoken about me. So, Mr. Chairman, in deference to you, I intend to deal with the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. The hon. Minister, when all else fails, turns to the ethical side of the policy of the Government <span class="col_7011_7012" refersTo="page_0838"/>that he has to implement, and he has made many speeches in the recent past to demonstrate, or to attempt to demonstrate, the ethical value of the policy of apartheid and specifically the creation of an independent Bantustan, to be followed by others, and more specifically in regard to the consequences which must flow from the implementation of that policy, the removal of people&#x2014;as if they were inanimate, like bags of mealies. And, Sir, it is the &#x201C;ethical&#x201D; aspect of his policy that I would like to discuss with him, very briefly.</p>

<p>A few days ago this hon. Minister, in attacking the hon. Leader of the Opposition, said to him: You want to look only at the economy of South Africa and you want to protect only economy of South Africa, and that is (as he called it) the &#x201C;Esau-beleid&#x201D;, in other words, the policy of a man who was prepared to sell his birthright. The hon. Minister, I recall, has often said to us on this side of the House, &#x201C;you do not read enough&#x201D;, I believe that many of us read too much&#x2014; perhaps, too much of the speeches made by the hon. Minister and others on that side&#x2014; but it seems to me that the hon. Minister, who has always struck me as a devout man, does not read enough in his Bible. If he had read the Bible recently, he would not have tried to pin this charge of an &#x201C;Esau-beleid&#x201D; on my honourable Leader, because if you look at the Esau-Jacob incident, the boot is somewhat on the other foot! Here we have it, Genesis, Chapter XXV, from verse 31&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And Jacob said, sell me this day thy birthright. And Esau said, behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall this birthright do to me? And Jacob said, swear to me this day; and he swear unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob. Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.</block>

<p>This is what I want to tell the hon. Minister. The birthright of South Africa and of the people of South Africa, of the hon. Minister as well as myself, of everybody in this House, everybody in this country&#x2014;is South Africa, a country of 475,000 sq. miles, which Providence has ordained shall have a population at the present time of some 15,000,000 people, of whom approximately over 3,000,000 are White, 1,500,000 are Coloured, 500,000 are Indian and 10,500,000 are Black, Bantu&#x2014;and now, who is trying to sell the birthright of South Africa?</p>

<p>Who is busy giving away the birthright of South Africa? Who is carving up this birthright of South Africa in order to create Bantustans? The hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, or my honourable Leader, who has opposed that policy&#x2014;as we all have done and still do to this day&#x2014;to the utmost? Who is giving away or selling this birthright? In case the answer is not clear, I say categorically that if ever there was a case by which that proverb about selling your birthright&#x2014;and remember it originated from this Biblical incident&#x2014;was perfectly illustrated, it is certainly the case of the policy of this Government in terms of its present attitude to the Bantu people of South Africa, and the so-called freedom they will get and which in consequence must mean the complete dismemberment of South Africa as a geographical and as an ethnological entity, and which must also mean the &#x201C;removal&#x201D; of people. And that is the point I want to deal with now. Of course, you cannot have this apartheid policy and you cannot discuss it, let alone implement it, without this constant talk of &#x201C;verwydering&#x201D;, removal. Now does the hon. Minister ever think about this in the knowledge that he is going to remove, in terms of the policy of the Prime Minister, not sacks of mealies, but human beings? And has he any idea of how many people he is going to remove like that? Has he ever tried to contemplate this in terms of what he calls the ethics of the case, in terms of human values? If he has not, I would like to suggest to him &#x2014;with very great respect&#x2014;that he must then not make statements of this sort&#x2014;if he has not considered the ethical aspect of removing human beings.&#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, here is a very lengthy statement. I was accused the other day by Mr. Speaker of reading a newspaper. It was not a newspaper. It is the <i>South African Patriot,</i> which I happen to get from time to time, and here is a very lengthy statement by the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and Development&#x2014;two pages of it, virtually half of this journal&#x2014;in which he says, among other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding the opinions of uninformed critics and misrepresentations by agitators, this Act (the Transkeian Constitution Act), and its implementation stands as a spotless monument to White South Africa&#x2019;s honesty and its sacrifices in utilizing the White taxpayer&#x2019;s money to buy properties belonging to Whites in order to promote and fulfil South Africa&#x2019;s traditional, unselfish, honest and Christian policy of &#x201C;live and let the Bantu also live in this, our common fatherland&#x201D;,</block>

<p>This is what the Minister said in March of this year, the Minister who always tells us about his high ethical scruples. He said or wrote in March/April of this year, for anybody to read: &#x201C;The Bantu live in this, our common fatherland.&#x201D; What does that mean, <span class="col_7013_7014" refersTo="page_0839"/>except that it is their birthright to live in South Africa, as much as his and mine? If the fatherland is common to them as well as to us, the White people, why all this talk about &#x201C;verwydering&#x201D;, all this talk about removal? And why the accusation against my honourable Leader, when he points&#x2014;among other things&#x2014;to the economic consequences of this policy, if implemented, not only to the Whites but also to the Bantu&#x2014;why say to him &#x201C;dit is &#x2019;n Esau-beleid&#x201D;? In other words, &#x201C;you have not got the moral scruples or ethical principles that I have Furthermore, I want to tell you that there is so much evidence here of this kind of, shall I say, completely immoral indulgence in moral arguments&#x2014;I cannot put it any higher than that&#x2014;that I think, with great respect to the hon. Minister, that it is time that he took another line. If he said to us, for example, that his policy was to remove the Bantu from this, that or the other area&#x2014; eventually a &#x201C;removal&#x201D; of 6,000,000 people, because that is what the hon. member for Vereeniging told us within the last 48 hours&#x2014; and that he is prepared to do so regardless of any ethical or moral scruples, then I, for one, as a simple-minded man, would understand it, and so would the hon. member for Vereeniging, who is not nearly as simple as I am. Then the Minister would be telling us the truth&#x2014;that regardless of the ethical immorality or lack of ethical morality, if I may put it that way, he is determined to remove these people at any price and under any circumstances and at any cost, to them and ourselves, the White people. But no! He poses here as the great exponent of ethics, and I, for one, feel that it is high time that that kind of double-talk, and some of the other things the hon. Minister says in his more amiable moments, should be exposed, once and for all.</p>

<p>Before I come to the hon. member who has just sat down, I want to reply to the extremely stupid attack of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E.

I thought that he had read the article in Afrikaans and that that was why he did not understand precisely what it contained, but he read the article as it was translated in the <i>Cape Times</i> and I challenge him now to quote from that article to prove that the <i>Burger</i> stated that the inhabitants of Natal were a group of settlers. The <i>Burger</i> said that that was the attitude of the United Party, the attitude of the hon. member for South Coast. The <i>Burger</i> did not say that it was the attitude of the National Party. And it said that if the hon. member for South Coast adopted that attitude, it would lead to the destruction of the White man in Natal. Now he contends that the <i>Burger</i> stated that it was the policy of the National Party to accuse the White people in Natal of being a group of settlers. That is completely untrue.

<p>Yes, I shall read further. The newspaper says that the position in Natal is difficult. It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are sorry, but on that basis the people of Natal have no right to call in the aid of the rest of South Africa.</block>

<p>That is to say, according to that attitude of regarding themselves as colonialists, just as the people in Kenya regarded themselves as settlers. But the newspaper goes on to give the attitude of the National Party. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If they want to be colonialists and to remain the permanent bosses of the Black majority, with or without the pretext that they and those people are and can become one nation, they should expect the common fate of all colonialists.</block>

<p>What is wrong with that? What is wrong with their adopting that attitude? That is what the <i>Burger</i> says, &#x201C;If they adopt that attitude&#x201D;. Here we have a typical example of &#x201C;honesty&#x201D;. The accusation of the hon. member for South Coast against the <i>Burger</i> was that the <i>Burger</i> had said that the people in Natal were a group of colonialiists and settlers. The <i>Burger</i> said just the opposite. The <i>Burger</i> said that if they adopted that attitude, if they thought that they could retain permanent authority over those people, then they regarded themselves as colonialists. If they applied the policy of the hon. member for South Coast they would suffer the same fate as all the colonialists and settlers. The <i>Burger</i> did not say that they were a group of settlers. The <i>Burger</i> went on to explain the policy of the National Party and it recommended what Natal should do&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a better approach for the White Natalians. That is not to play at being colonialists in the last ditch, as British settlers elsewhere did in vain, but to face their bitter problem within the national complex. They are a nation which wants to remain free but cannot do so on the basis of permanent colonial supremacy under a Black majority.</block>

<p><span class="col_7015_7016" refersTo="page_0840"/>This is just the opposite of what the hon. member for South Coast said but now he wants to make people believe that we say that the people in Natal are a group of settlers. The fact is that he wants to behave like a settler and a colonialist. He thinks that he can do in Natal and in South Africa what has not been successfully done anywhere else, and that is to keep those people in a state of permanent subjugation, to retain permanent authority over them without giving them any rights at all. The attitude of the National Party, as clearly stated by the <i>Burger,</i> is that Natal&#x2019;s problems are difficult because there is not only one Bantu area there as is the case in the Transkei. But one has to give those people their own homelands where they can develop to the best of their ability and it will only be on that basis that the Whites in Natal will be able to maintain their position. If that party thinks that they can keep the Black men in South Africa in a state of subjugation they will suffer the same fate as Kenya and the Federation. The only solution is to give those people their own area in which they can develop. That is the only way to maintain the position of the White man. I think that the hon. member for South Coast will be man enough to stand up and to say that he completely misinterpreted that article.</p>

<p>I understand that the hon. member for Germiston-District (Mr. Tucker) attacked me yesterday for having said that it was the policy of the Government to remove the Black man not only from the western Cape but also from the rest of the White areas in South Africa. I stand by every word that I said. I said that that was the eventual pattern that we were striving to achieve. Our aim is to be able to do without the Bantu and if the Bantu come to the Republic, they will come here with one purpose only and that is to sell their labour here. Their home is in their homelands. I want to mention this example to the hon. member. Take the position of the Indians who came to this country. They have created an impossible position because we can do nothing with them; we cannot send them back to India. But we are following just the opposite policy with the Bantu. We are establishing national homelands for them and as far as it is possible to do so and in conformity with moral and ethic standards, we will try to send them back to their homelands. If they come to the Republic to work, they will come here of their own free will and they will come here as migrant labourers to fulfil a contract. Once that contract expires, unless they enter into another contract, they must return to their homelands. The hon. member asks how long this will take. I do not know. It may take 100 years. It is a tremendous process, but that is our policy. They are here as migrant labourers, as temporary labourers, to fulfil a certain function, and once they have done so, they will return to their homelands. If they want to come back here again, they can do so, but they have no other right here than to sell their labour.</p>

<p>I will read what I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because our policy is not only to remove the Bantu from the Cape but eventually from the whole of the White area of South Africa.</block>

<p>If our policy is to remove every Basuto, does it mean a Basuto cannot come here to work? Why cannot we recruit them to work on the mines? Our policy is to remove every Nyasa from the country, but does that mean that they will not be able to work on the mines? We will try to reduce those 6,000,000 as far as possible. Hon. members opposite say that there will still be 6,000,000 Bantu in the White areas. They will be here, but they will be here as migrant labour and they will have no other rights here. If they want political rights, they can exercise those rights in their own homelands. What is so strange about that? I want to refer the hon. member for Green Point to Switzerland. There are 5,000,000 Swiss in Switzerland and there are 3,000,000 living outside of the country but they still remain Swiss citizens. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>We will leave it to the people to decide. I have yet to learn that a man acts dishonourably if he fights for his country. Did we act dishonourably in the last war when we fought for this country?</p>

<p>But I want to get on to something else. Some time ago the Bantu Chiefs in Zululand held a meeting with a view to discussing the acceptance of the Minister&#x2019;s proposals for establishing a territorial authority. The meeting was addressed by the Commissioner-<span class="col_7017_7018" refersTo="page_0841"/>General for Zululand and by Chief Cyprian and by other speakers. Eventually a proposal moved by one chief was accepted that the chiefs should go back to their tribes and hold tribal gatherings so that the tribesmen could decide whether they would accept the territorial authorities in Zululand. They wanted the Zulus themselves to decide for themselves, tribe by tribe, whether they should accept these Bantu authorities. I want to ask the Minister whether that proposal was brought to his notice, and if so whether he is allowing the chiefs an opportunity, each in his own area, to put the proposal to his own tribe without interference and without undue influence to get them to accept that particular point of view. Is the Minister permitting the tribes each to have their own gatherings and to decide whether they want it? Because I want to say at once that there are some very unfortunate stories going around already about certain pressure which is being brought to bear, and I think it is right that the Minister should disallow it at once and say that no official pressure is being brought to bear on any of the chiefs to persuade the headmen and the elders to accept tribal authorities, and that they will be left entirely free to decide for themselves. We have lived in peace and harmony with the Zulus in Natal ever since the Bambato Rebellion in 1906, and we resent the steps being taken now because of this policy of the Government which is being forced on these people who do not want it. The suggestion was turned down flat at this meeting, until there was this suggestion that it be left to the tribes to decide. That is the feeling in Zululand. The people there do not want this political disturbance. They want to live in harmony with us. This article written by the <i>Burger</i> is just a lot of Nationalist nonsense and a story which the <i>Burger</i> hopes will be accepted by the Afrikaans people who are its readers. We are not concerned with whether history put the Zulus in Natal. What we are concerned with is whether we can live in peace and harmony with them. Is the administration of the Government such that we can live as multi-racial people in South Africa in harmony with each other, or are they going to have thrust down their throats, whether they like it or not, the concept of self-governing, independent Bantu states, or will they be permitted to carry on their normal life and to carry on the economy of South Africa in conformity with the dear old standards laid down by our forefathers where we work together happily without disagreement. That is all the Bantu want. The Zulus are the most law-abiding and decent Bantu people in the Republic. Why disturb them with this foreign concept? Why tell the Bantu that the White people of Natal are colonialists and settlers and use the terms used by Tom Mboya and Nkrumah? Why disturb this peace-loving race of Natal? Why give them the idea that they are being preyed upon by White vultures? They only want to live in peace and harmony and to get a job that they can keep and a decent standard of living. They are happy and satisfied and they have never asked for anything else. But no, the Minister will not have it. Will the Minister make it clear that the Bantu can discuss this matter without any pressure whatsoever being brought to bear on them? I hope he will give a perfectly clear answer to that question, because the Bantu want to know where they stand in this regard. The chiefs fear that their lives will become unbearable because the Government is trying to force its will on them. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast is very upset because the <i>Burger</i> stated that the policy of the United Party and of the leadership of the United Party in Natal was that of colonialism. But what is the policy of the United Party if it is not precisely what the British policy in Africa was? We had the position in South Africa that the British policy of political integration was followed here, a policy in terms of which Black and White enjoyed equal political rights, and it took this nation of ours a century to break down that system of political integration. We had the 1913 Act to restrict the property rights of Whites and Bantu to their respective areas. After that we had the removal of the Bantu from the Common Roll and then the removal of the Coloureds from the Common Roll; we also had the Population Registration Act and in 1959 we had the removal of the Natives Representatives from Parliament. Only then did we reach the stage where the pattern of political integration had been broken down. The declared policy of the United Party today is to restore that pattern of political integration in South Africa. They say clearly that every single measure that we passed to do away with political integration and to establish a pattern of separate development will be repealed if they come into power. The United Party say that they are going to bring the Natives&#x2019; Representatives; they are going to repeal the Population Registration Act and they are going to put the Coloureds back on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. They go so far as to say that they will violate the provisions of the 1913 Act by giving the Bantu property rights in the White man&#x2019;s area. That can mean only one thing and that is that the United Party are seeking to restore the whole pattern of political integration which Britain set up in the Cape Colony. That is the same pattern that was established here in the Cape by Britain and that was foisted on to Rhodesia. There they also obtained a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll with limited franchise for the Bantu through the medium of property and educational qualifications. They raised the qualifications at a later stage, just as was done in the Cape when the number of Bantu voters became too large but the difference between South Africa and Rhodesia is that we did not leave the matter at that but broke down the British pattern of political integration. Not only did we try to avoid the necessity for that system by the manipulation of franchise qualifications; we broke it down. That is why we <span class="col_7019_7020" refersTo="page_0842"/>are in a different position to Rhodesia to-day. We will be in the same position as Rhodesia to-day if we restore that pattern of political integration as the United Party wants to do. That is why the hon. member for South Coast must not become upset when we say that the United Party policy is a continuation of the colonial policy, because that is precisely what it is. The United Party considers itself to be the heir to British colonialism in South Africa. That is the only interpretation that one can attach to its policy. The United Party says that with its race federation plan it is taking what is best from Liberal policy and from National policy, and that is the policy that it wants to give South Africa. But I want to put this question to the hon. member for South Coast: What part of the National Party&#x2019;s policy of separate development is included in the race federation plan if the United Party makes it its policy to undo every step that this Government has taken to establish a pattern of separate development? They may think that they can manipulate things but if their policy is to abolish the population register and to give the urban Bantu representation in this House, they will be opening the two channels which carried Rhodesia to the point where its former Prime Minister said that it would have a Black Government within 15 years.</p>

<p>The most remarkable fact of all this is that when the hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke during the non-confidence debate and the hon. the Minister of Justice asked him whether the former Prime Minister of Rhodesia had not said that there would be a Black Government there within 15 years, he said &#x201C;Yes, that might be so&#x201D;. &#x201C;But who had started Rhodesia along that road, was it not Great Britian&#x201D;? he asked. That is true, and what hon. members opposite do not want to realize is that they also want to place South Africa on that road by means of precisely the same policy that Britain applied in Rhodesia. [Interjections.] I am not discussing the unimportant details of race federation. The essence of United Party policy is political integration such as was forced upon Rhodesia by Britain. I told the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) yesterday that his leader and deputy leader had said that it was their policy to give the Bantu representation in this House and to absorb them in the Cabinet and I shall read it to them again if they want to hear it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not respond to the last speaker as I am concerned with the policy of the Government, and not with a leading article in the <i>Burger.</i> Having listened for a long time to hon. members opposite over the past two days, and to the Minister for even longer, on the subject of the Government&#x2019;s Bantustan policy, I can only say that the country will find this Bantustan &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D; a barren thing, a sort of political cross-breed, a sort of political mule which can only engender kicks and nothing else. But the unfortunate position is that these kicks will be felt individually by those persons who played no part in formulating this policy, and it will be felt collectively by the economy of the country as a whole. I want to deal with facts and figures, and I wish to raise with the Minister certain matters which fall within the ambit of his vote and which bear on statements which he made when replying particularly to the hon. member for Jeppes.</p>

<p>The Minister spoke with enthusiasm about the present and the coming economic development of the Bantu areas and he spoke of cities growing up which would be larger than Durban. He brushed aside criticism that the removal of Bantu from the so-called White areas would bring about unemployment and distress in the Bantu areas. He claimed that tertiary industry was developing very rapidly in those areas, and he painted a picture of a happy and industrious community developing there. If that is so, will the Minister explain why the published figures of the Bantu Investment Corporation present a very different state of affairs? Those figures reflect a very small and slow business progress in the Bantu areas, so slow that one is tempted to say it is dead <span class="col_7021_7022" refersTo="page_0843"/>slow. At the end of March 1963 the Corporation had been in operation for nearly four years, but the latest figures available are for the year ended March 1962. The Minister saw fit during the year ended March 1962 to increase the share capital of the Corporation from R1,000,000 to R2,000,000, and yet at the end of that year R1,500,000 of that money was being invested in Escom and other Government stocks, in building societies and with the Public Debt Commissioners. In other words, the whole of the increased share capital and about half of the original share capital was being used to finance White development and was not being used for Bantu development. I accept that the Minister is not charged with a day-to-day running of the Corporation. That duty falls on the Board of Directors which is appointed by the Minister and which is answerable to no one else but the Minister. In fact, the House will recollect that the Minister can override the decision of the directors and substitute his own decision therefor. In those circumstances I think the Minister is answerable to this House in regard to the financial transactions of the Corporation. But I quote the figures I have given because they give a very different picture of the economic progress in the Bantu areas from what the Minister has told us. In actual fact, loans and advances actually paid over to Bantu undertakings as at the end of March 1962 amounted to about R210,000.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the Committee adjourned for supper I had pointed out that at the end of March 1962, after nearly three years&#x2019; operation the Corporation&#x2019;s outlay in respect of loans and advances to Bantu undertakings totalled R210,000, whereas the sum expended on fixed assets&#x2014; and I quote from the Account&#x2014;that is to say &#x201C;Land and buildings, machinery and equipment, office and sundry equipment and motor vehicles&#x201D;&#x2014;totalled R220,000. In other words, although the amount the Corporation had invested in fixed assets which I take to be capital assets and not trading assets, had expanded from R7,000 to nearly R25,000 in a single year, the outlay&#x2014;for the very purpose it was established, namely to assist Bantu business undertakings&#x2014;stood at a lower figure of R210,000. It is quite true that a new venture during the year is disclosed under the heading &#x201C;Current Assets&#x201D;which deals with the purchase of what is called &#x201C;stock-in-trade&#x201D; for resale to Bantu business undertakings. The outlay for &#x201C;stock-in-trade&#x201D; stood at R133,000 at the end of the year, but the published statements contain no trading account, so presumably no trading took place. I mention these details because they are so wholly different, and present such a wholly different picture of business development in these areas from those presented to this House by the hon. the Minister in such glowing terms. As I have indicated, the board of directors is appointed by the hon. the Minister. They are answerable to nobody else but the hon. the Minister. I think that the House is therefore entitled to some explanation not of day-to-day transactions, but of general financial administration in broad outline such as I have dealt with. When doing so, I hope the hon. the Minister will also explain how the Corporation which made a loss of some R5,000 during the year was able to set aside R50,000 to provide for doubtful debts. I have always understood that provisions of that nature are made from profits, whereas in this particular case the board seems to have appropriated some R35,000 of share capital merely in order to balance its accounts. As I have said, the reserves normally come from profits and the board of directors is here dealing with public money. It is money which is voted by Parliament and which goes to the South African Native Trust. It is then invested by the South African Native Trust in this corporation. Therefore, as a shareholder in this concern, I can only say that I found the transactions impossible to understand and nor are they very gratifying to me. I hope the hon. the Minister will explain the position. The Coloured Development Corporation which was established during 1961 and which at the same date&#x2014;31 March 1962&#x2014;had operated for only six months presents a picture which is worth making comparisons with. In that case the Share Capital is only R500,000. It is true that that body had been operating for only six months and that the only active outlay was R15,000 to directors, being directors&#x2019; remuneration, yet the board had before it at that date 103 applications for financial assistance totalling R576,000. The comparable figure for the Bantu Investment Corporation on 31 March 1962, that is to say having operated for nearly three years, was 138 applications for financial assistance totalling R403,000. The figures are comparable and interesting because they establish beyond doubt precisely the point which has been made by this side of the House. The Coloured Development Corporation is operating in the so-called White areas where the economy is active and dynamic even though it may be no longer full of vigour. It is that state of the economy which accounts for the number of applications that are being investigated by the Coloured Development Corporation in comparison with the number being dealt with by the Bantu Investment Corporation which is operating in an area where the economy is stagnant. It is not stagnant because the inhabitants of the area are Black. It is stagnant because the natural resources, the capital and the know-how are being employed in the areas outside those areas. I can only say that it seems to me that it is safer to look at the financial operating results of the coporation than to listen to the glib words of the hon. the Minister if we are to judge what the <span class="col_7023_7024" refersTo="page_0844"/>economic progress&#x2014;present and potential&#x2014;is in these Bantu areas. I quote those figures because they are reliable figures. They cannot be disputed, but they do represent a situation which is vastly different from that which the hon. the Minister has given to the House.</p>

<p>I should like to raise one other matter with the hon. the Minister and it relates to the Estimates presented to the House. The hon. the Prime Minister announced yesterday in this House that the Transkei Bill had now become law. It is obvious that it is going to come into operation at some time in the near future, but certainly before Parliament reassembles again. It is equally obvious that at the stage at which the financial provisions of the Act are brought into operation, moneys must be provided under appropriation by this Parliament to the Transkei Government. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister this question. Is any of the money provided in Vote No. 26 designed to be made available to the Transkei Government or not, or is the hon. the Minister going to introduce additional Estimates during the current Session to make provision for funds for that purpose? The second question I should like to ask the hon. the Minister is this: A substantial amount of money is being provided for both on Revenue Account and on Loan Account. When these Estimates were framed did they take into account that in the near future the Transkei is going to have a separate financial administration of its own and that in so far as this House is concerned, moneys must be appropriated to it? The hon. the Minister was at pains a few weeks ago to say that the amount of money handled in the Transkei would not be less than it is to-day and although he did not give us figures, he had a very big book which was called the &#x201C;Doomsday Book&#x201D;. In spite of his big book he could not tell us what the figures were. I think this is a further opportunity for the hon. the Minister to tell us precisely what is contained in the present Estimates, both on Revenue Account and on Loan Account, that is going to be dealt with and handed over as an appropriation from this Parliament to the Transkei Government and if no provision is being made, was there over-provision because the Transkei is now becoming a separate financial entity, or are we going to have before us additional Estimates in which the picture of what has transpired so far as parliamentary appropriation is concerned will be revealed? I hope the hon. the Minister will deal with the matter and give us the information which I have asked him for.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to address the hon. the Minister on his policy with regard to border industries. Yesterday the hon. the Minister said that labour was being wasted in South Africa because of the typical colonial attitude that non-Whites should provide labour while foreign powers collected profits. The hon. the Minister went on to say that this was the thing the Government was setting its face against. He said there was no moral foundation for this policy and the Government rejected it in every way. The Government wanted to create opportunities for every section of the population to develop to the fullest extent. It was not only doing this because it realized that the other policies amounted to suicide, but also because it believed that there should be a moral foundation to any Government policy. He said that if the non-White had to be looked on merely as a source of labour, it would be impossible for him to have the necessary respect for the White to live alongside him. Non-Whites would work for themselves in their own areas. What I want to know from the hon. the Minister is this, namely how he squares that with his border area policies, because surely these people who are going to work in these border industries are going to work for White businesses, or is this only a temporary phase? What we are anxious to find out is what criteria are supplied by the hon. the Minister in determining what are border area industries. We have not been able to get from this Minister of the Minister of Economic Affairs what factors decide what is a border area. We have been told by this Minister in the past that Durban is not regarded as a border area, but Durban has Native reserves contiguous to its boundary. East London has been told that it is an area recognized as a border development area, but East London also has reserves contiguous to its boundary. What I want to know from the Minister is this: When is an area not a border area, or when is an area a border area? It is very difficult to follow because Durban is not regarded as a border area although the reserves are contiguous to it. Pinetown is not regarded as a border area although the Minister of Economic Affairs has indicated that it might be considered as such. Hammersdale, which has the same Bantu reserve contiguous to the Hammersdale area, is regarded as a border area and yet Pinetown, which shares the same common boundary with the reserve, is not regarded as a border area. It is very difficult to follow both from the point of view of the industrialist and from the point of view of the worker. The Bantu is very concerned about his future. In the reserves he has security. He has the security of communal life. He has the tribal discipline, but he has a very low standard of living. Virtually, in many cases, he has poverty and the Minister is concerned about poverty. That is why he is talking about establishing industries in the reserves in order to relieve poverty. In the towns the Bantu has no security. He has a communal life which is a communal life on sufferance. His communal life is based entirely on the will of the Minister of his Department as to when they are going to be endorsed out. He has little discipline, except that which is enforced by the police because there is very little opportunity to exert discipline amongst the community as a whole. Little wonder that recently Mr. Van Vuuren, M.E.C. for the Transvaal, stressed that the Bantu in the towns are in a sort of &#x201C;no man&#x2019;s land&#x201D;. He said: &#x201C;hy is nog n&#x00EA;rens tuis nie, van niks seker nie; sy stamen tradisieverband is <span class="col_7025_7026" refersTo="page_0845"/>verbreek en hy het homself nog nie weer gevind nie&#x2026; hulle hunker na vastigheid en sekuriteit&#x201D;. Surely, if that is a correct summing-up of what the position of the Bantu in the towns is, it throws a big responsibility on the Minister and particularly when we have heard earlier on, in the course of this discussion, the member for Vereeniging saying categorically that eventually all the Bantu will go back to their homelands.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Chairman, in a 100 years&#x2019; time, but the member for Cradock can bleat as much as he likes. What we are concerned with is this question of security. I shall draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a summing up given in a book recently published by a sociologist, Gussman, where he says this:</p>

<block name="quote">It is not only ambition that drives a European to work harder and to desire to take the first prize. There are also a number of other complex and interlocking factors. Chief of these are the desire for status, that is achieved by the possession of wealth, and the achievement of security in the future. The motives prompting an African to work were quite different, although just as natural to his way of living as are the motives of Europeans to theirs. The African never thought of the future in terms of saving up or putting by. Had he done so individually he would inevitably have caused a dislocation in tribal equilibrium, for there would have been some individuals more successful than others, and some again who were not successful at all. There were, therefore, four good reasons why he made no provision for the time ahead. The first was this question of equilibrium. Secondly, there were no facilities for storing up possessions above a certain minimum subsistence level. Thirdly, any surplus that could be built up would always be something of an invitation to plunder by a tribe or group more powerful than the saver&#x2019;s own. Financially, very few people grew to an old age in which they became enfeebled or incapacitated&#x2026;</block>

<p>and the community looked after them. The difficulty with the Bantu in the towns is that they feel that they have no security there. They go to the towns for the wealth which they can get there and they have to make the choice between the security and poverty of the reserves and a better financial position, but no security in the towns. As long as the Minister is going to talk about the evacuation of these people from the Cape or from the areas in Natal or the Transvaal&#x2014;it matters not which&#x2014;he is going to continue this feeling of insecurity and so long as there is this feeling of insecurity, you will not get sound financial development be they border industries or any other kind of industry. For example, I should like to know from the Minister: When he establishes a border industry, who are given jobs in that border industry? Are the jobs confined to those Bantu in that reserve? Let us take Hammarsdale as an example, Bantu are recruited for the Hammarsdale factory. Are the employers required to recruit only those Bantu from that tribal area? If that is his policy it is not being carried out. People are being taken on at these factories. They work for a short time, or they may work for a longer time&#x2014;a year or 18 months. They are dismissed and they become in many cases loungers on the fringe and if the hon. the Minister goes to Hammarsdale he will see slums developing there already. There are slums in Hammarsdale. There are shacks in Hammarsdale. There are tin shanties in Hammarsdale and they are not an advertisement for the Minister. It is all very well for the Minister to say that he has a plan to build houses, but the factories have come first. The sewerage has come a bad second and the houses have come a very bad last. How can you talk about planning border industries when the very people you are trying to help have shocking conditions and when you are not allocating the jobs to people from that area? We are dealing with a human problem and anybody who knows anything about industry knows that if you are going to get efficiency you must have continuity of employment. The development of the large industries overseas has shown that skills have been acquired over generations. There are many factories in South Africa where African, Coloured and Indian people are the second and third generations employed there. They have acquired skills. They have developed pride of performance in the factory in which they have been employed and they have encourged their children to follow them. The Minister has been overseas and he knows that the great industries in Europe have developed their present high standards because, not only have they had high technical efficiency but they have a good managerial status at the top.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to reply to the hon. member. I want to continue my speech of yesterday. I want to say this, Mr. Chairman. Having heard all the remarks and speeches of the hon. members on the other side, I should like to say that long before the foreign winds started blowing across Africa, South Africa, through the Nationalist Party had adopted the policy of homelands of the Bantu as their own property and of putting the Bantu on the road of full self-development. I should like to emphasize that whatever they may say, whatever their accusations against us may be, South Africa is not prepared to grant powers and responsibilities to immature people which they cannot cope with. That is a definite statement and I should like to emphasize that. The United Party wants race federation. In the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in 1961 he defined the aims of his race federation policy in these words:</p>

<block name="quote">So that different races could live within one state in South Africa on the basis of <span class="col_7027_7028" refersTo="page_0846"/>White leadership with consultation with non-Whites along with having a say in the Government machinery and sharing of civilization with responsible non-Whites.</block>

<p>In connection with this, Mr. Chairman, I want to add this. What a rosy picture and what a paradise of concord and amity! The hon. members on the other side are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise, but I want to add something to that. What a conglomeration of abstractions! I want to give due credit to the hon. Leader of the Opposition for what he says, but I read these speeches, as I do all the other hon. members&#x2019; speeches. I go through them. I take their Hansard and I read them. After I read through the speeches of the hon. Leader of the Opposition, the only remark I can make is this: What a conglomeration of abstractions! And then he calls it a policy! Generalizations, abstractions to satisfy the Liberals, to surrender to the Conservatives and then to ask the voters to vote. After the voters have voted, he proclaims it as his policy. I want to put a few questions to the hon. Leader of the Opposition as I did last year. I never received a reply. To-night I want to put a few questions to him again. Does he propose to satisfy world opinion by means of these abstractions, I mean abstractions and I leave it to the hon. Leader of the Opposition to analyse his speeches as we analyse them because as responsible men, we must analyse the speeches of a responsible man and if he analyses his speeches he will come to the same conclusion, and that is that it is a lot of generalizations and abstractions. My question to him is: Does he propose to satisfy world opinion by means of these abstractions? I want to put another question to him, and I am very serious. I am not referring now to the hon. member for Sea Point. If Rhodesia could not satisfy the aims of Pan-Africanism after Mr. Whitehead had admitted that Black rule would be a fact after 15 years, how does he intend to satisfy Pan-Africanism? He must be explicit. He must tell us. We want to know. How does he want to satisfy Pan-Africanism, if Mr. Whitehead promised at UNO that within 15 years Black rule would be an accomplished fact in the Federation and they did not believe him? All of us know what happened in the Federation. But I want to put another question to the hon. Leader of the Opposition. Does he want to continue with White representatives of Blacks as the member for Port Elizabeth (West) told me? He is not satisfied with Black representatives. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) will be satisfied only with White representatives of Blacks. Am I right or wrong? I am putting the question. Does the member for Port Elizabeth (West) want White representatives for Blacks or does he want Black representatives? [Interjections.] But there is a difference. There is a difference of opinion. There is a difference of policy in the United Party&#x2019;s ranks. Does the Leader of the Opposition want to continue with White representatives of Blacks in the foreseeable future? And afterwards, when there is no future for White political control, must the control be handed over to Black rule? Does he want that? We want a reply from the hon. Leader of the Opposition. We want a definite reply. How does he envisage the prevention of a Black majority in a multiracial society without relying on discrimination and not providing for one man one vote? [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not propose to follow the hon. member&#x2019;s conglomeration of abstractions. I was saying, when I was interrupted by the time limit, that what we are concerned with is ascertaining from the Minister what the criteria are for the establishment of border industries. We know that we have a border industry some 20 or 30 miles to the north of Pretoria. What determines that? Is it determined on economic grounds? Is it determined on ethnic grounds, and will only the people from that area be employed there? I do not know that area. I have not been there since it has been established as a border area, but I do know other border areas. I do know what is happening in Hammarsdale. I do know the number of people who are being employed who do not belong to that area and when they are unemployed, in many cases they hang around, hoping to get back into the factories. Do you know what happens, Mr. Chairman, when you get these young girls and young fellows sent out from the factories on a Friday night after receiving their week&#x2019;s pay, and being told that they are being put off? There is nobody there to guide them or to advise them. What welfare work is being done by the Minister in these new areas? When these people are summarily put off or put on short time, who is there in these new areas to explain, on behalf of the Department, what it means to be put on short time? These young people who come from different areas and who are thrown on the streets in a border area&#x2014;the whole world has fallen down as far as they are concerned. It is different if they belong to that area. If they can go back to their tribal homes, they can see their father or mother or husband or wife, as the case may be. These people are left loose. They are rudderless. They have nobody to whom they can turn. Does the Minister regard that as a satisfactory way of establishing new industries? If we are going to get an efficient border industry or any efficient industry, not only must we have the necessary capital, the necessary technical knowledge, the necessary efficient management, but we must have a contented working staff. For a contented working staff, one must not only give them good pay&#x2014; pay on which they can live&#x2014;but one must also give them a sense of security&#x2014;a feeling that their job will continue as long as they give good work. In the South African Digest for 9 May 1963 Dr. Norval said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; only by encouraging the establishment of industry fairly and squarely in the reserves could they be made economically more viable in the foreseeable future.</block>

<p>He did not believe, Dr. Norval added, that the Bantu areas would ever become <span class="col_7029_7030" refersTo="page_0847"/>wholly viable. It was, however, imperative that they should be made more economically self-sufficient that they were to-day,</p>

<p>&#x201C;The quickest and surest way of accomplishing this is through development from the centre. There are many industries which could be started on a comparatively small scale within the Bantu areas and would find a ready market for their products there.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Industries most likely to succeed were those making footwear, blankets, clothing, soaps and canned meats. They should be operated initially as semi-State and private undertakings under State guidance and supervision. As the Bantu developed sufficient managerial skills and technique, the State could lessen its managerial and supervisory control.</p>

<p>Dr. Norval believed it was wrong to expect that the establishment of industries in the border areas would have a great impact on the economic development of the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>Here, Mr. Chairman, to go back to the Minister&#x2019;s opening remarks yesterday which I referred to in the opening of my speech, in which he said that if the non-Whites had to be looked upon merely as a source of labour, it would be impossible for him to have the necessary respect for the White to live alongside him, how does that fit in with the Minister&#x2019;s policy? How can he say that the non-Whites will never have respect for the Whites if they feel they have to depend on them and yet he is establishing border industries? Is the border industry only a temporary phase? One must assume that because the hon. member for Vereeniging made it quite clear yesterday that all the Bantu are going to go back to their homelands. The border industries will therefore presumably be only temporary, because eventually the border industries will fall away. What encouragement is there going to be for industrialists to establish border industries? Because the border industries will eventually disappear. Furthermore, Sir, once an industry is established in the reserve under the Minister&#x2019;s direction there will not be a tendency on the part of the Minister to exert pressure through the chiefs to ensure that the people in the Bantu area work in the factories in that area and that labour will be withdrawn from the border areas or is there to be a quota? Can the European employer rely on a long-term basis on the Bantu labour in his factory if he is not sure whether that labour is going to be permanently available to him. It is time that we had a clear statement from the Minister as to the shortterm and long-term policy in regard to the border areas.</p>

<p>It seems to me. Sir, that the I.D.C. under the guidance and direction of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs is establishing border industries in areas which they think are economically advisable. The Minister&#x2019;s Department is supplying the services. There is lack of co-ordination because housing comes very late after the establishment of the industries. The people who are intended to help are not sure of the future; they have been drawn into this industrial complex and they are unsure of the future. As I said earlier, Mr. Chairman, on the one hand they have security with poverty in the reserves and on the other hand they are in a better financial position in the urban areas but insecurity and in the border areas they have neither: they have neither security of industry nor do they get the higher wages. This is an attempt to try to draw off labour from the towns, to put them in border industries at a lower standard of living and to attract the industrialists to invest in that area with the fake that low wages are the attraction. I suggest it is time that the hon. the Minister gave us a clear indication as to the criteria he intends to apply in establishing border industries.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I want to continue and I want to conclude. I said that I had put certain questions to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I say he cannot be explicit because his vague abstractions in the ulitmate analysis must satisfy the conservative element as well as the liberal element within his own ranks. If I am allowed to make one conclusion, one deduction from this debate, I say that the Leader of the Opposition cannot be explicit because within his own ranks he has a conservative element and a liberal element, and he is compelled to satisfy both those elements. Today, Sir, Rhodesians are learning a grim lesson about a beautiful concept. They thought it was a beautiful concept, a beautiful concept called partnership, a partnership which, on closer analysis, has turned out to be nothing more&#x2014; and I want to emphasize this&#x2014;than a clever device to defeat White control in easy stages. That is typical United Party policy. As far as this side of the House is concerned we say this: To solve this problem the following will be necessary: The United Party must realize that it is imperative not to localize one&#x2019;s vision and perspective. That is the mistake they are making. A long-range view must be taken and this is a long-range policy. It is a policy of gradual expansion, gradual development and gradual fulfilment. A long-range view must be taken. Localized and isolated tendencies do not constitute a real image. As I listen to the United Party they do not deliver any proof of long-range image or long-range view or perspective on this long-range process of gradual uprooting, a process which has been rooted in this country for 300 years. Time and again we have stated that the removal of the Bantu will be gradual. It is a process of uprooting which must be executed with the least economic disruption. We have experienced vast industrial expansion. Naturally an increase in numbers had to be expected. We need time to rehabilitate what has been neglected by the United Party under the regime of the previous Minister of Native Affairs, the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. Van der Byl). He does not know what is going on in this Chamber. He never knew what was going on under his regime What we are faced with to-day is to rehabilitate what he neglected.</p>

<p><span class="col_7031_7032" refersTo="page_0848"/>Mr. Chairman, the policy of the United Party has not got the remotest chance of success. We all believe that and the voters of South Africa believe that. The United Party was cold towards the interests of truth and practice and those who had determined to sell them out and those who never intended that party to survive namely the Progressive Party. When they broke away from the United Party the Progressive Party never intended the United Party to survive. The Progressive Party is not the Nationalist Party&#x2019;s greatest enemy but of the United Party. The United Party fear the Progressive Party more than they fear us. The full story of the betrayal of South Africa by the United Party with their race federation policy cannot be fully disclosed.</p>

<p>I withdraw that, Mr. Chairman. I say the enemies of South Africa, the post-war liberals, the humanists, the armedchair philosophers, the Progressives, the extreme Pan-Africanists have planted influences in our fatherland which are aimed at our destruction and I blame the United Party for taking part in that process of destruction. The tragedy. Sir, is that the United Party does not visualize that. A race federation state will be an extreme left wing federation intended as a military base for the ultimate subjection of Africa and control of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. That will be the ultimate outcome of the policy of race federation where Black rule will be predominant. That will be the ultimate outcome; it will be a left-wing federation which will give to the communists Africa as a basis to control the Atlantic and the Indian oceans. Mr. Chairman, the United Party is retreating virtually on every front in South Africa as far as the White man&#x2019;s struggle is concerned. They are retreating. More concessions are demanded; Pan-Africanism is justified. What did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition say the other day?

<p>We have heard about local views, images, long-range processes, economic reductions, truth and practices and even humanity, from the hon. member who has just sat down. I do not intend dealing with abstractions. Sir, the whole policy of the Nationalist Party about returning the Bantu to the Bantu areas is one of abstraction. I want to deal with a practical problem. I want to deal with one particular town. I want to know from the hon. the Minister what his policy is in regard to the town called Port St. Johns. When I endeavoured to raise the position of Port St. Johns under the Transkei Bill I was told that it was outside the Transkei and that I could not refer to it. I now wish to deal with it. Port St. Johns, as the House and the Minister know, has been specially excluded from the Transkei. It is a White spot which will never become part of the Transkei. That has been made quite clear to the Transkeian Government by this Government. The people in Port St. Johns quite rightly want to know what their future is going to be. Whose responsibility are they. That is what I want to know from this Minister. At the moment they fall under the administration of his Department. Are they to continue to fall under the Department of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development? If so. I want to know from him what he is going to do to ensure their future and their prosperity. If ever a town could be called a border town Port St. Johns could be called such. At the moment, Sir, they find themselves isolated with a foreign government controlling all accesses to the town except from the sea. I dealt with the question of the roads leading to Port St. Johns and I pointed out to the Minister previously that these roads were at present maintained by the Cape Provincial Council. At the moment the Cape Provincial Council subsidizes those roads to the tune of over R800,000 per annum. The Minister has told the House and the country that the Provincial Council will continue to maintain provincial roads. I want to know from the Minister whether the Provincial Council has budgeted to maintain the roads leadine to Port St. Johns and how long the Cape Provincial Council intends to accept that responsibility in a foreign State. If the Cape Provincial Council is not going to do it I want to know who is going to do it. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) raised certain questions with the Minister with regard to the allotment of funds to maintain the Government in the Transkei. We want to know where that money is going to come from. I hope the Minister will make it quite clear whether it is going to come from Loan Estimates or from Additional Estimates. We want clarity from the Minister on that issue. We want the Minister to tell us whether he has come to an agreement with the Cape Provincial Council in regard to the roads leading to Port St. Johns.</p>

<p><span class="col_7033_7034" refersTo="page_0849"/>Port St. Johns is an ideal place to establish as a border industry. It is on the border; it is a border completely surrounded by African states. At the moment it is only a holiday resort and it is suffering as a result of Government policy. People are afraid to travel through the Transkei, quite unnecessarily, because the Transkei is one of the safest places to travel through. My hon. friend on my right mentions that there is in fact a state of emergency; that is true. There is a state of emergency declared by this Government. The sooner the Government lift that state of emergency the better it will be for the country. People want to know why there is a state of emergency and as a holiday resort it is definitely suffering. It cannot grow solely as a holiday resort. The only possibility there is for Port St. Johns to develop is through a harbour. As I have said, it is completely surrounded by an independent Government. Is the Minister taking any steps to see that the port of Port St. Johns is developed so that the town itself can develop? You cannot expect those people to continue to live there as they are at the moment completely cut off from the rest of the country. It is the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility to see that something is done for the residents of that area. I want to know, for instance, whether he has consulted with the hon. the Minister of Commerce and Industries in regard to the establishment of a fishing harbour to develop the fish industry there? Has he consulted the Minister of Defence in regard to the possibility of developing the harbour for defence purposes? These are all possibilities and this Minister has a special duty towards Port St. Johns, more so than towards any other part of the country. This town is completely surrounded by the new Transkeian territory. I ask the Minister now to show the humanity referred to by the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) and his countrymen-feeling towards those people and tell us how he is going to save the people of Port St. Johns and not throw them aside as is alleged was done by the British Government in Kenya, Rhodesia, Uganda and elsewhere.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I am quite convinced that most of the questions which have been put here, have not only been replied to but have been replied to repeatedly. That is one of my problems with hon. members of the United Party, that questions have to be replied to so frequently and in the long run they still do not understand the answers. The hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) even went so far as to denounce me vehemently and to accuse me of not replying to a single question. Is he a stranger in Jerusalem? Surely the hon. member ought to know better than to make that type of accusation. He made that accusation in spite of the fact that he had not put a single question to me. He now expects me, of course, to reply to a question which he did not even put to me. I think the accusation which he made was a very unfair one.</p>

<p>I want to start with the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). He also accused me of not having replied to his questions. His first question was what the boundaries of the Bantustans in the Transvaal were going to be. Sir, we have replied to that question repeatedly, not only in this debate but in previous debates. We have often said that the policy that we are following is to consolidate the Bantu areas, wherever they may be situated in South Africa, as much as possible. It is impossible to say finally at this stage precisely where the boundaries will be. We are making very rapid progress with this process of consolidation. As I pointed out to hon. members yesterday evening, in the past year we have wiped out no fewer than 74 Black spots and consolidated them with their own areas. This is a natural process, and in giving effect to it we have to consult the Whites on the one hand and the Bantu on the other. We are grouping the Bantu together on an ethnic basis. The hon. member knows that it is impossible at this stage to say precisely where the boundaries of the Bantu homelands in the Transvaal are going to be. These homelands are there already; we are simply making additions to them. That is why we are not buying land indiscriminately in other areas. The hon. member posed a second question which has also been replied to repeatedly. He wants to know whether I still stand by Map No. 63 in the Report of the Tomlinson Commission where the Commission indicates how these areas can be consolidated. Sir, we have frequently said that the recommendation of the Tomlinson Commission as shown on that map, was purely a tentative recommendation. It is not a law of the Medes and Persians. Even the Tomlinson Commission adopted the attitude that this process of consolidation must evolve naturally. What the Commission put forward was merely a tentative plan as to how it could be done. We have repeatedly replied to that question. It will only be possible to draw up the final map therefore when this process of consolidation has been completed. Every member who has studied the position will accept that that is so.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked a further question. He wants to know whether our policy is to allow those areas adjoining Bechuanaland to go over to Bechuanaland. We have never said that it is our policy to cut off a part of South Africa and to give it to Bechuanaland. He also wants to know whether we are going to hand over to Swaziland the areas which adjoins Swaziland. Surely it is ridiculous to ask such a question. After all, that land forms part of our own fatherland; surely we cannot give it away to another country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>That map clearly shows that these areas may be consolidated with either Bechuanaland or Swaziland. I want to know whether that idea has been rejected entirely and whether those areas will remain part of the Transvaal?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. <span class="col_7035_7036" refersTo="page_0850"/>Chairman, it was never our intention to make those areas part of those Protectorates. It was thought in certain circles that if the Protectorates were incorporated with the Republic of South Africa it would then be possible to consolidate these areas on an ethnic basis. That possibilty was visualized but the hon. member knows that that is not practical politics to-day.</p>

<p>The hon. member made one interesting observation which once again showed me the typical lines on which the United Party thinks. He said that he wanted to express his appreciation of the fact that this Government had been following the old United Party policy of clearing up the slums around the big cities. I want to prophesy here that within a few years the hon. member will still congratulate the Government on having followed United Party policy in connection with the Bantustans in South Africa. We have often found in the past that they oppose a certain policy tooth and nail and then accept it after a while. We know how the hon. member&#x2019;s party fought us when we cleared up the slums of Johannesburg. We know how they fought us when we removed a small Black spot in the Wolkeberg mountain range and moved the people there to a decent place. That is the sort of support that we get from the other side.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rissik (Mr. de Kock) advanced another interesting proposition; he stood up here and quoted from President Kruger&#x2019;s 1883 manifesto. He then went on to say that President Kruger was really the father of the United Party&#x2019;s policy. Sir, he reminded me very much of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Whenever anybody turns against the National Party the <i>Sunday Times</i> publishes his whole family history; he is suddenly either a descendant of President Kruger or of President Steyn or of Piet Retief or of Gerrit Maritz or some other national hero. The hon. member actually comes along and says that the federation plan is not the baby of the hon. Leader of the Opposition but of President Steyn. I can only say that that is a story which nobody will swallow.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) also wants to know where the boundaries of the Bantustans in the Transvaal are going to be. I have already replied to that; the position is perfectly clear. We have our Bantu homelands there and there are smaller pieces of land that we are trying to consolidate. We accent that this will be a long-term process. It is only when this process of evolution has eventually been completed that finality will be reached in connection with this matter. There is no reason why people should feel uneasy. The hon. member asked a very interesting question. He asked whether West Johannesburg would also become a Bantustan. I can only say that it will not become a Bantustan. The United Party will never come into power and will never be able to make the whole of the Rand a Bantustan. It is a basic principle that if you give a person property rights in a country, you give him a stake in that country. If the policy of the United Party is to give all those people in the Western Area of Johannesburg property rights, then that area will be converted into a Bantustan immediately. That would be the effect of its own policy.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) says that 90 per cent of those people have no tribal links. He referred me to the report of the C.S.I.R. I just want to remind the hon. member that there are many experts who have made a study of this matter. I want to refer him to a study which was made recently in the East London location, which is the oldest location in South Africa. The finding of the research workers was that the vast majority of those people still retained their tribal links.</p>

<p>Whether there are 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 makes no difference; what we are discussing here is whether they have become detribalized. My attitude has always been that 90 per cent of those people have retained their tribal links in some form or another. You can go to Langa and ask any Xhosa there, &#x201C;Is this your homeland?&#x201D; and he will immediately tell you where his homeland is. I base this statement on <span class="col_7037_7038" refersTo="page_0851"/>scientific grounds, and I am prepared to give the hon. member a number of books written by experts who investigated this matter. That is not an argument therefore which holds water.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller), who has apologized for being unable to be here, submitted that the industrial areas would continue to draw more and more Bantu and that we would solve nothing. The hon. member only says that because he does not know the policy of the National Party. That is one of the reasons why a policy of decentralization is being followed. I shall deal with the border area industries in a moment, but those are not industries which are simply there to develop the Bantu areas. This is a form of decentralization of industries, the object of which is to obviate that more and more Bantu are drawn to just these few industrial centres. That is one of the cardinal principles of the policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) is, of course, opposed to the idea that Bantu should systematically be removed from the Western Cape. His argument is that if we do not allow the Bantu to flock into the Western Cape unchecked, the standard of living of the Coloureds here will drop. If therefore we want to raise the standard of living of the Coloureds in the Western Cape, we must simply open the sluicegates so that every single Bantu who wishes to come here may enter. I do not think there is a single economist on the other side who would subscribe to that proposition. The fact of the matter is that no single factor has played a greater role in lowering the standard of living of the Coloureds in the Cape than the entry of cheap Bantu labour into this province. If this had not happened I am convinced that the standard of living of the Coloureds in the Western Cape would have been considerably higher to-day. We must not overlook the fact that there are some people who only study their own pockets: they make no effort to give the non-Whites a decent living. They do not look after the interests of the Coloureds and the non-Whites; they are only interested in the profits that they can make. We know that there are people of that kind, and if we continually allow cheap labour to come into this area it must result in a lowering of the standard of living of the Coloureds. There are prominent Bantu throughout South Africa who are reproaching us to-day because of the fact that we are allowing foreign Bantu from other areas to come to South Africa. They say that but for that fact, the standard of living of the Bantu in South Africa would have been higher than it is to-day. I agree with that. The hon. member&#x2019;s argument holds no water therefore.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) who made a few reckless statements here. In the first place he thanked me for seeing to it as he put it, that the Bantu were not removed from the Western Cape. The fact of the matter is that that is what our policy is designed to do. We have succeeded in a very large extent in pegging the position. If we had not done so, what would the position in the Western Cape have <b>been to</b> day under a United Party Government? What were the conditions here behind the mountains in the days of the United Party Government? We gave our serious attention to this matter and we achieved a great deal. But the hon. member comes along and makes another statement which is equally irresponsible. He wants to know how many farmers have written to me to thank me for the fact that we have not removed the Bantu here.</p>

What has happened, however, is that various farmers have said that we should tackle this matter judiciously and that they will then assist us in every possible way. That is why an organization has now been established in which all interested parties are co-operating to realize this ideal. The hon. member made an nasty accusation which I think is a reflection on our farming community in South Africa, and I am glad that the hon. member for Namaqualand dealt with him so effectively.

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), who has apologized for not being able to be present, says that she is still not quite satisfied with what is being done for the Bantu in the Northern Transvaal under the drought conditions prevailing there, and she would like a further statement in that regard. I have given all the facts. Briefly the position is that we have been helping the Bantu there since last year. They have their chiefs and their councils; there are Bantu Authorities there which are functioning well; they also have their Regional Authorities and their Territorial Authorities in the Transvaal, but we also have our Bantu officials there, our Commissioners, our agricultural officials, etc. I visited this area personally last year and we created the necessary machinery to be able to provide the necessary food there in an effective way, and there is no reason to-day why a single person there should starve. I have seen the Rev. Snyman&#x2019;s letter. I do not know what the position is on his mission station, but if that is the position there, then he has been negligent in not getting in touch with my officials. The hon. member says that if the Government makes money available to the Provincial Council of the Transvaal the Provincial Council will be quite prepared to make the necessary arrangements there. But that is nonsense. We have all the machinery we need. Why should the Government make money available to the Provincial Council which has no contracts there? It is ridiculous. We have the necessary money and food is being provided there. I have already said that our policy is to give free food to the children, the aged and the deformed. For those who are fit to work we create avenues of employment. The hon. member for Houghton, of course, knows much more than I do. She says that I do not know what is going on there, but then, of course, she always knows everything. We are constantly in touch with these people. She said that avenues of employment had been created for about 150 only and she talked about a few hundred bags of maize having been sent there. That is what was sent to one place only. But the food is being distributed over the whole of the drought-stricken area. It was only at one place perhaps that 150 jobs were created. Special jobs have been created so that these people will be able to earn their food. The hon. member has been given the wrong information. Her information always comes from those people who are constantly out to blacken South Africa and then she just exaggerates it a bit.</p>

<p>I come now to the hon. member for Durban (South Coast) (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). He referred with very great indignation to an article which the <i>Burger</i> wrote. He was good enough to send the article to me to read, and I saw at once that the hon. member had completely misinterpreted it. Nowhere in that article is the statement made that the people of Natal are colonists and settlers&#x2014;nothing of the kind. But the <i>Burger</i> does issue the warning that the attitude which is adopted there, particularly by the hon. member for South Coast, is in line with the sort of colonialism which one also found elsewhere, and the <i>Burger</i> warns that that is a dangerous spirit. I too warned here yesterday evening against the spirit of colonialism which is revealed by many members on the other side, that spirit of colonialism which is responsible for the fact that the White man has already been driven out of the rest of Africa. I think the hon. member was being extremely unfair to the <i>Burger.</i> He wants to know whether I approve of this article. I think if the hon. member wants to render a service to Natal, he will go and buy all the available copies of the <i>Burger</i> and pin a copy of this article over the heart of every Natalian, because the warning contained in it is a serious one which should not be ignored. It is of no avail to camouflage these things. We should learn from the experience of these other countries and we should warn our people not to make themselves guilty of the sort of things which in other parts of Africa led to the collapse of the White man. The <i>Burger</i> was merely issuing a warning.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<p>The hon. member knows that that is not my advice. That is not a fair question. The hon. member asks whether we want to give the whole of Natal to the Zulus only. In point of fact we pointed out that if the policy of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was followed, it would be simply a question of time before the whole of Natal would belong to the Zulus. That is why we are trying so hard to get the hon. member to accept our policy, under which there will be protection for the White man and the White man will also have a place in Natal. The solution for Natal lies in the policy of this side of the House. The hon. member need not be afraid. This side of the House will also save Natal for the White man. The hon. member also wants to know what happened at the meeting of chiefs. I can only say to the hon. member that the Paramount Chief of the Zulus simply put forward the suggestion that he would like all his chiefs to meet once again at his seat because there were a few matters which he would like to discuss with them, and he stated that one of the matters which he would like to discuss with the people who were still not in favour of it was the question of Bantu Authorities. My reply was that that was their own affair and that he was at liberty to invite them to come there; that we were not inviting them, that it was his affair. This meeting was not convened by the Department of Bantu Administration. On the contrary, the Paramount Chief invited these people and he specially asked the Commissioner-General to come and say a few words there, which he did. He did not make a long speech. A few important matters were then discussed, and one of them was whether the other Zulus, who had not yet accepted the system of Bantu Authorities, would not agree to accept it. Buthelezi then stood up and proposed that every chief should consult the members of his tribe, not only the tribal Bantu but also those who were in the cities, because he said that they still formed part of the tribe. What more convincing proof can one get of the fact that there is no truth in this story that the Natives have become detribalized? The majority of these people then decided that it was good advice that those who had not yet accepted the system of Bantu Authorities should consult their people about it. I have no objection to that. On the contrary, that is the very thing that we always encourage. They should consult not only the Bantu in the reserves but also in the cities. The hon. member now wants to know whether we are going to allow them to consult their people in the cities. Of course. I can give the hon. member the assurance that if he brines one case to my notice where an official of mine does not permit such consultation. I shall take very drastic steps against the official concerned. They have the fullest right to consult their people. It is something that we encourage. The hon. member asks whether we are not going to force them to accept it. No, it has never been our policy to force these people to accept the system of Bantu Authorities, nor is that our policy in Natal. It has always taken place on a voluntary basis. In no single case in Natal has a Bantu Authority been foisted on to the people. But a large number of the tribes have accepted it. A large number of them have accepted Regional Authorities, and there are many of these people who have indicated that they would also like to have Regional Authorities there as soon as possible. But they have the fullest freedom to consult their people. A few other important matters were also discussed on this occasion, and one thing which we specially asked the Commissioner-General to bring to their notice was the question of the tribal fights which were taking place at Msinga. I let them know specifically that I should like to have their advice in that regard, and they gave their advice. For the rest, however, they were given no lead or anything of that kind by the Department. I want to add, however, that pamphlets were distributed on a large scale by certain people, appealing to the Zulus net to accept the system of Bantu Authorities. I am investigating the question of the authorship of these pamphlets; we have certain clues already. Generally speaking, however, a very fine spirit prevailed there. The hon. member asks why I do not leave the Zulus there alone. He says that we should leave them alone; that we should not worry them with Bantu Authorities and that sort of thing. The hon. member is making a very great mistake. He ought to know the Zulu and he ought to know that it is also the desire of the Zulu to manage his own affairs. There is no tribe which has greater national pride than the Zulu has. There is more and more evidence of the desire of the Zulu to develop. I wonder whether the hon. member has visited Ngoma recently to see what development has taken place there. If this development had not taken place thousands of head of cattle would have died there in the recent drought. This has made such an impression even on Buthelezi that even though he does not yet accept the system of tribal authorities, he has nevertheless asked that we should help him to undertake developmental works in his area, and he is even prepared to pay the entire cost. That is the impression which it has made on the Zulus.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) put a question to me in connection with the Bantu Development Corporation. Time does not permit me to go into this matter at great length. He is quite correct in saying that to a large extent we still have a stagnant economy in the Bantu areas, but the Bantu Development Corporation is one of the instruments which we are using to introduce a dynamic economy there. We realize that it takes time, and indeed we have said so from the beginning. The fact that already we have enabled 138 people in the various areas to conduct their own businesses is a worthwhile achievement. The hon. member must remember <span class="col_7043_7044" refersTo="page_0854"/>that in the economic sphere and in the commercial sphere the Bantu still do not have the experience that we have. We have a rehabilitative task in connection with these businesses. I want to give the hon. member the assurance that we have already achieved very fine results We have a number of cases where people have started their own businesses and where within a year or two they have repaid in cash the full amount of the loan. Just think what these businesses mean to that community. They are gradually converting the economy of the Bantu community into dynamic economy. That is one of the wonderful results that we have achieved. But I admit that it is no easy task. We receive applications but they have to be sifted carefully. We would not like to do an injustice to any Native; we have to go into each application very thoroughly and it takes time to do so. But we are proud of the results which have already been achieved, in spite of the pessimism of the hon. member. I do not see how the hon. member can make the statement that this is simply being done to help the Whites and not the Bantu. On the contrary, in the past two years we have done a great deal through the Bantu Development Corporation to develop Bantu trade. Take Sekukuniland, for example, where we have taken over a large business and where we are giving business training to a number of Bantu. The hon. member wants to know whether money is being made available under this Vote for the Transkei. No. We are, of course, carrying on with our ordinary developmental works, but I want to refer the hon. member to Section 52 (2) of the Transkei Constitution where the position is very clearly set out, and that is that the Department will continue to provide the necessary money up to the financial year commencing in April 1964. In the meantime every Department will continue just as in the past to make available these amounts. I would advise the hon. member to read the last page of the report of the Recess Committee; there he will see what the estimated amounts are in respect of the Transkei. The hon. member wants to know whether provision will be made later on for further moneys. He can rest assured that provision will probably be made in the Additional Estimates for further necessary sums.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) also put a few questions to me. He asked what the norm was for border industries. This matter, of course, really falls under the Minister of Economic Affairs, who has a permanent committee which decides where the special border industries will be encouraged.</p>

<p>Yes, we naturally have very close links with it, but I do not think it is my duty to take this function out of the hands of the Minister of Economic Affairs, and I shall be glad if the hon. member will put his question to the Minister of Economic Affairs. I just want to say, however, that he is quite correct in saying that a place like Durban will not be regarded as falling within a border industry area, but since there is a large Bantu area in close proximity, the necessary labour will be drawn from that area. East London is going to be a border industry area. That also applies to King William&#x2019;s Town and Pretoria-North and Pietersburg, as well as other places in Natal. The hon. member says that he cannot understand how I can make the statement that the Bantu will not always just continue to be labourers but that they may also become strong financally. He asks how I can reconcile that statement with our border industry policy. Sir, it is clear that the hon. member has no conception of the role of border industries. We are developing these border industries on the borders of the Bantu areas and the labour will then eventually come from the Bantu areas. But we have repeatedly said that one of the important considerations is that in the first place these people will now be given freehold title in the Bantu towns, but in addition to that they will also have the right to build up their tertiary industries, and the hon. member knows that in the national economy as a whole tertiary industries play a very important role in capital formation, etc. There will now be traders there who will build up businesses, who will even build up big bazaars and other large businesses. We do not allow that in the White residential areas, but we do allow it in the Bantu areas. The time will come later on therefore when you will have a moneyed class there</p>

<p>In the first place we adopt the attitude that the people in such a town will belong to a particular ethnic group. The local people will, of course, have a preferential claim when it comes to employment in those industries, and in fact we are encouraging our industrialists to give them preference. But one may find that there is not sufficient labour available locally and that Bantu from some other place may perhaps have to be engaged. That might well happen. At Hammarsdale, for example, our policy is to encourage our industrialists to make use in the first place of the labour which is available in that area. We may find, however, that such an industry will not be able to obtain sufficient labour there, but as far as it is at all possible to do so the labour of the ethnic group concerned will be used, and in this connection we have had no difficulties up to the present. The hon. member made the general accusation that although the National Party talks about the establishment of border industries nothing was being done by the Government; there is Hammarsdale, it is true, but there are no houses as yet; the basic services have not been provided yet. But after all the hon. member knows that there are other places where border industries <span class="col_7045_7046" refersTo="page_0855"/>have already been established. In many cases the houses are completed even before the industries are established. Take Pretoria-North. The industries have not yet started operating but most of the houses there are already occupied. The hon. member takes Hammarsdale as an example and says that that is the result; but he forgets the other places in Natal where we have established housing schemes. The hon. member has no right to muke such a general accusation. I come now to Hammarsdale. I readily admit that nothing has been done at Hammarsdale yet. But it must not be overlooked that Hammarsdale is not a Bantu area. We were asked just recently to undertake the planning there and to erect the buildings, and I want to give the hon. member the assurance that attention is being given to the matter. But proper planning must first take place. The hovels which are there today are not situated on land which has been planned for industrial development. This place is receiving attention. Hammarsdale is one of the exceptional cases where nothing has been done yet. But we want to improve the conditions there and steps will be taken to that end. The hon. member may rest assured on that score. I want to ask the hon. member, however, to raise this matter when the Vote of the Minister of Economic Affairs comes up for discussion; he will then be given all the relevant information.</p>

<p>I should like to add that the success we are achieving at the present time with the development of the border areas, in spite of all the prophets of doom on the opposite side, is truly encouraging. There are inquiries at every place and people are putting up factories. Go and look at East London. There is a factory there already.</p>

<p>The hon. member does not know his own country. [Interjections.] The hon. members say there are a number of factories at East London, but if they had been there they would have seen there is one very big factory, a textile factory, near Undanzani. [Interjection.] That is the difficulty. The United Party says no attention is being given to the border industries while the factories are there already. Take Rosslyn. You will be surprised to see what has happened there in a short while. One can hardly recognize the place. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) has quoted from Dr. Norval&#x2019;s report, but that is a little straw the hon. member is grasping at. There are, however, other economists in South Africa advising us. Take a person such as Professor S. P. Viljoen. He is convinced that this thing is going to be a great success, and the indications of success are there already.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) asks what about Port St. Johns. My objection to the hon. member is that he is not a good Member of Parliament, because if he were a good one, Port St. Johns would have progressed much more than it has up to the present time. But he scares the people to such an extent that hardly a single Transvaler goes to Port St. Johns any longer. Everybody asks me whether what Mr. Hughes says is true. The hon. member suggests there are terrible things going on. Proclamation 400 hangs like a cloud over the people there. The hon. member is the cause of the people&#x2019;s unwillingness to go to that place. I shall be glad if he will rather help me to build up Port St. Johns. I should like to assure the hon. member that he need not worry about it. Port St. Johns will remain a White area and we realize that those people must be assisted, and at the present time a number of matters in that connection are being attended to. The necessary attention is being devoted to it. I cannot say at this stage what the results are going to be, but one of the things is the possibility of developing the harbour. Quite a number of other things there are also receiving earnest attention at the present time, so that those people need not be uneasy. But why make the statement that a little group of people are now sitting on the other side of the borders of a foreign state? He scares away all the people with that statement. Surely it is not a foreign state, and it is not fair to use that representation. If he really wishes to serve the Transkei as well as Port St. Johns, he should not make such wild statements. Those areas are still a part of South Africa. The day when they no longer form part of South Africa he may make those statements, but it is unnecessary to scare the people in advance. I appeal to the hon. member. He can do much for the Transkei and he can serve Port St. Johns much better if he would rather co-operate with us instead of scaring the people. The hon. member is very concerned too about the roads there. He can be quite reassured that the roads will be constructed by the province, and will be maintained by the province through Port St. Johns. I should like to give the assurance that all the other roads will be maintained equally well, because we are employing experts to help us in this task, and the same amount that is being spent on those roads at the present time, will continue to be spent there in the future, and the roads going via Port St. Johns will be constructed by the province. I repeat that with the development of the Transkei, the people at Port St. Johns will ultimately be grateful to us for the benefits they will derive from it. I think I have now replied to all the questions. Of course there are fine points here and there, but it is absolutely impossible to reply to everything, but I have at least replied to all the major questions.</p>

<p>May I ask whether the hon. the Minister agrees with the statement made by the hon. member for Vereeniging?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>That is also a strange thing which I cannot understand. The same question replied to by the hon. member for Vereeniging was asked in this <span class="col_7047_7048" refersTo="page_0856"/>House years ago, namely whether it is our policy to remove all the Bantu from the White areas to the Bantu areas, and Dr. Malan gave the reply on that occasion. He said it was the ideal we aimed at, but it was not practical politics at present. Dr. Malan replied to that question, and Advocate Strijdom replied to it, and the present Prime Minister also replied to it; but the hon. member for Germiston (District) cannot understand it yet. That is the ideal that is aimed at, but we realize fully that we shall need the Bantu for many years yet, just as he will need us. It is not intended simply to drive them out here and to dump them there. Surely that cannot be done. It can only be done as those areas are developed, and I have pointed out that the best results will be achieved when all those areas lying fallow there are developed so that they can build up a dynamic economy. We have a single economy for the whole of the Republic of South Africa. That is the only way out, and in the meantime we are trying to give as many of the Bantu as we do not need here a livelihood there. We do not believe that they should congregate in their thousands at Cook&#x2019;s Bush and live in hovels, as the United Party has done. No, we believe in seeing to it that all the manpower of South Africa, White as well as non-White, shall be harnessed in the interests of the greatest productivity of our economic structure.</p>

<p>I conclude by saying that I really had expected that in this debate hon. members opposite would at least have given us the alternative policy for South Africa. Once upon a time I also sat on that side and I also criticized sharply. [Interjections.] But when asked what our policy was, I could put it clearly and succinctly. Go and read the Hansards. Time and again we stated our policy during these debates, and on the strength of that we won the election in 1948. [Interjection.] The hon. member asks why the Sauer Commission was appointed. It was appointed for only one purpose, and that was merely to recapitulate the policy we already had in their report, because a policy grows with the nation. We are going further in many instances than General Hertzog went, because we are not a stagnant party, but a dynamic party. We have seen the phenomenon that at one time the United Party also had a policy, and eventually it had a sixpence policy, but to-day that policy cannot even be sold for one penny. We cannot get any policy from the United Party. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Green Point asks whether General Hertzog did not say that apartheid was unrealistic. I have just said that Dr. Malan said our ideal is total apartheid, but it is not practical politics to-day. I am convinced it is not practical politics even today, but we are working in that direction. If that ideal could be achieved, nobody will be gladder than that hon. member. But the United Party have no ideal for the achievement of which they are working. Here we have been debating the matter for days, and they cannot expound a policy. Not one of them has even mentioned the federation plan. I want to say this. The hon. member for South Coast has waged a whole campaign in regard to land in Natal. I want to warn him beforehand that the people of Natal are no longer as scared as they were. People cannot be attracted to a party by scaremongering. You must do so by means of faith and ideals. That is what makes a party strong. You have to grip the imagination of the public, and that is why the National Party came into power in 1948 and that is why it will still be in power in 1988.</p>

<p>On behalf of the House I should like to express our appreciation and thanks to the Select Committee which considered this matter so thoroughly and so seriously. It is of very great importance to this House that its prestige should be properly safeguarded at all times. In particular I should like to express my appreciation of the fact that the finding by the Select Committee that the accused is guilty was a unanimous one, because it is desirable that in matters of this kind affecting the honour of the House there should be a unanimous finding.</p>

<p>In reading the report, however, I also noticed that although the finding was unanimous there was a difference of opinion as to the punishment that should be imposed. That is understandable, for in the course of the years we have imposed only a few of the penalties which may be applied in such cases. The result is that such a Select Committee would obviously consider itself bound to a large extent to impose a punishment which has come to be accepted as customary. It is understandable that there may be a difference of opinion as to the punishment to be imposed in a particular case. However, I do think that it is desirable also that not only the finding but also the punishment itself should be approved with the greatest possible degree of unanimity by this House, and I am glad the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had the same feeling and that he discussed the matter with me to see whether it would not be possible to determine a punishment, if necessary a new form of punishment, on which all of us in the House could agree. It will also in future be a means of giving committees of this nature a somewhat wider choice of penalties. Now I am pleased to be able to say that it was found possible to arrive at such a punishment. I am also glad to be able to say that on both sides we conferred with the members of the Select Committee appointed, and that the punishment I should like to suggest here has met with the approval of the members of the Select Committee. Therefore, if this House sees fit to accept this suggestion, not only the finding but also the punishment will be endorsed by unanimous resolution of all those present here. I should therefore like to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, having considered the Report of the Select Committee on a Question of Privilege, resolves as follows:</block>

<p>I have the honour to second this motion and to associate myself with the words of the hon. the Prime Minister. This is not a case of a malicious or wilful act. We are dealing here with a case of negligence, but gross negligence, and there is not the slightest doubt that the person concerned should have been found guilty. The only difference of opinion concerned the punishment, and it is a pleasure to be able to say that the hon. the Prime Minister and I wholeheartedly agreed on the punishment, which is somewhat different from the punishment proposed by the Select Committee, but is one which in our view is more appropriate on this occasion. There is not the slightest doubt that this was a serious offence and that we have to take drastic action to see to it that the dignity of the House is preserved and safeguarded. I second.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill before us now in its third reading will place on the Statute Book one of the most important changes in our defence organization since our Defence Force came into being. One of the most important factors in the Bill, in Clause 2, is that it brings the existing defence organization into line with general world policy. Changes necessary to meet the new techniques of warfare, nuclear warfare and the tremendous advances in air warfare and use of unconventional <span class="col_7051_7052" refersTo="page_0858"/>weapons, and in order that our defences can be turned into one fully coordinated force. That change is provided for by Clause 3, which is one of the most important clauses in the Bill. Clause 3 also collects into its ambit a number of other important changes in our defence organization, of which the one I have just mentioned, that the entire Defence Force, on land, air and sea, can now be used as one combined force, is the most important. And in the new set-up, although more or less the same practice has been followed in the past although largely on a voluntary basis, by which men could be transferred from one branch to the other, officers and men will now be liable to transfer to any other branch or formation of the Defence Force. It will no longer be voluntary, but they may be compelled to do so. That will become the recognized practice in future, and it conforms to a considerable extent to a practice which has been found necessary in other much larger defence organizations than ours, and we on this side of the House have no objection to it.</p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Order! The hon. the Minister cannot even hear the hon. member.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Clause 2 considerably extends the duties and responsibilities of the A.C.F. Both the A.C.F. and the Commandos now form part of the defence forces of the Republic. Clause 2 considerably extends the scope of the duties of those bodies by making them liable in future to carry out a number of important functions and duties which were hitherto only the responsibility of the Permanent Force. The Bill in fact can fairly be said to fit the description the Minister gave it when he introduced the second reading, that it is something brought about of necessity under to-day&#x2019;s world conditions. Events even since the Minister made that statement has stressed its importance. I think, however, we might add to that that it is not only world conditions, but world conditions and their effect on our own internal conditions in the Republic which must be taken into account. The Bill makes it clear that the Republic&#x2019;s small Permanent Force can no longer be regarded as sufficient guarantee for the security of the Republic and therefore the expanded A.C.F. and the Commandos are merged with it, particularly in regard to internal security. Clause 2 extends to them the duties to a wide range of police duties hitherto only applicable to the Permanent Force. Now they will apply to any unit or member of the A.C.F. or the Commandos. The Minister will remember that in the earlier stages we tried to get some restriction applied to that power inasmuch as we felt that certain of the trainees in the Citizen Force had not yet reached the standard of training and discipline which warranted vesting them with the full authority of the police. The Minister gave an assurance that this power would only be used in the case of men who had undergone a special course of training in military police duties but unfortunately the Bill itself imposes no such limitation. It sets no limitation at all on the type of police duties or the type of man who can be called upon to undertake them. In fact, Clause 2 itself, in paragraph (4), vests all the powers and functions conferred on the police by the Police Act of 1957 in these men. Its scope is so wide that the Opposition still, in spite of the assurance given by the Minister, regards it as unsatisfactory, in the case of men who have not completed their six months&#x2019; training. The discussion of Clause 2 has also brought to light the startling fact that, other than last year&#x2019;s batch of trainees who have completed their nine months&#x2019; training, there are very few people in the country to-day who have had a minimum of six months&#x2019; military training. That is a somewhat surprising situation to be suddenly faced with, particularly in the light of the very heavy defence expenditure over the past ten years and the big expansion in defence activities.</p>

<p>The Bill also in Clause 3, read in conjunction with Clause 13, not only takes into account the widespread effect of the big defence expansion upon the lives and vocations of thousands of young South Africans who are being called up for special military training, but also the restrictive effect this national conscription has on certain branches of industry, as well as the increasing extent to which the manufacturing industries in many important respects are now being harnessed to supply the defence needs of the country. Clause 13 is one of the clauses which emphasize that aspect. It clarifies the responsibility of employers in their not being liable to meet in any way the loss of pay of volunteers called up for their training period. At the same time that particular clause affords protection to people who are called up, protection up to a limited period of four months in regard to certain rights of promotion, increments, leave and sick pay, and as far as apprentices are concerned up to a period of four months&#x2019; and subsequently periods of three weeks during further periods of training will be taken into consideration for purposes of their civilian indentured training. This is a provision which we can well support, although we hope that the Minister will yet find it possible to increase that period of four months still further.</p>

<p>Clause 13 contains certain new principles. Firstly there is the appointment of the Manpower Control Board operating under the Minister of Labour. This is the first time such a body has been found necessary in peacetime. There again, one can regard these provisions as a pointer not only to the demands that defence expansion is making upon the available manpower in the ordinary life of the country, but especially on the skilled manpower which is already in short supply. It is also a reflection of the general world conditions at present and the mounting threat of aggression against South Africa to which the Minister has referred, and the increasing necessity for maintaining internal security. In terms <span class="col_7053_7054" refersTo="page_0859"/>of that clause the board, on which various industrial bodies will be represented, can advise the Government in peacetime concerning the use of the available manpower, particularly in regard to its allocation to defence, and it will also keep an eye on the needs of the ordinary industrial activities to see that they get their fair share of the available manpower. The board will have authority to advise the Minister and the Government regarding the categories and professions which may be exempted from military service. All these are the most important features which affect not only defence but also the ordinary life in the country and its manpower.</p>

<p>Clause 5 deals with the establishment of something which I think the House in general is in complete agreement with, the Air Commandos. In Clauses 6, 10 and 11 the various matters consequential to the establishment and the operation of the Air Commandos are dealt with. These are all features which the country will welcome in the Bill because they provide for the strengthening of our defences. They will enable flying people to keep in touch with military requirements and practice and provide a valuable reserve to the Air Force in emergency. We have no hesitation in giving it our full support.</p>

<p>Clause 15 is one which has to be taken in conjunction with Clause 2, and it is another one of the clauses in regard to which we on this side had reservations. It deals with internal unrest. A resident magistrate in an area who feels that unrest had developed to such an extent in his area that his relatively small group of local police need to be reinforced, has the right to set in motion proceedings which result in the calling up of members of the Defence Force resident in that area to support the police. That clause side-tracks to some extent, for a limited period, the powers of the State President. Previously this call-up could only be done by a proclamation issued by the State President, but the Bill waives that right for a limited period of 24 hours, so that action may speedily be taken at a time when the police probably need assistance most. We are all agreed on the principle of rendering assistance to the police. If the police require assistance to maintain order, they must receive it. Where we do differ is that this clause places no limitation on the class of members of the Defence Force who can be used, and people with little training and who lack experience may also be called upon. We feel that according them the full powers of the police is inherently dangerous, and we asked for a limitation to those who have had at least six months&#x2019; military training. Because of the rules of the House that amendment could not be proceeded with, but I want to ask the Minister who had indicated his willingness to accept a reservation subject to some limitation to give serious consideration to it in the Other Place. I believe our objection is justified. This is one of the clauses in the Bill which contains a definite weakness which we believe should be remedied.</p>

<p>The other clauses of the Bill deal with the limitation of the powers of the State President. In certain instances where he formerly had to issue a proclamation, that proclamation can now be issued by the Minister, or it can be waived for a stated period. Another clause deals with doctors in certain of the bigger institutions which may be used for defence purposes. The senior doctors in charge and the staff will be liable to be dealt with as defence units, something with which we are in agreement. In fact, it starts to make provision for something which defence will have to face up to in future, because expansion on the medical side will be necessary. Therefore we support that provision with the big expansion of defence manpower build-up the medical side of defence organization will have to be considered.</p>

<p>I think one can sum up the Bill by saying that it marks the entry of the Republic into a period of steadily increasing conscription, which is being applied not only to the serving forces but also to industry. The Minister stated that under existing world conditions it was necessary to do these things to ensure the security of the Republic. We on this side certainly do not subscribe to any doctrine that there is cause for panic or that we should not have a calm outlook in regard to the future of the country, but we feel it is necessary to strengthen our defences. The Minister is responsible for the defence of the country and we feel that under those conditions it is in the best interests of the future of the country that these steps should be taken, and we support the third reading of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to deal with one aspect of the Bill. It concerns an obvious weakness in the existing Act in regard to making use of the available defence forces of the country. The Minister knows that the duties of the Defence Force set out in Clause 2 were really confined in the past to the Permanent Force, and in respect of the Active Citizen Force they were limited. The Minister now gets the power to use the A.C.F. for police duties. But in regard to the actual defence of the country there is of course the other important aspect that the Commandos are now for the first time being put on a par with the A.C.F. and the Permanent Force in regard to their use in the defence of the country. Whereas in the past there was a difference between the functions of the A.C.F. and the Commandos as compared with those of the Permanent Force, now all the armed forces can be used immediately for the defence of the country. I will say a few words in a minute about police duties, but the most important aspect is defence. When one reads Clause 17 with Clause 21, the manner in which the Defence Force is now being constituted becomes even more important, because never before has the Minister had the power immediately to use the defence forces in the defence of the country without issuing a mobilization order, but now he can do so. When <span class="col_7055_7056" refersTo="page_0860"/>one looks at Clause 21, which also contains an amendment in regard to the issue of regulations dealing with the immediate use of the forces, I think that is welcomed, because regulations may now be issued in advance to anticipate conditions that may arise in future if we have to face a national emergency. In other words, the effect of this Bill is that the immediate use of our defence forces is now made possible. I think the Bill has great significance in the light of recent developments and statements made on the African continent, and the manner in which the Bill was received in the House will make it clear to those who made those statements that both White and non-White are not prepared to allow our country to be wrecked either from within or without, and that no South African worth his salt will be prepared to stand by and watch any country wreck everything we have built up, and least of all those who can hardly be described as upholding the rule of law.</p>

<p>Arising from that, I notice that the Minister made a very important statement at Vryburg, where he said that he was now able immediately to use some 140,000 men for the defence of South Africa. If that is so, I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to indicate the level of training and the steps he will take in regard to the bulk of that manpower, because the bulk of that manpower consists of the Commandos, and only something like 20,000 to 22,000 men belong to the A.C.F. and the Permanent Force out of that figure of 140,000 men. As the result of these changes, a far heavier onus will lie on the Commandos and I think the Minister should make a statement in regard to their training, particularly as he is now making use of escapees from the ballot to build up the Commandos in the urban areas. I hope the Minister will indicate that he has embarked on an adequate training scheme in that regard.</p>

<p>Then I should like to ask the Minister this. He knows the difficulties with which we were faced, in terms of the rules of the House, in moving an amendment, which he indicated he was prepared to accept in regard to Clause 2.</p>

<p>In terms of Clause 15, the Minister now has the power to use the two arms, the A.C.F. and the Commandos, for a period of 24 hours in certain districts. There is an obvious weakness here and I can only hope that the Minister will attempt to put it right in the Other Place. I do not want to traverse the whole ground again, but the Minister knows what that weakness is.</p>

<p>Then in regard to Clause 13, a Manpower Board is set up under the Minister of Labour. I hope that the Minister will consider the point previously made in the debate, and to which he did not reply, that there should be no clash of interest in regard to the exemption applied for by an apprentice in his individual capacity, as opposed to the general exemption granted by the Manpower Board, in terms of Clause 14. I hope the Minister will bear that point in mind because it is important. I think it will be most undesirable if the Manpower Board should be regarded as an escape route for men to avoid their military service in defence of the country.</p>

<p>All I can say at this stage is that I am sincerely grateful for the general support this Bill is receiving in this House. I only wish that some of the people outside our country who are boasting of everything they want to do could have heard this afternoon how unanimous this House is concerning defence matters. The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) once again raised the matter of the duration of the training for people who have to perform police duties. We have already discussed it in the second-reading debate and in the Committee Stage, and we cannot do so again. The hon. member has also expressed the hope that in future more than four months&#x2019; protection will be given to youngsters who come in for training. I do not think that is a matter I can go into for it may mean discriminating against young men who undergo training, but I hope that we shall shortly be able to train everybody.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) has stated that I said on Friday that we would be able to put 140,000 men into the field. That is quite correct. What I did say is that we would have 140,000 men in uniform at the end of next year, whom we shall be able to put into the field. The hon. member suggested that only a small number of them would be trained. I may just tell him that under the nine months&#x2019; training scheme in the first year we trained 10,000; we are now training 11,000 and next year we shall train 16,000, and the gymnasium trainees must still be added to these. The 140,000 I referred to will consist only of our Permanent Force, our full-time force, our Citizen Force and our Commandos. Not all our Commando members are trained as yet.</p>

<p>No, if the hon. member works it out, he will see that the majority of them will not be Commando members at the end of next year. Their officers are all trained men. Many of them are taking courses every year, in progressively increasing numbers, and even they will be reasonably well trained for the kinds of duties they will have to perform in the country.</p>

<p>I just wish to say here this afternoon that I am very grateful for the support I am receiving in respect of defence, and I should like to tell those who are not here that they <span class="col_7057_7058" refersTo="page_0861"/>will have to deal with a united South Africa and with at least 140,000 men in uniform next year, who will be prepared to strike hard.</p>

<p>On Clause 2,</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move the amendment standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of the proposed new sub-section (2) inserted by sub-section (1);</block>

<p>Provided that the registrar may, where owing to circumstances beyond his control copies of any document required under Section 70 cannot be furnished without undue delay, permit any person to make such copies by mechanical means.</p>

<p>This sub-section as it now stands still gives the right of inspection to a member of the public and I would like to say that I welcome the upholding of the principle laid down by the Appellate Division in 1962, in the case of Spoor and Fisher v. the Registrar of Patents, where Mr. Justice Dowling maintained that the right of inspection carried with it the right to copy documents. This is now embodied in the clause, but I feel that this amendment which I am now moving in sub-section (2) will vest a discretionary right in the Registrar to permit copying of documents by mechanical means upon request in terms of Section 70 of the Patents Act, 1952, in the event of a break-down in the copying system of the Registrar&#x2019;s Office. Many emergencies may arise in this connection. We must appreciate that there are unusual non-recurrent demands for tens of thousands of patent specifications on occasion and facilities may not be available to copy them. One of the patent firms deals with abstract patents and copies of these have to be forwarded to whoever demands them within three days; another patent firm deals with details of new patents for supply to American patent magazines, and these have to be supplied very swiftly for printing purposes. The amendment which I have moved will be able to eliminate delays in this regard. A private individual may go to the Patents Office and find after a search that he wishes to make a copy of a document; he then either has to write down the patent by hand or get the clerk to write it down by hand or perhaps order a copy of the patent from the Registrar&#x2019;s Office, and in the event of the Patents Office being unable to supply a copy where it is needed urgently, the sub-section as it now stands prevents the Registrar from exercising the discretion to grant the applicant the right to use mechanical means. I feel that there will always be a need for making copies very quickly of patent registrations or extracts from documents. The need to provide for emergencies which may arise in the Office cannot be overlooked and I therefore move this amendment because I have always maintained that the solution to these problems lies in administrative measures. This amendment provides that when through circumstances beyond his control the Registrar is unable to provide copies of any documents without undue delay, he will have the right to commit any person to make copies by mechanical means. I trust that this amendment will prove acceptable to the hon. the Deputy Minister. I would like him to give it his very serious consideration because its acceptance is going to go a very long way towards quietening the fears of patent firms, members of the public, and organizations whose work could be obstructed through delays caused by a break-down of the photostatic system. This amendment will also safeguard the rights of the general public. Sir, there is one question I would like to ask in connection with sub-section (2). May I have the assurance of the hon. the Deputy Minister that this amendment will not be put into operation until the same services which patent agents were providing for themselves can be provided by the Department?</p>

<p>During the second-reading <span class="col_7059_7060" refersTo="page_0862"/>debate already I indicated that I was prepared to accept this amendment. As regards the assurance the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) seeks, I should like to point out that the provision that the subsection will come into operation only after it has been proclaimed in the <i>Government Gazette</i> has been inserted for the specific reason to give the Registrar the necessary time to acquire the requisite machinery, and to be able to provide the necessary services. I think the fact that this provision is being inserted in the Bill at the request of the Registrar is sufficient assurance that it will not be proclaimed until such time as he is able to provide the required services.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>In this connection I should like to move the amendment as printed on the Order Paper in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 3 and 4, to omit &#x201C;(other than a certification mark)and to omit paragraph (b) of sub-section (1).</block>

<p>When this Bill was drafted, it was intended to make special provision for the protection of certification marks, and for this reason the provisions of Clause 44 (1) were not applicable to such marks. However, it was decided subsequently that the provisions of Clause 44 should be applicable to certification marks, but by that time the Bill had already been drafted. This amendment was also proposed by the Committee. They met three times and after full consideration it was decided to move this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>May I say that I would commend the deletion of both these provisions as recommended by the Trade Marks Committee itself and the S.A. Institute of Patent Agents. I am glad to see that they are both being deleted. Firstly in Clause 44 (1) it is proposed in lines 3 and 4 to omit &#x201C;(other than a certification mark)&#x201D;, because clearly there is no purpose whatsoever in allowing for the registration of certification marks under Section 52, because no action can be taken to enforce the rights. Hence the necessity for the deletion of these words in lines 3 and 4. And this Clause 52 will not provide for the infringement of certification rights. One must presume that these words were inserted in error. With regard to paragraph (b) of sub-section (1), an applicant for registration is able to specify the goods for which he requires trade-mark cover. Such a specification makes the extent of his rights quite clear. But if these rights extend to &#x201C;goods of the same description&#x201D; as laid down in paragraph (b), there would be uncertainty and embarrassment to the trade, because it is generally an open question as to what constitute &#x201C;goods of the same description&#x201D;. This is not defined specifically in paragraph (b). Such an uncertain extension of the rights of registration has not ever been felt to be a necessity in order to give a registrant adequate cover. And even if it were of practical advantage to a registrant this would be more than offset by the interests of the trade in general. So this side of the House is in concurrence with the withdrawal of these sub-sections through the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s amendments.</p>

<p>Eighth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;National Film Board Bill.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Before proceeding to explain the object and basic principles of the Bill, it will perhaps be fitting if I just briefly sketch the historical background which gave rise to the position of the State&#x2019;s film activities as we know them today.</p>

<p>Shortly after the end of the previous world war, the Department of Education, Arts and Science took over the equipment of the Defence Film Unit and gave it to its Film Service to be used in the making of educational films on South African subjects for schools. However, it did not take long before State Departments, which were fully conscious of the mighty influence of the film as a medium of instruction, insisted on the making of films to promote their own activities, for purposes of recruitment, etc. To meet this demand to some extent, the Production Section of the Department&#x2019;s Film Service had to be extended, both in regard to equipment and staff. To-day the Production Section is known as the State Film <span class="col_7061_7062" refersTo="page_0863"/>Production and it is a full-fledged section of the Department of Education, Arts and Science. This section is housed in Pretoria and at present has a technical staff of 68 and equipment to the value of approximately R500,000. This section renders services <i>gratis</i> to State Departments and Provincial Administrations. Every year approximately 30 documentary films are made, consisting of about 50 reels of ten minutes each, of which 50 per cent consists of films for the classroom. But with the ever increasing need for such films the fact that the State&#x2019;s Film Service as such is not geared to undertake commercial transactions has become increasingly apparent. The Public Service Acts, its regulations and provisions&#x2014;like the financial and tender regulations and regulations in regard to the employment of personnel&#x2014;do not comply with the requirements of an undertaking in connection with which the time factor is of cardinal interest, as, e.g., in the making of films. Film production needs a measure of flexibility which is foreign to the Public Service, but which is accepted practice in commercial undertakings.</p>

<p>The desirability of changing the State Film Production Section into a Film Board has therefore been felt for many years already, and with a view to this the Government brought Mr. John Grierson, a film expert who was responsible for the establishment of the Canadian National Film Board in 1947, from England at Government expense in order to investigate this matter here. His visit did not result in anything concrete, although he advocated the establishment of a board like the one proposed here. But because the Government so thoroughly realized the necessity for a more practical and firm basis for a more effective and economic production of films for Government Departments and State-aided bodies, the then Minister of Finance appointed an inter-departmental committee of inquiry during 1955, under the chairmanship of Dr. F. J. Cilliers, to go into this matter. This committee thoroughly investigated the whole matter of the State&#x2019;s film activities and, <i>inter alia,</i> came to the following conclusion. In the first place, the committee found that the Film Service of the Department of Education, Arts and Science was not able, with its limited production capacity, to supply all the needs of State Departments, State-aided bodies and Provincial Administrations. The result of this was that various Government Departments established their own production unit, which again led to overlapping and waste, not only waste of money but also waste of the available technical manpower. The De Villiers Committee further found that there was a total lack of proper distribution facilities for films made by the State. They found that these films did not reach the general public of South Africa. Consequently the committee came to the conclusion that it would be in the interest of the State for a reasonable percentage of its films to be produced by the film industry, in order to assist in the development of a sound South African film industry. In its report the committee recommended that a strong central organization under the control of a board should be established by legislation, which could co-ordinate the film activities of the various State Departments, the provinces and State-aided bodies, which would make films itself and could act as a liaison with the film industry in order to have some of these films made, and to obtain the best distribution and exhibition facilities for State films. In terms of the committee&#x2019;s recommendation, this organization should be an autonomous body with legal personality, and which would have its own funds available and be able to plan ahead; it should be able to budget without being dependent on the normal parliamentary consent.</p>

<p>The object of this Bill is to give effect to the main recommendations of this Committee of Inquiry, namely to establish a National Board which can co-ordinate the film activities and photographic services of Government Departments, the provinces and State-supported bodies, and which can make provisions for the purchase, manufacture, exhibition and distribution of certain films of an informative nature; which will contribute to the development of the film industry in the Republic and which can buy films which have an archival value, collect them, process them and make them available to research workers, film producers and students who are interested in the development of the film as an art form.</p>

<p>The objects in regard to the production of films for State Departments and State-aided bodies, and the requirements which have to be complied with, may be summarized briefly as follows: Firstly, it is the object to produce or to have produced films destined to depict knowledge concerning South Africa, its people, their way of life, culture, traditions and problems. They are produced mainly for the State Information Department and are destined for local as well as overseas exhibition. They are supplied with sound tracks in Afrikaans, English and various European languages. These films therefore have to comply with the highest standards in regard to quality and technique. The second object in regard to the making of these films is to promote tourism. They are made for the Tourist Corporation, and will in future be made for the new Department of Tourism. They are also distributed overseas, and must therefore comply with the highest standards.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we need films to instruct the broad South African public as a whole in connection with specific matters like road safety and nutrition. They must also be of the correct length to fit in with the supporting programmes, and must also obviously be of good quality. Fourthly, the Government wants to have films made to publicize the particular functions and activities of Departments and organizations, <i>inter alia</i> with a view to recruiting personnel for, e.g., the Police, Defence, the Post Office, etc. They must also be of a high technical standard and attractive.</p>

<p><span class="col_7063_7064" refersTo="page_0864"/>Fifthly, we have to comply with the needs for classroom films which are used as educational aids in our schools. They must conform to the specific curricula of the schools and psychologically they must be such as to be suitable for the school audience concerned. In the sixth place, Mr. Speaker, we need films for research purposes. Phenomena of scientific interest are filmed for further analysis and study. Lastly I may perhaps mention that we need films to record historical and unique happenings for their educational and news value and for posterity.</p>

<p>As you will have inferred from the objects I have stated, Mr. Speaker, a fairly wide field for film production is envisaged. In order to attain all these objectives, use will be made to a large extent of the private film industry in our country. The Bill makes provision for that. Whereas in the past the industry had no share in this specific type of film production of the State, the Bill now provides that some of this work can be entrusted to the industry, through the board. The development of the film industry and of photography in the Republic will therefore greatly benefit from this Bill which is being introduced to-day. The intention is, however, not that the board will give direct support to the film industry of the country, but that it will act as a channel along which an important proportion of the demand of State Departments for the production of films will be canalized to commercial undertakings. The board will co-ordinate and control this aspect of the State&#x2019;s film requirements by appointing experts in the sphere of film production to ensure that the State receives the best value for its money from these commercial undertakings. Under the present system (with the exception of the films made by the industry for the Department of Information and the South African Railways and Harbours Administration) only about 50 films per annum each of ten minutes&#x2019; duration are made for other State Departments by the State&#x2019;s film production section. The balance of their annual requirements, amounting to about 150 reels, simply has to stand over year after year. The arrangement now proposed will result in greater production at a more reasonable cost. It is expected that when the board is in full swing, which we expect to be in three or four years&#x2019; time, only about 40 per cent (i.e. 80 reels) of the State&#x2019;s total requirements will be manufactured by the State itself. The other 60 per cent, amounting to 120 reels per annum of ten minutes each, will be made by commercial film producers through the agency of the board. In that way State funds will be made available to the growing film industry and indirectly give financial support to up-and-coming film producers, which will considerably strengthen our own film industry.</p>

<p>Whereas in the past the film requirements of the Department were necessarily restricted by the production capacity of the State Film Production Section, the board envisaged by this Bill will on behalf of the Departments be able to make arrangements with the industry to give effect to the needs of every particular Department. The Departments will in future have to negotiate with this Film Board in regard to their requirements. But&#x2014;and it is important to emphasize this&#x2014;the Departments themselves will have to make provision in their Estimates for funds to pay for the films made for them through the Film Board. The board&#x2019;s own production will, however, be limited to a maximum. I may just mention here that the State Department concerned, the Provincial Administrations and the South African Broadcasting Corporation have all been consulted in regard to this matter, and that they are all in agreement with the provisions of the Bill. The only body which raised objections for well-founded reasons is the South African Railways and Harbours Administration, and it is therefore specifically being excluded from the provisions of Clause 11. The Railways has already made its own contacts and we felt that it was not necessary to allow duplication.</p>

<p>In regard to the distribution of these films. I want to say that one of the important aims of this Film Board will be to bring about an improvement in that regard. One of the greatest problems with which the State has to cope is to ensure effective distribution for departmental films which bring matters of State and State policy to the knowledge of the public. From the nature of the matter it is difficult to persuade the distributors of films for entertainment to include in their programmes films of this nature which have little or no entertainment value. Except in exceptional cases, therefore, distribution through the ordinary amusement channels is eliminated, and other machinery has to be created in order to allow these films to reach the broad masses in the country.</p>

<p>In the case of educational classroom films, distribution is done by means of the Department&#x2019;s section for audiovisual education, but this distribution is to a large extent confined to the schools and other educational institutions of the Republic and South West Africa. The board which is now going to be established will therefore have to concentrate on building up distribution channels in this country which are not exclusively dependent on places of entertainment. The National Film Board of Canada has succeeded in achieving a nation-wide distribution of State films by obtaining the co-operation of cultural organizations, film clubs, study groups, libraries, agricultural clubs, debating societies, etc. I do not think it ought to be difficult to build up a similar distribution organization in this country also. In regard to overseas distribution, there will have to be the closest co-operation with the Departments of Information and Tourism in order to make use of the existing distribution channels. Apart from this, a definite campaign will have to be launched in order to develop new fields. Hon. members who visit the cinemas have frequently seen documentary films depicting Canada, New Zealand and other countries, films which are often welcomed by the cinema-going public. <span class="col_7065_7066" refersTo="page_0865"/>So one asks oneself why documentary films made in South Africa and depicting our natural beauties and way of life cannot also be shown on the screen in those countries. It will be the task of this Film Board to seek such channels for distribution for us abroad.</p>

<p>Apart from the extent to which the private film industry will be used for the production of State films, the Film Board will of course also have to concentrate on making films on its own initiative for inland as well as overseas distribution. In regard to photographic services, the position to-day is such that various State Departments&#x2019; functions are of such a nature that they have to have their own photographic service. That is, e.g., the case in the Department of Defence, the South African Police, Trigonometrical Survey, Agriculture and Information. The last-mentioned two Departments do only part of their own photographic work, and the rest of it is done for them by the State Film Production Section. The object of this Bill is not to bring about a change in this present state of affairs, but to make provision for the proper coordination of the State&#x2019;s photographic requirements and to ensure that unnecessary overlapping does not take place. A central photographic service will be able to do this work much more economically, particularly where it concerns the large-scale production of photographs and diapositives.</p>

<p>I now come to the financing of this Film Board. In so far as the initial running costs of the board are concerned, it is envisaged, as indicated in Clause 14 (1), that the board will be financed by means of interest-carrying loans supplied by the State. It is estimated that an amount of R100,000 will be necessary for this. In addition, loan capital will have to be supplied to the board in order to enable it to take over the existing film equipment of the State Film Production Section and that of other Government Departments, which it will need for the carrying out of its objectives.</p>

<p>For the rest, the board, as indicated in Clause 14 (1) (b) and (c), will be dependent on moneys received for services rendered, contracts entered into or action taken by the board, or on money from other sources. At this stage, Sir, I should just like to give notice of an amendment which I will move in the Committee Stage. I want to draw the attention of hon. members to Clause 3 (1) (b). This clause provides that all five of the persons concerned will serve on the board, but the word &#x201C;or&#x201D; in line 43 (of the Afrikaans text) causes doubt in the mind of some persons as to whether that is the intention. Consequently I will move that the paragraph concerned be replaced by the following one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of sub-sections (5) and (6)&#x2026; the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science, the Secretary for Trade and Industry, the Secretary for Information, the Secretary for Tourism and the Chairman of the South African Broadcasting Corporation.</block>

<p>The law advisers tell me that this &#x201C;or&#x201D; really means &#x201C;and&#x201D;, but I was not able to understand it and they were then good enough to put it in language which even I could understand.</p>

<p>I now come to the question of the Film Institute, which is also provided for in this Bill. This Bill also provides for the establishment of a Film Institute under the Film Board. Everybody who saw the exhibition of documentary films in Cape Town and in Pretoria will surely agree that this is a very important aspect which we dare not neglect further, and that is where we should preserve our documentary films in this country. The institute which will be established by the Film Board will be responsible for the purchase and acquisition by donation of films of an archival value, and for the restoration, care and preservation thereof to prevent this material being lost to posterity, to research workers, students, etc. As you know, Sir, the life of film is to a large extent dependent on storage under certain definite conditions in regard to humidity and temperature. Nevertheless a stage is reached where such a film deteriorates and even gradually perishes. In such a case it ought to be duplicated timeously so that its contents may be preserved for future use. It is now envisaged that the institute will also make available for research purposes the films in its care. As something depicting history, the film plays a great role in the forming of a nation&#x2019;s character and traditions, and as such it should be available for exhibition on suitable occasions. Because the proposed Film Board will have available to it specially built storage rooms and equipment for the preservation, restoration and duplication of films, this is the suitable body to which the functions of the proposed Film Institute should be entrusted.</p>

<p>You will agree, Mr. Speaker, that a certain measure of State control is essential in view of the fact that the State is making available considerable sums for film production. Clauses 17, 18, 19 and 20 provide for the necessary measure of State control over the activities of the board.</p>

<p>In regard to the date of commencement of the activities, I may just mention that we intend appointing the Film Board as soon as possible, if this Bill is passed by Parliament, so that it can commence its activities early next year, quite probably towards the beginning of July 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, viewed from the educational, the cultural, and we may also say, the industrial, angles, this is a very important undertaking, and I should like to think that it is generally supported by this House.</p>

<p>The Department of Information will be treated in the same way as any other Department. It must apply through the Film Board for the making of films. As the hon. member will see, there is an exception in Clause 11, namely that if any Department should desire to make a film otherwise than through the agency of the Film Board it will be necessary for the Minister of that Department to come to an agreement with the Minister of Education, Arts and Science so that the necessary permission may be granted. Except for such a case, all applications by State Departments for the making of films, either by the Film Board itself or by private undertakings, must be canalized through the Film Board; they are the people who have to do the co-ordination. The main object of this Bill is to get that co-ordination so that it will not be necessary for every Department to establish its own film unit.</p>

<p>I have said that one of our great problems is to get the correct distribution channels for State-produced films. We are struggling to make them available to the public, both inside this country and overseas. Throughout the years the Railways has succeeded in building up distribution channels for itself here and abroad. It has built up valuable commercial contacts for itself, and we feel that it should be allowed to retain those contact. There are cases where, e.g., they manage to get the aircraft of the S.A. Railways shown in advertisements of other undertakings as the result of their business contacts with them. Our main object is to get the best possible distribution of our films, and whilst the Railways has these contacts and channels and requested us to allow it to continue with them, it was felt that we could comply with that request.</p>

<p>As the Minister stated in his introductory speech this is a most important piece of legislation because it envisages control of an extremely powerful medium for the influencing of public opinion. We have had a very short time to consider this measure. I think we will be better able to study the Bill now that we have had the advantage of hearing the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s observations about the various provisions and the principles contained in the Bill. I therefore wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask for the privilege of the half-hour, Sir? Last year when we discussed the Vote of the Minister of Labour we raised several difficulties that people were experiencing. We on this side of the House are very glad to see that some of those difficulties have disappeared; we are grateful for the improvement. We are also glad, for the Minister&#x2019;s sake, that he does not have to contend with these extreme problems any more. Last year, for example, one of the major subjects we had to discuss was the question of unemployment. The Minister himself had to come to the House with an amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Act in order to save money for the Unemployment Insurance Fund because the drain on that fund had become so serious that it gave reason for concern. That amended Unemployment Insurance Act has now been in force for a year and I think it would be interesting for the House if the Minister gave us a full report of the effects of the amendments. We would know how much money has been saved as a result of the severe restrictions which were placed upon beneficiaries, apart from the savings which must have been effected as a result of the improvement in the employment situation. We shall also be interested to learn from the Minister whether his Department has had any information about hardships caused by the administration of the amended Act. We on this side of the House have certainly had many complaints from people who have suftered as the result of the amendments. The difficulties last year were caused mainly by the reluctance on the part of people who own capital to invest their money in South Africa. People were unwilling to invest their capital in businesses in South Africa in view of the uncertainty at the time which still obtains to a large extent. That has been overcome in part for several reasons. One of them is that various finance institutions have had to reduce their interest rates. This has made it more attractive for people to borrow money and to use it. There is also no doubt that Government expenditure, especially in the Defence Department, as had a stimulating effect upon industry. Finally, there is the natural phenomenon that capital dislikes to be idle. When people have capital available they want to use <span class="col_7069_7070" refersTo="page_0867"/>that money. As capital mounts up there is a tendency on the part of people to suppress their worries and fears and to take risks with their money.</p>

<p>It is the duty of the Opposition to warn the Minister of Labour that he must please not be over-optimistic about the labour situation. All Ministers of Labour in the past, since 1948, have tended to come to Parliament and to give us statistics about the labour position which have not been convincing. Indeed, Sir, we on this side of the House have found that figures given by the Department in respect of the unemployment position are useless and indeed misleading. We know for a fact, in the first instance, that many of our Coloured people who are entitled to register as unemployed do not do so. They prefer to trudge the streets looking for work themselves at factory gates rather than to appeal to the Department of Labour. I do not know why they do so; reasons are given which I do not want to repeat because I think many of them are unfounded. But the fact remains that the statistics available to the Department of Labour on the unemployment position amongst Coloureds and Indians are completely unreliable. We shall show this in the course of our speeches. We know that the unemployment position amongst Indians in Natal is one which is causing profound concern. The estimates I have heard from authoritative sources far exceed the official figures available to the Minister and which he gives to the House in good faith. The time has come that the Department of Labour should accept that the information that they have officially in regard to unemployment among Coloureds and Indians cannot be relied upon at all.</p>

<p>Then we have the fact that we in South Africa do not maintain statistics of unemployment among our Native people. In this connection the findings of the Froneman Commission must have come as a severe shock to us all. I hope the Minister of Labour was duly shocked when he learnt from the report of that commission of the startling incidence of unemployment amongst the Native people of South Africa. It is a difficult position. I know. Whom does one classify as unemployed in the strict sense of the word? The unemployed may be a tribal Native; he may have his roots in the reserve; he may have land in the reserve to which he can return and which may entitle one to say that although he is not in active employment he cannot be regarded as unemployed because he has a form of earning a living in the reserves. The mere fact that that is the position means that a greater number of detribalized Natives are probably not regarded as unemployed although they are, strictly speaking. They are not regarded as unemployed because this Government perseveres in the fiction that all the Bantu people in South Africa are in fact still tribal Natives and that they should still have their roots in the reserves, even if they do not. That fiction confuses the issue. It makes it impossible for us to do clear thinking about the position of the industrial Native in South Africa.</p>

<p>In this connection I must add that it is a pity that the statistics of the Department of Labour do not make it possible for us to determine in which age groups the larger number of unemployed fall. I think if we were able to determine the age groups of most of the unemployed in this country we will find that the situation is most unhappy. From our experience we are sure the Minister will find that the heaviest incidence of unemployment occurs amongst our elderly people, not our old people, but our elderly people of 50 years to 60. We on this side of the House and I am sure hon. members opposite know of hard cases, of men who are physically and mentally fit but who are out of work because they are over 45 and find it impossible to find a job. Employers are nervous of a man who is over 45. They are the people who suffer. I would ask the hon. Minister what special steps has his Department taken to see to it that these willing workers, whom we need in South Africa, are given proper opportunities to be placed in employment? It would seem that there is no special machinery in the Department of Labour to provide for the needs, the dire needs, of people over 45 who are unemployed. You see, Sir, we cannot afford in South Africa that people of skill and people of potential skill, even of 45 and over (these people still have skills or may have skills that can be developed), are wasted; we cannot afford to have them unemployed. There seems to be general agreement amongst all people who think about the economy of South Africa that the dominant retarding factor in the development of our country is not persistently a shortage of capital or the unwillingness of capital to become invested, but it is the shortage of skilled manpower.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I am grateful to see that the hon. member for Vereeniging and I for once worry about the same thing. I am asking the Department of Labour in the first place whether they are aware of this particular problem and secondly, whether they have taken special steps and have taken special measures in order to meet the problem. If they have not, then the Opposition will have, as so often has happened, to think out something and present it to the Government in order to overcome this problem. But first of all, I want to give the hon. Minister a chance to show that he has been thinking about the problem and that he has taken steps.</p>

<p>I was making the point about the shortage of skilled manpower in South Africa. Not long ago the hon. the Prime Minister published some of the findings of his Economic Advisory Council and one of the major findings was that the problem that we in South Africa will have to face in future and have to face at the moment is the problem of the shortage of manpower. Now I am not going to press that advice by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s <span class="col_7071_7072" refersTo="page_0868"/>Economic Advisory Council. Our experience is that members on the Government side do not attach much importance to advice by reputable economists. So I am rather hoping that it may have some impact upon hon. members opposite if I quote the remarks of people who are actively engaged in industry and business in South Africa to show how serious the shortage of manpower is. I would like to draw the attention of the hon. Minister to the result of a survey recently conducted by the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation. According to the morning Press of 23 April of this year this was the position&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are immediate vacancies for just under 2,000 skilled men in the engineering and allied industries according to a survey recently conducted by the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation. And as the economic recovery gets into its stride, the number of vacancies is expected to increase.</block>

<p>Only in the steel industry a shortage of 2,000 skilled workers! And as our defence programme expands and as further demands are made on our steel industry, every South African must feel profound concern to think that in one industry alone, a key industry, a vital industry, there is a shortage of 2,000 skilled people. That is not all. Look at the position in the building industry. According to a report in the morning Press of 16 February this year, we are told&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The President of the Pretoria Master Builders&#x2019; Association, Mr. R. L. Downie, last night gave a warning that a shortage of labour was threatening in the building industry.</block>

<p>&#x201C;I understand that only 15 apprentices were registered this year, and of these 13 had only passed Std. VI at the age of 16 or over. The average age for this standard is 13 years.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It was obvious that with the natural wastage, the industry would not be able to continue unless ways were found for attracting suitable apprentices or use was made of Africans already trained by the municipal housing authorities.</p>

<p>Then more generally there was a statement reported in the afternoon Press on 26 February, referring to Dr. M. H. de Kock, the ex-chairman of the Reserve Bank, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As things are in South Africa at present, the availability of capital will not become a general problem. Although there may be an occasional shortage of risk capital, the gap will be filled by established investment companies in the country.</block>

<p>Dr. de Kock, speaking at the annual meeting of Federale Volksbeleggings, added that the most important limiting factor in the expansion of South Africa&#x2019;s economy was shortage of suitably trained people.</p>

<p>Then we had a statement by Mr. D. W. J. C. Visser, a senior psychologist of the Cape Education Department, who said, as reported in the morning Press of 26 April, that there had been an alarming wastage of White manpower in South Africa for years, and very little had been done about it.</p>

<p>So I can go on, Mr. Chairman. I have a stack of quotations here, but I do not want to bore the House. But psychologists, industrialists, economists, all complain that we have a bottleneck and that as the skills and enterprise and the labour of our people combine to advance South Africa, the bottleneck will increasingly be skilled manpower. We want to know what the Government is going to do about it. Can we afford to waste our elderly manpower as is happening to-day in South Africa? Is the Department of Labour fully aware of this shortage of manpower, the need for more skilled labour?</p>

<p>But when I ask whether we can afford to waste our elderly manpower, I am forced to put another question as well, a question which is more tragic: Can we afford to waste the skills and abilities of our youth in South Africa? It grieves me to have to tell the House that in fact there is a shameful wastage of the potential skills of our young people. Again, I cannot state it better than as it has been stated by some of the prominent leaders in the business world and in industry in South Africa. Here is the testimony of Dr. F. J. van Biljon, president of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce, as reported in the <i>Transvaler</i> on 20 April 1963. This is what he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In plaas van om hul tyd te mors deur agter Cliff Richards se handtekening aan te hardloop moet die jeug liewer probeer om sy eie handtekening die moeite werd te maak.</block>

<p>Statistiek dui daarop dat die Bantoe vinnig besig is om sy agterstand by die blanke in te haal.</p>

<p>And then he follows this up with a shocking statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar is beraam dat &#x2019;n kwart van ons leerlinge wat wel in Staat is om te matrikuleer dit nie doen nie, slegs omdat hulle nie probeer nie. Om ons as nasie te handhaaf, is dit nodig dat ons gebruik sal maak van die intellektuele vermo&#x00EB;ns wat daar aan ons gegee is.</block>

<p>I want to remind the hon. Chief Whip of the party opposite that we are now not talking politics, but we are discussing much more serious matters.</p>

<p>I would also like to draw the attention to a survey conducted by National Institute of <span class="col_7073_7074" refersTo="page_0869"/>Personnel Research, which also reveals a shocking situation, as again reported in the <i>Transvaler</i> of 22 April 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Opname onder &#x2019;n groot groep jong blanke mans in die Republiek het aan die lig gebring dat omtrent 36 persent tot ho&#x00EB;r kwalifikasies in staat was as wat hulle bekom het.</block>

<p>As 5,000 meer blanke mans jaarliks in Suid-Afrika matriek of soortgelyke kwalifikasies behaal, en 3,000 meer blanke mans per jaar genoeg opleiding bekom om toesighoudende of geskoolde werk te verrig, sal dit &#x2019;n geweldige verskil aan die samelewing in die land maak.</p>

<p>Die Instituut het vraelyste gestuur aan 11,120 blanke mans tussen die ouderdomme 17 en 20 jaar, wat in 1954 vir milit&#x00EA;re opleiding gereigstreer het, en aan 5,157 mans wat nie vir milit&#x00EA;re opleiding goedgekeur was nie.</p>

<p>Volgens skatting was sowat 39 persent van die mans in die groep wat nie Std. VIII gehaal het nie, wel daartoe in Staat met meer aanmoediging en moeite.</p>

<p>Dit is bereken dat &#x2019;n totaal van sowat 32.5 persent van die groep wat nie matriek of soortgelyke kwalifikasies gehaal het nie, daartoe in Staat was.</p>

<p>And so on, a story of the wastage of the potential skills and abilities and gifts of the youth of South Africa. Sir, are we not reaping our corn while it is still green? Are we not indulging in a form of waste that no country can afford, but least of all this sorely tried nation of South Africa.</p>

<p>Should we not consider whether one of the causes at least&#x2014;and this where the Department of Labour is directly responsible&#x2014;for reaping our corn while it is still green, for wasting the potential of our people, is that by various measures for which this Department is responsible, we are creating a false sense of security among our young people? That to me is the great danger of a system&#x2014;I will call it a system&#x2014;of action, of thought, known as &#x201C;job reservation&#x201D;. That to me is one of its greatest dangers. Through job reservation we are limiting all races in South Africa in their opportunities, limiting them in their potentials, denying to South Africa the abilities of the peoples of South Africa&#x2014;a shameful state of affairs! I notice that the Garment Workers Union in a statement issued on 15 February, of this year, complains that since job reservation was introduced the number of White workers, White garment workers in the Transvaal, came down from 3,237 in 1960 to 2,936 at the beginning of 1963. In spite of this so-called protection, the number of White workers in this industry is decreasing. The reason is that job reservation works against the interests of White workers in the Transvaal, it works against the interests of factories in the Transvaal; it favours factories in Natal and in the Cape, but especially factories on the borders of the reserves. They have an unfair advantage over factories in the Transvaal where they employ civilized labour and pay civilized wages to their people. The time has come that the hon. Minister of Labour&#x2014; and not his deputy, I want to hear the hon. Minister himself on this&#x2014;should tell us what is his Government&#x2019;s policy to make use of the potential of our Coloured and Indian peoples. After all, in theory at least, the Natives have their homeland: The Xhosas in the Transkei, the Zulus in Zululand and the Vendas in Vendaland, etc. etc. They have opportunities to realize their skills and their potentials. But what about the Coloured people and Indian people? What does the Government do to see that those people are able to give to the full of the potential that God has put into them to this country, this South Africa of ours? What is the Government&#x2018;s policy?</p>

<p>Let us look what is happening to the cape Coloured people for example. In this City of Cape Town, there are hundreds of fine monuments to the enterprise of the Cape Coloured people, some of the finest buildings of this city. But from 13 May of this year, seven skilled crafts in the building industry in the Cape have been closed to the Coloured people. What is this? I will tell you what it is. It is nothing but a gratuitious, ineffective insult to the Coloured people of the Cape. Here I have a report from the morning Press on 30 April 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From 13 May, seven skilled crafts in the building industry will be reserved for White workers in certain areas of the western Cape where 75 per cent of the building trade artisans are Coloured.</block>

<p>Coloured workers now practising the crafts, however, will be allowed to continue their trades in &#x201C;White areas&#x201D;.</p>

<p>How very generous of the Minister! The report continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A representative of 3,000 Coloured men yesterday described the new determination as &#x201C;slavery&#x201D;. The crafts concerned are stone and marble masonry, joinery and wood-machining in workshops, electric wiring, letter-cutting and stone decorating and shop, office and bank fittings.</block>

<p>Mr. Bruce Dundas, vice-president of the Master Builders and Allied Trades Association, said: &#x201C;The building industry offers one of the finest avenues of employment for Coloured men.</p>

<p>The Coloured people need not fear it will ever be possible for Whites to take over their jobs in the building industry. There are just not enough Whites available and the determination soon to come into effect will have little practical effect. It is restricted to certain branches of the trade that have been staffed almost wholly by Whites.</p>

<p><span class="col_7075_7076" refersTo="page_0870"/>So I say it is a gratuitous insult to hurt the feelings of these loyal South Africans, these Coloured people. What a reflection on the justice of the people in charge of the Government in South Africa! And the reaction of the Coloured people was that it amounted to &#x201C;slavery&#x201D;. The quotation goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Speaking for 3,000 members of the Western Province Workers&#x2019; Union&#x2014;the Coloured workers&#x2014;Mr. R. G. Simmonds, the secretary said: &#x201C;Determinations like this are a constant source of worry for our artisans and their children. No other industry has such a glut of artisans as the building industry. Normally our members would have migrated to other areas of work, but those doors have now been closed to them.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Causing worry and unhappiness.&#x201D; This Minister by the application of job reservation to these seven crafts in the building industry, has been guilty of gratuitously insulting the Coloured people, quite unnecessarily, causing unhappiness and worry and misery in a thousand homes in the western Cape. Quite unnecessary in the circumstances. Unnecessary because South Africa needs the skills of these people, Coloured or not. Look how silly this job reservation system is! It is purely a political gesture, totally ineffective as a protection for the people. I want to come to another report from Durban, which appeared on 23 April 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A shortage of White heavy-vehicle drivers and the difficulty in finding reliable men to do this type of work has prompted one of South African oil companies to employ Africans to drive its petrol tankers.</block>

<p>Although heavy-vehicle driving was work reserved for Whites, the Department of Labour, said a spokesman for the company, had given the company permission in Natal to engage Africans. There is said to be a shortage of 17,000 White drivers in the Province.</p>

<p>Job reservation, but the Minister is forced to grant exemptions and allow Africans to do the work for which no White people are available.</p>

<p>Well, the fact remains that there is a shortage. The fact remains that in many industries, the hon. Minister has to give exemptions. The hon. Minister knows it. He knows that there are very many complaints from people who say: This type of work is reserved for Whites only; give us the White people; we simply cannot get them. I want to repeat that we cannot afford in South Africa to deny people the opportunity of using their potential skills. I have heard from a very good source that at Hammarsdale people are employed to do building work on the new border factories and that they are paid 25 per cent of the wages paid to White people in the established industrial areas. Is this the intention of job reservation? To reserve jobs for White people in the existing industrial areas and then to see that future jobs are created on the borders of the reserves where there is no job reservation, and no rate for the job so that eventually only non-existent jobs will be reserved in White industrial areas for Whites? Job reservation is no protection. The only effectual protection is the rate for the job. That fundamentally is still the only protection for all the workers, irrespective of race in this country.</p>

<p>I want to know from the hon. Minister how his Department intends to overcome this problem they have, this problem of the shortage of skilled labour in South Africa. At the moment immigration is still tragically inadequate. I cannot go into detail, because that falls under the next vote. But it is a fact that although immigration has slightly increased, and compared to what the Government did in the past, it has dramatically increased, it is still hopelessly inadequate for the needs of South Africa. And even if all the White people in South Africa were to be trained to the limit of their skills, as all of us would like to see, it still would not be enough to fill the real needs of South Africa in respect of skilled labour, and to enable us to expand to the limit of our capacity.

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) was true to form to-day; he once again made a big fuss about problems to which attention has been drawn repeatedly and in connection with which there have been appeals to people to co-operate in combating those problems. He began by referring to the Indians and the Coloureds who do not register with the Labour Bureaux. We admit that fact, to a degree. However, I should like to ask him whether he now wants the Minister and his Department to take the &#x201C;Bergies&#x201D; in Table Mountain from the bushes and drive them to the Labour Bureaux to have themselves registered, or does he want the Department of Labour to take the Indians, who are living in their thousands in the bushes around Durban, out of the bushes and get them to register themselves? Is it the task of the Department of Labour to drive the people with a whip to the Labour Bureaux to be registered? The Department is there to provide employment for the people who want to register. It is the task of the Department of Labour. The hon. member has referred to people 45 years of age and older. Now I happen to be one of those who have repeatedly pleaded in this House for those people of more than 45 years of age, and I have pointed out the difficulties in the way of getting these people employed. The Government has already done very much. Steps have been taken to raise the age limit in the Public Service, in the Railways, etc., and last year again in the Defence Force the age <span class="col_7077_7078" refersTo="page_0871"/>was raised to enable us to make use of these people. But there are certain problems and I wish to point out that even when Mr. Schoeman was Minister of Labour, and when Mr. de Klerk was Minister of Labour, appeals were made to employers to employ the older men and to retain them in employment. But there are certain difficulties in this regard, and one of the greatest difficulties is the question of pension funds, in view of the provision in regard to the pension funds that people cannot contribute to pension funds after they have reached the age of 45 years. That is one of the great obstacles, this provision in the regulations in respect of the pension funds, that people above the age of 45 years can no longer contribute to a pension fund. That is a very great objection. But I know the Government is sympathetically disposed to the matter. The hon. member has also elaborated upon the shortage of skilled labour and technicians. I want to tell him that we are equally concerned about that. In the course of the present Session a motion was proposed by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) in which he drew the attention of the House to that matter, and efforts have been made in this regard. The hon. member refers to one-quarter of the high school pupils who can matriculate but who have not matriculated. He blames the Government for that. I think responsible people in this country have year after year, particularly during recent years, appealed to parents to keep their children at school, and the present Government has had great success in increasing the number of high school scholars. I should like to mention some figures. In 1948 there were 123,513 scholars in our high schools and that number had already increased in 1961 to 232,230; while the number of pupils in the primary schools has increased by 52.15 per cent, the number of high school scholars has increased during the last 12 years by 96.1 per cent. I think a very great effort has been made particularly by putting up more high schools in the Transvaal, etc., so that the scholars remained at school. Reducing the age of admission to high schools also contributed to it. But much more can be done in this regard. However, I should like to point out further what more has been done to encourage people to qualify themselves. Take the matter of bursaries. Do you know that since 1956 the Government has instituted bursary schemes in the Public Service firstly, and that 1,600 public servants have already received bursaries to qualify themselves technically. They have been given the opportunity to study. 1,323 agricultural bursaries have already been granted; 302 bursaries have been granted to railway people. The C.S.I.R. has, with the aid of funds from the Government, awarded 910 bursaries and since 1956 the Government has also made funds available to universities, and since that year R464,000 has been made available for bursaries to enable people to undergo technical training.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member has also dwelt upon job reservation and the Coloured people. I want to say at once that the hon. member&#x2019;s facts in this regard are completely wrong. In any event, he represents it in such a way that it does not give a picture of realities. The job reservation determinations provide in the first place that the Coloured building workers who have qualified themselves to-day, may continue and no reservation is applied to them. Similarly also the apprentices already registered. Moreover, job reservation provides that it applies to only certain areas, only the larger cities. Outside the big cities it does not apply at all.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Next it provides that job reservation is not applicable to a group area for Coloureds in the Cape or to a group area for Indians in Durban. Let us now take the opportunities being created by the Government for Coloureds at the present time. Do you know that at the present time many opportunities for Coloured workers have been created within the metropolitan areas which have been mentioned, for which the Coloured workers are eligible and may be registered? I wish to explain that the Government is engaged upon great housing schemes for the Coloureds in the Cape. There is a shortage of 50,000 dwellings for Coloureds alone, and for Indians alone there is a shortage of 30,000 dwellings. Those dwellings have to be built with Coloured labour in the Coloured areas. The Housing Commission is spending R7,000,000 annually on Coloured housing in the Cape alone, and the Coloureds are building them. Those are only the dwellings, but think of all the other public buildings such as schools and churches that must be built. That shows there are sufficient opportunities for employment. To try to create the impression that we are depriving the Coloureds of work, surely is wrong.</p>

<p>Take another fact. There is the Garden Cities Utility Company which laid out Pinelands. They have now received approval for the establishment of a Coloured township here comprising 3,000 dwellings. We have given the Bantu an opportunity to build their own housing schemes, and the same thing is being done for the Coloureds. In other words, to create the impression that the Government is taking away work from the Coloured people is wrong. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I was asking what the Minister&#x2019;s plans are to overcome the shortage of skilled labour. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) seemed to indicate that my major attack was on job reservation, but my attack was that we would like to see some drive on the part of the Minister and his Department to overcome the shortage of skilled labour, and job reservation is only one aspect of it. The hon. member reminds me of the simple woman who had an illegitimate child and when the minister reproached <span class="col_7079_7080" refersTo="page_0872"/>her for the sin she had committed she said that it was only a tiny baby. In spite of the opportunities for work given to the Coloured people, it remains wrong to deny them the right to use their skills in the service of the only country they know. I do not agree with it, but in the case of the Black people my friends opposite can argue that they will have their own country. But the Coloureds and the Indians have to live here and we are denying them the right to use their potential skills to build up South Africa, and that is the point the hon. member did not even attempt to answer. How can the Minister overcome this problem? It is quite clear that immigration cannot solve the problem, and even if all the White people in this country were trained we should not solve it. It is clear that we shall have to use the labour resources of South Africa properly and make available to South Africa the skills of its people, which this Government not only fails to do but prohibits. If we could really combine the potential of the people of this country, there is no limit to this country. We could then set an example to the whole of Africa. We could become the industrial and economic leader of the whole of Africa, but we are denying that by our own bigotry. We should accept as our simple principle that our people should be given the right to put their potential at the disposal of their fatherland. I am not alone in saying this. Some of the most surprising people agree with the United Party. Here I have a report in the <i>Star</i> of 23 April of a speech made by Dr. C. R. Louw, the chairman of Trust Bank&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What appears to be a clear appeal for the development of the skills of all races with the least disruption of South Africa&#x2019;s labour force was made by Dr. C. R. Louw. Looking optimistically to the future, Dr. Louw predicted that the population would rise to 22,000,000 by 1965.&#x2026;</block>

<p>Personally, I think that is a misprint, but he is reported to have said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Purchasing power will rise by R3,000,000. The <i>per capita</i> income of the Europeans would rise by R340,000,000&#x2026; and the national income would almost double itself to R7,400,000,000. Therefore all possible steps should be taken to increase not only the quantity but also the quality of our labour force.</block>

<p>I can only say it is impossible for anyone to state the attitude of this side of the House more clearly than Dr. Louw did.</p>

<p>But of course people must be protected against unfair competition. People with a higher standard of living must be protected against competition from people with a lower standard of living, but the answer to that is not job reservation. The answer to it is the measure adopted by all civilized states throughout the world as far as I know, and that is the principle of paying the rate for the job, which prohibits the employer from employing a man at a lower wage when he is willing to work for a lower wage because he has a lower standard of living. Everywhere else in the world it works, but in South Africa for some peculiar reason is said not to work. But the history of this country shows that it does work. Nowhere in South Africa have non-Whites displaced Whites from work, but the non-Whites have created work for all other races, and that is reciprocally true of all races. Work begets work.</p>

<p>Then I think the Minister should consider whether the time has not arrived when the privileges of learning the advantages of collective bargaining should not be extended to the other races. I have not the time to go into this, but the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), who was unfortunately prevented by illness from being here to-day, on a previous occasion put out suggestions to the Minister. We admit that most of the Black people in this country are too primitive to conduct collective bargaining, but the existing trade unions, with their vast experience, should be encouraged to include the interests of the Native workers in the representations they make, and there should even be a system of affiliated membership with the existing trade unions so that the Black people can gain experience. In advocating this course, I want to warn the Government that it is necessary that we in South Africa should train our Bantu in this art of collective bargaining, because if the Government&#x2019;s policy is to come to fruition the time is not far distant when nothing the Government can do will stop the Bantu of the Transkei from forming trade unions and claiming for themselves the right to conduct collective bargaining. Unless we start training them now, they will exercise those rights without the necessary experience and responsibility, and it will result in chaos and misery, and nobody will be to blame except this Government which denies those people the opportunity to be properly trained.</p>

<p><i>I</i> apologize, but if I may not plead for it, I may put a question on the subject, and I want to ask the Minister whether he has ever considered the need for such a step. I want to say that if only we would change our attitude to the human <span class="col_7081_7082" refersTo="page_0873"/>resources of South Africa, we can change the outlook for South Africa completely, not only industrially but also politically. This Government has a wonderful opportunity; yet they are locking the door on that opportunity. The Minister has the key to that door. This Minister in his past life knew better. He had wonderful opportunities to learn wisdom. I can only hope that he will impart some of that wisdom to the other side of the House, to moderate some of the follies he is compelled to administer to-day. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>There can be only one fundamental reason when official recognition is sought for Bantu trade unions.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>I was not referring to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). I merely said that there can be only one fundamental reason when official recognition of Bantu trade unions is asked for, and that is that the Bantu have no effective champion for better wages and conditions of employment in South Africa. Now it is strange that the hon. member raised this matter at this stage when everybody in the country must admit that the Bantu have an effective champion for their interests in the Central Bantu Labour Bureau. For the past four years, from 1959 to 1962, wage increases have been brought about in this manner for 514,000 Bantu workers, amounting to nearly R23,000,000 I say it is peculiar that we should have to receive these representations when the Wage Board which has been established to look after the interests of the unorganized workers in industry, has had its working capacity doubled by legislation, and that during the last five years 60 determinations have been made by the Wage Board, affecting 203,000 Bantu workers, and which mean millions of rand for the Bantu workers.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has also referred to the many complaints received from contributors to the Unemployment Benefit Fund as a result of the amendments passed here last year. The position is that the Minister has stated during this year, in reply to questions from the other side, that the complaints received emanated from persons who have left the labour market and no longer qualify for benefits because they did not work for the minimum of 13 weeks now required. In most of the cases the complainants received the benefits on various occasions during the period of 26 weeks in the preceding period of 52 weeks. Their complaints now were that it is not their fault that they have attained an advanced age or have become chronic sick persons. The hon. member for Yeoville knows as well as I do that the primary purpose of the funds has always been to pay unemployment benefits to contributors who are suitable to be employed and available for employment, while they are unemployed and are looking for employment. In other words, the object of the fund was never to pay a pension to people who have left the labour market. Even with the introduction of the sickness allowance in 1952, the then Minister of Labour, Mr. Schoeman, stated very emphatically that we did not intend establishing a scheme to pay sick benefits; it is a matter that should fall under a scheme of national health insurance. In other words, the people who have complaints, are people who simply cannot be assisted, because the fund was never intended to help those people.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville has said that the rate for the job is the only effective safeguard for the Whites. But when we read the report of the Industrial Tribunal on the building industry in the Cape Province and Natal, we find that this so-called safeguard has nowhere stopped the ousting of the Whites in that industry in these two provinces. On the contrary, the same principle which has been lauded by the hon. member for Yeoville as a safeguard for the Whites, was really a crowbar used to oust the White man out of this industry. That is revealed very clearly. I do not know whether the hon. member has read the report, but there is the evidence of the Durban Branch of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers. That is a society which is opposed to job reservation, but what does their Durban branch say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Society holds the view that the rate for the job is the only safeguard for their members. The Durban Branch of this Society however adopted a very strong and positive attitude in favour of job reservation for Whites. It says that the principle of the rate for the job is a failure and has not succeeded in eliminating cheap Coloured labour.</block>

<p>That is understandable, for the simple reason-that the White artisan usually receives more than the minimum wage, while only the minimum is paid to the non-Whites, who are able to eke out a living on that, but on which the White man with his higher standard of living cannot do so. But the position of the White worker is undermined still more because dishonest employers pay to non-White artisans even less than the minimum wage. Evidence was given in this regard by White workers before the Industrial Tribunal. They said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are complaints also about some employers who make common cause with the Coloured artisans and agree with them on lower wages than employers are obliged to pay artisans.</block>

<p>That is on page 16 of the report. This evidence, is corroborated also by the Industrial Council of Natal in their evidence, where they said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One of the greatest problems of the Council is that some White, as well as some Coloured master builders make common cause with Coloured artisans in regard to the underpayment of wages.</block>

<p><span class="col_7083_7084" refersTo="page_0874"/>But what happened in Kimberley, where the principle of the rate for the job prevailed? If the hon. member for Yeoville had read the report of the Industrial Tribunal on the building industry, he would have known that they said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Kimberley is a typical example of the consequences of the infiltration of Coloureds into an industry. In a relatively short while the White artisans were completely overshadowed in numbers by Coloureds who are not only the main building workers, but the majority of the foremen are drawn from their numbers. Even a trade such as electro-technical wiring, which is done mainly by Whites throughout the whole country, is here no longer in White hands.</block>

<p>The building industry in Kimberley at the present time is wholly dependent upon the Coloured artisan. What has happened here in the western Cape in the building industry, where the Whites constitute only 25 per cent? This very remedy the hon. member for Yeoville wanted to suggest as a sufficient safeguard for the White workers, namely equal wages for equal work, has forced the White worker in the position that to-day he constitutes 25 per cent of the building industry. What objection has the Opposition to these 25 per cent Whites being protected in their industry? [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I ask for the privilege of the second half hour? I should like to discuss the Government&#x2019;s policy with regard to job reservation as it affects the Coloured people. I do so in the knowledge that the present Minister of Labour is a fair-minded man who will consider these representations and will not be unduly influenced by some of the regrettable speeches made by other hon. members. This matter of job reservation is one of paramount importance as far as the Coloured people are concerned. I cannot speak too strongly of the great frustration and fears which exist in the minds of the Coloured people about their future in this country, the only one they know, if a halt is not called to this unfortunate policy of job reservation.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>It undermines their very economic existence. There can be no gainsaying the fact that job reservation is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction and antagonism amongst the Coloureds. Protests have been made by most of the Coloured organizations throughout the country, and particularly the Cape, against job reservation. It is claimed that job reservation not only deprives members of the Coloured community from following the trades and occupations which were traditionally theirs down the corridors of the years, but it is also having the effect&#x2014;and I am speaking of cases brought to my personal knowledge&#x2014;of virtually closing a large number of avenues to the Coloured people for obtaining employment in competition with the White man. Coloured leaders claim, and I support it, that it is morally wrong to protect the inefficient White worker and creating what is really a monopoly of employment for him at the expense of the Coloured worker, who in many instances has an equal or better education and is more skilled than the White person receiving this protection. Sir, I repeat that this policy of job reservation is of paramount importance to the Coloured people. The Minister will appreciate the absolute despair facing young people who have reached school-leaving age and who of necessity have to embark on some form of trade or occupation to supplement the meagre earnings of their family. What opportunities exist for these young Coloured men? They are very few indeed. Can one imagine anything more frustrating to a young boy, who having passed Std. VII, or even some higher standard, is told that the Government will not allow him to follow a trade or occupation of his own choosing? Can one imagine anything more likely to build up in that young mind a bitterness and a resentment which he can never get rid of? What hope can there be of establishing good relations between that young boy, who may one day be a leader of his people, and the White citizens of the country? I say with absolute authority, from personal knowledge that I have of the Coloured people, that this policy of job reservation is creating the greatest resentment on the part of the Coloureds. It has the effect of depriving many of them of employment in trades which were traditionally theirs for generations and for which they are only suitable.</p>

<p>But this criticism is not only voiced by Coloured people&#x2019;s organizations. There are many White leaders of trade and industry in South Africa who support the criticisms levelled against the Government in respect of job reservation. White leaders of industry also feel strongly on the subject. Their sense of justice compels them to protest time and again against job reservation. These White people also claim that there is no justification on moral or economic grounds for such a policy. I should like to refer the Minister to a speech made two days ago by the president of the Cape Chamber of Industries at a luncheon given by the Canadian and South African Business Men&#x2019;s Club in Cape Town, in which he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Cape Chamber of Industries regarded job reservation as having no justification on any moral or economic grounds.</block>

<p>He went on to say that as far as job reservation in the western Cape was concerned, it was a purely political innovation with no justification. I entirely support that point of view. I say that job reservation in the western Cape as applied to the Coloureds cannot be defended on any moral grounds, and it is purely for <span class="col_7085_7086" refersTo="page_0875"/>political reasons that this policy was adopted by the Government. The President then went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We need the hands and the Westernized minds of the Cape Coloured community as far as their very considerable skills and ability can lead them. My Chamber has recently pleaded with the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Coloured Affairs for a revision of the policy in relation to job reservation affecting the Coloureds in the western Cape. I submit that the Government could well demonstrate its adaptability and strength not only to us but to the outside world by proclaiming a new deal for the Coloureds in respect of their spheres of work. If there is any thought that job reservation is necessary to protect the Coloureds against the Bantu influx, it would appear to be demonstrated that with influx control and the Government&#x2019;s policy for removing the Bantu from this area, any need for protecting the Coloured population has disappeared. We believe that any artificial barrier preventing the Coloured people from assuming occupations commensurate with their ability is entirely unwarranted. We believe that in the western Cape the rate for the job should apply, irrespective of race or colour.</block>

<p>I would like to say immediately that I am dealing now with the Coloured people who are citizens of this country and whose case has been pleaded by us from these benches session after session during the lifetime of this Government. I want to say that my colleague and I associate ourselves wholeheartedly with the views expressed by the president of the Cape Chamber of Industries. I feel most strongly that there is no moral justification whatsoever for this political innovation of job reservation, and I would appeal to the hon. the Minister to review this policy. He can do so with a great deal of credit upon himself and a great deal of credit upon the Government. I appeal to him to review this policy. I say that the upliftment of this obnoxious job reservation determination would not only be well received by our Coloured citizens but would win for us a tremendous amount of goodwill in the outside world, and nobody knows better than the hon. the Minister himself how much we in this country need the goodwill of the outside world. I agree entirely with the president of the Chamber of Industries when he claimed that the granting of a new deal to our Coloured people in respect of their working scope would relieve our country of a great amount of adverse criticism which we are receiving from the outside world. After all, all we are asking the hon. the Minister is to give to these Coloured citizens, who are South Africans in every sense of the word, the same level of protection that we are giving to the White citizens of this country. There seems to be no reason at all on any moral grounds why there should be a differentiation against the Coloured people as compared with the Whites. I say it is morally wrong to give this protection to the White people with a total disregard of the rights and privileges of the Coloured people who have been brought up in these industries and who have been traditionally employed in them for generations in the Cape. Sir, this appeal for the upliftment of the job reservation policy has also come by means of an unanimous resolution from the body known as the Council for Coloured Affairs. The Government have on many occasions indicated in this House that the Council for Coloured Affairs is the only real body of Coloured opinion from whom they take any advice and whose opinions they respect. I would remind the hon. the Minister that a unanimous resolution was passed a short while ago by this Council for Coloured Affairs, pleading with the Government to dispense with the policy of job reservation and race classification in industry and trade. Sir, I repeat that this body is the one official body that is recognized by the Government in its approach to Coloured Affairs, and I suggest that the hon. the Minister might very well attach some weight to the views expressed by this body.</p>

<p>Having dealt in general terms with this obnoxious policy of job reservation, I want to deal specifically with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s latest determination with regard to the building industry in the Western Province. Those of us who take any interest at all in Coloured Affairs in this area were shocked to hear that the hon. the Minister, by a determination dated the 9th November, 1962, had introduced job reservation in the building industry in the Cape area. I want to refer particularly to the portion of the determination which deals with the Cape, Wynberg, Simonstown, Bellville, Paarl, Wellington, Stellenbosch, Somerset West and Worcester in relation to the building trade. The hon. the Minister&#x2019;s determination laid down that work normally performed by skilled artisans in stone masonry, marble masonry, joinery in workshops, wood-machining in workshops, electrical wiring, letter cutting and stone decorating, etc., will now be reserved for White persons, and that no person who is not a White person shall perform such work, provided that those already employed in those industries in the areas mentioned shall not be affected. Sir, this has had a most serious effect not only upon the Coloured people of this province but also among the White leaders of industry in this province. I think it is necessary for me to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to a portion of the evidence which was given before the Tribunal in relation to the state of affairs in the building industry before this determination was made. I would remind the hon. the Minister, in the words of one of the witnesses who gave evidence before this Tribunal, &#x201C;that since 1922 peace had reigned in the industry. This was due to the spirit of cooperation between the races at all levels. All problems had been discussed and settled on the basis of what would be the best for the <span class="col_7087_7088" refersTo="page_0876"/>industry and its employees. No racial conflict had ever entered into the picture Sir, this statement, in a concise form, was made by the leader of the building industry who spoke on behalf of the employers&#x2019; section when giving evidence before the Tribunal. He said that since 1922 peace had reigned in the industry; that there had been no racial disputes between employers and employees and between employees and employees on racial grounds and that everything was settled on the basis of what was best for the industry and its employees. Then we find that suddenly the Minister sets up this Tribunal. In replying to a question which was put to him by my colleague, the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett), who asked him at whose request the Industrial Tribunal was set up to inquire into job reservation in the building industry, the hon. the Minister replied that if it was in respect of the Western Cape that the information was sought, the request came from the S.A. Operative Masons Society who specifically asked for work reservation in the Western Cape and from the S.A. Electrical Workers Association who had asked for protection for the Whites in the Cape. Sir, it might have been justifiable for the hon. the Minister to have inquired into the scope of work affecting these two organizations who asked for the setting up of this Tribunal, but I suggest to the hon. the Minister quite seriously that there was no general request on the part of the building industry for an investigation into the building industry as such, and in support of that contention I want to submit to the Minister some of the evidence that was given before that Tribunal by individuals who represent members of the council on the employers&#x2019; side as well as representatives of the employees. One of the members of the council representing the building industry, Mr. Posener, indicated to the Tribunal that he was speaking on behalf of the employers&#x2019; side of the Industrial Council; that he was speaking on behalf of the Master Builders Associations for the Cape Peninsula and the Boland but not on behalf of the Worcester Master Builders who would be presenting their own case. But generally speaking he spoke on behalf of these important bodies which I have just mentioned, the Master Builders Association for the Cape Peninsula and the Boland. He went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first question the employers asked themselves was whether there was any interacial competition as envisaged by the Tribunal&#x2019;s terms of reference.</block>

<p>It must be remembered that the Chairman of the Tribunal had indicated at the outset that the terms of reference of the Tribunal were to investigate whether as the result of interacial competition the White workers in the building industry in the Cape needed protection. This spokesman on behalf of the employers went on to say that they had tried to investigate this aspect as carefully as they could and they had come to the conclusion that there was no interacial competition whatsoever to justify any protection being given to any section. They went on to say that they had tried to establish where competition might exist between European and non-European workers, and then they asked this rhetorical question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Could it be monetary&#x2014;this was however discounted by the fact that a minimum wage was prescribed by the Council&#x2019;s agreement, irrespective of race or colour.</block>

<p>Therefore the monetary aspect did not arise. They then went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The criterion applied by employers was standard and output of work. The vast majority of employers were White and normally they would naturally prefer to engage employees of their own race and culture as there is usually in any circle an affinity to people of the same race and colour.</block>

<p>There again, Sir, there was no interacial competition, bearing in mind the fact that the vast majority of employers were White and that they would naturally lean towards employing White people&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, it had been found that White labour was not making itself available in sufficient quantities and the employers were using Coloured labour.</block>

<p>Sir, this was not due to any fault of the Coloured man; it was not due to any intrusion made by the Coloured man upon the White man&#x2019;s preserve&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There was, however, no victimization of White labour. Whenever it was available it was fully utilized.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize this aspect. This spokesman of the employers&#x2019; organization said that whenever White labour was available it was fully utilized&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Statistics show that there is a displacement of Whites in the industry by Coloureds and he proposed examining this position in order to establish the reason for this.</block>

<p>Mr. Posener quoted population figures which showed that the rate of increase in population in the Coloured group in the Peninsula between 1946 and 1960 was 2&#x00BD; times as great as the rate of increase in the Whites. Therefore it was obvious that more Coloured employees were becoming available than Whites. There had been a boom and great expansion in the industry in the post-war years and the White labour had not been available to fill the hundreds of vacancies. Coloured labour had been engaged in their stead. The only White artisans available had been those coming in from the platteland and it had been found that their standard of work and training had <span class="col_7089_7090" refersTo="page_0877"/>been far below that of the artisan trained in the Peninsula. However, all White labour which was available had been engaged.</p>

<p>The competition factor did exist, but not between races in the building industry, but between the building industry and outside employers such as the Public Works Department, local authorities, the South African Railways and Harbours, building societies, etc. These bodies recruited their building artisans in great numbers from the industry. They employ White artisans exclusively and this had been a major cause of the diminishing of the number of White artisans in the industry. It had not been possible to secure White labour to replace these artisans and the employers had turned to the Coloured labour force. This was not a case of displacement of White by Coloured, but the voluntary departure of White artisans.</p>

<p>[Laughter.] My hon. friend over there laughs. This evidence was given before the Tribunal by a spokesman of the Employers&#x2019; Organization, who went on to say that the employers in the industry were faced by a chronic shortage of White labour. They tried to keep the supervisory jobs in the hands of the Whites &#x2014;we all know that; the Coloured people know that and they accept that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They tried to keep the supervisory jobs in the hands of the Whites, but White labour was net forthcoming even if assured that it would in due course secure the supervisory and higher paid jobs&#x2026; The industry definitely could not get sufficient White employees to maintain its labour force. Again here there was no question of displacement but a lack of White labour becoming available.</block>

<p>Throughout the whole of the evidence of the Employers&#x2019; Organization it was strongly stressed that there was no question of White labour being displaced but rather that it was impossible to obtain White labour and that of necessity the industry was obliged to engage Coloured labour in this industry which has in fact been the prerogative of the Coloured man throughout generations. Mr. Posener went on to say that he could state unequivocally that no job dilution had taken place in the building industry in the Cape and that there had therefore been no interacial competition due to job dilution. He said that the Industrial Council made very sure that no dilution took place. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question of the scarcity of White labour in trades was not one which was peculiar to the Cape. Throughout the country and in all industries and trades difficulty was being experienced in obtaining sufficient White youths as apprentices.</block>

<p>As far as I am concerned I am confining my remarks here this afternoon to the position obtaining in the Cape. Let me quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Posener said that the employers had no intention of ousting the Coloured from the building industry. It was their intention to protect the White workers where necessary.</block>

<p>Sir, why the White worker should be protected and no protection should be afforded to the Coloured people is something which is beyond me, but even accepting that it was the fundamental job of this tribunal to protect the White worker I say that the decision which was taken by the tribunal was against the weight of evidence, against the volume of representations made to it not only by the employees but by the employers, the very people who engage White and non-White labour. Mr. Posener went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That a look to the future would show that job reservation would seriously hamper the industry. The industry was continually expanding and the trend was for fewer and fewer White youths to become available for employment in the industry. Should a restriction be placed on the number of employees which could be employed, the industry would be seriously hampered both in progress and economically.</block>

<p>With the closing of the doors to the Coloureds in the Transvaal and O.F.S., the Cape was one of the few places where the Coloured could attain artisan status, and he felt it would be most regrettable if their entry to the trade in this area should be restricted in any way. As it is, the building industry was one of the few industries which accepted Coloured youths as apprentices and the closing of this door would have a disastrous effect on a great number of Coloureds in the Cape.</p>

<p>May I say here that there was no evidence to the contrary, and despite this evidence and despite the substantial volume of representations made to it, the Tribunal, by a majority decision, decided to recommend the imposition of job reservation in favour of the White workers. Mr. Posener went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Tribunal insisted on introducing job reservation it must consider the consequences and at the same time offer a practical solution. Surely the function of job reservation was intended as a corrective measure and not a disruptive one as would be the case in the building industry in the Cape.</block>

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Posener said he would like to inform the Tribunal that the Master Builders Associations of Cape Town and the Boland were unanimously opposed to the enforcement of job reservation in any form in the building industry. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Should the Tribunal, however, feel constrained to introduce job reservation, his Association asked that it be done only in <span class="col_7091_7092" refersTo="page_0878"/>special cases where it would be practicable and not have a disruptive effect.</block>

<p>Sir, I cannot for the life of me see how in the face of this evidence&#x2014;and I have only given a very brief resum&#x00E9; of the large volume of evidence that was given before the Tribunal, how this Tribunal could come to the conclusion that it was necessary to take special steps to protect the White artisans against Coloured artisans. That recommendation was contained in the majority report of the Tribunal. I say that any fair-minded man receiving these representations and hearing the evidence which was led before the Tribunal, could only have come to one conclusion and that is that job reservation in the building industry was not justified in the light of the circumstances which obtained at the time. I want to remind you, Sir, that peace had reigned in this industry since 1922; there existed a spirit of co-operation between the races at all levels; all problems of any kind had been discussed and settled on the basis of what would be best in the interests of the industry and in the interests of the employees. There had never been any racial conflict, and despite this evidence we find that the Tribunal recommended to the hon. the Minister the imposition of job reservation in the building industry. Then we have the evidence of Mr. Briggs who is also one of the leaders in the industry and who supported his colleague whose evidence I quoted a moment ago. Let me quote what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Briggs said that it was generally the pattern in the industry that the jobs requiring the higher class of work and offering better working conditions and security went to the White employees. Those in joinery shops worked under cover and were less subject to breaks in continuity of employment. The employers hesitated to upset the balance in their shops. They did not wish to lose their normal workmen and it was becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to obtain suitable White employees in replacement. Speaking on job reservation generally, he asked that the Tribunal approached the question without emotion. They should consider whether job reservation would be for the welfare of the state, which included all its citizens.</block>

<p>I want to pause here for a moment and say that my colleagues and I support entirely the views expressed by Mr. Briggs before this Tribunal when he said that if job reservation had to be embarked upon as a policy, then it must be viewed in the light of what is good for the welfare of the State and for the welfare of all its citizens. Sir, the Coloureds are part and parcel of the citizens of South Africa and I suggest that they are also entitled to protection. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The Coloured Affairs Vote still has to be dealt with and I do not think it is relevant here to explain in general terms what the Government has already done and is doing for the Coloureds. In recent times it has become very clear that the Coloured representatives and the United Party are bidding against the Progressives as regards the Coloureds. It seems to me the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) has stampeded them completely. Nobody in South Africa has the right to come along with higher bids as far as the non-Whites are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member states that the Coloureds are concerned about their future as a result of job reservation. I think the Coloureds are the very people who have no reason to be concerned about their future in consequence of job reservation. Then the hon. member says there is immense dissatisfaction among the Coloureds, a statement which is just as sweeping as that made a while ago by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) whose allegations were effectively refuted by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) by reference to the Industrial Report. Why should the Coloured people be dissatisfied when the Whites are protected by job reservation? When we analyse the facts we find that we are faced with the position, particularly here in the western Cape and indeed in the whole of the Cape Province, that the Coloured population is much bigger than the White population. We have the further fact that the Coloureds have ousted the Whites from a number of industries and are squeezing them out completely. Why should those people be dissatisfied when the White man protects himself? I disagree with the hon. member. I think the Coloureds too have reason to be thankful to the Government for the introduction of job reservation. I should like to mention to the hon. member a few industries in which the Coloureds have been ousted completely by the Bantu. The Coloureds have been squeezed out of a number of industries in the western Cape. Mr. Chairman, last week, under the Bantu Administration and Development Vote, the question of the removal of the Bantu from the western Cape was raised. The United Party opposed it. They moved an amendment&#x2014;and there was a division on it&#x2014;that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s salary be reduced, because, among other things, he wishes to remove the Bantu from the western Cape. Where were the Coloured Representatives then? Why did they not on that occasion raise their voices in this House in the interests of the Coloureds? They did not have the courage to come and vote; they stayed away. They were not concerned about the Coloureds then. Job reservation was never intended to protect the Whites only. Job reservation was designed to protect all racial groups, and I believe the Coloureds are just as grateful to this Government as the White man, because the Coloureds have been <span class="col_7093_7094" refersTo="page_0879"/>ousted by the Bantu here in the western Cape from a number of industries, and I should like to mention a few. The Coloureds have been ousted completely from the dairy industry, until the &#x2019;forties, the western Cape was supplied with milk by Coloured delivery boys, but they have been ousted from that industry by the Bantu. The Coloureds in this area have also been ousted from the hotel industry.</p>

<p>No, that is only what they are being told by the Coloured representatives. There are still many farms on which Coloureds are employed. There are dairies employing Coloureds as delivery boys. That is a story which the United Party is fabricating to support their argument that the Bantu should be permitted to remain here. Mr. Chairman, I say the Coloureds have been ousted from the hotel industry. And do you know what I find so strange? When you go to the borders of the Transkei and to certain parts of the Eastern Province, you find Coloured workers in numerous hotels. They say there that the Coloureds are better workers in the hotel industry than the Bantu, but here in the western Cape, as a result of United Party stories and stories by the Coloured representatives that the Coloureds are not good hotel employees, the Coloureds have been squeezed out of the hotel industry. But let us take the motor service stations. What is the position there? A few years ago they were all staffed by Coloureds. What do we find to-day? Only here and there do we find a Coloured attendant at motor service stations. Let me tell you, Sir, that I do not have my tank filled at motor service stations where there are Bantu attendants. I take petrol at those stations where Coloureds are employed. The Coloured person is equally good and equally reliable. Those are two of the most remunerative industries in the western Cape&#x2014;the hotel industry and service stations&#x2014;because the people there receive tips. They receive much more in the form of tips than in the form of wages, and this remunerative work is being done at the present time by the Bantu here in the western Cape. The hon. member for Peninsula tells us the Coloureds are dissatisfied because they are worried about their future. I say that that is nothing but an attempt to incite people against this Government. If ever there was a time when the Coloureds had cause to be satisfied&#x2014;I concede that one is never satisfied but sometimes one does have cause to be grateful&#x2014;then the Coloureds at the present time have cause to be grateful to this Government who has opened doors to them which were never open to them before. As the hon. member for Peninsula knows, there are numerous posts in the Department of Coloured Affairs which are occupied by Coloureds.</p>

<p>I want to limit my remarks to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. Last year the hon. the Minister said that the Unemployment Insurance Fund was not intended to provide assistance to the chronically sick or the aged; he said that such people could be assisted from other sources such as the Department of Social Welfare. If these people are chronically ill or disabled and cannot work I have no quarrel with the Minister in that regard. But where I join issue with him is in regard to those men who are not chronically ill or disabled and are able to work. There are many men in my area who have been pensioned off from the mines (the mines pension scheme is still young and does not offer complete security to older men who have had to retire either because they were too old or because they had contracted pneumoconiosis in the early stages) and find it difficult to get other jobs. The mines have always been first-class employers and have given these men surface jobs but these jobs are, of course, limited in number. Most of these men, when they left the mines, were absorbed in the engineering shops on the East Rand but they were quite naturally the first ones to be put off when business was slack. I maintain that it is at such a stage that the Minister and his Department should step in and endeavour to help. That is what the Unemployment Benefit Fund is there for but what do we find? The amendments effected to the Unemployment Insurance Act last year to all intents and purposes took away this source of assistance to these men; it took it away to a large degree in any case, and they have certainly brought about a great deal of distress and unhappiness. When I refer to older men they are really men who are still in the prime of life. They get no help from any other sources. They do not fall within the purview of the Social Health Department either because they have a pension or because they have saved their money and bought themselves a house and are now subjected to the means test. I am not criticizing that but these men are still able to work and I maintain that if they are able to work they are the responsibility of the Department of Labour.</p>

<p>I want to examine how this Minister treats these men, men who have been good citizens, men who want work and who do not want charity. Some months ago a petition was sent from my area signed by 30 men who live between Benoni and Springs protesting against the proposed amendments to the Unemployment Insurance Act last year. They have handed me a copy of the reply which they got which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The hon. the Minister of Labour has your letter of 1 November 1962 concerning <span class="col_7095_7096" refersTo="page_0880"/>the Unemployment Insurance Amendment Act, the contents of which have been noted.</block>

<p>That was that. It may be because of the fact that every name on that list was English that the Minister did not attend to their problem. What did the Minister do about this particular class of men? In reply to a question put by the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) concerning the Unemployment Insurance Act he referred to people who were out of the labour market. I want the Minister to tell us whether or not he considers (a) men who are regarded too old to be employed in clerical positions or because they do not qualify for pensions schemes and (b) all men who are a bit older than those, but are still fully capable of being employed, to be his responsibility. If they are not his responsibility and if they are not the responsibility of the Department of Social Welfare I should like to know whose responsibility they are? I appreciate the fact that things are not as bad as they were some months ago but employment is always on the up-grade or on the down-grade and when it is on the down-grade the older men are the first to have their employment terminated. If the Minister is going to tell me that such a man should not and does not fall under the purview of his Department, I will see to it that those people know what his views are. As the mines close down in my area, and this is also the Minister&#x2019;s area, this problem is going to get worse and worse. We are going to find more men being put off by the mines at an age where it is not easy for them to find another job although they are still fully capable of working and the Minister should tell us whether or not he considers them his responsibility. If he does not consider them his responsibility we shall have to consider what pressure we can exert on the Government as an Opposition to do something in regard to this problem.</p>

<p>I should like to remind the Minister that these are men who know him personally, men who probably worked for him before he changed his political colours. I want now to refer to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. According to the Auditor-General&#x2019;s report the Unemployment Insurance Fund has been getting into serious difficulties. The last time there was an excess was in 1956 and it amounted to &#x00A3;988,000. This turned into a deficit of R9,800,000 in 1961. In 1961-2 the total benefits paid was &#x00A3;16,000,000 as opposed to 1956 when it was &#x00A3;5,000,000, which is a tremendous increase. A large portion of the deficit between costs plus payments out and receipts is of course made up by interest on invested capital which amounts at present to R125,000,000. The overall deficit for 1961 was R5,782,000 after crediting the interest, whereas the actual deficit of payments over contributions was R9,800,000. I accept that there should have been a tightening up in some form or other but I think the Minister will have to rethink. I am not advocating any legislation or anything like that but I think the time has arrived that the contributions from employers and employees should be increased. Seeing that the Government has consistently ignored our demand for a contributory pension scheme we are going to have this trouble with us to a greater and greater extent. If you will not give the country a contributory pension scheme you will have to reorganize this Unemployment Benefit Fund and you will have to arrange for help in between jobs for these older people who can work, and for whom jobs are not there at the moment. I maintain that the policy of this Minister and this Government is simply one of <i>laisser-faire;</i> why worry about these old chaps. I think the Minister will have to get off his back-seat and do something about them in future.</p>

<p>As a representative of a workers&#x2019; constituency I want to convey my sincere appreciation to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) and the United Party for their contribution to this debate because they have once again undoubtedly showed themselves to be the greatest enemies of the White workers in South Africa. The position is that we have almost full-scale employment as far as White labour is concerned. There is hardly any unemployment in South Africa. Had the United Party been in power with their policy of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;, you would not only have had large-scale unemployment amongst the Whites but those Whites who were in employment would have had to work at lower wages. The hon. member for Yeoville expressed his concern about that difficult group of unemployed, namely, the 45-year age group and over. I share that concern with him because the major part of my work in Vereeniging consists of trying to assist those people to find employment. The only difference between us is that my concern for them is genuine concern whereas his concern is assumed.</p>

<p>I shall prove it. If there is one class of worker who is vulnerable under this policy of the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; it is the man of 45 years of age and over. If you were to apply a policy of &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D; you would not only be making the man of 45 years and over vulnerable but you would make it simply impossible for that man to find employment; you would be throwing him on to the State. This problem of the 45-year-olds is a real problem and the Government and the various Departments have done everything they could to employ those people. Our problem is to persuade the industrialists to employ these people. That was why I asked the hon. member for Yeoville what he suggested we should do to persuade industrialists to employ these people. In the first place we must remember, Sir, that if a man of 45 years is out of work there must be a reason for it. Normally you do not dismiss a man of 45 years, because he has been in your service for a long time, he has the necessary experience and you know that he is a faithful person <span class="col_7097_7098" refersTo="page_0881"/>with responsibilities. You are, therefore, faced with this problem that you know the man of 45 years who is unemployed is a person who has not given the service which was expected of him. In the second place the industrialists are in this difficulty that they are faced with strong competition. They are not anxious to employ these people because they get better service from the younger people. That is also the problem as far as people of 60 years and over are concerned. I have negotiated with many industrialists in Vereeniging and they have assured me that it did not pay them to employ those people because their production was not up to the production of the younger person. As I have already said the State has done everything in its power to employ those people. What we have to do to-day is to persuade industrialists to employ more of those people. I want to suggest that job reservation should be applied on a larger scale. As has been brilliantly illustrated by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East), if you were to apply the policy of the rate for the job you would be throwing numerous White workers on the open market in competition with the Bantu worker.</p>

<p>I shall try to put it so clearly that the hon. member for Turffontein will understand it, although I do not guarantee that I shall succeed. Who will determine that rate? It will be either the Government or the Wage Board. And they will have to lay down a rate which is lower than the wages people receive to-day. They will have to lay down the minimum rate. Our difficulty to-day is not unemployment but a shortage of labour. As a result of this high rate of employment employers pay much higher rates than they would otherwise have paid. Let us take the position of a fitter and turner. He earns approximately &#x00A3;15 per week to-day, if not more. You will be placing a weapon in the hand of the employer if you applied the principle of the rate for the job by placing him in a position where he can say to that fitter and turner: &#x201C;If you are not prepared to work for &#x00A3;12 10s. I shall engage a Bantu in your place at &#x00A3;10.&#x201D; What is there to prevent the employer from doing that? The Bantu is so pleased with that wage that he will say he is willing to work ten hours per day instead of eight. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) says that they can be reported but who will report them? Will the employer? Will the Bantu? He has a better job than he has ever had in his life. You are thereby destroying the whole idea of negotiation between employer and employee. The difficulty is this that all employers will have to do what the unscrupulous employer does because they are in competition. You are therefore placing a sword in the hands of the employers which they can keep over the heads of the employees. If you were to apply the rate for the job principle in respect of such jobs as lorry drivers which do not call for a high degree of skill you will be throwing hundreds of Whites on the streets and there are thousands of cases in the country where Whites drive lorries. That is why I should like to plead with the Minister for job reservation on a larger scale. I may tell the hon. member for Yeoville this that we in Vereeniging should like to see job reservation in respect of lorry drivers of 5-ton lorries and over. We should also like to see the operation of cranes to be reserved for Whites. If you were to apply the principle of the rate for the job all the jobs, such as crane operators, lorry drivers and any other work which does not require the same amount of skill as in the case of a fitter and turner, will fall into the hands of the Bantu.

<p>Must I accept that the hon. member for Vereeniging is not interested in unemployment as long as it does not concern the Whites? Of course, the hon. member deludes himself like so many hon. members opposite do when they say that there is no unemployment in this country because they only look at the figure of registered unemployed persons which the Department publishes. Of course the figure of registered unemployment is just what it says; that figure only refers to the number of unemployed people who go to the labour bureau to register. It is a fact, as was again revealed recently by the census, that the number of registered unemployed is a fraction of the total number of unemployed. During the 1960 census they also took a census of the unemployed and if you compare that figure with the number of registered unemployed as given by the Department of Labour what do we find? We find, for instance, that as far as Whites were concerned the number of registered unemployed in September 1960 were 13,000. When we look at the census figures for the same month we find that the number was 41,000. So the unemployment figure in respect of the Whites was nearly three times as high as indicated by the figure of registered unemployed. If we look at the figure for Asians and Coloureds, who are given together in the figure of registered unemployed, we find that they give the figure as 13,800 whereas the census figure for the same month was 116,000&#x2014;nearly eight times as high. If we look at the figure in respect of Africans we find that the registered <span class="col_7099_7100" refersTo="page_0882"/>number of unemployed for that month was 33,000 whereas the census figure was 334,000 &#x2014;seven times as high. Altogether the total number of unemployed was very nearly 500,000 for that period whereas the figure of registered unemployed was only a fraction of that. That shows you, Sir, how hon. members opposite can delude themselves about the unemployment position in this country. I hope the hon. the Minister will look into this and see if he cannot find a more reliable index of unemployment in this country so that the Government cannot keep on deluding themselves. They delude themselves easily enough and if the statistical information is not accurate the chances of their deluding themselves become so much greater. I remember the hon. the Minister of Labour comparing our unemployment figure with the American figure of unemployment and saying that whereas our unemployment figure was only 1&#x00BD; per cent to 2 per cent it was 5 per cent to 6 per cent in America. But the American figures are census figures. They take a sample census every month over the total population and if the Minister were to do the same here the Government may realize what a dangerous position is developing in South Africa. When we look at the census figures for 1960 we find that far from our having one of the lowest unemployment figure in the world&#x2014;I am talking about Western countries; I am not talking about under-developed countries&#x2014;we find that our unemployment figure in respect of White was 3.6 per cent; the Coloured unemployment figure was 16 per cent; the Indian unemployment figure was 20 per cent and Bantu unemployment was 8&#x00BD; per cent. The alarming thing is the fact that unemployment seems to be growing. It seems to have grown considerably between 1951 and 1960. Apparently the country is not generating enough jobs for the rapidly increasing population. We find, for instance, that in 1951 the unemployment figure for Whites, according to the census for that year, was 28,000 and in 1961 it was 41,000. The unemployment figure for Coloureds in 1951 was 41,800 and nearly 90,000 in 1960. We find the same tendency in respect of the Asiatic figure, which nearly doubled itself from 14,000 to 27,000. The Bantu figure nearly trebled from 118,000 to 334,000. I suggest that that shows a dangerous trend is developing in this country. This makes the remark of the previous speaker that there would have been greater unemployment under a United Party Government look rather silly, because the fact of the matter is that our economy is apparently not generating enough jobs for unskilled workers. While we have a great deal of unemployment as far as unskilled labour is concerned, everybody will agree that as far as skilled labour is concerned, we are really faced with a shortage. I can do no better than quote from the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement issued after his meeting with his Economic Advisory Council on 21 August 1962 where he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the rate of development reaches a high level again, as we all desire, a shortage of capital may develop again, but the concensus is that a shortage of managerial talent, skilled labour, scientists and technical know-how in general will seriously hamper economic development before this stage is reached. It is, therefore, desirable that both the Government and private enterprise should constantly endeavour to solve these vital problems.</block>

<p>The problem to-day is skilled labour, technological labour. Just recently at a conference in Johannesburg of the Southern Transvaal Regional Development Association Dr. D. G. Gouws, of the C.S.I.R. is reported in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> as having said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is in a state of emergency because of manpower shortages in several key groups&#x2014;artisans, managers, scientists and technologists.</block>

<p>He then went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Because economic progress demanded a &#x201C;disproportionate number&#x201D; of high-level personnel, shortages could be expected to increase in the future.</block>

<p>That is the position, Mr. Chairman. Surely the Government should have a policy in view of the fact that it sees what is happening in the country, namely that the figures of the unskilled workers are increasing far more rapidly than the figures of the skilled. That of course is partly due to the mistakes made in the past. If they had not killed the immigration policy of the United Party in 1948, we would not have been in this serious position. We are thankful that after 14 years they have come to realize how wise the United Party policy was. In how far the fact that the hon. Minister of Labour was a member of the United Party has anything to do with that change in policy, I do not know, but if he used his influence we are thankful. The more he can get his side to adopt our policies, the more grateful we will be for the sake of South Africa. The hon. Minister is now trying to increase the number of immigrants to this country. It is no use crying over spilt milk. We must give him credit for that, but we can only express the hope that he will push the immigration policy more energetically than he has done in the past. But that is only the one side of the equation. Surely the other part of the equation is that we should have no limitations on the skills of our non-Europeans. Leaving aside for a moment the Bantu who according to the queer logic of the apostles of apartheid are not part of South Africa, although we all know that in fact they are, even hon. members on the other side admit that the Indians and the Coloureds are an inherent part of South Africa, of so-called White South Africa. They have as much right to live here as the White people. Hon. members <span class="col_7101_7102" refersTo="page_0883"/>opposite have admitted that. The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) and the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), and other hon. members have posed the question; On what moral and economic grounds can you justify job reservation in respect of the Coloured and Indian populations. Not a single member has answered that question. We have had the preposterous answer that job reservation is protecting the Coloureds against the Natives in the Western Province. But at the same time they tell us that they are removing the Natives from the Western Province. Why do they need protection then? And they cannot cite one instance where job reservation has benefited the Coloured people, not one instance where they can show that job reservation has been applied to safeguard the Coloureds against the competition of Bantu labour [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether it is not possible for him and his Department to create more employment for the physically disabled and handicapped persons. We have sheltered employment to-day and we are grateful to the hon. the Minister and his Department for what they are already doing in this connection. There are already 14 factories in the country which offer sheltered employment and which are conducted on a non-profit making basis where the State carries the losses. There is a farm in the Transvaal were 100 of these handicapped people are employed. The State is doing more than is generally realized. The State has brought this group of workers under the protection of the Unemployment Insurance Act and by doing so has accorded them stability. The State also spends approximately R6,000,000 annually in subsidizing the wages paid by private undertakings, municipalities and other bodies who employ these people. I want to ask, however, whether more sheltered employment facilities cannot be created for these people, whether more people cannot be employed on the wage-subsidized basis by private organizations and private undertakings duly encouraged thereto by the Department. At the end of 1962 1,990 handicapped people were in sheltered employment namely 1,351 White males, 194 White females, 408 Coloured males, nine Asiatic males and 29 Bantu ex-servicemen. Everyone of them should at least be capable of a 50 per cent labour production. There is a great demand for this type of employment on the part of handicapped people. We have the problem in the western Cape that this work which would normally have been done by such handicapped people are eagerly snapped up by non-White labour. There is one such sheltered employment factory at Ndabeni where 256 of these people are employed and there is a further factory at Epping which employs approximately 150 Coloureds. But in Cape Town there is already a waiting list of 70 approved Whites and 80 approved Coloured applicants. They are people who have been found suitable for that type of labour by the selection committee but they have to wait for an opportunity and their chances of being placed are very slender. The local committee who has to select the type of applicant here in Cape Town have to deal with an average of 26 White applicants and an average of 43 Coloured applicants every month. That shows you, Sir, what demand there is for that type of work in Cape Town. I recently read in the &#x201C;Digest of South Africa&#x201D; that it was estimated that in Durban alone there were 5,000 White handicapped persons, people who could not compete in the open labour market.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the products of these sheltered employment factories are mostly all purchased by Government Departments, such as uniforms for the Permanent Force and the police, various office requisites, etc., and the State Departments are encouraged to purchase from these sheltered employment factories. I do, however, want to ask whether the Minister and his Department cannot bring in more private undertakings under this system of sheltered employment. Can the Department of Labour not have centres where physically disabled people, even those with a productive capacity of less than 50 per cent, can be tested by trained employment officials as regards their dexterity, skill and aptitude and where they can be advised as to the direction in which they should try to get employment, or from where they can be placed in places where they can receive elementary training that will enable them to do that type of work, or from where they can be placed with local authorities or local undertakings which can make use of their services? It is better to assist these people to make an honest living than to keep them and their dependants alive by means of State allowances. Apart from rehabilitating these people and the upliftment work which will be performed by making those people regain their self-respect because of the work they are doing, the State will save thousands of pounds annually which it would otherwise have had to pay out in the form of special disability grants to those people who can now perform useful work. Over and above that those people can also make a very important contribution to the labour market. In this country with its unlimited source of cheap labour we are recklessly neglecting this very important labour potential. The Opposition asked in a previous debate where the workers have to come from to replace the Bantu in this area? If we give these people, who cannot compete in the open market, people who are physically disabled but who can still do constructive work, an opportunity and if we give other pensioners who leave their employment at a comparatively early age but who are still capable of doing a day&#x2019;s work an opportunity, we shall be able to manage with far fewer Bantu here.</p>

<p>What can be done by these people was recently proved in Durban where a society which particularly looks after the interests of <span class="col_7103_7104" refersTo="page_0884"/>this group of people and which has 60 of these physically disabled people in its employ, has gained a contract to erect a building of over R100,000. All the work to that building, from the foundation to the roof, is being done by these handicapped people; they were formerly unemployed and they have now obtained that work. They are doing excellent work and nobody can pass any remarks on it. That shows you, Sir, what productive labour these people can still perform. That is an example which can well be emulated and such undertakings should be supported by the State. For the rest we have the work which is done by the Cripple Care Association. They give people elementary training in certain directions and they then place them in employment. This should also be supported by the State. But apart from what the State does I want to ask that more should be done to bring in private undertakings under this sheltered employment scheme. There should be more factories to utilize these people; I think that in the western Cape particularly there is not sufficient opportunity for this type of disabled worker. I hope the hon. the Minister will give his serious attention to this matter.</p>

<p>If I still have a minute or so at my disposal, I should like to reply to what the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) and the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) have said in connection with job reservation and how it affects the Coloureds. Mr. Chairman, this question of job reservation as far as the Coloured workers in the western Cape are concerned, is being exaggerated out of all proportion by the Opposition and the Coloured representatives. I can tell you, Sir, that it has become extremely essential to have job reservation in certain jobs because the chances of the Whites to find employment in certain jobs which they have done hitherto are becoming less and less because they are being replaced by Coloured.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>From what we have heard here this afternoon, it is quite obvious that our big problem in South Africa to-day is the shortage of manpower which is skilled and the failure of this Government to do something to repair this shortage. Our problem is not the replacement of the one racial group by another to do the same job. Our problem is to find the best material amongst our working people to do the particular job. Mr. Chairman, as long as we encourage the people of South Africa, whether they be White, Coloured or Black, to buy the products that are manufactured by the skilled White man, so long will we have this shortage of skilled manpower. We have plenty of people here to carry the boxes containing the products made by the skilled workers, but as long as we debar one race group from helping to manufacture the product which is made by the skilled individual, so long will you have this shortage of manpower which we so badly need in our country. How are we going to overcome this? Because it is not only in the trades and industry that we are having this shortage. You get it in the professions as well. Right through trade and industry that require skilled labour, we find advertisements asking for the skilled people to come forward. There are more and more people leaving our country to-day who are skilled in particular work, and others are not coming in to replace them. The doors are open to these people right through the world, and we in South Africa are losing skilled people. Very few of the skilled are coming back, and very few of the limited number of immigrants are skilled in the particular types of work that we want to be done. Job reservation cannot solve this problem. All we do is to replace one group by another group, but it does not give us more workers of a particular kind that we require. It is no assurance against unemployment either for the Black man or the Coloured man, and certainly not for the Black man. It cannot be. So it means virtually that from our small reservoir of people that we have got, we have to use the people to the best advantage. That brings us to the problem of conserving our manpower and immediately I say that no longer in South Africa at any rate, can a person be judged by the number of birthdays he has had. A person should only be retired if he wants to be retired, or if it is found that he is unable to do his job properly. It is a pity to find so many people who are 60 or 65 who have stopped working because we have a rule that they must retire at that age in certain industries, in certain commercial houses and in the Government service.</p>

<p>That is the one end, the people who are at the retiring age. But what about the other end where we have a shortage of apprentices joining the trades and joining industry? What are we going to do to encourage youngsters to become apprentices. I said on an earlier occasion that we have got to break down the prejudice in South Africa of looking down upon the boy who wants to join a trade. On the one hand we should encourage children as far as possible to pass matric, so that they can enter the scientific and skilled field, but that does not mean to say that because a boy has passed his matric he should not enter a trade. In my opinion the higher his education, the quicker he will reach the top in his trade and the quicker he may become an executive. He may start off as a fitter and turner, which is at the bottom of the rung, but the higher his education the quicker he will be able to get to the top, in the same factory perhaps where he started I say that these boys must be encouraged to get as much education as they possibly can at school, but they should not be afraid then to enter industry or a trade. The basis of our trouble to-day is the shortage of White people in our country because the White person is carrying the burden of the Whites, the Coloureds and the Bantu and the Indians because of the policy of the Government which refuses to break down barriers, and as long as we have those barriers, as long as we talk of job reservation and the protection of the White man&#x2019;s job, so long will we have these shortages. In all sincerity I say that it is up to the White man in this country to take up the challenge and to show that he is a better man than any of the other Coloured races here, and if he cannot do that, he will fall by the wayside.</p>

<p>I want to deal with this once and for all, this question of job reservation in the mines. Job reservation was introduced in the mines and it has become a custom since the early 1920s.

<p>If that is the example of job reservation that this Government want to follow, there is no reason whatsoever for job reservation and the sooner we return to the rate for the job, the better for all of us. That is the solution. Give them the rate for their job and they will do the job.</p>

<p>I want to come back to what the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) has said about the disabled people. I want the hon.

These people should be employed as far as possible in temporary work. The disabled man should be placed in temporary work and the man who is still able to do a full day&#x2019;s job of work should be drafted into other types of work. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to dwell on the subject raised by the hon. member who has just sat down (Dr. Fisher) except to say that it struck me that the hon. member has justified job reservation in the case of the mines because according to him there are certain jobs which are too dangerous to entrust to other races. He stated, for example, that you could, therefore, not abolish job reservation in the mines because explosives were handled so frequently. It is quite clear that the whole argument of the hon. member collapses on the strength of his own remark. It is clear that he too wants job reservation because he and his party are not prepared to abolish job reservation in certain respects. I think I can leave the hon. member at that.</p>

<p>I want to bring another matter to the notice of the Minister in connection with the Workmen&#x2018;s Compensation Act of 1941 as far as farmers are concerned. We know farmers are obliged under the Act to insure their farm labourers who operate mechanically driven machinery or vehicles. But when you study the definition of &#x201C;vehicles&#x201D; and &#x201C;machinery&#x201D; you find that due to the mechanization that is taking place to-day there are few, if any, farm labourers who do not at some time or other and in some way or other come into contact with farm machinery and whom the farmer is not obliged to insure. In other words, it amounts to this that the farmer must insure every farm labourer of his if he wants to remain within the limits of the law. It was originally provided that a farmer could insure all his labourers in terms of an agreement with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner and that he could do so at half the ordinary tariff in operation at the time which then amounted to R1 per R100 wages. The result was that if a farmer wanted to insure all his labourers he could do so at 50c per R100 wages. That position obtained all these years until suddenly in 1961 when the farmers received their assessments they found that the premium of 50c per R100 wages had been increased to R1.50, in other words, an increase of 300 per cent. But there was further increase. Where the farmer previously had the privilege of insuring his labourers for a certain period only&#x2014;he could, for example, insure them for only six months if they only worked with machinery for six months in the year&#x2014;he found that that privilege had also been taken away from him. I take, as example, a farmer who has paid R3,000 in the form of wages. He could insure his labourers who came in <span class="col_7107_7108" refersTo="page_0886"/>contact or worked with machinery for only six months by paying a premium on R1,500 only. That was also abolished in 1961. In other words he now has to pay a premium on the full amount of R3,000. This means a 600 per cent increase in the insurance premium which the farmer has to pay under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. I do not think there is another increase to be compared with this. We often complain about the increase in the third party insurance premium but I think this is the worst there is. We all know this is a fund which is dependent on contributions only and that it has to carry itself. We are informed that there have been deficits since 1951 to 1960. Farmers have also been warned that if the tempo of accidents continued there would have to be an increase. A sword therefore hangs over the heads of the farmers that this high premium which they have to pay and which has already been increased by 600 per cent, may be increased still further. I have the official figures from the Department and according to the data 150,000 employers are registered with the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner but there were 200,000 accidents in one year. I am not quite sure which year it was but it maybe that the number was particularly high that year; I do not think that is the average. However, when you think of it that there are 200,000 accidents in one year you realize that the figure is alarming particularly bearing in mind the fact that in many cases the compensation paid to a workman who has been seriously injured, or where a person has perhaps lost his life, is exceedingly high. The point I want to make is this: I know that in many areas practically all the farmers are insured against accidents. They are compelled to insure but they seldom if ever make a claim. When you think of the terrific number of claims that are submitted the question arises whether there should not be some incentive in the form of a reduction in premium in respect of those people who are more careful and who practically never claim. Is it not possible to introduce a kind of &#x201C;no claim bonus&#x201D; system. I know the administrative costs of the scheme as it operates to-day are already high and that as a result of the change I have suggested the administrative costs may be increased further but I do think that if we encouraged people to take all the precautions they possibly can we would cause a considerable decrease in the number of accidents and claims.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I think I should at this stage answer certain questions. Before I do so, I think I should pay tribute to Mr. Hannah, the Secretary for Labour. This will be his last session, and as hon. members know, he has been in the Department of Labour all his working life, and he is now retiring in October. I should like to place on record the thanks of this Government and of the previous one for the services that have been rendered to this Department by him. [Hear, hear!] All I can say is that since I took over this portfolio he has been a great pillar of strength to me, and I shall miss his wise guidance. I think I express the sentiments of all hon. members when I say we wish him well and hope he will enjoy his leisure.</p>

<p>I want to deal with hon. members more or less in the order in which they spoke in the debate. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has raised the question of the Unemployment Insurance Fund. He wanted to know whether I had any information as to what the effect has been of the amendments which were passed last year. Sir, I have the report of the Unemployment Insurance Board with me, and with regard to the financial position of that fund this is what it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A substantial decrease in the amount paid in benefits took place during the latter part of the year.&#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the latter part of last year. I think the amendments came into force on 1 August last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but the expenditure over the whole year exceeded the income by R5,550,000. As a result, the amount invested with the Public Debt Commissioners on behalf of the fund fell from R120,702,000 at the end of 1961 to R114,606,000 on 1 December 1962.</block>

<p>In other words, there was a decrease of roughly R16,000,000&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is anticipated, however, that as the result of the amendments which have been made to the Act, there will be no appreciable fall in the reserves of the fund during the forthcoming year.</block>

<p>I should like to point out to hon. members that we have hardly had an opportunity yet of evaluating more or less accurately what the effects of those amendments are, but we will know more about it when we come to the end of the year for which they have been in operation.</p>

<p>The hon. member then dealt with Indian unemployment, amongst other things, and he expressed some concern at the increase in Indian unemployment. I think he made the point, which was later emphasized by the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) that the figures published from time to time concerning the unemployment of Indians, particularly in Durban, or rather in Natal, were not accurate. I think I should just pause to deal for a moment with this question of Indian unemployment which is of great interest to the Government, and is of particular interest to my colleague the Minister of Indian Affairs. This question of Indian unemployment has <span class="col_7109_7110" refersTo="page_0887"/>been raised here, and it was also raised in the Other Place when my policy motion was being debated there, and in this connection a number of hon. members made reference to the survey which was undertaken by the Institute for Social Research of the University of Natal. It was also reported in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 19 January this year, in an article dealing with this question, that there were 78,000 Indians who were hit through unemployment. Subsequently my Department got into touch with the editor of the <i>Mercury</i> and he informed my Department that the reporter who was responsible for this article merely multiplied the estimated number of unemployed, i.e. 15,000, by 5.2, which was the number of dependants of each work-seeker, and he then arrived at the figure of 78,000.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Now that is the basis on which this article was written. In so far as the survey of the Natal University is concerned, I think I should say something about that. There appears to be no real evidence for many of the findings of the Institute which, I think, are based largely on hearsay and on <i>ex parte</i> statements. They have apparently made no attempt to verify any of those statements. I think it is also significant that no mention is made in the report&#x2014;and may I say that the University sent me a complimentary copy of the report which I studied very closely&#x2014;of the Indians who are employed in the Pinetown and the New Germany areas, most of whom are living in Durban. The statement that the 15,000 estimated unemployed Indians are all actively seeking employment is very much doubted, as there are indeed very few people who will openly admit to not seeking work or wanting work. I think I should point out that the survey related to approximately one in 60 of the Durban Indian population and that it covered only 931 workers out of a total adult working force of over 56,000 Indian workers. I think this survey is an extremely small sample. I think we all know that it is also a fact that Indians are most reluctant to perform manual work and that they are more attracted to the commercial and distributive trades, and of course to the catering trade. According to the unemployment statistics maintained by my Department, over 2,000 Indians were registered as unemployed in Durban as at 30 April 1963. Of this number 2,338 were males, 341 were females, 29 were boys, and 19 were girls. It is also stated in this report that unemployment was most heavily concentrated among those trained in skilled, industrial occupations, namely 30 per cent, and among the unskilled labourers it was 32 per cent. This conclusion is not borne out by my Department&#x2019;s statistics for 1962. The skilled industries, of course, are the building, the engineering, motor, furniture, printing and leather trades. Unemployment in the building industry reached a peak during January 1962 whilst a certain amount of short time was worked by artisans in the furniture industry, and I think also in the leather industry. In the engineering industry the unemployment figures were extremely low, and in the printing and motor industries there was in fact no unemployment. The maximum number of unemployed skilled workers in these industries I have mentioned was never higher than 500 out of a total labour force of approximately 6,000, i.e. about 8.3 per cent. It appears, as I read the report, that the interviewers took it for granted that all the employees employed in these industries and whom they interviewed were skilled artisans. It is also mentioned in the report that only 47 per cent of the Indian working population had been in continuous employment for the period January 1959 to December 1961, and that the average duration of employment for the remaining 53 per cent was less than 12 out of 36 months. This finding, I think, confirms the view that the Indian worker is prone to changing his employment very frequently. My Department&#x2019;s records show that the number of Indians who had drawn, or who had applied for, unemployment benefits in Durban since 1949 to date is 67,000. This, I think, shows that approximately 67,000 Indian workers have at one time or other been in touch with my Department in connection with benefits over a period of 14 years.</p>

<p>Another conclusion reached is to the effect that the survey revealed widespread failure to use the Department of Labour as a means of obtaining employment. I think that is a fact. This finding, apart from not being based on facts, is of course completely misleading. My Department&#x2019;s records show that during the last ten years about 50,000 Indians registered for work in Durban, and that we were able to place 24,000. New registrations for work number approximately 2,500 a month. During 1961 the monthly average number of Indian unemployment insurance beneficiaries was 1,246, while the average number of registered unemployed work-seekers was 3,585; and during 1962 the Indian beneficiaries averaged 1,166 a month, while the average number of registered unemployed remained more or less the same as in 1961. In other words, according to our figures the position in 1962 was more or less the same as it was in 1961.</p>

<p>Apart from confirming the general theory that this report is based on very flimsy evidence, I think attention should also be drawn to the following incorrect statements contained in this report. In paragraph 31 it is stated that casual workers are excluded from the provisions of the Unemployment Fund. The majority of casual workers are in fact contributors to the fund. Only certain relatively unimportant categories are excluded, e.g. a casual worker employed for purposes other than the employer&#x2019;s business, and also persons employed for less than one working day per week. In paragraph 42 the view is expressed that the Unemployment Insurance Act is inadequate to meet the needs of the Indian community because <span class="col_7111_7112" refersTo="page_0888"/>it would seem that the Act limits the payment of benefits to 26 weeks in every year, and does not provide for the payment of a dole to persons who have never worked. It is also stated that provisions for assistance to those who are willing and able to work but cannot be offered work has become accepted policy in most industrial societies. Sir, I think I should point out that the Unemployment Insurance Act contains safeguards expressly provided for by the International Labour Convention, No. 44 of 1946, which are common to most systems of unemployment insurance; and from reports which I have from the International Labour Office it is clear that in most countries the payment of unemployment benefits is limited to persons who are in employment for reasonable periods.</p>

<p>To me it would appear that the sole object of the investigation by the University of Natal was to substantiate the claims that there are thousands of Indians unemployed in Durban. As far as I am concerned, the findings of the Institute are to me of very little value, as the investigation in the first instance covered far too small a sample of the Indian population, and secondly, little or nothing was done in the way of verification of the information furnished to the investigators. I think the fact should also be stressed that in the labour field Indians have proved themselves to be a group apart, particularly when it comes to separating non-working persons from unemployed workseekers. The investigators of the Institute do not seem to have appreciated this aspect of the matter or to have been correctly informed. However, I want to stress that the Government&#x2019;s concern for the welfare of the Indian community has, I think, been clearly demonstrated by the establishment of the Department of Indian Affairs, and as hon. members know, this Department has hardly had time to find its feet.</p>

<p>No, not at this stage. As far as my Department is concerned, I think all I can be expected to do is act on the registrations that we have in the various labour bureaux. It is up to the workseekers to assist us by coming to the bureaux to apply for work and to be registered there, because the bureaux are there for that purpose. But I would like to say, too, that I think it would be wrong to expect the Department of Indian Affairs to produce a ready-made solution for the problem of Indian unemployment. We all know that the Government&#x2019;s economic policy is so to order the affairs of the country as to ensure the maximum employment of all sections of the population. This of course does not mean that unemployment can be eliminated entirely, nor can any system be devised which will eliminate unemployment such as that which exists among the Indian population in Durban. It is true that the Unemployment Insurance Act provides temporary assistance for those who are temporarily unemployed, but it does not cater for those who have never had employment. It is assumed that there is a large number of unemployed Indians in Durban who fall into the latter category. That there are probably large numbers of Indians who have never worked and therefore cannot get any benefits.</p>

<p>I think I should add that one of the obvious steps in the direction of trying to solve the problem of unemployment amongst the Indians is to increase the educational facilities. In this connection I am thinking particularly of the expansion of technical college facilities and the encouragement of Indian children to remain at school until they have passed at least Std. 8. Of course, tied up with this matter is the question of compulsory education up to the age, say, of 16 years. This may not be a practical proposition at this stage, and in any case, it is a matter for the Provincial Administration of Natal, but I can assure hon. members that the Provincial Administration of Natal has been doing everything in its power for some years now to provide all the educational facilities possible for Indian children. I think that more or less covers the questions in regard to the unemployment amongst Indians, but I just want to emphasize that the Indians themselves would help my Department a great deal if they would register when they are unemployed. I think it must be obvious to hon. members that it is most difficult for my Department to assist them in any way whatever if in fact there are thousands of unemployed Indians who do not register as such.</p>

<p>Hon. members may be interested in a cutting which I have pinned to these notes and which I took from the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 10 February. The heading is: &#x201C;15,000 Indians Jobless. Where?&#x201D; It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is one Durban employer who cannot believe that there are 15,000 unemployed Indians in the city. He is manager of a sandwich service business and he says, &#x201C;I advertised for four Indians to sell sandwiches, either at a fixed wage or on commission. The average pay is from R10 to R12 a week. I pay 40c commission in every R2. The hours are not long, from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. It is not a hard job either, but I got no response to my advertisement.&#x201D;</block>

<p><span class="col_7113_7114" refersTo="page_0889"/>So, is unemployment as serious as hon. members say it is? The next question raised by the hon. member was that the statistics furnished by the Department of Labour from time to time are not informative enough; in other words, we do not state in those statistics what the ages are of people who register as unemployed. Well, in fact we do that. I have these statistics here. These statistics are in fact kept and a copy is issued by the Department of Labour every month. It shows not only the age groups, but also the various occupations, and if the hon. member is interested I can show him this. I am not going to weary the Committee by reading the statistics, but the statistics are issued under various headings, such as (1) Professional and semi-professional; (2) administrative and clerical; (3) commerce; (4) skilled artisans, and applications for apprenticeship, etc. It is then set out in the age groups, under 19 years, from 19 to 35 years, from 35 to 50 years, and 50 to 65, so that we do in fact keep a complete record of the age groups who are unemployed and who are able to see at a glance in respect of what age group unemployment is increasing or decreasing. If the hon. member would like to see this, I will show it to him.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Perhaps we can alter that and make it from 35 to 45 years. The hon. member also raised the very important question of the shortage of skilled manpower, and he referred to a statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister on 23 April this year. I think the hon. member also said that there were 2,000 vacancies for skilled men in the steel industry. Well, I am fully conscious of the shortage of skilled manpower, particularly in the steel industry, because representations have been made to me, and in fact a deputation came to see me last November from the steel industry, which included Iscor. They put forward a scheme. They of course made the case that there was a terrific shortage of skilled workers in the steel industry and that the shortage would probably increase as time went on. They put forward a case that the Government should consider training skilled operatives in the steel industry, and as a result of their representations and the case they put up I took up the matter with the Department of Education, Arts and Science, and it was obvious that there was indubitably a very real need to develop the manpower of the Republic to the very highest level of efficiency. As the result of the negotiations between the two Departments, Labour and Education, a Curriculum Committee was established consisting of representatives of Iscor and the steel industry, for the purpose of drafting a suitable curriculum, and as the result of these negotiations we have agreed upon a training scheme for these operatives in the steel industry. The course will be commenced at the Pretoria Technical College on an experimental basis and will be extended to other centres where the iron, steel and engineering industries are strongly represented&#x2014;such as at Johannesburg and Vanderbijlpark. I need not weary hon. members with details of the course. The effect, however, will be that a maximum of 30 persons will be trained every three months during the year. They will be paid during the period of their training, and will be absorbed in the steel industry after they have had three or four months&#x2019; practical training. We will provide for the necessary expenditure.</p>

<p>This is one of the schemes we have embarked upon in order to help the industries which I have mentioned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is somewhat similar to the COTT training system. The hon. member also raised various points about matriculants but those I think were effectively answered by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) and I need not repeat what he has said. Then the hon. member raised the perennial question of work reservation with which I propose dealing when I reply to the hon. member for Peninsula. I intend dealing then with work reservation particularly in the building industry. That is a question which was also raised by the hon. member for Yeoville; so that I think my reply to the hon. member for Peninsula will also cover his points. The hon. member also raised the point&#x2014;I think he quoted from some Press report&#x2014;that in Durban Natives were being employed to drive petrol tankers because there were no Whites available to do that work. Well, that report is completely wrong. There is, first of all, no job reservation relating to drivers of these petrol tankers. A certain petrol firm in Durban decided to employ Native drivers as an experiment. That experiment, however, failed. The firm was dissatisfied with these Native drivers and it then decided to employ White drivers. Apparently there was a good supply of White drivers because they were able to get White drivers for all their tankers. So that there is no truth whatsoever in that story. The hon. member is, of course, not responsible for that because it appeared in the Press. It is from there that he quoted it.</p>

<p>I think I should also deal with a question which the hon. member raised obliquely, namely the question of recognizing Native trade unions. He did not raise it directly but asserted by implication that the Government should change its policy in this respect. He said the Government should assist these Native workers to learn what collective bargaining means and that they should be given the responsibility of running trade unions. What the hon. member did indicate directly was that in his opinion as well as in the opinion of other members of his side, these Bantu trade unions should be given some responsibility so that they could be trained in the art of collective bargaining. The hon. member knows just as well as I do that <span class="col_7115_7116" refersTo="page_0890"/>that can mean nothing less than official recognition of Bantu trade unions by registration. That is all it can mean. I think it is a matter I should deal with. It is a matter into which I have gone very closely and one which is of some concern to the Government, and to hon. members, particularly in view of the fact that the Trade Union Council at its conference last year, and again this year, decided to affiliate certain Bantu trade unions. I will, therefore, be justified in dealing fully with the question of these Bantu trade unions. I should emphasize at the outset that Bantu trade unions are not prohibited in South Africa. This, I think, is an important point. The Bantu can form their trade unions and in that way learn the art of trade unionism and collective bargaining. Bantu workers are free to form their own trade unions and, as hon. members know, many of these trade unions have in fact been established. There are no restrictions on Bantu trade unions as such and the principle of freedom of association is, therefore, not involved. These trade unions have, however, not been granted the statutory recognition accorded to other trade unions. There are, of course, reasons for withholding such recognition and these reasons must be considered against the background of the conditions obtaining in South Africa. The statutory recognition enjoyed by trade unions in South Africa is in the form of registration under the Industrial Conciliation Act coupled with the right to use the machinery of that Act for the purpose of regulating relations between employers and employees.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, various requirements must be complied with before such registration can be granted and a certificate of registration can be cancelled where the body concerned is not functioning as a trade union. Every registered trade union is also required to function in accordance with a constitution which must provide for certain specific matters listed in the Act&#x2014;such as the method of electing office bearers and officials, the calling and the conduct of meetings, the keeping of minutes of meetings, the holding of secret ballots, the purposes for which funds may be used, etcetera. In addition certain obligations are placed upon these registered bodies by the Act itself with regard to the keeping and auditing of books of account, the submission of annual membership returns to the industrial registrar, etcetera. Rights conferred upon the registered body entitle them to participate in the formation of industrial councils or to apply for the establishment of conciliation boards for the purpose of determining conditions of employment for workers employed in the industries concerned. It follows, therefore, that registration alone does not carry the full advantages of trade unionism without the ability to use the machinery of the Act, because if it is not a registered trade union, it cannot use the machinery provided by the Industrial Conciliation Act.</p>

<p>According to my records, the first Bantu trade union came into existence in 1918. It catered for heterogeneous interests and its objects were as much political as the improvement of conditions of work. It clearly was not a trade union in the ordinary sense and after a process of disintegration it disappeared from the scene without having accomplished much of lasting benefit to the Bantu population. The organization was, however, replaced by a number of smaller unions organized on industrial lines and further unions have since come into being.</p>

<p>Successive Governments devoted attention to the question of the recognition which might be granted to these unions having regard to the fact that the Bantu had not yet reached that stage of development where they could adapt themselves to the system in operation in respect of trade unions composed of employees of other races. Protracted discussions took place between the Government Departments concerned and eventually a representative conference of trade union leaders, including Bantu representatives and other interested parties, was convened in order to discuss the matter in all its aspects.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member is not interested he need not listen. I, however, want this to be on record. At this conference which was convened by the Government&#x2014;and the previous Government was interested in it too&#x2014;it was made quite clear on behalf of the Bantu unions that they were not prepared to accept anything short of full statutory recognition under the Industrial Conciliation Act. The Government of the day was not, however, prepared to concede such recognition. This Government was the United Party Government. When the present Government came into office in 1948, it gave consideration to the whole matter and came to the conclusion that the Bantu had not yet reached a stage of development where they could without harmful results to themselves and to the country exercise the functions and rights normally conferred upon trade unions. Experience had shown that the unions which had been established had a precarious existence. The Industrial Legislation Commissioner found that some 66 Bantu trade unions had become defunct in the years prior to its investigation. There was evidence also to show that the trade union movement was not spontaneous amongst the Bantu and that it was frequently sponsored by agitators for their own purposes.</p>

<p>In general the Bantu outlook is not reconcilable with the underlying principles of trade unionism. The average Bantu expects something in return for every subscription which he pays. If his conditions of employment are satisfactory, he has no further interest in any trade union. The Industrial Legislation Commission found that in the case of some 13 trade unions with a total membership of 6,651, only 40 per cent of the members were in good standing as far as subscriptions were concerned. Moreover, an examination of the financial management of 35 Bantu trade unions revealed that the management of the affairs of 20 was <span class="col_7117_7118" refersTo="page_0891"/>completely unsatisfactory. The Commission was informed that in many instances Bantu trade unions were organized as a source of income for the organizers themselves rather than as a measure of protection and promotion of the interests of the workers.</p>

<p>I want to make it perfectly clear that this Government is not prepared to encourage a movement of this nature by giving statutory recognition to Bantu trade unions. It is also felt that recognition alone will not be of any benefit to the Bantu worker unless such trade unions are able to use the machinery of the industrial law which is intended for trade unions functioning on traditional lines. One of the basic conditions precedent to the use of the machinery of the Industrial Conciliation Act is that the unions must be sufficiently representative of the employees in the industries concerned. Representativeness is determined on the basis of the active membership of the union and trade unions with a fluctuating and unstable existence obviously cannot meet this requirement. I think all of us know that the overwhelming majority of the Bantu workers have no knowledge of and cannot appreciate trade union responsibility and discipline. As pointed out by the Industrial Legislation Commission, the theory and practice of trade unionism and the implications therein are matters which require the attention of leaders of experience and knowledge&#x2014;qualities which are not readily to be found amongst Bantu workers. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>I have some further notes here but I think I have said enough on this question.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I will consider that when it becomes an issue. I am not prepared to answer a hypothetical question on it at this stage.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Peninsula. This hon. member made a serious contribution to the debate and dealt first of all with work reservation generally as it affected the Coloured community. He submitted that work reservation weighed very harshly on the Coloured people, that there was really no lucrative employment for the Coloured worker, that it was the despair of young Coloured people because there were no opportunities for them after leaving school, etc. He also raised the question of the rate for the job. I am not going to deal with this question of the rate for the job because the hon. member for Vereeniging dealt with that very effectively. Moreover. I went into the whole question last year and I do not want to do so again this year.</p>

<p>What I do want to deal with, however, is the important question of job reservation in the building industry. This affects principally the Coloureds of the Western Province although also to a certain extent the Coloureds in Durban and elsewhere. The hon. member dealt with five or six activities in the building trade which are at present reserved for Whites. Let me deal for a moment with the determination in the building industry. First of all, I should like to reiterate that the Government realizes fully that all races in South Africa are entitled to their rightful place in the field of labour and that work reservation cannot lightly be applied, i.e. without taking into consideration established rights and certain economic effects. The main consideration, however, is that all races must be afforded an opportunity of contributing their share to the economic and social development of the country. On this we all agree. With this in mind, it has been my task as Minister of Labour to maintain industrial peace by means of wage regulating measures and the elimination of friction between the races in the field of labour. Although it has been said over and over again, I want to repeat that work reservation is resorted to only after all other methods of safeguarding the employee against inter-racial competition have failed. Quite often cases of displacement are dealt with administratively. Where that is possible, we do so&#x2014;sometimes after protracted negotiations between the Department and the employers concerned.</p>

<p>Work reservation in the building industry took over two years to investigate. The investigation was set afoot by my predecessor and the industrial tribunal took more than two years to determine what the reservation in the building trade should be if any. I think it will be of interest to hon. members to hear just a short extract from the report of that tribunal&#x2014; an extract which was not quoted by the hon. member for Peninsula. By saying this I do not want to create the impression that the hon. member deliberately did not do so. At any rate, according to this extract&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">White artisans in the Cape Province have no objection to Coloureds and Asiatics also undertaking building work, but the increase in the non-White numbers has given rise to the fear that Whites would be entirely crowded out. According to certain statistics, certain artisan work in the Western Province is mostly done by Coloured persons.</block>

<p>I now want to give hon. members the relevant percentages: bricklaying 1 per cent Whites and 99 per cent Coloureds; plastering 1 per cent Whites and 99 per cent Coloureds; carpentry&#x2014; 1 per cent Whites and 99 per cent Coloureds; plumbing&#x2014;40 per cent Whites and 60 per cent Coloureds; and painting&#x2014;2 per cent Whites and 98 per cent Coloureds. Now, it is obvious that in these particular occupations the work is almost entirely being done by Coloureds. Consequently work reservation does not affect them but they just go on as they have been doing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Does that apply to both Whites and Coloureds?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_labour">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>The existing ratio has been frozen&#x2014;in other words, we are maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> We need, <span class="col_7119_7120" refersTo="page_0892"/>therefore, not concern ourselves with these particular occupations because they are almost entirely occupied by Coloureds and are not reserved in the Cape.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula then complained about the few trades in which the workers were for the most part Whites. These trades are: masonry&#x2014;98 per cent Whites and 2 per cent Coloureds; joinery&#x2014;85 per cent Whites and 15 per cent Coloureds; wood-machining&#x2014;85 per cent Whites and 15 per cent Coloureds; shopfitting&#x2014;95 per cent Whites and 5 per cent Coloureds; and electrical wiring&#x2014; 95 per cent Whites and 5 per cent Coloureds. In all the circumstances, the tribunal decided to recommend that the majority of trades in the building trade in the Western Cape should be left unreserved. Consequently, only the work done by skilled artisans in the following trades was reserved for Whites only: stone masonry, marble masonry, joinery in a workshop, wood-machining in a workshop, electrical wiring, letter cutting and stone decorating, shop, office and bankfitting. Coloureds who at present practice the trades in the areas concerned are, however, to continue their work. In effect, therefore, as far as the first-mentioned trades such as plastering, carpentry, painting, etc., are concerned, no work reservation will apply. In regard to the other trades where I have shown the majority of workers to be Whites, the rights of the White worker are being reserved because it was being found that they were being pushed out of those trades in the Western Province.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula argued his case on the evidence which was placed before the tribunal. My attitude of course is that that industrial tribunal has been put there for that purpose, i.e. to investigate the question of work reservation. In the course of that investigation evidence is placed before that tribunal and on the evidence so placed before it the tribunal decides to make or not to make a recommendation. Hon. members will realize that it is quite impossible for me to say whether an industrial tribunal is correct or not. The case is argued before that tribunal and I as a Minister have by law no right to amend the recommendations of a tribunal. I must accept either the whole of the recommendation or reject it <i>in toto.</i> Now, can hon. members imagine what a position the Minister will place himself in if, faced with a unanimous decision of an industrial tribunal for a work reservation, he says he is not prepared to accept it? After all, the object of the Act in establishing an industrial tribunal is that such tribunal should sit there as a trial body, hear the evidence, and make its recommendation to the Minister. The hon. member for Peninsula said that this was not a unanimous decision of the industrial tribunal concerned. But that is not correct because it was a unanimous decision. The tribunal itself made the recommendation. It is true that the assessors sitting with that tribunal&#x2014;four of the employers and four of the employees&#x2014;made a minority report. To be more precise, only the employers&#x2019; assessors made a minority report. The assessors acting on behalf of the employees made no minority report. The tribunal itself, however, made a unanimous recommendation to the Minister. Now, I, as the responsible Minister appoint this body to investigate these matters and if that body places before me a unanimous recommendation as to what the reservation should be, am I entitled to reject it and say that I am not prepared to accept it? I say that it would be a serious matter for me to reject a recommendation of an industrial tribunal. Consequently, I am not prepared, where I get a unanimous recommendation from a tribunal which as in this particular case has spent over two years on the investigation, to reject it. Hon. members will see that this particular recommendation is fully documented and in drafting it the greatest thought and consideration were required. If hon. members study the reports, they will see that the recommendations are very fair having in mind that the tribunal was not prepared to allow the White artisans in the particular trades I mentioned, to be pushed out of those trades.</p>

<p>I accepted the recommendation and I am satisfied conscientiously in my own mind, that it was a fair recommendation. As a matter of fact, it may be of interest to hon. members to learn that I have received representations from workers from certain parts of the country objecting to the determination not on the grounds that it was unfair to Coloureds, but on the grounds that it did not go far enough to protect the White worker.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the hon. member for Jeppe (Dr. Cronje). The hon. member realizes, of course, that figures that are given by the Department of Census which are three years old are of absolutely no use to us whatsoever. We can only deal with the figures as we get them from month to month through registration. What can I do with figures which are now three years old? What can I do with figures which the Department of Census found on investigation three years ago? How am I to act on those figures? As I said before I can only go on the figures which I have now; these figures in respect of the registered unemployed. Obviously a Department of Labour can only go on registration figures. Every country in the world goes on its registration figures.</p>

<p>No. I am sorry; I am not carrying on an argument with the hon. member. I accept that three years ago there were 136,000 unemployed, but the hon. member also knows that in the last year, for instance, there has been a dramatic change for the better in unemployment in South Africa. So what is the use of my comparing figures which were taken three years ago when I know that in certain industries in South Africa there is no unemployment at all to-day? That is the only point I am making. The hon. member for Jeppe also made the assertion that there was not a single instance of work reservation for the protection of Coloureds. The hon. member is talking without his book. Perhaps the hon. member does not know that at the moment the Industrial Tribunal is conducting an investigation to protect the Coloureds in the Cape in the catering industry from Bantu infiltration. That investigation is taking place now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotze) raised a matter which is receiving the serious attention of the Government, namely, the question of work for handicapped people and the whole question of sheltered employment. He asked whether we could not extend the facilities for sheltered employment. As the hon. member knows, we are doing that in various ways, but unfortunately, of course, the only customer which the workshops under sheltered employment have is the Government, which is a limited market. The Government buys their products and the market is limited. The hon. member will see that there is an amount of R680,000 on the Estimates representing a subsidy which we pay to local authorities who employ handicapped people. I can tell the hon. member that we are completely sympathetic to the ideas which he has on this question. I am making further investigations as to how far we can extend the facilities which we are giving to handicapped people. I might add, for instance, that we have taken over from Social Welfare the workshops in which the blind are being assisted. My Department has now taken those workshops over, and we hope to extend that system of sheltered employment further. So far we have made quite a good contribution, but it is a matter which my Department takes very seriously and I can assure the hon. member that it has our fullest attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) also raised the question of work reservation. He said we were not using the best material to do the work in South Africa. He also said that apprentices should be encouraged. If hon. members want further information on what we are doing in order to assist apprentices in their technical training, the hon. the Deputy Minister, who dealt with the Apprenticeship Bill, which is now law, will be able to give them that information. The hon. member for Rosettenville evaded the question put by hon. members on this side in regard to the question of work reservation on the mines. I view this matter seriously, because the case that the Opposition puts against work reservation is based on moral grounds, at least that is what they assert. That word is used time and time again by the Opposition. They say on moral grounds there should be no work reservation. In other words, it is immoral to have work reservation. I have put this question on various occasions: If it is immoral in certain industries why is it not immoral in the mining industry? That is the question they must answer.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) would say that because her policy is quite clear; I appreciate her <i>bona fides.</i> But the United Party will not answer this question. I say that if work reservation is immoral in the building industry, in the clothing industry and in any other industry, why is it not immoral in the mining industry? That is a question that party must answer. I have not had an answer yet. If hon. members can tell me what difference there is between work reservation in the mining industry and in other industries I would like to know it. The hon. member for Rosettenville attempted to draw a distinction. He said there was work reservation in the mines because workers had to handle dangerous explosives and therefore you must have a highly skilled worker to handle these explosives. Well, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) effectively replied to that. He said because it was a highly skilled job it was reserved for Whites. <span class="col_7123_7124" refersTo="page_0894"/>That is what the statement of the hon. member for Rosettenville means: Because it is a skilled job it must be reserved for Whites.

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East raised the question of workmen&#x2019;s compensation in regard to farm workers. As the hon. member knows the Department has recently gone very fully into that question. I have a copy here of what I said to the Agricultural Union on this question. I can save time by reading an extract quickly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The average cost per accident is not the criterion in fixing the assessment rates. What is in fact taken into account is the ratio between the total income of assessments and the expenditure of a specific industry over a period of years and whatever the number of accidents which occur and the total costs should an upward or downward trend be shown. The rate which is determined is only intended to let the income and the expenditure balance and to provide for a small contribution to the reserve fund in addition. It has not been designed to recover any past losses. In numerous instances where it appears that the fund is making excessive profit the rates are appropriately reduced. During the period 1951 to 1960 the accident fund suffered a loss of R1,200,000 in so far as agriculture was concerned and this shortage had to be met from the contributions of the other industries. Considerable progress has now been made during the last two years in regard to the registration of farmers and it is anticipated that the total income from agriculture will increase during the next few years. The position is being closely watched and should the total expenditure remain more or less constant or become reduced the assessment rate will then be reduced. In so far as the question of merit rebate is concerned it is not correctly alleged that the small employers who do not pay more than R200 in assessments during a cycle of three years are being neglected. The employer who pays more than R200 and who can consequently qualify for a rebate also does not receive any rebate on the first R200 of his assessment.</block>

<p>I can assure the hon. member that the position is being closely watched and no injustice will be done to the farmers as far as that point is concerned.</p>

<p>As far as that is concerned the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. Van Staden) also raised the question of job reservation in respect of petrol pump attendants. My attitude is this: that I am prepared to investigate these matters if I get a request to do so. We usually get requests from certain representatives, certain trade unions and so on. If the hon. member would put in a request that that matter should be investigated, also the question of the petrol pump attendants, they will have my attention.</p>

<p>I just want to deal shortly with the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross). The hon. member for Benoni, apart from raising the question of pensioners which is not my job, it is the job of my colleague, the hon. the Minister for Social Welfare and Pensions, raised the question of a certain petition which he says had been sent to me from 30 persons requesting either a repeal or an amendment to the Unemployment Insurance Act which was passed last year. He read a reply which they had received from me to the effect that the petition had been noted. The reason why the reply was sent in that form was that I was not prepared to amend or to repeal the Unemployment Insurance Act. The hon. member then went out of his way to be insulting as far as I personally was concerned. He added this just for good measure which I think was a vile insinuation and probably just worthy of that hon. member. He said this: &#x201C;Probably if the 30 names had not been <span class="col_7125_7126" refersTo="page_0895"/>English names the Minister would have attended to it properly.&#x201D; Hon. members will see what a vile insinuation it is but I expect that sort of thing from that hon. member. What I want to tell the hon. member is this: I do not propose to answer any of the questions which he has submitted to me as Minister. I also want to tell the hon. member this that if his constituents wish to raise any matter with me as Minister of Labour and Immigration they must do so through some person other than the hon. member. I want to tell them that if that hon. member raises any matter with me as Minister of Labour and Immigration, they will not get any sympathy from me whatsoever. I am going further, I am giving instructions to my Departments that if that hon. member raises any matter concerning my Departments it has to be referred to me personally; I will attend to it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I shall be very brief. I just want to place on record immediately the feeling of shock and disappointment which the last part of the long speech of the hon. the Minister of Labour aroused in one. If a speech of an hon. member in this House is insulting the Rules of the House provide for it that the Minister can be protected. If the hon. the Minister feels that he has been insulted he has the fullest right to draw your attention to it, Mr. Chairman, and you will protect him. But for the Minister to report to what amounts to a boycott of a chosen member of this House is something completely unheard of. It is something so petty, Mr. Chairman, that I still cannot believe my own ears. I can only hope that with the passage of time, when this cry of pain of the Minister&#x2019;s has subsided, he will come to his senses and once again act like a responsible Minister of the Republic. If the hon. the Minister takes exception to anything which an hon. member on this side says he ought to object immediately and seek protection. But to penalize the constituents of the hon. member to compensate himself for his feeling of inferiority is something unheard of. One can understand the Minister feeling ashamed of himself in certain respects but how dare he take it out on a free member of a free House of Assembly of a free country?</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister raised one matter which perhaps deserves a little attention. That was his accusation that we were double faced in regard to job reservation on the mines of the Witwatersrand. I want to react briefly to that. The Minister has, of course, made far-reaching accusations. He has betrayed seven-eighths of his own political past. He got up here and as much as said that for the major part of his political life he had been a dishonest and double-faced person. I cannot help that; that is the Minister&#x2019;s own affair; that is a matter for his own conscience. It is quite clear that a special position has developed on the mines over the years. A special position has developed on the gold mines over the years and that position was due to two major facts. The one was the objection of the mineworkers to the fact that primitive tribal Natives, all migrant labourers.&#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>In 1922, when the matter was raised, it was proved that all the Natives concerned in the gold mines on the Witwatersrand were migrant labourers. [Interjections.] What is more, I go so far as to say that even to-day 98 per cent to 99 per cent of the Natives who work underground in the mines are migrant labourers. With the development of the gold fields of the Orange Free State there was an attempt on the part of the mines to reduce the number of migrant labourers and to create an established permanent Native working class, as the Government is doing in the case of Sasol. But when the mines wanted to do so in the Free State this Government stopped them. However, I do not want to go further into that. The fact is that the mineworkers objected to primitive tribal Natives handling explosives. That led to a bloody strike; it stopped just this side of a revolution. Blood flowed and as a result of that a National Party Government passed an Act shortly after that whereby certain work was reserved in the mines for the Natives. That was approximately 35-40 years ago. That pattern has become part of the mining organization. [Interjections.] I am not saying it is right; I am not saying it should not be changed. If it is changed it must be changed as a result of the employers and the employees coming to an agreement. I personally hope such an agreement will become possible because I do believe that the time will arrive when it will not be possible for us to maintain that colour bar and maintain a sound economy in South Africa at the same time. As practical people we must accept that we are dealing here with an established position under an established set of circumstances.</p>

<p>What happened was this: That was the first attempt to get Natives <span class="col_7127_7128" refersTo="page_0896"/>to do that type of work and the position was frozen because of tremendous industrial unrest; the existing position was frozen. People were not deprived of existing rights. The position in regard to job reservation is that it is an attempt&#x2014;the courts shattered that hope at one time&#x2014;to deprive people of their existing rights. A few years ago the Minister lost a case in Johannesburg when he tried to interfere in organized factories there; he wanted to put the clock back by depriving people of positions they had occupied for years. To-day an attempt is still being made to do so on a percentage basis. It will have this result that people will be deprived of the jobs which have been theirs traditionally. There is no comparison between that position and the position which exists on the mines. I think it is unworthy of the Minister to advance this superficial argument and to level unfounded accusations in view of the fact that for 20-30 years of his political life he has had the opportunity of agitating for a change in order to establish his moral superiority over us. Why did he not do so? I can only express my extreme disappointment in the attitude of the Minister, firstly, because of his threats and the boycott he has promised the voters of Benoni, something which he, as a servant of the State, has no right to do, and secondly, because of his superficial betrayal of his own past in order to get out of an embarrassing political situation.</p>

<p>We have to-night again had an exhibition of the double game played by the United Party. We have already had a few examples of that. I shall begin with the admonition of the hon. the Minister to the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross). He reprimanded the hon. member for Benoni for his insinuation that because the names were those of English-speaking people the Minister was not concerned about it. That is a reprehensible insinuation. The Minister was quite right in expressing himself strongly in that regard. It has a double meaning to intimate that the Minister acted against the constituents of Benoni. On the contrary, the Minister said that the Benoni constituents should in the future approach him through other channels. That is what he said. Why are his words now being distorted.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Chairman, I did say that. I withdraw those words. The fact is that the hon. the Minister said that he would respond to those constituents if they approached him through other channels. The accusation made here by the hon. member for Yeoville was that the Minister was now going to take action against the voters of Benoni. If that is not an unparliamentary distortion, then it is a definite misrepresentation. That is not the only instance of this double game on the part of the United Party that we have had in this debate. The other double game we had was in connection with work reservation. The one moment work reservation is branded as immoral, as the worst thing in the world. When we come to the first work reservation determination laid down in this country, namely the Colour Bar Act of 1926 which affected the mining industry, then it is suddenly perfectly all right and the hon. member for Yeoville has nothing to say in that regard. Do principles not count at all with him? It is, after all, precisely the same principle which has been applied right up to the present as far as work reservation determinations are concerned. But, naturally, because they have so many friends in the mining industry, and because they probably feel as we do that the mining industry should carry on as it has been doing, they suddenly change their sense of values and say they cannot expatiate on that. These are not the only instances of double standards and double play that we have had here. We have encountered it in connection with the so-called &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;, which has been raked up <i>ad infinitum</i> as the solution. The hon. member for Yeoville said again to-night that it was the solution. I would very much like to know if the hon. member for Yeoville can answer this question for me: Is it still the aim of the United Party to protect the White worker by the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;? Is that still your objective?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, here you now have an interesting example of double talk. I have here an extract from the <i>Speaker&#x2018;s Guide</i> of the United Party&#x2014;you will remember this famous document with which they attempted to fight us in 1953. In relation to the &#x201C;Protection of the Rate for the Job Principle&#x201D;, the United Party then said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why is this important? It is important because it means that so long as wages are fixed according to the job no non-European can take over a European&#x2019;s job by offering it to him at a lower rate of pay.</block>

<p>In other words, on the one hand they want to pose as the people who protect the White worker because, as they put it, the work cannot be offered at a lower rate of pay. I wonder if the United Party, including the hon. member for Yeoville, who now takes such an interest in labour matters, have ever taken the trouble to ascertain how the United Party&#x2019;s &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; works? I took the trouble of asking my Department to investigate the question as to how the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; operates here in the Cape and how it provides protection. Now I would just like to give a few instances to illustrate how the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; works. In the engineering industry the minimum wage, the so-called &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;, is 39 cents per hour here in the Western Cape, but the Whites get 45 cents per hour. But do you know what the Coloureds get? They get 42 cents per hour. Now what sort of &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is that? What sort of &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; is it that has a minimum rate of 39 cents per hour, and the Whites get 45 cents and the non-Whites get 42 cents?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Who determines it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>It is a question of wage determinations and wage agreements. But my point is that despite a minimum wage being laid down for the so-called &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;, the employers pay the White workers somewhat more than the so-called &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;, and they pay the non-Whites at a lower rate.</p>

<p>Allow me to mention another two or three more examples. Take clerical posts. In the trade the minimum wage for clerical posts in the Western Cape is R12 per week. Do you know what the average weekly wage is for Whites here? It is R25 per week; but the wage of the Coloureds is R15 per week. That is how the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; works in practice. It is just bluff; it is a fraud. We call it swindling (boereverneukery). And what do the Coloured blockmen get? This &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D; means that 92 per cent of the Coloureds here in the Western Cape receive the minimum wage. They receive the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;. But only 13 per cent of the Whites receive the minimum wage: 13 per cent of them receive the &#x201C;rate for the job&#x201D;. Precisely what the hon. member for Vereeniging said: the minimum wage is laid down, &#x201C;the rate for the job&#x201D;. A higher wage is paid to the Whites, and it is constantly used as a sort of threat, as a sword hanging over their heads: &#x201C;If you do such and such, then either you go, or we will reduce you to this wage&#x201D;. What sort of protection for the Whites is this then? This is nothing else but fraud, and it is just one of the many examples of the double game played by the United Party. We had this double game in another sphere as well, and that was in connection with the Native trade unions. The hon. member for Yeoville pleaded that we should now allow the Bantu workers&#x2019; interests to be served by the existing trade unions, so that they could also then have collective bargaining. That means only one thing. If you take part in collective bargaining in this country, then you must, as the hon. the Minister said, belong to a recognized trade union. There is no other way in this country of taking part in collective bargaining. The hon. member knows that as well as he knows his own name. But if it is pointed out that they are pleading for the recognition of Native trade unions, then the hon. member is quick to say to the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. Van Rensburg): No, he did not plead for the recognition of Native trade unions. On the one hand he wants them to participate in mutual competition, and that necessarily means that he recognizes trade unions. And if it is then put to them, they are too afraid to admit it. So long as a party like the United Party plays this double game as far as principles are concerned, and so long as principles are to them just so many trade commodities, to be handled for the sake of opportunism, for so long must they also expect their standpoint to be treated with contempt both by this House and by the workers themselves.</p>

<p>Oh, he challenges me? I shall go to Benoni, but not with him. I am not going to give him an audience. He cannot get an audience. I do not believe he has ever had an audience of more than 20 people in Benoni, and he is regarded by his own constituents as just about the most useless member they have ever had. They do not make use of his services. They make all their representations through Morrie Nestadt. They don&#x2019;t want to know anything about him; they do not wish to see him, and I know of no United Party member who has any time for him. I think the hon. member, who was offensive here to the Minister by suggesting that the Minister refused to give attention to a certain matter because it concerns an English-speaking person, deserves nothing less than the Minister gave him, and I want to urge upon the Minister to adhere to what he said.</p>

<p>Now I should like to come to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), this man of high morals. Take his defence of job reservation in the mines. I want to ask the hon. member for Yeoville this: Why will his policy of the rate for the job not work in the mines? Surely a rate is fixed, is it not? He says that primitive people are employed in the mines; that it is migrant labour from other territories that is employed there; that they are foreign Natives; that they are primitive people. Assuming he introduced his rate for the job; who would make use of this primitive labour to handle explosives there? Why would the rate for the job not work there? This only goes to show that his whole argument that this is based on tradition, does not hold water. The hon. member now sits there talking; I appreciate it very much that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is trying to save the hon. member from his embarrassment. But what is the basis of the rate for the job? The basis is that once a rate has been fixed, an inferior person will never be used for the job. One uses the person who can best do the job. His argument therefore that primitive people are being employed in the mines, migrant labourers, semi-barbarians, demonstrates that that is the obvious place where the rate for the job should be applied. Surely that is the place where the rate for the job will give complete protection to the White workers, according to his own reasoning. The hon. member now says that it is a mistake; that there must be no job reservation in the mines. He says it must eventually disappear, but if it has to disappear it must be done away with as a result of discussions between the employers and the employees. Did I understand him correctly?</p>

<p>Oh, not the ordinary employee; not the primitive employees; in other words, the veto must be given to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. Is that correct?

<p>Very well then, it suits my argument better if he did not say that. The hon. member now says that there must be an agreement with the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. What greater right has the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union to safeguard their interests than the Steelworkers&#x2019; Union in Vereeniging and in Vanderbijlpark and in Pretoria have to safeguard theirs? Why should they have more protection? The hon. member talks about principles. Is it on principle, on moral grounds, that they should enjoy greater protection? The hon. member admits that the Mineworkers&#x2018;Union will retain the veto in regard to job reservation in the mines. Is that correct? The hon. member for Yeoville is not a member without courage. I should like to ask him this: Suppose the Chamber of Mines (and they would gladly do so) were to agree. The Gold Producers&#x2019; Committee would gladly agree that Bantu labourers should also be able to do skilled work. The only body against it is the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. Now the hon. member says that it must by agreement between the employers and the employees, and the only <span class="col_7133_7134" refersTo="page_0899"/>employees organization that he recognizes is the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. In other words, the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union must have the last word as to whether there shall be job reservation in the mines. Is that correct or is it not correct?</p>

<p>I devoted almost my whole ten minutes to the point that the position at the mines was perfectly clear. The whole matter was regulated after the strike which took place as long ago as 1922, when a fixed pattern of industrial relationships arose on the mines. That was my main argument. I say that since there is this fixed pattern of relations, it can only be modified or varied by the operation of industrial democracy; that means agreement between the organized workers and the organized employers. Nothing can be clearer. I also emphasized that in the case of the mines there was an existing position which the employers sought to change, and the employees objected. In the case of job reservation, what has already been achieved is being undone. And that is the difference. But if the hon. member wishes to argue with me and wishes to ignore these two critical differences, then he is not arguing with me; he is knocking down skittles which he himself put up.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>I have put a very simple question to my hon. friend, namely who had to be consulted. There are only three groups that can be consulted. The one is the Gold Producers&#x2019; Committee. We know they are in favour of the abolition of job reservation. The other body that could be consulted is the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, and the third group that could be consulted is the unskilled labourers in the mines, namely the Bantu, the migrant labour as he called it. The hon. member is not in favour of the Bantu being consulted. Or am I saying the wrong thing now?</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>All of them are affiliated to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Uuion. It covers all the White labourers. Now I ask the hon. member this: If he wants to protect the workers in the mines, if he wants to give those workers the veto right, why cannot I have that right for my steelworkers in Vereeniging and Vanderbijlpark and in Mr. Van der Walt&#x2019;s constituency? They want the same right. Why cannot we have the same right for the engineers? Why cannot we claim the same right for the transport services? What happens to the moral basis now? The United Party is willing therefore, for political reasons, to give to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, the White workers in the mines, the veto right to discriminate against Black labour in the mines, to give them the full power to say: &#x201C;We refuse to allow any Black man to come and do this job we are doing at the moment.&#x201D; But they refuse to give that right to any other worker. Where does the moral basis come in? What is the economic basis for it? Is there any basis at all for such an attitude? It only exposes the absolute bluff on that side, and the hon. member for Yeoville ought to be ashamed of himself. What happens to the rate for the job? He does not have a rate for the job. Their whole case simply is that they are willing, when it does not affect them politically, to throw the White labourer on to the open market in competition with Black labour, and they do not care what becomes of the White workers. Never since I have been in this Parliament, has the absolute immorality of the United Party, the absolute lack of principle, been exposed so damningly as the Minister of Labour has exposed it during this debate to-day, and the hon. member for Yeoville has helped to destroy them completely.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry to interrupt this private argument between the hon. member for Yeoville and the hon. member for Vereeniging, but I want to come back to this very important subject of job reservation. Before I do that, I would like to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. Minister in paying tribute to Mr. Hannah, the present Secretary for Labour, who. I understand, is facing us in the Gallery for the last time in that capacity. My colleagues and I have had on numerous occasions to interview him in regard to labour matters affecting the Coloured community. We have always found him very courteous and a painstaking official, and he carries with him the goodwill and good wishes of my colleagues and myself, and we wish him a very long and happy retirement.</p>

<p>I would also like to thank the hon. Minister for the very courteous way in which he replied to the observations that I made earlier this afternoon on this very important matter of Job reservation. I do not for a single moment agree with the hon. Minister&#x2019;s contentions, and I want to show him in the course of a very brief speech where he has erred. <span class="col_7135_7136" refersTo="page_0900"/>But nevertheless the hon. Minister was very courteous in his reply and I am grateful to him for the way in which he dealt with the observations I made.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister pointed out that this tribunal (I want to deal with job reservation particularly in so far as it affects the building industry in the Cape) was established by his predecessor in 1960. I accept that position, because I am absolutely satisfied that the present incumbent of that office, the present hon. Minister, would not have established this tribunal on the very flimsy request that was made at the time. The hon. Minister himself has pointed out in reply to a question that was put to him in this House that the tribunal was established because of a request made by the South African Operative Masons Society and the South African Electrical Workers Association. It was significant that the tribunal was not established to inquire into the affairs of those two associations, but was established generally to inquire into the building industry. I want to refer again very briefly to the terms of reference of that tribunal. The chairman of the tribunal, Mr. Potgieter, indicated that the tribunal&#x2019;s terms of reference were to investigate whether as a result of inter-racial competition the white worker in the building industry in the Cape needed protection. Those were the simple terms of reference of that tribunal. I venture to suggest that the weight of evidence, Mr. Chairman, and the weight of representations laid before that tribunal in no way justified the majority finding of that tribunal. On the contrary, it was pointed out right throughout the whole of that evidence that until this tribunal was established in 1960 absolute peace existed in the building industry in the Cape. I refer to the statement made by the representative of the Employers&#x2019; Association, who in no uncertain terms said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would like to bring to the notice of the tribunal the fact that peace has reigned in the industry since 1922. That was due to the spirit of co-operation between the races at all levels. All problems have been discussed and settled on the basis of what would be the best for the industry and its employees. No racial conflict has ever entered into the picture. I appeal to the tribunal not to upset this happy state of affairs by introducing job reservation&#x2026;</block>

<p>That is to say racial legislation. Then he went on to say, and that is very important&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The non-European builder has been the backbone of the building industry in the Cape for the last 300 years, both in numbers and the quality of work. The artisan in the Cape compares favourably with those in any other centre in the country.</block>

<p>This was the situation that existed in the industry when the Minister&#x2018;s predecessor suddenly decided to establish this tribunal. Peace had reigned in the industry since 1922. The workmen were happy and satisfied. The employers were happy and satisfied. But for some reasons, which I suggest can only be attributed to a political innovation on the part of the then Minister, he decided to establish this tribunal to investigate whether as a result of inter-racial competition the White worker in the building industry in the Cape needed protection. I say that there was no evidence whatsoever that there existed any inter-racial friction between the various races, or that the position of the White worker was in any way in jeopardy. I say it was unnecessary to establish this tribunal in the first place. But, in any case, once the tribunal had been established, it was abundantly clear from the evidence which I have read here, and which my colleagues have read, and which I am sure the hon. Minister has read, that the weight of evidence clearly indicated that there did not exist any justification whatsoever for the introduction of this job reservation policy in any industry where peace had reigned since 1922 without the necessity of having this obnoxious form of legislation introduced. The hon. Minister has pointed out&#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>The obnoxious policy on the part of the Government in the form of job reservation, Sir. I referred previously to the obnoxious policy of the Government to introduce job reservation. The hon. Minister has pointed out in the course of his long reply that he was not affecting any particular people, because where the vast majority of workers in any particular industry happened to be White the job was reserved for the White people, but where the vast majority happened to be Coloureds it was reserved for the Coloured people. He pointed out, for instance, that the bricklayers consist of one per cent Whites and 99 per cent Coloureds, and that this trade under job reservation was reserved for the Coloured people, and so on. But what the hon. Minister has overlooked is that in this determination the hon. Minister has unwittingly precluded men who are qualified in particular jobs, for example, as carpenters, from carrying on that job in any part of the Cape Province. He has restricted them to the region where that person is or was employed at the date of this proclamation. I do not think the hon. Minister appreciates this very important aspect that I want to raise now. There are many Coloured artisans&#x2014;I take carpenters as an example&#x2014;who have been in the employ of some of our big European establishments in the Cape for generations. These people work in Cape Town and they work outside Cape Town, they work all over the Cape Province. They tender for jobs in all parts of the Cape Province. In terms of this determination a Coloured man who has worked for, say, 25 years as a carpenter, and who is probably the most efficient carpenter in the employ of the White organization, could not <span class="col_7137_7138" refersTo="page_0901"/>be taken by that White organization when it is carrying out a contract in East London. In terms of this legislation that man would be restricted to Cape Town, because this is the place where he was employed at the time of this determination. It means that that carpenter in those circumstances&#x2026;</p>

<p>I am glad that the Minister confirms that, and I hope that the hon. the Minister will bear this in mind because this is a very important aspect. It means that that poor unfortunate carpenter who has given his entire life to the service of his employers would be deprived of his livelihood if that firm has to take on a job outside of the region where this man was working at the time of the determination. This is one of the instances of many which affect the Coloured people here, and I would urge the hon. Minister to reconsider the matter. He has received representations from Coloured organizations. Time does not permit me to deal with it at great length. But he has received these representations and I ask the hon. Minister to give his most careful attention to it, because he is doing, unwittingly perhaps, a disservice to a large section of law-abiding Coloured citizens of this country who are being most adversely affected by the determination in its present form.

<p>I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) and the hon. Minister in regard to Mr. Hannah. I have had many occasions to deal with him personally, and I appreciate all the help that he has given me and I also wish him well in his retirement.</p>

<p>I also want to say to the hon. Minister that the point raised by the hon. member for Peninsula just before he sat down is one of the most important aspects of this legislation, and the hon. Minister should give us a full explanation as to why he restricted skilled Coloured artisans to an area in which they are now employed. The hon. Minister gave the impression that the <i>status quo</i> is being maintained. I contend that that is not so. I want to tell the hon. Minister that not only has he brought in his job reservation in the building industry, but the aspect raised by the hon. member for Peninsula has made it impossible for a Coloured man to go to other parts of the country, mentioned in this determination, to legitimately carry on his trade. The Coloured people do not deserve that. Which White man is refused the right to go from Cape Town to East London or Port Elizabeth to pursue his calling or the work he is engaged on. But a Coloured man is prevented from doing so. Why? The hon. Minister owes an explanation to the Coloured people of South Africa as to why that is taking place. I go further: The Coloured boy who is to-day an apprentice in the building industry cannot go there after he has finished his five years of apprenticeship work in Cape Town if he is apprenticed in Cape Town. So we have the position that a Coloured man is apprenticed in Cape Town and that when he is finished he is told that he has to go outside the area and work somewhere else. What sort of legislation is this? Who is the hon. Minister protecting? The White people? I say that it is absurd. He is bringing in a vicious system which curtails the right of a citizen of this country from carrying out his work and from carrying on the traditional occupation for which he has studied and to which he has devoted most of his life. Now the Minister also says that he is maintaining the status quo, but has the hon. Minister realized what he has done in regard to East London? In East London to-day there is complete job reservation in favour of the White man. No Coloured man can work in the building industry in East London. What evidence is there to justify such a determination? I think it is necessary to say that the employers in the building industry have made it clear to the hon. Minister and the Industrial Council for the Building Industry has made it clear to the hon. Minister what the position is. What other evidence does the Minister want? Does he take no notice at all of the Industrial Council of the Building Industry of South Africa? Is this a body to be treated with contempt? They wrote to the Minister and they wrote to the tribunal and they made it perfectly clear that they are against job reservation. On 11 December 1960, the Industrial Council for the Building Industry in the Western Province wrote a letter to the tribunal.</p>
