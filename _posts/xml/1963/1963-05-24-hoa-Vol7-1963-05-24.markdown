<heading>STOCK EXCHANGES CONTROL_AMENDMENT_BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Stock Exchanges Control Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The object of this short Bill is to give effect to a request submitted to me by the Committee of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, to change the financial year-end of members of the Exchange from 30 June to 28 February.</p>

<p>This request arises from the change in the tax assessment year under the P.A.Y.E. system. I am informed that, if members of the Exchange adhered to their present accounting date of 30 June, they may be involved in difficulties and clashes in carrying out their various duties under the P.A.Y.E. system (in relation to both employees and their own provincial payments) which would all be geared to the assessment year ending in February. Furthermore, many brokers have in their total earnings a component of private income derived from activities other than stock broking, and here again complications might arise if the financial year ending 30 June were retained.</p>

<p>Although some brokers might, with the approval of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue, be able to continue on the present basis, the Committee of the Stock Exchange considers it very desirable to have a uniform financial year. In order to ensure that members have that required amount of minimum capital, the Committee insists that brokers submit audited accounts as of the same date; that is essential in order that outstanding bargains between brokers can be checked.</p>

<p>If the change proposed in this Bill were not made, those brokers who changed their financial year to 28 February might find it necessary to have their accounts audited no less than three times per year&#x2014;at 28 February for income-tax purposes as well as for their own internal purposes, at 30 June to comply with Section 22 of the Stock Exchange Control Act, and at 31 December to comply with Rule 190 (d) (i) of the Stock Exchange. If this Bill is accepted, it would be possible to dispense with one of these audits, since it is the intention of the Stock Exchange Committee to alter Rule 190 (d) (i) to ensure that in future audit certificates be submitted by broking firms as at 28 February and 31 August of each year.</p>

<p>I think the request of the Stock Exchange Committee is reasonable and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>We naturally support this Bill. It is consequential upon the introduction of the new end of the financial year, namely, the end of February, as the hon. the Minister has pointed out. Section 22 of the Act provides for the control of books, accounts and records of stockbrokers. The Committee of the Stock Exchange actually goes further than the Act provides. They control their members even more stringently than in the manner laid down in the Act. We naturally support this Bill that the hon. the Minister has introduced.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry the hon. the Prime Minister and the Chief Government Whip are not present here this morning. In the absence of the hon. the Prime Minister I will convey my message to the hon. the Minister of Finance. This request has been made to me from various parts of the country. A <span class="col_6585_6586" refersTo="page_0625"/>short while ago I spoke with a few hundred farmers in the district of Lydenburg in the Transvaal and they asked me to ask the hon. the Prime Minister to arrange an exchange. The request is that the hon. the Prime Minister should give other portfolios to the Ministers of Agricultural Technical Services and Agricultural Economics and Marketing and that the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development should be given the agricultural portfolios. I make this request on behalf of the Farmers&#x2019; Union of South Africa. It has appeared from the discussions on farming matters during this Session that hon. members opposite can no longer contain themselves. They have to tell the same Job&#x2019;s story that they say we on this side tell.</p>

<p>The strongest accusation that I have against the hon. the Minister and his Government is the following. The hon. the Minister is now going to tell me about the millions of rand that are spent on assisting the farmers. I want to say here that those millions of rand are nothing more than piecework. All this money is money that is being loaned to people who can no longer help themselves. Money is made available by the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board in the form of loans to buy stock because people can no longer make a living in any other way; we have Land Bank loans because farmers can no longer obtain credit at some other place. To my mind the most important indication of the critical condition in which the farmers find themselves in this country was the announcement in the Budget debate by the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker). Imagine, Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Cradock standing up and making an announcement in connection with the financing of farmers! It was not done by the Minister but by the hon. member for Cradock. And what did he say? He said that their caucus had decided to make this announcement. He also said: &#x201C;I also want to say that our three Ministers, although they have not adopted the report in its entirety.&#x2026; Where on earth have we heard a member of the caucus making an announcement and not a Minister? What does this amount to? It amounts to this, that the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board, the Land Bank, the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services have to finance the farmers. Then the hon. member for Cradock says that the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board must be converted into agricultural committees. At the end of his speech he said that farmers would no longer have to be sold up when they could no longer pay the interest they owed and that farmers would no longer be sold out by the Land Bank either. What else is all this but patchwork? The fact remains that this Government does nothing for the farmers unless the farmers are on their knees. We on this side of the House do not want that state of affairs. It is time that this Government woke up. I have said and I say it again that the farmers are tired of hearing that they should apply better farming methods.</p>

<p>They are tired of hearing that they should lower their production costs. What is the truth if one considers the matter in that connection? What happened last year in regard to the price of wheat and maize? The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing said then that because the production of wheat had fallen the price should be lowered.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I said nothing of the kind.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>But of course the hon. the Minister said so. This is not the first thing that the hon. the Minister has denied; neither will it be the last. Let us assume that he did not say this. This was the reason that was given: That the production of wheat had fallen and for that reason the price of wheat also fell. But there has always been a shortage of wheat in this country. There was a surplus production in the case of maize and the price of maize was also lowered. On the one hand there was a shortage of wheat and the price was lowered and on the other hand there was a surplus of maize and the price was also lowered. This is an interesting fact: Last year there was a surplus of maize and the price of maize was lowered. This year more maize was produced than last year and this year the price is higher. [Interjections.] It is estimated that more maize is going to be produced this year than was produced last year. Mr. Chairman, that hon. member is trying vainly to put me off. Let us accept the fact that there will be a million or two million bags less than last year. I make that concession to the hon. member; he wants to make a bone of contention of it. What then was the justification for lowering the price of maize last year if the price is being raised again this year? The fact is that the price of maize should not have been lowered last year and the price of wheat should not have been lowered either. Mr. Chairman, the simple fact is that the farmers with their knowledge of methods of expansion, with their methods of operation, with their methods of fertilizing, because of the increased use of hybrid seeds and the better combating of pests and plagues are doing everything that they possibly can do on their farms. And what has the hon. the Minister and the Government done? Let us see what they have done to bring production costs down.</p>

<p>During the discussion of the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services it was particularly interesting to me to note that the hon. the Minister said that we were able to produce all the bags and woolsacks that we needed in this country. I put a direct question to him and he said that if we were no longer able to import them we would be able to supply our own needs. But he did not tell us what the price would be. What are the facts to-day? The fact is that the farmers are subsidizing the two factories that have been erected in this country. Because the imported bags are cheaper, a balance has been effected between the two and the farmers have subsidized <span class="col_6587_6588" refersTo="page_0626"/>these factories to the tune of millions of rand in this way, The remarks of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services merely indicate to me that he does not have the slightest idea of what the farmers are spending. I will not deal with this matter any further because another hon. member will discuss it. The fact is that the prices of farming requisites have continued to rise. I want to quote from <i>Agrecon</i> [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The prices of farming requisites rose by 2.9 per cent as against 1.5 per cent for the previous year. The most important increases were in connection with fuel, bags and building material.</block>

<p>Then they give the percentages; 3.5, 4.3 and 2.9. They also talk about the tremendous increase in agricultural exports which at the moment amount to R349,000,000 of our total exports amounting to R852,000,000. But they also give a graph and this graph is the most interesting of all because it indicates what the expenditure was in comparison with what the farmers received. In other words, it showed the farmers&#x2019; profit. When one looks at this graph one is surprised that there are any farmers at all who are still able to make a living. As I have already said, it is the man whose farm has been paid off, the man who has no debts who can still hold out because he is able to borrow money on his land. He is encumbering his unencumbered land. Mr. Chairman, the farmers are subsidizing the artificial fertilizer factories that we have in this country. Last year the hon. the Minister emphasized the fact that the farmers had sold tea and butter and that this had been a great success. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>It is very clear to me that the hon. member who has just sat down forgot in the first place to ask for the half-hour and secondly, she thought that she was still living in the days of 1948. Hers was a speech that would have been appropriate then. But to-day one has to be realistic and see what is going on around one in South Africa. I was completely amazed to hear the hon. member trying to get away with the statement that she made and then on top of that she still had the effrontery to repeat the distasteful remark that we expect the two Ministers of Agriculture to be exchanged for other Ministers. It is a strange thing, to my mind, that last week in the Western Transvaal I came across exactly the opposite to what the hon. member for Drakensberg came across in the Eastern Transvaal. For example, at a meeting at Zeerust at which 600 people were present, by far the majority of whom were farmers, there was one dissentient I imagine that the hon. member knows the person, Mr. Henry du Toit. He asked a number of questions and, as usual, was sent home with a flea in his ear. What happened there is what happened in the Transvaal and throughout the whole country. If we have an election or a by-election to-morrow, our majorities will simply be increased. If what the hon. member has said is true and the farmers have deteriorated to such an extent that things are going so badly with the farming industry, why did they not make use of the opportunity in the Free State and elsewhere to contest by-elections? Why did they not appoint candidates? It is nonsensical for the hon. member to contend that this Government is not giving its full attention to the farmers and to agriculture in South Africa. And if the hon. member reads this book that is at her disposal, the Annual Report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing, she will see that year after year the agricultural industry in South Africa goes from strength to strength. But she comes along here now and contends that the Government is doing nothing for agriculture! After all, the Government is not a farmer. The Government is there to determine policy. I want to put one question to the hon. member. I want to contend that on the Highveld of the Transvaal land in the maize area is being leased at from R16 to R34 per morgen.</p>

<speech by="#schoonbee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>I am prepared to prove these figures on any platform in South Africa. I put this question to the hon. member. Is this not proof positive that money is still available in this particular industry? How otherwise could a person pay such an amount for the lease of land? This is positive proof that money is still available. And there is money in the wool industry. There is also money in other industries in the country. We cannot get away from the facts. There is a great deal wrong with our farming because there is a great deal wrong with our farmers. Just as there is a great deal wrong in other industries in the country we also find this in the farming sphere. Everyone does not fit into the pattern. Everyone in the mining industry is not a miner and everyone in the agricultural industry is not a farmer. As long as the world exists this will always be the case because man is not a perfect being either in agriculture or anything else. There are a few things which I want to bring to the attention of the Opposition. They had the opportunities before the present Government came into power to create those perfect farming conditions in South Africa. What did that hon. member and the loquacious hon. member next to her do here in South Africa? I was a farmer at that time, as I still am to-day, and the fact is that we in South Africa had a shortage of maize. We had so much wool that we had to store it in Port Elizabeth. There was not a single product that our country could export. Let the hon. member deny this! We had to import maize. And what did we import? Absolute rubbish! We had a shortage &#x2019; of dairy products and we had to import cheese and butter from New Zealand, And what did their party and their leaders do during that period of shortages? I was Chairman of the Milk3 Board in the Transvaal at the time and we sent a deputation to the then leader of <span class="col_6589_6590" refersTo="page_0627"/>that party, the Minister of Agriculture. What happened? After giving a promise at 5 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon that those prices would not be altered, at 12 o&#x2019;clock that same evening the prices were published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> and it was announced that prices would be cut by 2d. This was the sort of treatment that farmers received in the past. I say to-day that the defeat of the United Party in the election of 1948 and its defeats in subsequent elections was due entirely to their agricultural policy.</p>

In every by-election that takes place in a farming area this Government increases its majority.

I want to urge him to discuss urban matters and to leave agriculture alone because he knows nothing about it.</p>

<p>Now they are fighting a sham fight. When the hon. member speaks about Lydenburg it is only a sham fight; there is nothing in it.</p>

<p>There are many matters that one would like to discuss under this Vote, matters affecting agriculture and which are of the most vital importance. But instead of making a positive contribution to the debate the Opposition make it very difficult for one to raise matters under this Vote. I also want to talk about bags and fertilizer but I certainly will not follow the theme of the hon. member for Drakensberg. As far as bags are concerned we have an industry in South Africa to-day that is partly financed or subsidized by the State. The reason is that it is a young industry and we want to reach the position where we will not be placed in an embarrassing position as was the case in the past when the United Party was in power. It is because of this fact that we are subsidizing this industry. We want to assist this industry to the benefit of South Africa. But my plea to the hon. the Minister is that subsidization by the State makes it very difficult indeed for the farmer. The bags that he has to buy in South Africa are too expensive. We ask the hon. the Minister and his Department to give attention to the matter to see whether something cannot be done in this connection. This is a matter that affects South Africa as a whole, not only the farmer, not only the man who needs the bags. This matter rests heavily on the shoulders of farmers who have to use millions of bags. We ask that further attention be given to the matter and that a cheaper bag be made available to the farmer. I think that when I put the matter in this way I am putting it more positively than the hon. member on the other side put it. In the past we had to buy our bags abroad at such exorbitant prices that eventually we had to make use of paper bags. In asking for further research in this sphere and for more assistance to be given to the farmers, I think that I am putting the matter more positively than was done by the hon. member.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I have the privilege of the half hour? The hon. member told us about a meeting at Zeerust. Why did he not also tell us that after he had spoken the Nationalists there asked the hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) never to bring him there again because he was harmful to the Nationalist Party? And why did he not tell us that when the motion was put it could not be put in the usual way to find out how many were in favour of it and how many were against it. All the Chairman said was: &#x201C;All in favour of the motion shall rise&#x201D;, and of course, everyone stood up and walked out and he immediately adjourned the meeting. Nobody knew what was going on.</p>

<p>The hon. member merits a word of praise because he has broken a lance for the farmers in connection with bags. He merely enlarged upon what I had said but he is the last one to talk about elections. He knows that nomination day is coming and I wonder whether the hon. the Prime Minister will save his skin this time. The hon. member told us that he was Chairman of the Milk Board in 1947 or 1948. But I want to rectify another mistake that the hon. member made. He spoke about an amount of from R16 to R34 per morgen for land leased by farmers for maize production. Why then does the hon. member not lease all his land? Or has he already done so? That is an impossible position. How can an adult stand up and say that port of thing? If it were true all the maize farmers would simply move to the towns and live there in luxury&#x2014;if they could receive R30 per morgen for their land! I can well understand the hon. member for Marico saying that the hon. member should not return to Zeerust because he did the Nationalist Party too much harm.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said that he was Chairman of; the Milk Board in the Transvaal when the United Party was in power. If he was Chairman of the Milk Board in the Transvaal I want, to refer him to the graph that I have here from which it appears that the farmers made a profit in regard to all products, a very large profit. I will give it to the hon. member later so that <span class="col_6591_6592" refersTo="page_0628"/>he can study it and while we are talking about milk, what is the position in regard to milk now? I was saying when my time expired that last year the hon. the Minister spoke about the campaign that they had set in motion to popularize dairy products, cheese and butter amongst the public, and he said that it was such a success that much more of these products was used than before and that the surpluses had been disposed of. That is true. But it is also true that farmers have also disappeared. At the moment there is a shortage of milk in South Africa, particularly in Natal. We find that Mr. Maree, the Chairman of the Milk Board, says that the milk shortage is &#x201C;country-wide and is not confined to Natal&#x201D;. In Natal the position is that the tinned milk factories have to import powdered milk, that cheese has to be imported and that there is a shortage of butter there. And we are now only in the middle of May. We know that the lean months in Natal are July, August and September. I think that this also holds good for the Transvaal and for the Cape as well. Therefore under the control of the hon. the Minister it is a fact that the surpluses have disappeared but the farmers have disappeared with them.</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I want to urge the hon. member to consider what he is going to do at the next nomination. In Durban alone 127 milk producers and suppliers went out of business people who were no longer able to keep dairy cows and who left the business completely. I do not know what has become of them. But it struck me that in the course of a certain debate when the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) was speaking about the mines that are closing down, hon. members opposite said that there were more people in the cities than there ever were previously. This to my mind indicates where the farmers have gone. The farmers have left the platteland and the report on the depopulation of the rural areas outs it very clearly. This report was submitted three years ago. I do not know what they would say to-day because in the past year the number of farmers has decreased by 28,000 and these 127 that I have just mentioned are not anywhere near the number. The fact is simply that the rural areas are becoming blacker and blacker. And the hon. member who told us just now how well things are going with the farmers is one of the members who during the debate on the Vote of the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services told us about a large black spot of 100 miles wide in his constituency that had arisen during the past two or three years. I can tell him that this is the case throughout South Africa. What is the truth in connection with this matter? The truth is that this Government does not care what becomes of the farmer. The truth is that this Government wants the farmers to leave the platteland. As I said, this Government only helps when it can no longer avoid doing so. What good is it to give a man credit, along one channel, when he is on his knees? It merely means a change of creditor. It simply means that where previously he owed money to various persons, he now owes it to one person, to the State, but he still owes every penny of that money and he has to pay back every penny of that money. This to my mind is a terrible thing because our farmers are the most independent people in the country. We have always said that the farmers are the backbone of the country, the stable section of the country. In agriculture the tendency is for a man to develop a strong character because of the difficulties that he has to overcome&#x2014; droughts, insects, plague and so forth. All the conditions that he has to contend with result in his character being strengthened. Because of this we have a stable type of person on the platteland. But now we are losing all those stable people. They are being taken away and they are going to the cities and they are going unprepared. In a previous debate I asked what the hon. the Minister wanted them to do. Mention has been made of uneconomic farms. What does he want the uneconomic farmer to do? I pointed out at the time that the hon. the Prime Minister also sold his farm. Farming probably also became uneconomic for him. I added that on the salary that he was receiving at the moment he could at least put one Afrikaner on that farm and pay him a salary.</p>

We want to stop these people being brought to their knees. An important thing that will assist here will be for more market research to be done than is being done at the moment. I have here a paper called <i>Austral News,</i> which is issued by the Australian Trade Commissioner.

<p>While I was listening to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) I asked myself whether the Opposition was in earnest in putting forward this criticism. I cannot object strongly enough to the nonsensical statements made by that side of the House in regard to the position of the farmers. The hon. member for Drakensberg spoke for 40 minutes, and in that time she said absolutely nothing. If they were really in earnest in saying that things were going badly with the farmers in South Africa we would at least have had some constructive criticism from that side of the House. But to come here and to tell the Minister that farmers from Lydenburg asked the hon. member to ask the hon. the Prime Minister to do certain things simply shows that no notice is taken of her at places where she is not known. This certainly did not come from her own constituency. I want to say that the criticism of the Opposition in regard to farming is absolute nonsense and certainly does not redound to the credit of the farmers. When we say that things are going badly with the farmers, I want to emphasize that a prosperous farming community is the greatest asset that any country can have. That is why one becomes concerned when it is continually suggested that things are going badly with the farmers. All that we expect of the Opposition is that if they are really in earnest when they say that things are going badly with the farmers, they must suggest steps that can be taken to place the farmers on a sound economic basis.</p>

<p>If the day does come in South Africa when the farmer no longer has that honorary title, it will be to the great discredit of the farmers. But to keep the farmers going and to place them on a sound economic basis no remedies are required, The basis of any remedy for the farmers must be rehabilitation. That is why, when we discuss the economic position of the farmer to-day, it must be seen against this background. We must realize that farming in South Africa is no longer a way of life, but has become a competitive business. Our attitude must be that any farming undertaking must rest on a sound business basis and, to do this, it is necessary to consider certain economic laws. By this I mean that in the determination of the price of any product proper regard must be had firstly to supply and demand and, secondly, the producer must be allowed production costs with a reasonable profit margin. These requirements must be applied together and must form the nucleus of any policy that is applied. I say this because I want to make a contribution, a suggestion to place the farmer on a sound economic basis. I want to say immediately that the involved and unrealistic methods by means of which the production costs of some products, particularly maize and wheat, are estimated, do not comply with these requirements. On the contrary, in many respects they have the opposite effect. Our estimates of production costs are too artificial to my mind and in many respects serve as an incentive in the wrong direction. I want to take maize as an example, because it fits in with my farming pattern, and what I am going to say here also applies to any other branch of agriculture.</p>

<p>The basis on which we must work is this: As far as maize is concerned, we have become an export country and accordingly we must bear the export price in mind. As far as our internal market is concerned, the consumption has remained fairly constant and has not risen along with production. We must also take this factor into account. In the third place, the payability of maize is not determined by the price per bag, but by the profit per bag obtained by the producer. That is why maize farming must be regulated in such a way that the farmer produces at a price that is as close as possible to the export price. The internal price must simply be regulated to eliminate fluctuations and to supplement supplies when the crop falls short of expectations. The internal price must be kept within limits so as to encourage local consumption, particularly in regard to stock feeds. I make bold to say that it is possible to comply with these requirements without affecting the reasonable profit margin of the farmer. To this end it is necessary that we have the closest co-operation between the Government and the producer. This is a task that they must tackle together. The Government&#x2019;s contribution in this regard has been to set up the Marketing Act with the various control boards to ensure the orderly marketing of the various products and to avoid undesirable and detrimental price fluctuations. It has never been the function Of the control boards to assure the producer of a guaranteed price which cannot be justified on economic grounds. There is an obligation on the producer under the marketing system of the country, because he has certain basic rights that he wants to protect like a costly jewel, and because he wants to retain these rights, it is <span class="col_6597_6598" refersTo="page_0631"/>the duty of the producer in the first place to ensure that his investment is economic and realistic. It is unrealistic when the farmer pays fantastic prices for land or for hiring land. Secondly, it is necessary for the farmer to make use of his methods of production as advantageously as possible. Here I may mention the care of his implements, the judicious use of fertilizers and the preparation and conservation of the soil. It is also necessary for the farmer to make the fullest use of his labour and here I include, not only manual labour, but also mechanized labour, of which he must make the fullest use. This also includes the servicing of those machines. His investment in machines must also be judicious, because I have always considered it to be injudicious to purchase machinery costing thousands of rand which can only be used for a month or six weeks of the year. Those are the responsibilities of the farmer, and the State cannot interfere in this regard.</p>

<p>On the other hand the Government also has its duty towards the producer. The Government can ensure that means of production are made available as cheaply as possible, and this can be done in various ways. In many instances this may mean that the farmer has to be protected against himself. What the Government can do is to ensure that machines and implements are standardized to some extent. I know that this is a difficult task, but I cannot see why there should be dozens of types of plough-shares, because all ploughs can be adapted for the use of a certain type of share. If these shares can be manufactured in bulk, it must result in a considerable price reduction. [Time limit.]</p>

As a matter of interest, I see that powdered butter is now being developed in Australia. That is a new patent. I sincerely hope that, in the interests of the dairy industry it might be used in this country if it is a success, I want to suggest to the Minister that it is high time that his side of the House got rid of the idea that the United Party wants to damage or get rid of the Marketing Act. [Interjections.] This side does not want to get rid of the Marketing Act. It is this side of the House which put the Marketing Act on the Statute Book,</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker), and the hon. the Minister himself suggested that last year. He accused the United Party of wanting to get rid of the Marketing Act: But that fallacy must be exploded for all time. The methods we have adopted in this House have been to criticize the administration of the Marketing Act and its boards, and there is every justification for that and we shall continue to do so in order to attain a measure of stability. I want to say that those improvements can be effected if the Minister would apply his mind to the matter. These problems have to be solved in the interests of the economy of agriculture in South Africa. At this stage we have to try to remove the severe fluctuations that exist. I want to say to the Minister, by way of example, that he has misconstrued many of the addresses that have been made to him from this side of the House. I ask him to investigate the price spread between producer and consumer prices, a gap which is definitely too wide. I raised this matter last year, and what did the Minister reply to me? He said I wanted the boards to take over distribution. Sir, the Minister knows full well that the boards are the greatest wholesale distributors we have in the country to-day. They are the suppliers to the retailers, but the price spread between the wholesale price and the price the consumer has to pay runs up to 100 per cent. I mentioned the various commodities on a previous occasion. Products which realize 14c are sold at from 28c to 36c. It costs 100 per cent to distribute milk. All I ask is that an investigation be instituted to see whether it is necessary for them to get 100 per cent. If it is, tell us so; if it is not, we want something to be done about it.</p>

<p>I want to come to the question of levies which is agitating the mind of every farmer in South Africa who supplies products through a control board. After a period of some 30 years during which those boards have existed, we still have uncertainty as to what is required. We must be holding somewhere in the neighbourhood of R100.000.000 in control board reserve funds, buildings, etc. What further contribution is the Minister expecting from the present generation to assist posterity? You have the Wool Control Board, which controls about R24,000,000. When will that be enough? That is all I ask. Is it necessary for us to continue to accumulate these huge funds? For what purpose? With the funds they have got they have done an admirable job in giving a measure of stability. You have the Meat Control Board, which is sitting with some R11,000,000. Is that not enough? What is significant there is that when it had something like R6,000,000 the Minister allowed the levy to be raised to 140c. Why? Because in the last year they Have increased their reserves up to R11,000,000. Is that necessary? For what purposes are these huge sums being stored by the control boards? I also want to touch on mealies. There is possibly a. 30.000;000 bag surplus arid its export will require substantial funds, but as far as meat is concerned, I maintain that that R11,000000 does not give us the stability We require. Unfortunately we have the boards&#x2019; passing the buck. When we had a measure of Control under the permit system. <span class="col_6599_6600" refersTo="page_0632"/>the buck was passed on to the agents who are now expected to control the markets. The board could not do it itself with its agents, but now it is handed over to private enterprise, co-operative agents or private agents, and they are now called upon to control the market in the interest of stability. Surely that is an unsound practice. With that state of affairs existing, what right have we to accumulate R11,000,000 without being able to give that stability? I mentioned it last year, and I have to mention it again, that there is still a price spread between the floor price and the highest price received almost in successive days of 10c a lb. The Minister cannot deny it. I produced the documents for him last year when I showed that the price spread over two successive days was 15c up to 25c, for the same quality meat, and the same state of affairs exists to-day. Surely the time has arrived to combat that type of thing.</p>

<p>I want to say how grateful we are to the Mealie Control Board for the report it has submitted to us. There are three members of the Control Board here, including its chairman. Its technical adviser has made some very interesting observations, in which he has asked for an investigation into the greater use of maize to raise the standard and the quality of the meat produced in this country. Over and above that, there is the very pertinent suggestion that maize might be used to maintain stock at a level where it will not lose that 200 lb. to 400 lb. weight over the hard winter months. But in order to do that we must bring meat and maize into harmony. We will certainly produce a very much better quality beef and mutton if we did that. But I think that must come from the Minister, because a close investigation of that matter will make it possible for South Africa to produce a much higher quality beef which can compete reasonably overseas. I think the time has come for South Africa to send its beef, mutton and pork to market on the hoof, rather than have the enormous surpluses of mealies we are exporting overseas. It is important to the country that that should be done, and I sincerely hope the Minister will not tell me that South Africa will not absorb a higher quality meat. Our high quality meat represents only 35 per cent of the production, i.e. prime and first grade, and 65 per cent of the meat produced represents second-class, third-class and inferior meat. I think much could be done in this direction and I sincerely hope that the members of the Mealie Control Board sitting in this House will indicate to us the extent to which they will investigate the matter.

<p>When I was interrupted just now I was trying to show that in fixing the price of a product the factor of supply and demand must be considered and that the producer must be allowed his production costs plus a reasonable profit margin. I tried to show that the State and the farmer had certain obligations in this connection. I want to take this further and say that the State can do a great deal in connection with standardization. This is an important task and I do feel that we can succeed to a large extent by means of standardization if we give the co-operatives the right to retain the agencies for certain agricultural implements. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that agricultural co-operatives are given the agencies for certain agricultural implements but once they have popularized those implements amongst the farmers, the agencies are usually taken away from them and given to some other undertaking. If we make use of the co-operatives to popularize certain agricultural implements, we will be making great progress as far as standardization is concerned. I refuse to believe that there is a great difference between the various kinds of implements in the various areas. We can very easily popularize an implement by making use of the co-operatives in this regard.</p>

<p>As far as the conserving and fertilizing of soil is concerned the Government should give the farmer all the assistance possible. I have never been satisfied that it pays to push up the yield per morgen of any product by the application of excessive fertilizer because of the climatic risks that we run in this country. I am not convinced that the great expense incurred in increasing production is worth the trouble. The Government must ensure that the transport of produce, perishable products and particularly export produce is given effect to as efficiently and as quickly as possible. The export of maize particularly must be streamlined. Surpluses should be disposed of as soon as possible. In the report of the Maize Board one can see the amount of expense involved in storing and carrying over maize. By streamlining the transport of these products a great deal of money will be saved. Once we have done all this, when the State has fulfilled its obligations on the one hand and when the farmer has fulfilled his obligations on the other hand, we will be on the way towards placing farming in South Africa on an economic footing once again. That is why it is not only the responsibility of the farmer but also the responsibility of the State. When these two cooperate I believe that farming in South Africa will again be placed on an economic basis.</p>

<p>I want to come back to this question of the shortage of fresh milk in Natal and the prices paid for it, because this is not only important to the economy of the agricultural producer, but it has a very serious effect on the consuming public and on the economy of South Africa. I want to refer to the figures supplied by the Minister&#x2019;s own Department in reply to questions I asked earlier this year, to show him that this question has been coming forward year after year when this side of the House, and I in particular, have warned the Minister that the prices he has been gazetting for dairy produce have been unrealistic in relation to the cost of production over the years, and I accused this Minister with being the one responsible for the shortage of milk and dairy products in South Africa. I am quoting from headlines in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> <span class="col_6601_6602" refersTo="page_0633"/>and the <i>Daily News</i> of only the day before yesterday, which say: &#x201C;Milk shortage hits the province of Natal: Dairy farmers claim low prices force them out of business.&#x201D; I warned the Minister last year that whole dairy herds were being disposed of. There were dispersal sales and many of our good dairy cattle were going to the abattoirs and were not being purchased by other people to produce milk, but were being slaughtered, and beef stock was taking their place. The Medical Officer of Health says that for the first time in four years he had, on four days last week, to allow 1,000 gallons of fresh milk a day to come in from unregistered premises. He said that at the moment the milk coming in was from registered premises, but he did not know how long he could hold that position. [Interjections.] The Minister should give a reasonable price in relation to the cost of production and he should subsidize the price of stock-feed, but he allows the price of fodder to go up while fishmeal is being exported, so that the price goes up generally for everything the farmer needs, but he gets a lower price. We had a reduction of 2 cents a gallon for our condensed milk and cheese milk during the last 12 months, and that price was fixed by the Minister. Sir, the secretary of the Natal Fresh Milk Producers&#x2019; Association says that there are 127 fewer suppliers to Durban this year. Most of those 127 suppliers who were in the business, in most cases for many years, have stopped producing milk. Would they do that if they were making a profit? Sir, we have complained over and over again that this Minister in particular and the Government as a whole do not help the farmers and the dairy producers in relation to their cost of production. We had a notice last week stating that because of the fact that the overseas price has gone up, the price of molasses to those of us who use it as a dairy feed in Natal will go up as from Saturday next week. The price of meat has gone sky high: the price of fishmeal has gone up; the price of everything that we use in the production of milk is going sky high. The hon. the Minister cannot say that he has not been warned. Let us deal with the position over the last few years, according to figures provided by the Minister&#x2019;s own Department in reply to questions which I have asked in this House. In 1958 we imported 2,500,000 lb. of cheese, 2.750.000 lb. of condensed milk and 1,500,000 lb. of milk powder. We imported milk powder from various countries, cheese from New Zealand and condensed milk from the Netherlands. We also imported from various other countries. We imported in 1959, and each year I have raised this matter with the Minister. In 1960 we again imported but not quite to the same extent. Then in 1961 our price dropped, and I warned the Minister that with this drop of 2d. per lb. on butter-fat, the production would be tremendously affected. [Interjection.] We have not had a drought every year from 1958 to this year. In 1962 we imported over 1,000,000 lb. of New Zealand cheese alone and another 1,000.000 from other countries, We imported 1,500,000 lb. of dried milk as well as other dairy products. Whereas we were exporting huge quantities and earning exchange &#x2014;last year I went in some detail into the amounts that we were exporting during the &#x2019;fifties when we were exporting huge quantities of cheese and dried milk&#x2014;to-day we find that we have to import these commodities. We as producers are called upon to launch a campaign to advertise cheese and inviting people to eat more cheese; I opened a Cheese Week only last July in Durban, where we gave away free cheese and gave away wine so as to encourage people to eat more cheese, and within one week what were we doing in Maritzburg? We could not buy South African cheese. We had to buy New Zealand cheese. What did we do in this very city only a couple of weeks ago? We had a cheese and wine night at Goodwood where we offered free cheese and free wine. But what is the position to-day? Go and try to buy South African cheese in Long Street. You will find that you can only get New Zealand cheese. I have complained year in and year out about this. The producer in this country does everything in his power to encourage the consumption of our cheese, and then we find that our people have to consume cheese from other countries. Sir, I ask the Minister what he is doing to rectify the position; is he going to give back to the producer of cheese this 2d. per gallon on milk? Is he going to be realistic? If he tries to use the excuse that there has been a drought, is this Government going to help the farmer who has been hit by drought? The farmer does not ask for anything free; all he asks for is reasonable help under difficult conditions. But even those farmers who have not been hit by the drought are in a precarious position. In my own area I have not suffered a drought but I know that I have not made one bean out of milk in the last five years. I am not producing fresh milk to-day; I am producing industrial milk&#x2014;butterfat&#x2014;and I do not make one penny out of it. I am not making one bean out of my cows to-day. I think the average farmer in the milk areas in Natal to-day is not making one bean out of either fresh milk or industrial milk. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>A great deal has been said and written about farming and agricultural problems in South Africa. Commissions have also been appointed from time to time to investigate, amongst other things, the depopulation of the platteland, but I do think that one of the most important causes of these agricultural and farming problems, including the depopulation of the platteland, is the high land prices that we have to pay in South Africa. The prices of all agricultural products are practically uneconomic to-day as a result of the unduly high land prices. An increase in the prices of agricultural products is of no assistance because as soon as the prices of agricultural products are increased, the price of land rises and one is back again exactly where one started, particularly in regard to the young man who wants to start farming. The price of an average grain farm to-day&#x2014; <span class="col_6603_6604" refersTo="page_0634"/>I do not say that it is the average price&#x2014;the price of an average grain farm, not even a good grain farm, is in the neighbourhood of R100 per morgen or more. On the other hand for the purposes of the determination of wheat and other prices, the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing fixes the price of a morgen of land at R74. They think that that is an economic price. Here immediately we see the difference between what the Department and the Minister consider to be an economic price and the ruling market price. The same holds good for land in the cattle areas, those areas that are situated in the dry parts of South Africa. The old farmers always argued that sheep and land prices corresponded in the animal husbandry areas&#x2014;that one would pay for a morgen of land what one pays for a sheep. If the market price of the sheep was R2 then in those days they did not pay more than R2 for a morgen of land. They argued that this was the only way to make sure that they could farm economically and I think that that is the only way. What is the position to-day? A man can buy land to-day but even in the drought-stricken areas he has to pay R16 per morgen and if he is not willing to pay that price he simply cannot buy land. The average price for a sheep in those parts is R7. One sees immediately how the high price of land pushes up the price of sheep. I do not think that there is anything wrong with the present price of sheep. On the contrary, R7 is a very high price. The farmers will tell you that it does not pay and it does not pay for one reason only and that is that the farmers have to pay too much for land. But this does not only apply to agricultural land; it also applies to building sites. The position to-day in this sprawling country of ours is that we have to pay R2,000 or more for a piece of land the size of a crypt. In earlier times people used to use a piece of land, land for which we pay R2,000 to-day, as a crypt. Mr. Chairman, I think that land speculation is wrong. There should be no such thing as land speculation. That land belongs to the country and to all the people. In South Africa we have the position to-day that it is only the State through the Department of Lands that can assist young men who want to take up farming. It is only the State that makes land available cheaply to young men who want to start farming. Otherwise it is absolutely impossible for a young man to start farming unless he has inherited a farm. If he has to buy that farm it is uneconomic because the rate of interest that he has to pay is so high that no matter what the price may be that he receives for his products, he simply cannot make ends meet. It is said&#x2014;and this is the generally accepted thing in South Africa&#x2014;that people who make a lot of money buy land in order to avoid paying income-tax, and I think that this is one of the reasons why land prices in South Africa are so high. There was a time when the profit on land sales was taxable for income-tax purposes. I think this was responsible for the fact that there was no land speculation in those days and I want to make an earnest appeal this morning to the hon. the Minister and his Department to find a practical solution to this question of rising land prices in South Africa. I am convinced that farming in South Africa will only be placed on a sound basis once again&#x2014;there are other methods as well but this is the most important one&#x2014;if we do something to combat these ever-increasing land prices which are getting completely out of hand.</p>

<speech by="#dodds">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DODDS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the Committee to what I regard as a very serious matter and that is the high cost which our producers have to bear in connection with the packing of their products. I refer, of course, to all the jute products in this country. I recently had occasion to address the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services on the question of fibre production. The Minister then gave us a very full reply and one which, if we could accept it and if he himself was satisfied with it, might offer a little hope for the future, but I quite frankly feel that what he has told us has been contradicted by information supplied by the Department of Economic Affairs. In a statement recently made by the secretary and which appears in the Report of the Public Accounts Select Committee, he indicated that they had got so far that they anticipated producing 2,500 tons of fibre next year whereas our requirements, as you know, Sir, amount to some 50,000. What we have to realize and appreciate is that in spite of all the efforts which have been made over many years now, we have only got to the stage where we can meet about 4 per cent of the country&#x2019;s needs. I think 4 per cent of our requirements is actually being manufactured. We also have this position which is clearly set out in this report to which I have referred, that the locally produced fibre cannot be used unless it is mixed with jute. On the basis of a 50-50 mixture therefore we still have to import jute, so one can quite realize that the bulk of our requirements in jute products is still being imported. In fact all your grain bags and all your wool sacks which are being manufactured here to-day, are naturally manufactured of imported jute. In this regard I just want to say that we might well bear in mind that Pakistan is certainly not going to be prepared indefinitely to continue selling raw jute to us in an unmanufactured state. They have already commenced to impose extra duties on it. If you look at the matter from their point of view, why should they not look after their own people and get the services completed in their own country? All this is adding to the costs of the goods which we manufacture from imported jute. While I am on that aspect, I think the time has come when this position will have to be gone into very carefully indeed. I would not be surprised if within a year or two we found that we have to scrap all ideas of fibre production locally because other methods of packing which are already being introduced indicate that more suitable fibres are being found. We will find ourselves in the position that not only will <span class="col_6605_6606" refersTo="page_0635"/>we have these two mills which we have kept going here, but we might find that we have a tremendous development in fibre production which will be of no value to the country. I feel therefore that it is essential that this position be properly investigated before we allow it to get out of hand.</p>

<p>Sir, unfortunately time is short and one has to hurry over these things, but I think we have arrived at the stage where the actual results which have been made available reveal a shocking position with regard to the losses the farmers have had to carry over the last four or five years. You have been on a basis where you import raw jute and give mills the opportunity to manufacture wool packs and grain bags for you. Incidentally, we still have jute control. In the case of grain bags we find it impossible to get the exact prices of the imported goods. Jute control is useless at this stage. It is of no value at all except possibly to guide the position as far as the locally manufactured article is concerned, but it is absolutely useless and I think the time has come when it should be abolished. It simply means extra cost. If you abolish jute control, then all wool packs and grain bags could be imported freely into this country, with a resultant big saving to producers. Let me just tell you. Sir, that during the years 1958 to 1962 we imported 87,000,000 grain bags as against 68,000,000 manufactured locally. On the locally manufactured bags, taken at a fairly moderate price&#x2014;I am sure that my prices are very low &#x2014;the farmer has already lost well over R10,000,0000. These are carefully prepared figures, and I can assure you, Sir, that if you include all the other grain bags which are used for various purposes, the figure might well be as high as R15,000,000 to R20,000,000 over this period. I base this on the actual figures of grain bags supplied to me by the Department of Economic Affairs. Well, how do we expect the farming community to progress and prosper when they are handicapped in this way? For what reason is this being done? Is it a type of insurance? If it is a type of insurance then I can only say that the farmers have to pay an enormous premium. Earlier in this debate the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbie) who has at last become interested in this matter, pleaded for the cost of grain bags to be reduced, but I would like him to investigate the position so that he can substantiate his plea. He spoke about the subsidy that the farmers received. Well, I do not know who subsidizes whom because here you have the farmers subsidizing the mills at a tremendous cost. Sir, I have just touched on the position with regard to grain bags. Let us see what the position is with regard to wool packs. Here the position, of course, is clear; here I have been able to get all the information. I find that during 1959-60 the loss to the wool farmer was R373,000; in 1960-1 R241,000, in 1961-2 R357,000, and if you add the estimated loss for 1962-3 it means that over this period of four years the farmer has lost R1,271,000.</p>

<p>Sir, can the Minister tell us exactly why this should be so?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>You are making a mistake. The price of the bag is taken into account in fixing the farmer&#x2019;s price.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#dodds">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DODDS</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about wool packs now, and I would like the hon. member to know that I am not talking light-heartedly over this; the figures which I have given here can be substantiated. The wool packs which are manufactured in South Africa cost you 70 cents more than the packs which you import. For what reason do you carry on? Can the Minister give us any reason? This is a large amount of money which is taken out of our economy. In the first place it is coming out of the pockets of the farmers. You could reduce the farmers&#x2019; cost of production, which would mean that the consumer would get the benefit of lower prices. I think we have reached a shocking state of affairs, and I do think it is time that the Minister instituted a proper inquiry and made it clear to the House what is at the back of all this. Is there any reason why we should keep mills going for that specific job? What are we afraid of? If we are carrying on because of fear, there is no justification for it. I do not know whether this falls under this Minister because we have three Ministers to deal with in this matter, but the point is that this Minister is responsible for marketing, and if he is responsible for marketing, then he has to put clothing around the product he markets. As I have said earlier, this particular aspect of the development with regard to jute goods in this country is not only hitting the farmers but every industry in the country using jute goods. The progress that is being made in fibre production in this country is so limited that I do think the time has arrived when we should abandon this effort and try other avenues to produce the fibres which are required to meet the needs of this country. We can certainly never go on in this way and call upon the farmers of this country to pay these enormous sums of money every year to keep the mills going.</p>

<p>I again appeal to the Minister to look at this matter in its true light. There is no justification for carrying on in the way in which we are carrying on to-day. We are simply marking up the costs of these products from year to year with no immediate prospect of solving the problem in regard to the production of fibres.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to discuss two aspects of farming. The first deals with the distribution difficulties of the farmer and the second with his production problems. I want to start with the farmers&#x2019; distribution problems and I want to link this up with the question of maize in South Africa. At the moment a higher maize price is being paid than was paid last year. The price is R2.87 per bag. The farmers, of course, are satisfied with the determination of that price and I want to state that <span class="col_6607_6608" refersTo="page_0636"/>here as a fact. But if anybody contends that this increase in the maize price this year has solved the problems of the maize farmers, then he does not know what he is talking about. In my opinion, this only affords temporary relief, and it is a matter to which we will have to give our serious attention in the future. We must not make jokes about it as the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) did this morning. This is a serious matter and I think we must concentrate our attention on the distribution of maize in South Africa. In considering this matter, we realize that it is essential to see whether we cannot find a bigger internal market for our maize. If we can do so, then I think we will be able to overcome our problems to a large extent. We have our Maize Board and I want this morning to put forward a few points of criticism of the Maize Board. I am not criticizing the hon. the Minister because I do not think that this criticism can be laid at his door. But I think I must say a few words in connection with the Maize Board. When we start with the distribution problems, the first problem is that the cost of distribution is so high. The middleman must be eliminated. We find to-day that the Maize Board itself is the big middleman because maize can only be bought through its agents. I do not think that in saying that I am saying too much. I want to ask that far more serious attention be given to the idea of a floor price for maize.</p>

<p>The hon. member can say, &#x201C;Oh!&#x201D; I know that any member of the Maize Board will immediately say, &#x201C;Oh!&#x201D; because apparently the Maize Board is a complete stranger to that idea. Mention is only made of it in passing in their report but they have never investigated the matter thoroughly. I expected them to investigate the matter very thoroughly. Let me put the position in this way: Let us imagine that we have a floor price of R2.80 per bag for maize and that the farmer sells his maize at R2.80 direct to another producer who needs the maize to feed his sheep. We will then eliminate distribution costs to a large extent and I do not see why this cannot be done. The storage costs and the handling costs can then be eliminated to a large extent. Let me mention an example. A maize farmer at Heilbron receives R2.80 for his product but if that producer at Heilbron wants to sell the maize to his neighbour, his neighbour has to pay R3.60 for it. He has to buy it from the agent of the Maize Board. There is a difference of almost 80c in the price that he has to pay although the maize could simply have been transported from the one farm to the other without incurring those additional expenses. In other words, the maize farmer to-day is paying for the storage and handling of the entire maize crop throughout the country.</p>

<p>Yes, the Government pays for it; I am quite aware of that fact but the consumer also pays for it. The consumer is only subsidized to the extent of 35c, not the full amount of the difference. [Interjection.] The hon. member who is a member of the Maize Board can argue with me about it in a moment. Let me first put my point. I want to put it because it is necessary that this should be said sooner or later. As maize farmers we cannot afford to keep the Maize Board&#x2019;s agents going artificially. I feel that an investigation should be made into this matter and that other methods should also be investigated. Is the Maize Board not too attached to the present system? That is all I want to ask. If it says that it is not and that it has tried other methods, then I shall be satisfied. They must tell us whether they have tried other methods. I simply say that there are other possible methods that have not yet been tried and that is what I want to advocate here this morning. In the past the Government subsidized yellow maize by 50c. This amount will now be smaller, of course. But let us take the 35c subsidy that the Government pays on white maize. That subsidy can be used to cover export losses if we have a floor price of say R2.80. The subsidies which are now being paid for internal consumption can be used to cover the loss on the sale of maize abroad and then we will be able to buy our maize at the floor price far more cheaply in this country. This will stimulate the consumption of maize abroad. At the moment it is not being stimulated. The price of maize to the local consumers is too high, Mr. Chairman. In spite of that 35c subsidy it is still too high in this country. The price that the producer receives and the price that the consumer pays must, as far as the internal market is concerned, be brought closer to one another. Ways and means should be found to bring this about. I want to ask that the Maize Board should investigate this matter. I gain the impression from their report that they have not investigated this aspect very thoroughly.</p>

<p>We also had meat control. It was in a chaotic state and we then introduced the system of floor prices. I do not say that we have solved the meat problem, far from it. There are still many problems in connection with the distribution of meat but we can at least say that the position has been improved since that system was introduced. I want to ask in all earnestness that this matter be investigated. The Maize Board should investigate the question of the distribution of maize on the local market. We should find a bigger internal market for our maize. Let me take the kaffir-corn farmers as an example. They have a floor price. They produce nearly 3,500,000 bags per annum. The local consumption is only about 2,000,000 bags; that is to say, almost half of the kaffir-corn crop is marketed locally at a floor price. Since a floor price was introduced for kaffir-corn we have not had any complaints from the kaffir-corn farmers; they are very satisfied with the position as it is <span class="col_6609_6610" refersTo="page_0637"/>to-day. I want to know whether that system has also been investigated as far as maize is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in connection with the costs of production. I want to put this question to the hon. the Minister. Is there proper co-ordination between his Department and the Department of Commerce and Industries? I ask this because I have had to deal with a few matters when I was convinced that one Department did not always know what the other was doing. An hon. member raised the question of the jute industry a moment ago. I take it that there is the necessary co-ordination in this regard between the two Departments. But then there is the question of artificial fertilizer that I have repeatedly mentioned in this House. Last year we could not import nitrogen into South Africa because the Department of Commerce and Industries said that we were manufacturing all the nitrogent that we needed here and the price of nitrogen was fixed accordingly. This year the manufacturers of nitrogen are producing that nitrogen in a form which enables them to export all of it and they have told the Department of Commerce and Industries to start importing once again. I want to know whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is aware of the fact that nitrogen can again be imported into South Africa. And since nitrogen is going to be imported into this country again, is the hon. the Minister aware of the fact that nitrogen prices abroad have fallen considerably and that nitrogen can now be sold more cheaply in South Africa? [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As we live in times of agricultural surpluses I believe that insufficient attention is being given to the encouragement of the production of those crops for which there is still a steady market within South Africa. That is to say, Sir, that I believe more attention should be given to the solving of the problem of surpluses by making it more attractive and more remunerative for farmers to grow those crops which we still have to import. The one I should like to deal with in particular is cotton. We import a considerable quantity of raw cotton into this country because we are not growing enough, yet there are large areas of the country which are suitable for the production of cotton provided a realistic price is paid to the grower. The figures for the last four years are these: In 1959 we imported 44,000 odd bales of 500 lb.; in 1960, 76,000; in 1961, 117,000; and in 1962 approximately 120,000. That is a great deal that we have to import from abroad. These imports come chiefly from the United States and Brazil. The interesting thing about this is that the quality of the imported cotton is below the quality of the cotton produced in South Africa. If this is a product which can be produced here&#x2014;and there is no doubt that there are large areas of the country including my own constituency where this product can be grown successfully provided the price is right and steady&#x2014;it seems quite wrong that all this exchange should be spent abroad when the stuff can be grown here. The point will no doubt be raised that the textile manufacturers require a great variety of ranges of cotton and that all those types cannot successfully be grown in this country. That is true, Sir, but we can grow a great many of the varieties which are presently being imported in large quantities. The production in South Africa for the equivalent period, as I have just mentioned, is as follows: In 1959, 34,000 bales; in 1960, 22,000 bales; in 1961, 22,000 bales and 1962, 28,000 bales approximately. After 1959 there was an actual drop in the production with an increase last year, an increase which is no doubt related to the restrictions on the growing of sugar because many sugar farmers switched temporarily to cotton to overcome those restrictions. Here you have a situation where a crop can profitably be indulged in by farmers provided the price is right. At the beginning of the picking season this year cotton farmers expected a drop of about 7 per cent in the price; a drop of &#x00BD;c per lb. It can be grown successfully in South Africa but as the question of insecticide is important because to grow cotton successfully you have to use a great deal of insecticide which means that a man engaging in cotton production has not only the ordinary expenses connected with tractors, implements and labour which become higher year by year, but he has the expense of having to use a large quantity of insecticide. If, say, a year in advance of the picking of the crop a farmer could be sure that he would get a guaranteed minimum price, which I suggest should not be less than 8c, there would be a large-scale increase in production of raw cotton in South Africa and we would not have to import the hundreds and thousands of bales which the textile manufacturers require. The amount imported goes up year by year whereas the production in South Africa, apart from the year 1962, has remained almost static. It cannot be said that the slight increase such as I have suggested would have any material effect on the cost of cotton textile goods because the price to the farmer for the raw material forms a very small percentage of the total cost of production of a shirt, for instance. That is clearly understood, Sir, if one bears in mind that a shirt weighs less than 1 lb., whereas the increase that is suggested to the farmer is of the order of 1c per lb. of raw cotton. It is quite clear that a slight increase to the farmer will bring about benefits which will enable a large-scale expansion of the production of this crop as a farming crop, whereas that small benefit by way of increase in raw cotton has very little effect indeed on the cost of production from the manufacturers&#x2019; point of view of cotton goods. An increase such as I have suggested will mean an increase to the farmer of R5 to R10 per acre which, of course, is calculated on a crop of one or two bales per acre. That is most material; it makes it worth while from the farmer&#x2019;s point of view. I stress that in the nature of things that increase which is worth while to the farmer is negligible as far as the cost of production of the manufacturer is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="col_6611_6612" refersTo="page_0638"/>I believe that this is something which would bear investigation by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department. He may find himself, in this instance at least, in the happy position where he is able to satisfy the farming community by stabilizing their income from this source and where he will satisfy the hon. the Minister of Finance because a great deal will be saved in foreign exchange mainly with hard-currency countries, and he will not have deputations from the textile manufacturers waiting on his doorstep because that increase to the farmer will be minimal so far as the increase in the cost of production to the manufacturer is concerned.</p>

<p>To sum up, I believe there should be a guaranteed minimum price of something of the order of 8c, perhaps a little more, to the farmer. If that were to be done, and the price is guaranteed 12 months ahead, you would have the expansion of cotton production amongst the farming community which is desirable and the hon. the Minister would have available an alternative crop which could profitably be grown in many parts of the country as an alternative to some of the crops which are presently in over-supply.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I think I must reply to a few of the points raised by hon. members. I want to start with the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) who was the first speaker on the Opposition side. When that hon. member speaks one gains the impression that she is not really very interested in the economic position of the farmers or the advancement of their interests, because the hon. member simply makes wild statements. She does not look so wild to me but I have often wondered why she makes such wild statements. The hon. member made statements that were completely devoid of all truth. She alleged that I had said last year that the price of wheat had been reduced because less wheat had been produced than in the previous year.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I said that production costs were reduced.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>No, that was not what the hon. member said. The hon. member does not know herself what she said but I do resent that fact. She actually said here that I alleged last year that the price of wheat was reduced because the production of wheat had dropped. I said that it was untrue and then the hon. member said that it was true. I think that under these circumstances one cannot take too much notice of the representations made by the hon. member for Drakensberg or of the statements that she makes. She quoted from a newspaper in regard to what happens in Australia as far as the promotion of the marketing of their products in other parts of the world is concerned. She then suggested that nothing was being done in South Africa to sell our products in the rest of the world. But the hon. member must remember that this is something that I have said on various occasions. On the one hand the hon. member is annoyed with the Government and the Department because agricultural prices are not fixed in such a way that all the farmers are able to stay on the land. In the same breath she resents the fact that prices are not such that our farmers are able to compete with other countries in the world. I have repeatedly said that if we want to build up a sound agricultural industry here and if we want to be in a position to compete with other countries in the world in regard to that part of our production that we have to export, then we must produce in such a way that we can compete. There are reasons why Australia is better able to compete than we are. The hon. member referred to the export of cheese and butter from Australia to other countries which are close to Australia. But the hon. member did not want to tell us at what price these products were being exported. We know that Australia can deliver butter to this country and to our neighbouring territories at prices lower than our local price. We know that Australian mutton can be delivered in South Africa at a price which is considerably lower than our internal mutton price. It is in this connection precisely that we have to educate our farmers and regulate our economic position in such a way that if we want to compete on the export market we can do so at a price that is competitive. It does not help to keep prices artificially high internally without having a market for one&#x2019;s product. Or does the hon. member expect the Government to fix a guaranteed local price for every product that can be exported? Does she expect the Government to pay the difference in price by way of a subsidy if that price cannot be obtained abroad? If that is what hon. members opposite expect then they must say so openly. That is why we say that we must keep our internal prices on a reasonable basis in respect of products the prices of which are fixed. But if we want to develop foreign markets, then we must get our farmers to produce at a price which will enable them to compete.</p>

<p>Another wild statement made by the hon. member was that we should see what is happening to the farmers in other countries. She said that in this country the farmers were being driven from the platteland. She mentioned a figure but I do not know where she got it from. She said that the farmers were disappearing from the farms and she asked why the Minister did not give attention to what was happening to the farmers in other countries; why the Minister did not go to America to see what was being done there. But in the European countries and more specifically in America, the Government is following a specific policy. It is their policy to encourage people to leave the rural areas. That is the policy in Holland and also in most European countries. That is also the policy in Germany to which the hon. member referred. Their policy is specifically to have <span class="col_6613_6614" refersTo="page_0639"/>fewer people in the rural areas. If she looks at the official policy of the American Government she will see that in the next few years they are going to try to remove 100,000 farmers from their farms. And then the hon. member says that we should see what they are doing; that we should do what they are doing! In the same breath she accuses the Government of being responsible for the depopulation of the rural areas. I cannot understand what the hon. member wants. The hon. member says that the Government is doing nothing to reduce production costs. She says that all that the Government does is to wait until the farmers are in a position where they can no longer help themselves before it takes action; only then does the Government help the farmers. That is a stupid statement. How can we wait until the farmers can no longer help themselves before we help them? Where climatic conditions and other conditions have placed the farmers in difficult circumstances, the Government has always assisted them. I do not want to mention the figures again. The hon. member says that the particular assistance that is given to farmers under those conditions is in the form of loans and that the farmers have to repay those loans. Does the hon. member want the farmers to be given that money? If the United Party comes into power is it going to give that money to the farmers? [Interjections.] The hon. member says that I must not talk nonsense but the impression created by the hon. member is that she is criticizing the Government because it lends these people money. She asked what was the good of making loans to the farmers because they had to repay those loans. That is the impression that is given to the outside world. I know that the hon. member did not mean it in that way and that the United Party would not resort to such action, but the hon. member wants to give the outside world the impression that the assistance that this Government gives to the farmers means nothing and that if the United Party had been in power they would have assisted the farmers in another way. That is the impression that she wants to create. Let them tell me what this other method is. Would they have given that money to the farmers under the same circumstances? [Interjections.] Do you see, Mr. Chairman, that is precisely what we have to deal with. When I ask the hon. member what she means she shrugs her shoulders and, just like a woman, says &#x201C;perhaps She says nothing is being done to keep production costs down. But that is not true; and the hon. member knows that it is not true.</p>

I take it that she not only read that portion which it suited her to read, but that she also read further and, if she did, she would have seen that the subsidy in respect of artificial fertilizer amounted to R2,693,000 in 1961-2. The railway rebate on artificial fertilizer alone was R3,631,000, and that is paid by the Government. The rebates in respect of the transport of stock alone amounted to R852,000 last year. Last year the rebates on stock feed were not so high, but during the previous year they amounted to R547.000. Last year the amount was R158,000. I do not want to mention all the other figures.

<p>All those figures appear in the report; the hon. member can look them up herself. I do not want to weary the House with those figures. The hon. member knows what the most important reason was for those loans. She knows what the special circumstances were in parts of the country which gave rise to this position. She knows it just as well as I do, but she tries to create the impression that the farmers who are assisted by the Government are not assisted because particular circumstances have placed them in that position, but because the Government has not ensured that the farmers receive good prices for their products. But in the same breath the hon. member attacks me and says that maize prices are so high that the stock farmer cannot afford to feed his stock on maize.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) said it. Another accusation that was made was this: It was my fault that there was a shortage of cheese this year and that we had to import cheese. This shortage was due to the drop in price. We all know what our production of dairy products was last year. We all know that at the end of 1961 we had a tremendous surplus of butter which we could not sell. We all know that quotas were fixed on the markets on which <span class="col_6615_6616" refersTo="page_0640"/>we normally sell these products because there was a universal surplus. We know that the storage costs of that butter were very high indeed. We were also saddled with a surplus of cheese. We then started a special campaign to encourage the consumption of more cheese. The hon. member referred to this, and then she asked what was the good of starting a campaign to encourage the consumption of cheese when we had no cheese. But that is not so, Mr. Chairman. The consumption of cheese increased considerably. It increased by millions of pounds because of that campaign. The small amount of cheese that is now being imported is being imported to supply the public with the product which they have become accustomed to using. Of course, the hon. member would not understand that. I want to put this question to her: If we have a shortage of a product to which the public have become accustomed, must we not ensure that they continue to get that product? The hon. member says that the milk and cheese production dropped&#x2014;she mentioned Natal particularly&#x2014; because prices were lowered. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) associated himself with that remark. But the price for fresh milk in Natal has never been reduced.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>Or increased.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>They are so afraid of an increase that they are keeping it on a strict quota basis. No farmer can enter the market in Natal and produce fresh milk unless he pays R5,000 to be able to produce 100 gallons of milk. And that is being done voluntarily by the Natal farmers together with their distributors. If there is such a shortage of fresh milk in Natal, let us do away then with the quota system. I also want to put this question to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District). He said that there was not sufficient milk in Natal. Will he rise now and advocate the removal of the quota system in Natal and say that every farmer should be permitted to produce fresh milk? I want the hon. member to be honest. He says that there is a shortage of fresh milk in Natal, but at the same time those companies which supply milk in Natal adhere to a quota system for milk. The farmer has to pay a considerable amount to obtain a quota by producing at a low price over a long period. If the hon. member is really concerned about the position in Natal, is he prepared to stand up here and to say that the quota system must be done away with? Is he prepared to do that? If he is not prepared to do so, then his questions are not honest, or he is at least being unfair. Is the hon. member prepared to say that the quota system should be abolished? Hon. members must not talk if they do not want to answer such a simple question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) raised a few important matters to which I want to reply. The hon. member said that I had apparently maintained that the United Party wanted the Marketing Act repealed. That was not what I said. I say that the Marketing Act is sometimes wrongly interpreted by some members and allegations are made on the basis of things that are not contained in the Act at all. Nowhere in the Marketing Act is it provided that the price of a product must be determined on production costs plus a certain profit. Nowhere in the Act is that provided. The purpose of the Marketing Act is to stabilize prices as far as possible and implicit in this is the fact that the producer has a say as far as the marketing of his product is concerned. But nowhere in the Act is there a provision that a price will always remain at a certain level plus a certain profit. One cannot give an undertaking of this nature because one can never determine what the precise production costs of products are going to be as far as the various farmers are concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about meat and the reserve funds of the various boards. He asked what the policy was and to what extent those funds should be built up by way of levies. I just want to tell the hon. member that the usual practice is for the levy fund to be built up until one is reasonably sure that no matter what sort of problem may arise in connection with the marketing of the product and bearing in mind the fact that one regularly has to export a large percentage of that product, the fund will be adequate to withstand a reasonable shock for a certain period. The hon. member mentioned two products particularly&#x2014; wool and meat. As has been said on various occasions, the position is that as far as the Wool Fund is concerned, it enables one to stabilize the market temporarily but if there was a continual drop in wool prices, this fund would not be able to do much in that regard and one would have to follow the world price. But the fund can be used&#x2014;as it has been used in the past&#x2014;to absorb a between season fluctuation and to maintain some measure of stability. In order to do this one needs a fairly strong fund. But I am also beginning to feel that particularly in respect of the marketing of our wool, advertising and research have become even more important now than was the case in the past. One asks oneself whether it is necessary for the stabilization fund to continue to be built up to the same extent annually or whether one should not use a portion of the fund for advertising and research, particularly for advertising in connection with the sale of wool. We are considering this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the possibility of the export of meat and obtaining the co-operation of the various boards to see whether we cannot make more use of our maize to produce meat, particularly for the export market. This is of course also a matter that is considered by the boards from time to time. The problem of course is that the maize prices are so high that it actually does not pay one at this stage to convert a large amount of maize into meat and then to try to sell the meat because at this stage the meat that is <span class="col_6617_6618" refersTo="page_0641"/>being exported does not fetch such high prices. But at the request of the Meat Board discussions are taking place at the moment between the Maize Control Board and the Meat Board to see whether it is not possible to find a scheme by means of which more use can be made of maize for cattle fodder and its resultant conversion into meat. I want to tell the hon. member that we have also permitted the Meat Board to export certain super grade meat on a contractual basis with farmers at a fixed guaranteed price here locally so as to test the overseas&#x2019; market for super grade beef to see to what extent we can export such meat and to what extent a loss may perhaps be incurred on the meat. But we feel generally that it is doubtful whether we in South Africa should concentrate on selling only our best meat overseas. Our experience with the export of boneless beef has taught us that we can export that type of beef at competitive prices if we buy it up here at floor prices. Experience has taught us that we can compete with other exporters to Europe. That is why I feel that we should rather concentrate on that sort of meat. By concentrating solely on the super grade young beef carcasses for export and trying to make that grade of meat our most important meat export product, we will find that because of the long distances that have be covered, because of shipping and refrigeration expenses, we will not be able to compete with countries in Europe producing the same kind of product, a product that they have to transport only a very short distance at little expense. In any case we cannot deliver the meat there in the same condition as those other countries which compete with us.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Welkom (Mr. H. J. van Wyk) and the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) raised a few points to which I want to reply. They spoke about the system of the sale of maize in South Africa as it is being applied now and they asked whether the time had not come for us to review our internal marketing system for maize. I just want to say that the Maize Board has a committee at the moment under the chairmanship of one of the Marketing Board members and this committee is inquiring into the whole question of the marketing of maize. It will also report on marketing schemes as it is at present. I do not want to say anything further at this stage. This is a step that has also been taken in pursuance of the overseas mission and the experience gained there. In pursuance of this they will now make this further inquiry and then submit recommendations. It is possible that a change will be effected in the marketing method but I do not want to anticipate the committee&#x2019;s findings at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central) (Mr. Dodds) spoke about the bag industry and the import of jute to manufacture our own bags in this country. Of course, the hon. member knows the history of the manufacture of bags in our country. He knows that we may have boycotts imposed against us and for that reason we want to have our own bag industry here, also having regard to the possibility of increasing the internal production of certain fibres. It is of course very difficult to start from scratch any industry which has to face competition. It costs money and initially losses are usually incurred. Of course the hon. member also realizes that this aspect falls more appropriately under the Department of the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. But we all realize that it is desirable for us to build up our own local bag industry. We are gradually starting to produce more fibres in South Africa from which we will eventually be able to make bags. I want to tell the hon. member that research is taking place on a wide front in an endeavour to manufacture all sorts of containers that we need in this country on a cheaper basis in order to enable us to handle our products. The Government has made large amounts available on two occasions for the building of large sheds, and there are parts of our country where the bulk handling of grain has already made considerable progress. I think for example of that part of the country that I come from&#x2014;the Bredasdorp district&#x2014;where the wheat co-operative as far as wheat is concerned is fully organized for the bulk handling of this product. All its grain, all its wheat is handled in bulk to-day and many of the farmers are also able to undertake bulk handling from their farms to the receiving depot. The hon. member will also know that the Maize Board has also taken over the grain elevators from the Railways, and this will also improve the position. I think that the time will come when we will be able to handle the steadily increasing quantities of maize and wheat in bulk in which case many of our problems in connection with bags will be eliminated. There are of course other products which will still have to be sold in bales but the hon. member knows that research is also being done to discover whether we cannot manufacture bags more cheaply.</p>

<p>I want to come now to what was said by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman). He spoke about alternative crops that can be cultivated to assist those parts which produce products of which there is a surplus production. Of course he had cotton in mind. We are all aware that this is one of the products that can be cultivated on a large scale in South Africa. The Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing has on various occasions had discussions and entered into agreements with the manufacturers of cotton and started schemes in terms of which the producers have received a higher price than the world price. Another agreement of this nature was again entered into this year in terms of which a higher price will be paid to our local producers than is paid on the world market. But I want to point out to the hon. member that cotton is one of the products that also has to compete as a manufactured product. Once our factories have manufactured the cotton goods, they have to rely to a large extent upon the export market and they have to be able to compete there. If the manufacturer <span class="col_6619_6620" refersTo="page_0642"/>pays too much for the cotton and the producer receives too much protection as far as the local product is concerned then the manufacturer cannot compete with other countries abroad. No matter how much one wants to fix a price which will promote maximum production, one still has the problem that one cannot make that price too high because then the price of the finished product is not competitive. That is why there is a ceiling governing the price. Research is also done from time to time in order to increase the production of cotton per morgen and we hope in this way to be able to give the farmers the opportunity to produce cotton at a price that will be able to compete with the world price. Another problem is also that much of our cotton, as the hon. member himself said, is of such a good quality that having regard to the clothing that they make the factories cannot pay the high price for that cotton and they can usually buy it more cheaply abroad. They prefer to import the cheaper types of cotton. But I want to give the hon. member the assurance that we will do everything in our power to keep the producer price at a level which will be an encouragement to him to produce more cotton, bearing in mind the problem that I have just mentioned.</p>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the half-hour? When business was suspended, the hon. the Minister was replying to the debate thus far, but what did his reply really consist of? His reply in the first place was an attack on the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) whom he asked whether he would be in favour of the abolition of the quota system now being applied by the milk producers in Natal? The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) never suggested anything of the kind this morning, nor has he ever done so before. As the hon. the Minister ought to know, the scheme originated with the milk producers themselves. But the question I should like to ask the hon. the Minister is this: In December 1961 the hon. the Minister decided that the price of butter-fat would be 29c as from 1 December, a reduction of 3c per pound, and the prices of cheese milk and condensed milk would he reduced by 11c to 143c and 144c per 100 lb. of milk respectively. That was 18 months ago.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Your figures are not correct. It was 2&#x00BD;c and not 3c. that when temporary shortages of a particular commodity occur, they have to import it so that the consumer will not go short. In other words, as regards cheese there is no surplus in South Africa at the present time. The question we are asking the Minister then is this: When can the dairy produce farmers of South Africa expect the prices of their produce to be brought into line with the principle of supply and demand which is followed in South Africa at the present time? When is it going to return to the old basis? When are they going to receive the increase to which they are entitled, in view of the fact that when there was a surplus of the product, they were prepared to permit a reduction in their prices? If it is the Minister&#x2019;s policy to apply the principle of supply and demand, and if there is no surplus now, but a shortage, when can they expect the price increase? But the Minister tells us: What would be the nature of the assistance the United Party would have given South Africa in such circumstances? Does the hon. the Minister not know then that if the United Party had been in power to-day, the circumstances under which the farmers in South Africa would have been living would have been entirely different from what they are to-day? Does he not know that the economic development of South Africa would have been on a much higher level than under this Government? Does he not know that the standard of living of the South African citizen would have been much higher than it is to-day? Not only would the purchase power of the average South African have been much greater, but I make bold to say that there would not have been surpluses under a United Party Government to the same extent that there is under a National Party Government at the present time. The hon. the Minister is surprised that we on this side argue that the Government has done nothing to reduce the costs of production. And he quotes what <i>Agrecon</i> says. <i>Agrecon</i> tells you how the Government helped to reduce the costs of production in recent years by means of subsidies on fertilizer, railway rates, rebates, etc. The Government helped to reduce the costs of production in this way. The hon. the Minister should rather have quoted from the report of his own Secretary for 1962. who tells us this on page 5: That the index as regards implements rose from 271 in 1953 to 306 in the year under review (1 July 1961 to 30 June 1962); spare parts increased from 284 to 316. Implements and snare parts taken together from 276 to 309. Why did the hon. the Minister not mention that to us? For these are matters that affect the farmers. The subsidies on bread, on wheat, do not help only the farmer.</p>

<p>Let us look at butterfat: 320 to 294; cheese milk from 364 to 326; condensed milk, 278 to 252; poultry, 246 to 234. I think the hon. member for Bethlehem regrets already that he ever put the question and that I had to read the figures. I thought I would spare the Minister that embarrassment. But that is the position most of the farmers in South Africa have to face up to. Yet the Minister comes along and tells us that they have succeeded in helping the farmers to reduce the costs of production. I just want to read to him what a prominent farmer in my area, in the Eastern Province, says about costs of production. He is Mr. Crous, the chairman of the East Coast Agricultural Union. It is an extract from the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> of 17 August last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How could a farmer further reduce his costs if all his essential requirements were continually increasing in price? Milk producers have been forced to accept a cut in milk prices to give the distributors a 10 per cent interest on their investments. Why were the distributors not told to cut their costs instead of the farmers?</block>

<p>So he continues and he says it is almost impossible for the farmer because&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said farmers were already using every possible means to reduce production costs.</block>

<p>And that is a fact. The colossal production we have had in South Africa in recent years&#x2014; and the Minister&#x2019;s Secretary also refers to this in his report, to the contribution of more than R800.000.000 by agriculture to the national income of South Africa&#x2014;I do not think that production could have been achieved if the farmers had not done everything in their power to do so. They had had to mechanize and the increase in the number of tractors on the farms is proof of that, and those things cost a lot of money; every farmer knows that. But it is very certain that the margins of profit of most farmers have dropped in recent years. Here also I could quote the Secretary and this is what he said in <i>Agrecon</i> of 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The price cost squeeze was having its effect and the increased production, although at a slower rate over the past five years, must partly be ascribed to increasing yields per morgen and per animal. But it must also mean that the profits of many farmers have been considerably reduced. This is known from other information which lack of space precludes from presenting here.</block>

<p>It is an incontrovertible fact that the margins of profit have become increasingly smaller, and the hon. member for Christiana is nodding his head in agreement. That is why I think we have made a little more progress in this House than at the beginning of the year, namely, that we are prepared to agree that the farmers are no longer prospering, in other words, that their position is becoming steadily worse. So, if the hon. member for Cradock rises and tells us that certain steps will now be taken to canalize agricultural credit for the farmer, and that a special Department will be established for the finances of the farmer, I should like to ask the Minister how much progress has been made in that direction? Is that Department still going to be established this year? Has the Cabinet approved it, or was it only a propaganda trick of the hon. member for Cradock and his farming group to indicate that not only the United Party but they also are concerned about the position of the farmers?</p>

<p>Another matter I should like to put to the Minister is this: Better plans must be made to bring the products of the farmer to the notice of the consumer. That is why I say there should be greater marketing research. I see in the <i>Oosterlig</i> of 30 October last year that they Say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Official committees are working on a plan of action whereby the various control boards will jointly apply the techniques of marketing research, publicity and sales promotion in order to build up a greater demand for agricultural products internally.</block>

<p>It is said that these committees are busy. It will be welcomed if the overlapping and the expenditure incurred by control boards on their own could be eliminated, and if we can prevent the advertising campaigns costing so much, but we should like to know from the Minister how far this research has progressed. When are the first steps going to be taken to bring the product of the South African farmer to the <span class="col_6623_6624" refersTo="page_0644"/>attention of the consumers more effectively? The hon. the Minister ought to tell us these things, because these questions are being asked not only in debates of this nature, but at every agricultural congress, so much so that the farmers are already saying at congresses that the control boards no longer serve their purpose.</p>

<p>But the statement he made is still there. We are merely asking the Minister how much progress has been made, to see to it that the control boards co-operate to a greater extent and that more effective publicity campaigns are launched to bring the product of the farmer to the notice of people. The Minister says they already have been successful as regards cheese, so much so that there is no longer a surplus of cheese, but a shortage in fact, so that they had to import cheese. If publicity could have been so successful, can it not then also be successful as regards, e.g., meat, mealies and deciduous fruit, and everything that is being controlled at the present time under the Marketing Act, so that the farmer at least will know that the contribution he makes in the form of levies to the various control boards is being well spent?</p>

<p>But in this House, and in this debate, it has also appeared, as the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) has said, that the farmers of the Highveld are very satisfied with the prices they are receiving.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that there were 600 people at a meeting and that only one was dissatisfied. But what is the true position? Last year, at the congress of the Free State Agricultural Union, the following was mentioned&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the Highveld, where the costs of production are greater than in the other regions, the farmer&#x2019;s profit is only 2s. on a bag of yellow maize and 2s. 6d. on a bag of white mealies. The small farmer is not responsible for the surplus, and he ought to receive his full entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage.</block>

<p>The hon. member wished to create the impression that those people are extremely satisfied. It may be that the farmers now are satisfied with the new increases that have been announced, but it does not follow that they are satisfied with the new maize prices. The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has already said that we must not think that the increase just introduced will be the solution to the problems of the maize farmers. This swinging to and fro of the prices of the products of the farmer is the very item that causes them most concern. I just want to mention the example of wheat prices. In the 1961-2 season, they were given an increase of 7.2/3 cents per bag on the previous year, and the increase is attributed to the increase in the costs of production, such as the increased price of bags. But what happened then? In 1962-3 a reduction of 12 cents per bag is given to the wheat farmer, and the Minister and the control boards then said it is attributable to the decrease in the costs of production. The dissatisfaction among the grain farmers of South Africa in respect of this policy of the Government of tampering from day to day with the prices they receive is one of the main reasons for the instability in agriculture at the present time. The farmer does not know where he is from day to day, and he cannot plan properly for the future. This year again the grain farmers of the Western Province and the Free State had to sow their grain before knowing what the prices for the ensuing season would be. No wonder we had prominent wheat farmers such as Mr. de Villiers Loubser saying this in the <i>Landbou-weekblad</i> of 14 May of this year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am pleased about the increase in the price of wheat but disappointed nevertheless because I expected that after the poor harvest of last year, the price drop of last year would be wiped out completely, especially when it is remembered that there is no surplus of wheat in this country as yet. Mr. Lotter of Winburg, a member of the Free State Wheat Committee, says he is grateful for the increase, but had hoped it would be a few cents more per bag, because the Free State wheat farmer this year suffered heavy losses and many farmers could not even meet their expenses. Mr. Ferreira of Marseilles, also a member of the Free State Committee, is disappointed with the new price. He thinks producers were entitled to an increase of at least 15 cents per bag, and he says many <span class="col_6625_6626" refersTo="page_0645"/>farmers will feel like sowing more maize and less wheat.</block>

<p>I do not have the time to do so now. But the position is that they do not know where they are from year to year. If the Minister, with their surveys of costs of production, cannot arrive at a stage where they have a fixed formula, there will never be stability in this industry. They must have a fixed formula for the farmer of South Africa, and especially for the wheat farmer, so that they can tell the people that for the next few years the farmers may be sure of a fixed price.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>But in one year there is a drop and the next year there is a rise. [Interjection.] The hon. member must understand that many people are engaged in producing wheat, and they incur tremendous expense for one year&#x2019;s harvest, and it is an enormous risk the grain farmer is running every year, and the hon. member loses sight of that. Apart from the capital expenditure in respect of machinery, there are his seed and fertilizer; the grain farmer annually incurs great expenditure just to put his seed in the soil. Therefore it is essential that you should tell him: You may be sure of that price, and that price will exist for a number of years, or at least the formula for it. If you cannot do that, you must expect a lack of confidence in this industry. The Minister and all of us know that there is no surplus, but a shortage of wheat. We have to import wheat annually. Is it not possible to plan for the next five years so that the people will know where they are, and so that in the next five years they will produce so much that the industry can become stabilized? I am quite sure a surplus will not develop in the next few years, but I will not say that we shall never have a surplus of wheat, but the Minister should take the grain farmers into his confidence and give them stability for the future.</p>

<p>Now there are a few other matters I should like to mention. We have been told repeatedly that South Africa must be prepared, when it has an export market for certain products, to compete on that market. The Minister said so again to-day. But the overseas market for the South African agricultural product is a shrinking market and not an expanding market, because there are so many countries in the world competing on that market. We know that if Britain were to join the European Common Market there will not be such a tremendous opportunity to expand our market. If it should come about, we know that there possibly may be tremendous losses involved for the South African export farmer, as the Secretary also has said in his report. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) delivered a lengthy speech on wheat. I think he ventured onto dangerous ground because I know he is not a wheat farmer and that his knowledge may be somewhat limited. He said that the wheat farmers will not be prepared to sow before they know what the price is going to be. That may be compared with a woolgrower such as he is. I should think that he must keep his sheep in the enclosure and not shear them before he knows what the wool price is going to be, and he must keep his rams away from the ewes because he does not know what the price of lambs is going to be! It seems so fatuous to me. The hon. member says the sowing season passes before the prices are announced. I do not think any sensible person can make such a statement. He knows that when it is time to sow, you have to plough. Then there is only one factor that worries the farmer and that is the rain, and over that we have no control. That is the only factor over which there is no control. We do have control over the other factors. The hon. member has argued that the farmers would be better off if that party were in power. I know he is young. He has perhaps forgotten, or will not remember, that while his party was in power the people had to stand in queues to obtain food.</p>

<p>If the hon. member had had a little more experience he would have drawn the correct inference. He said implements and lorries and spare parts had become more expensive. Of course they have become more expensive. What determines the price of an article? It is the cost of production. What determines the price of wheat and maize? It is the cost of production. What <span class="col_6627_6628" refersTo="page_0646"/>determines the price of implements and tractors? It is the cost of production. Take the wages paid in this country 15 years ago and compare it with to-day&#x2019;s. It is five times more than it was then. And I do not begrudge the people that. Must they then live on wind?

<p>Of course he works, but I do not begrudge the factory worker and the farm labourer every penny they earn more in recent years. What was the hon. member&#x2019;s servants earning 15 years ago, and in what kind of house were they living? I know the hon. member has made great improvements on his farm. Why does he try to give us a wrong impression? I do not say the farmers may live in luxury, but, goodness me, I who grew up in the Karoo, where the hon. member also farms, cannot to-day recognize a farm I knew 40 years ago. And how was it done? It has been built up with money, and where did the farmer get that money? Now the hon. member must not sit and laugh. With what did they drill the boreholes, wire the fences and improve the herds? Twenty years ago a farmer sheared 4 lb. of wool from a sheep, but to-day only a poor farmer shears less than 10 lb. It is because more expensive rams were bought. The stud breeders improved their herds, and that could not be done without money. The days when we paid &#x00A3;5 for a ram have passed. To-day you pay &#x00A3;40 for a ram and I gladly pay the price and I do not begrudge the stud farmer that, because he has sunk a lot of capital into his stud farm. I ask again, where did he get that capital? He made it from his farming operations.</p>

<p>But before I sit down I should like to make an appeal to all our farmers, particularly here in Parliament, in regard to the use of wool. Millions of rand are spent on advertisements for the promotion of wool. We ought to set an example, but we do not. Not even 5 per cent of those of us sitting here to-day are wearing woollen ties. Which of us is to-day wearing a decent suit made of wool? The old idea that woollen clothes are clumsy and unattractive has gone. Research has resulted in us being able to obtain some of the neatest woollen clothes for both men and women. The time has arrived that we who are making laws here, also should set an example and that we should wear woollen clothes and ties, and even woollen socks, so that there may be a greater market for wool.</p>

<p>I want to make use of this opportunity to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention as a matter of urgency to the parlous position in which the producer of industrial milk finds himself. I want to concentrate particularly on an area which I know very well, and that is the milk collection area of the Reivilo Dairy Co-operative Society. Since the Dairy Board has ordered that industrial milk is to be bought on a butterfat basis it has become evident that the butterfat content in this area, namely on the Ghaap plateau, differs considerably from the butterfat content in other parts of the country and that it shows a definite downward trend. I concede that the type of grazing presumably plays an important role in this matter. Nevertheless milk of good quality is produced here, as is evident from the quality of the cheese which is manufactured at Reivilo and which is 100 per cent first-grade. If we can manufacture that quality of cheese, it only goes to show that there can be nothing wrong with our milk. I want to point out to the Minister, however, that the price of industrial milk with a butterfat content of 3.5 per cent was reduced from 156.6 cents in May 1960 to 133 cents in December 1961 and that the present price is 138 cents per 100 lb. of milk. During this period in which there has been a drop in the price of milk, production costs have steadily increased: railway rates have been systematically increased and have resulted in an increase in the price of fuel and therefore also in an increase in the cost of transporting milk. The prices of all products required in the production of milk, namely bonemeal, stock feeds, etc., have increased but there has been a steady downward trend in the price of milk. This situation of rising production costs on the one hand and a decrease in industrial milk prices on the other has now reached breaking-point. I can assure the Minister that in the Reivilo cheese factory area the general tendency is to discontinue milk production, a tendency which in my opinion should be checked, particularly in view of the present shortage of cheese. In spite of unfavourable climatic conditions the cheese factory at Reivilo has been built up throughout the years into a huge factory, in fact the biggest in the country, but the Board of Directors is perturbed about the present situation. Another aspect which has been brought to my notice as a matter of urgency is the rate at which the price of milk drops or rises in relation to its butterfat content. As you know, the price of milk is reduced or increased by 3 cents per 100 lb. for every 0.1 per cent reduction or increase in the butterfat content of milk. In my opinion the drop or the rise in the butterfat content is not always in keeping with the drop or the rise in the cheese yield. I have here a memorandum which was sent to me by the Reivilo Dairy Co-operative Society, and in this connection I should like to quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A comparison has been made for a period of three years of the relationship between the butterfat content and the cheese yield of cheese milk received at the Reivilo Dairy Co-operative Society. Although the reductions and increases have not always maintained the same ratio, we have nevertheless been able to determine the average cheese yield per unit of butterfat. Prom this it appears that the cheese yield has dropped <span class="col_6629_6630" refersTo="page_0647"/>or increased by an average of 1.7 lb. of cheese per 100 lb. of milk for every 1 per cent reduction or increase in the butterfat content of the milk. At the present estimated cost of cheese milk as determined by the Dairy Board, namely 15.131 cents per lb., this represents a cost of about 25.7 cents for cheese milk, while the variation in the price of milk itself is 30 cents. It is clear threfore that at the present price the price variation is too large having regard to the variation in the cheese yield. In our opinion 2.5 cents per 100 lb. of milk would be a more realistic figure.</block>

<p>Viewed from another angle, the case can be stated as follows: When the present price variation of 3 cents per 100 lb. of milk was fixed, that is to say, on 1 March 1961, the basic price of cheese milk was 150 cents per 100 lb. Since then the price has dropped to 133 cents per 100 lb. and to-day it again stands at 138 cents per 100 lb., a net increase of 8 per cent therefore. If the variation of 3 cents per 100 lb. was correct for a basic price of 150 cents per 100 lb. (although in our opinion it was already too big) then it is definitely excessive for a basic price of 138 cents. In order to retain the correct relationship, the 3 cents should also have been reduced by 8 cents. Since the butterfat content of the milk on the Ghaap plateau shows such great fluctuations, this 8 per cent, which works cumulatively, could make a big difference to the income of the suppliers. We feel, particularly in view of the fact that the average butterfat content of the milk in this area is lower than in the rest of the country and since after all, the milk, as far as &#x201C;quality&#x201D; is concerned, is very suitable for the manufacture of cheese, that this big price variation unduly penalizes the suppliers in this area.</p>

<p>If the conditions on the Ghaap plateau differ so materially from those in the rest of the country that this first argument is not valid everywhere, we feel that we have given ample reasons why the Reivilo Dairy Cooperative Society as a co-operative society should be allowed itself to determine the price variation for the milk of its members on a more realistic basis. If necessary, a limit can be set to the permissible variations.</p>

<p>I should like to associate myself with this request and make an urgent appeal to the Minister to assist this factory in this matter. I want to give the Committee the assurance once again that the position has reached breaking point as far as the dairy industry in this area is concerned. The shareholders of this factory would like to retain what they have built up throughout the years but under present conditions they find it extremely difficult to do so. This factory is capable of processing 30,000 gallons of milk a day and it has been modernized more and more throughout the years at tremendous expense. It goes without saying that the more milk the factory can collect in this particular collection area, the more remuneratively the factory can function. The farms are separated by great distances and if the present conditions force farmers, as the tendency is at present, to give up dairy farming, it will mean fewer gallons of milk per mile and possibly an increase in transport charges, which would then automatically cause the price of milk to drop even lower. I want to point out to the Minister that during the period August 1959 to August 1962, when there was a reasonable cheese surplus, this co-operative society refrained from insisting on higher prices for milk, but we very seriously urge today that those prices should be revised and that the Minister should do his utmost to come to the assistance of the people in that area.</p>

<p>I should like to extend my hearty congratulations to the hon. member for Kuruman (Mr. du Plessis) on the speech which he has just made and on the way in which he stepped into the breach for his constituents. His speech will not be very popular with the Minister, of course, but I am sure his friends on the other side agree with every word that the hon. member said.</p>

<p>I do not want to become involved in the argument between the rich wool farmers and the poor dairy farmers. I want to break a lance for a small group of people, the poultry farmers, who are making a good living to-day, but who still need a great deal of assistance from the Government. The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) in my opinion put his finger this morning on the reason why it is altogether impossible to-day for a beginner or for a person with little capital to become a farmer. As far as I know there is only one branch of farming to-day in which one can start on a small scale and make a living out of it, and that is in poultry farming. Three months after buying a day-old chicken, one can market it; one gets one&#x2019;s capital back quickly and one can make a living out of poultry farming. But unfortunately we have also had a surplus of poultry and poultry products over the past few years. Last year, for example, South Africa produced 38,000,000 dozen eggs, in other words, 1,300,000 cases of 30 dozen. Over the past 10 years production has increased by 10,000,000 dozen. The Egg Board was obliged to export a fair quantity of these eggs. Last year, for example, the board succeeded in exporting 272,000 cases of eggs as well as 200 tons of frozen eggs, but unfortunately it had to do so at a loss. Unfortunately there has been a gradual shrinkage of the markets to which we have been exporting our eggs and egg products. There has been a reduction in the quantity of eggs imported into Britain and Germany from South Africa; in Italy, Aden and other places there has been an increased demand but unfortunately, because of limited shipping facilities, we have not been able to export more. The result is that last year exports dropped by about 12,000 cases in comparison with the previous year. This industry is still expanding and it is necessary to find markets for this increased production. We all know that the Egg Control Board <span class="col_6631_6632" refersTo="page_0648"/>is doing its best to find markets overseas, but the board is unable to sell all our surplus eggs abroad. It is up to us therefore to try to find a different market for our surplus eggs, and I want to suggest to-day that the Egg Control Board or the Minister&#x2019;s Department should try to see whether we cannot persuade our Native population to consume more poultry and eggs. We know that the eating habits of the Natives in South Africa are changing; they are eating more meat and more bread to-day than they did formerly. We also know that there is a good deal of malnutrition in certain parts of our country. If we can persuade the Natives to eat eggs we shall be able to supplement the present deficiencies in their diet and at the same time create a market for our eggs. I would go so far as to say that we should rather give the eggs which we are exporting at a loss to-day to the Native at a lower price. Let us first teach them to eat eggs; once we have succeeded in doing so, they will continue to eat eggs. We have heard here to-day what the effect has been of a comparatively small propaganda campaign in this country as far as cheese is concerned. Within a year after the initiation of that propaganda campaign there is a shortage of cheese in this country to-day. Sir, it is not beyond the ingenuity of the Minister and his Department to think out ways of teaching the Native to eat poultry and eggs. It is interesting to see how many eggs can be consumed in this country. I just want to refer to one location in my constituency, namely Alexandra about which we heard such a great deal here the other day. At the moment there are 50,000 Natives in Alexandra. If everyone of them were to eat one egg per day, they would eat almost 50,000 cases of eggs per annum&#x2014;50,000 cases &#x2014;whereas our total exports only amount to 272,000 cases. This is just one small place; there are so many other examples that I could mention. I leave this thought with the Minister. I do feel that he will be giving great fillip to poultry farming, which forms a very important part of our farming industry, if he succeeds in persuading the Natives to eat more eggs and poultry.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The thread which has run throughout this debate to-day as far as the United Party is concerned is that the poor farmers of South Africa are going through very hard times. I do not propose to reply to all the arguments of hon. members on that side, but I should like to put this question to them. If it is true that the poor farmers are struggling so much, why has the price of land increased so enormously in recent years? The hon. member who has just sat down, referred to the speech of the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) and said that the high price of land was really the reason why people with little capital were unable to start farming. But the price of land is high for the very reason that things are going well for the farmer of South Africa. If that were not so, the farmer would not be able to afford to pay these high prices for land.</p>

<p>But I do not intend to follow these hon. members because I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister a matter in which I am keenly interested. I refer to attempts which are being made in the Citrus Board to obtain complete control once again over the internal marketing of citrus. We know the history of control over the internal marketing of citrus. Before 1941 there was no control whatsoever. In 1941 control was instituted under the Marketing Act and it remained in force until 1945. In 1945 a slight change was made again. From 1947 to 1956 there was control only over the large-scale producers, and since 1957 there has been no control at all, but there is a very strong demand to-day in the Citrus Board, which is largely controlled by the South African Citrus Exchange, that full control over the internal marketing of citrus should be re-instituted. The Deciduous Fruit Board made the discovery as far back as 1951 that the internal marketing of a product cannot be controlled within the area of production, because in order to be able to do so one would need an army of officials to exercise supervision to ensure that the control measures are not contravened, and since our orange-production areas are spread over the whole of the country practically I submit with all due deference that it will prove impracticable to exercise control over the internal marketing of citrus in South Africa because one would need an army of officials to enforce it. The unfortunate part of it is that the Citrus Board is controlled by the gentlemen of the South African Citrus Exchange who in the main represent the large-scale producers. There are only two members on the Citrus Board really who represent the small-scale producers. They are hopelessly in the minority and there is a very great danger therefore that full control over the internal marketing of citrus may once again be instituted. The plea that I want to make to the hon. the Minister this afternoon therefore is that he should not allow the introduction of control, without any limitations, over the marketing of citrus in South Africa, because these gentlemen talk about control under a pool system. In the Western Cape we have a small number of small-scale producers who concentrate mainly on the production of oranges for the offseason market. If they had to be drawn into the proposed pool they would simply be ruined. I notice in the report of the Citrus Board for 1962 that for navels in the home market they paid 18.9c per pocket and 13.9c per pocket for Valencias. As against that these farmers who market during the off-season get anything from 60c to 100c per pocket. They would simply be ruined if their product had to go into the pool, and I would therefore urge upon the hon. the Minister not to allow these farmers to be drawn into the proposed pool because it would ruin them. They produce for a specific market; they produce for a market which extends mainly from about 15 to 31 October up to the end of February. I trust that the hon. the Minister will not <span class="col_6633_6634" refersTo="page_0649"/>accede to the demands that complete control should be re-instituted.</p>

<p>In the few minutes which I still have at my disposal I should like to make a few comments on the scope of agricultural co-operative societies. I link up these remarks with the very unfortunate occurrence some weeks ago when we found that a country-wide co-operative society was forced to go into liquidation. There are a few other large co-operative societies as well which are finding themselves in very difficult financial circumstances, and we want to ask the hon. the Minister and his Department at this stage therefore to give us a clear lead once again as to the spheres which agricultural co-operative societies may justifiably enter. To me it is perfectly clear that the time is past when co-operative societies should be established on a compulsory basis. Compulsory co-operative societies have been replaced by agricultural control boards. In my opinion the sphere of non-compulsory, that is to say, voluntary co-operative societies, is fairly limited. It does not seem right to me, for example, that an agricultural co-operative society should risk entering a highly specialized commercial sphere or a specialized industrial sphere, and I would welcome it therefore if the hon. Minister and his Department would once again give a very clear lead to the farming community of South Africa as to the scope of agricultural co-operative societies because the co-operative society movement in South Africa is dealt a very serious blow when circumstances arise, such as we have had recently, where a country-wide co-operative society is forced to go into liquidation. I want to emphasize that in making these observations I do not do so because I am against agricultural cooperative societies. On the contrary, I have the privilege to serve on the Board of Directors of various agricultural co-operative societies and I am anxious that our agricultural co-operative societies should operate extremely successfully, but in that case we must limit ourselves to spheres about which the farmers themselves, who are going to constitute the Board of Directors of the co-operative society, have sufficient knowledge so that they as the masters of that co-operative society will be able to guide their manager, so that we do not find ourselves in the position that the Board of Directors consisting of farmers is completely dependent for guidance on the manager, because then we would be looking for trouble and then we would get the sort of situation that we have just had where a country-wide co-operative society goes under to the detriment of the co-operative society movement in this country.

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the observation made by the hon. the Minister with reference to the Marketing Act, and that is that it is simply an enabling Act which grants certain powers to the Minister. One&#x2019;s thoughts involuntarily turn to the charge made here in previous debates by hon. members opposite that the Marketing Act has allegedly been violated in recent times; that the powers granted under the Act have been abused and that the Act should be amended. I should also like to refer to what was said a moment ago by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher), and that is that if the United Party had been in power today the farmers would have flourished. I just want to remind the United Party that during the period they were in power they also had at their disposal the powers granted under the Marketing Act, and how did the United Party Government use those powers? At a time when world prices were high, they used the powers granted to them under the Marketing Act to force domestic prices lower and lower. Moreover, while prices abroad were high, they simply reduced the internal prices when the production exceeded the local requirements. That is how the United Party Government used the powers granted under the Marketing Act. They are the last people who can talk about a misuse of the powers of the Marketing Act. On the contrary, they abused the powers which the Marketing Act gave them. The hon. member continually talks about formulae. I want to ask the hon. member whether the United Party Government ever drew up a formula for the fixation of agricultural prices, in the case of any agricultural product, in which the cost of production was taken into account. In no single case did they take into account the cost of production in determining the price. Those prices were simply fixed arbitrarily. Prices were fixed on the basis of our domestic requirements. If that formula were to be applied to-day agricultural prices would drop very considerably indeed. Sir, I indicated my agreement when the hon. member said that he had read in the report of the Secretary for Agriculture that there had been a gradual reduction in the margin of prolit. Yes, that is true but nevertheless there has still been a margin of profit. I had occasion to refer recently to the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) who confirmed some time ago that it was the opinion of the United Party that we should adapt our prices to overseas prices, but he says that those adjustments must take place gradually. That, he says, is the policy of the United Party. As far as the Marketing Act is concerned and the remarks made here by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), I just want to remove a misunderstanding here. Following upon the Marketing Act, the Maize Regulation Act was introduced, and under that legislation the one-channel system was instituted, a system for which the farmers had fought for many years. Prior to the introduction of this system prices had dropped to a very low level. If we do away with the one-channel system and introduce a floor price, as suggested by him, then the hon. member makes a very great mistake if he thinks that R2.87, which is the price this year, will continue to be the price. Under a floor-price system an advance price is agreed upon with the Land Bank. That advance price would be much lower&#x2014;it is usually 75 per cent&#x2014;than <span class="col_6635_6636" refersTo="page_0650"/>the price that will eventually be received. The price agreed upon would then be paid to the farmers as an advance. When the whole crop has been disposed of, the balance in the pool, after taking into account the losses or the profits, is then divided amongst the farmers. I can assure the hon. member that it is out of the question that the subsidy which the State pays to-day, both to cover the administrative costs connected with mealies and to pay the agents, can be used to cover export losses. That simply could not be done because it would be conflict with international agreements. Unter the GATT agreement the State is not allowed to subsidize exports. The State is subsidizing the internal consumption of mealies at the present time, but it in no way subsidizes the export of maize. The maize industry has to carry its own costs, both the administrative costs and the storage costs.</p>

<p>We have a crop to-day of just about 60,000,000 to 62,000,000 bags, of which only 25,000,000 bags are sold in the local market. That means that for every one bag sold locally, two bags have to be exported. The hon. member alleges that the Maize Board is the biggest middleman. This difference between the internal price and the external price is absorbed largely by levy moneys. Whichever way the hon. member looks at the position, the difference between the internal price and the external price has to be made up by means of levy moneys. Those levy moneys have to make up the losses on export prices. The losses have to be met in some way or another. The hon. member mentions the example of the floor-price system in connection with kaffir-corn. Let me tell him at once that the farmers are not satisfied either with the kaffir-corn floor-price system because there are such tremendous variations in price. There is no stable price under such a system. In the case of the kaffir-corn floor-price system it is an easy matter to collect the levy moneys. The kaffir-corn crop is less than 3,000,000 bags and the levy has risen as high as 130c per bag, but it is easy to collect it because it is collected from the malt manufacturer before it is sold. It is a good deal more difficult to collect the levy moneys in the case of maize to cover the export losses. That makes one&#x2019;s task much more difficult. Those losses have to be covered. I think I am right in saying that in a year such as this, with such a large crop, the farmers, under a maize floor-price system, could expect no more than R2 per bag by way of &#x201C;voorskot&#x201D; (advance payment), and then after 12 months or longer, when the whole crop has been disposed of, they can then expect a deferred payment.

<p>I should like to go a little bit further than the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel). If he is correct that the Minister is responsible for determining the overall policy in regard to the activities of the Marketing Board I think it is logical to say that production of surpluses and the eventual disposal of those surpluses are dependent upon the policy followed by the Minister. That is the issue I wish to raise. I also wish to take a point raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) a little bit further. He has referred to the necessity for adequate market research in regard to the disposal of surpluses. Hon. members on the Government benches have also from time to time advanced suggestions in that regard.</p>

<p>I wish to confine myself to the disposal of the mealie surplus. The Minister is responsible for the policy in regard to the disposal of surpluses and he is also responsible for the policy dealing with the production of those surpluses. We have the position to-day that the mealie farmers are caught in a vicious circle. They are forced to continue to produce a crop, because of lack of Government policy, of which there is a surplus in order to pay their way. What surprises me, Sir, is that the Minister who is responsible for the marketing of all our agricultural products has not at any time come forward with suggestions to farmers in regard to the production of other commodities of which there is not a surplus and for which there is probably a great internal demand and a great export market.</p>

<p>It may be an old thought but it is a thought which can well be applied here in South Africa. I want to know from the Minister what his policy is in this regard? I have a series of letters here which I think the committee will find interesting. They show the short-sightedness of our Marketing Board in certain respects. I as a small farmer was interested in the issue so I addressed a letter on 8 March to the Dried Bean Control Board. As you know, Sir, that board is administered by the Mealie Control Board. I wrote to them as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What was the board&#x2019;s policy in regard to the production and marketing of soya beans? I would appreciate a full outline of your board&#x2019;s policy in regard to this class of bean. I should be grateful if you would give me any information in your possession in regard to the extent of soya bean production in the Republic and its market potential.</block>

<p>On 20 March I received the following letter</p>

<block name="quote">Re: Soya Beans; With reference to your letter of 8 March in connection with the abovementioned matter, I wish to inform you that this board does not control soya beans.

<p>A couple of days later I wrote to the Secretary of the Minister&#x2019;s Department as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On 8 March 1963 I addressed a letter to the manager of the Dried Bean Control Board.

<p>At the same time I addressed a letter, in reply to his letter, to the Secretary of the Dried Bean Control Board in which I said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am well aware that your board does not control soya beans. My letter of 8 March requested information as to the board&#x2019;s policy in regard to this type of bean. I would be glad if you could advise me why the board, in its wisdom, does not control the soya bean?</block>

<p>I got a reply to that letter dated 16 May, again signed by the Secretary, on a letterhead of the Mealie Industry Control Board, which said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With reference to your letter of I may 1963, regarding the control of dried beans I wish to inform you that the matter will be submitted to the board for its consideration at its next meeting on 17 May 1963. The board&#x2019;s view in this connection will be conveyed to you.</block>

<p>That is the short-sighted approach. I have not, of course, heard what the board&#x2019;s views are. The production of the soya bean has certain vast industrial uses; industrial uses which are predetermined. The production of oil from the soya bean holds out wider prospects than in the case of any other agricultural product known. It holds out the prospect of the manufacture of plastics to the manufacture of paint and the feeding of children. I go so far as to say that there is not a single member in this House who did not, in his early days, consume soya beans. Baby food is made out of soya beans to the extent of 50 per cent.</p>

<p>You would think that where a vicious circle has developed, where farmers have to go on producing mealies and where they are caught up in ever-increasing production costs and where they are faced with an ever-increasing problem of disposing of that surplus, that the Government would turn round and say to those farmers: &#x201C;All right, I have another plan <span class="col_6639_6640" refersTo="page_0652"/>for you; we suggest you produce another crop for which we have wider uses.&#x201D; If the soya bean has such wide industrial uses, for which we are not from an industrial viewpoint equipped to handle to-day, you would think the Minister would at least get up and say to the farmers: &#x201C;The Government will see to it that your crop is taken from you; we will finance the necessary disposal of the crop,&#x201D; as was done in the United States of America. When you look at the figures&#x2014;I do not want to quote them in the time available to me&#x2014; you will find that the soya bean in America has developed into one of the vastest and greatest industries from the agricultural point of view. There is no surplus problem. The whole of the Far East is crying out for soya beans. Our own mining industry is to-day asking for soya beans. In reply to another letter which I addressed to the Minister&#x2019;s Department two years ago I was told that kaffir beer had now replaced the soya bean as food for Natives in the mine compounds.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>As a back-bencher on this side of the House I find it remarkable that the Opposition who regard themselves as the alternative Government right from the beginning of this debate till now have only tried to refer to the Minister and his Department in a critical and belittling manner. The Opposition has not succeeded in coming forward with an alternative policy which is acceptable to the farmers. You would have expected the Opposition to avail themselves of this opportunity to say: This is what we are offering to you as farmers. It is clear, therefore, that the Opposition do not have that alternative to offer.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I hope the hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow him because I think his plea simply amounts to this that it is a matter between him and the Minister&#x2019;s Department which is not replying to his correspondence. I must say that it is usual for us on this side of the House, when we have a difference of opinion with a Minister of a Department, to go there and settle the matter. We do not take up the time of this House for that purpose.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). As the member who introduced the debate on that side of the House the hon. member referred to the position in the northern Transvaal with special reference to the Lydenburg constituency and other drought-stricken areas. The hon. member said that those people could no longer make a living and that this Government only offered assistance when the people were already down on their knees. The hon. member lacked the courage of her conviction, however, and did not reply when the hon. the Minister asked her whether she was in favour of it that alms should be handed out to those people. She did not want to reply to that. It is, of course, absolutely necessary that such an irresponsible statement be reacted to. I take it that the hon. member spoke on behalf of the United Party members in that area and in that constituency. That is why nobody is surprised when the majorities of the National Party are continually increasing in the platteland. The self-respecting farmers in those drought-stricken areas do not, of course, want any alms from the Government. I am obliged, and it is also my pleasant privilege, on behalf of those farmers who have not reaped a crop for three/four successive years but who have had only expenditure, to convey our sincere gratitude to the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing for the assistance which has been given to those farmers. We thank him sincerely because had it not been for that assistance, assistance which the hon. member has degraded to the level of patchwork, many of those farmers would no longer have been on their farms.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet it is also my privilege to convey our gratitude to the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions with whom I am negotiating at the moment in order to submit representations to the Government in regard to further auxiliary schemes which will meet the domestic needs of those families which have been hard hit. It is true that we have only had a very sympathetic ear from this Minister when we told him that the one Department had attended to the agricultural needs but that the domestic needs of those people still had to be seen to. Mr. Chairman, alongside the gratitude which we want to convey to the Ministers concerned, it is also my privilege to tell this House how important the agricultural sector is in our national economy. It is true that in the short time at my disposal I cannot make a proper comparison with the other sectors of our national economy. It is necessary to point out that over the past year, 1961-2, as far as agriculture is concerned, the gross agricultural yield reached the figure of R846,700,000 as against R814,400,000 in the previous year. That proves the vitality of our agricultural economy; in spite of all the setbacks it has nevertheless shown an increase of R31,300,000, in other words, a percentage increase of 3.8 per cent.</p>

<p>We are aware of the fact that our price structure is to a very great extent dependent on our internal consumption and our export market as far as our agricultural products are concerned. That is why I think it is of the very greatest importance that we should show how our products fare on the overseas market. In the year 1960-1 we exported agricultural products to the value of R311,000,000; last year it was R373,100,000. In other words, there has been an increase of R62,100,000 which is an appreciable increase, an increase which has benefited the farmers because the Government developed those overseas markets and found new markets for our products. We found that because those markets had been developed wool, karakul pelts and citrus fetched appreciably higher prices on the overseas market than in previous years. The price of other products remained constant and in <span class="col_6641_6642" refersTo="page_0653"/>the case of a few commodities there was a slight decrease in the price on the overseas market. This is indeed an achievement on the part of the National Government. Have hon. members on the other side of the House expressed any gratitude to the Minister of to the Department for what has been done for the farmers?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to deal with the statement that there are more incalculable and uncontrollable factors in the agricultural industry than in any other industry. The question which arises is this: How is it possible that this industry can experience such prosperity in the fact of all those unfavourable factors? The reply is that it is because the agricultural industry has been built on various pillars, pillars on which the whole agricultural structure rests. One of these pillars is the cooperative societies. I want to deal with this subject briefly. The co-operative society system has been built by the farmer, for the farmer, from the farmer. The underlying idea was that the farmers realized, when they had to go hat in hand in the past to one trader after the other to trade or sell their products in the most humiliating way, that co-operative societies would have to be established. That is why I say they were born from stress, by the farmers, for the farmers, from the farmers.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the idea of co-operative societies has fired the imagination of our people. That is why our sons and daughters have thrown their best talents and energies into our co-operative society movement. There are numbers of persons who have sacrificed brilliant academic careers for the sake of this wonderful cause. That is why we have some of the best brains in the Republic in the cooperative society movement to-day. The cooperative society movement is consequently the pride of the farmer to-day in the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let us consider the important functions which co-operative societies fulfil. It is true that this fact is not sufficiently emphasized in the world outside. It is clear to me that the co-operative societies and the people in the employ of those societies do not get sufficient credit for what they have sacrificed. In the first place the co-operative societies constitute one of our most important marketing channels. Take tobacco, for example, of which practically 100 per cent is marketed co-operatively. In the case of grain it is 90 per cent, citrus 80 per cent, wine products practically 100 per cent, meat 35 per cent. Similarly fruit and many other products are to a great extent sold co-operatively. That is why I say it is one of the, if not the, most important marketing channels. It is also true that cooperative societies constitute your most important distribution channel because in this way agricultural requirements, consumer goods etc. are placed at the disposal of the public.</p>

<p>Finally it is also true that the co-operative society is a very important financial institution. I wish to state as a fact that next to the State co-operative societies constitute the most important short-term financial institutions in the Republic. They make production loan facilities, seasonal loans and monthly accounts available to a large extent. It is the custom among co-operative societies on the platteland to extend these facilities to the farmers as members of the society.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what has the co-operative society movement achieved? It is necessary to point out how the membership has increased, how it has increased phenomenally. That shows how the co-operative society idea has fired the imagination of the nation. On 30 June 1962 there were 307 registered agricultural co-operative societies with a total membership of 290,550. Apart from that there were 159 registered consumer co-operative societies with a total membership of 127,298. On 30 June 1962 therefore, there was a total of 466 registered co-operative societies in the Republic with a total membership of 417,848 which is indeed an achievement on the part of the South African farmer.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to hark back to one or two of the subjects that I dealt with this morning. The first is the question of levies. I want to understand the hon. the Minister quite correctly: Did he suggest that he was going to make use of these levies during slump periods?</p>

<p>No, I am not talking about seasonal periods; I am talking about slump periods. I want to say this that we dare not collect money at this stage to try to finance slump periods. We can do it during fluctuating periods, but not during slump periods because slump periods affect the whole of the world markets.</p>

<speech by="#warren">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to remind the hon. the Minister that the bulk of the products which are being supplied on the world markets are products which are subsidized; they are really dumped on those markets and subsidized by the countries where they have that surplus production. So for us to compete with them, as is suggested, is going to be very difficult because our economy is slightly higher than the economy of the countries where we do the dumping. So, in effect, we must expect to lose money. To what extent will the Minister&#x2019;s Department subsidize those particular surplus products that must be dumped on those markets to relieve the position in this country?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury dealt with this question of the capital required for the staffing of farms. Sir, that is an extremely important item because we are faced with this position that the two Departments have worked <span class="col_6643_6644" refersTo="page_0654"/>out very accurately the cost price per acre for the running of certain types of stock. He quoted the figure that has been established for certain parts of the country, and that is R32 per morgen. That includes the cost of the particular animal to be run on that land. So where the carrying capacity is one sheep per acre, including the cost of the animal, it can be done at R32 per acre. What I want to put to the Minister in that respect is that no young farmer in South Africa can establish himself on the land unless he has a father who is financially able to put him on the land. I want to assure the hon. the Minister that this is going to have a serious affect on farming in future. Unless we can establish farmers on the land to follow in the footsteps of those producers who are gradually going out of production we are going to land in a serious state in the future. I want the hon. the Minister to realize that agriculture has lost a certain amount of confidence as far as lending is concerned. Until we are able to re-establish that confidence the future of farming is not so very good. The Minister is now setting up a new Department. May I suggest that he set up a committee or commission to investigate the position. He should have men on that committee or commission who will be able to give him the practical side of the issue. Because without them he will not be able to arrive at a basis on which to finance these young farmers. It requires an enormous amount of money to establish a stock farm to-day, not less than R50,000. That is the cost of establishing a farm with 1,000 head of small stock. That is the minimum that can give a decent living to a farmer. On the basis of cattle, there are other hon. members who will discuss the subject. The hon. member for Paarl wanted to know why land has rocketed. I think land had to rocket when you had increases in prices throughout the world. It was not confined only to South Africa. Land in America has rocketed in the same way as ours. I saw some valuations in the report from the Mealie Control Board Committee that went over there that would astound South Africa, to see the cost of land for mealie production in that part of the world. The figures show that their production per morgen was just about three times the average production in South Africa. I sincerely hope that the hon. Minister will take due note of the urgent necessity to bring about a healthy economy in this particular Department. And I want to put it to him that the method of financing applied during the past few years was not the safest nor the healthiest for the farmers of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#maree">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) discussed a matter which was particularly interesting and I also want to say something about it. Many of his colleagues before him this morning, however, made spectacles of themselves by saying things without knowing what they were saying. That was why we witnessed the spectacle that one member attacked the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing for not having replied to a letter which was written to the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services. We also had the strange occurrence that the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) made strange allegations and the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) wanted to make us believe that the reason why there are no United Party seats on the platteland is because of the delimitation. In view of the fact that the whole platteland is National, I wonder how she wants to set about this delimitation? How does she want to demarcate the constituencies so that the United Party can win seats there? Although they have no seats on the platteland, I want to point out that those of them who are still farmers have the right to attend agricultural congresses. If they have attended agricultural congresses in past years they have probably found it a characteristic of our agricultural congresses that there are usually a number of items on the agenda in which the two Ministers of Agriculture and their Departments are thanked for what they have done. I feel that I would be neglecting my duty if I did not associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Groblersdal (Mr. M. J. H. Bekker)&#x2014;the very serious drought in the north-west is now virtually over&#x2014;and express my thanks to the hon. the Minister and his Department for the very sympathetic manner in which they have always dealt with representations made to them from those parts during periods of drought and for all the assistance that they have given. We are grateful for the sympathetic way in which they have dealt with our farmers and are still dealing with them now that the drought is over and the farmers are rehabilitating themselves. I want to add that the farmers of South Africa will certainly not be pleased that the Opposition has tried to speak on their behalf and has shown so much ingratitude after the wonderful way in which the Government has proved that it is still the friend of the farmer, particularly in times of emergency and difficulty. But this past drought also further emphasized certain factors of which we were aware, perhaps more than ever before. One of the factors that was further emphasized was the necessity to have fodder available during times of drought. One of the things of which we have become fully aware is the necessity to be able to transport fodder to the drought-stricken areas. I want immediately to thank the hon. the Minister very much indeed for all his assistance; for the rebate on the transport of fodder to the drought-stricken areas and the fact that this also applied to road motor services and even to private transport services in those parts where there are no railway links. This was a great help and I would almost say that it was the most important practical concession because those large parts of the north-west which were stricken by drought for so long have practically no railway links. The hon. the Minister introduced <span class="col_6645_6646" refersTo="page_0655"/>that rebate of which they had never before had the benefit. On behalf of the north-west I want to thank him very much indeed. But we also feel that fodder is not always available in time of drought. That is why we have asked that a survey be made to find out how the available fodder can be stored for use when the drought is at its worst. That is why I want to thank the hon. the Minister and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services as well for the manner in which they reacted to this request. An inquiry is being made at the moment in the north-west into the fodder potential in the area and also the manner in which it can be economically processed and how this should be financed. I think that this is our next step in the combating of drought. I make so bold as to say that all that can be done by way of farm planning in the northwest has already been done, and the way in which we managed to combat this drought in the north-west proves that. I feel that we have now reached the next phase in the drought problem and I want to thank the hon. the Minister for the very sympathetic manner in which the two Departments of Agriculture have approached this matter. This is also greatly appreciated by the farmers and I want to give the hon. the Minister the assurance that he will have the wholehearted co-operation of all the farming bodies and co-operatives in that area in regard to the next step in the combating of drought.</p>

<p>There is another aspect that has made itself felt, particularly during the drought, and that is the aspect of uneconomic farm units. This is a problem that has now become so serious in the north-west that it must be solved. It is a problem that has assumed vast proportions. We know that the problem arose in a very innocent way but before we knew what had happened, we were saddled with a problem. I am grateful that legislation has been introduced by another Minister to take steps in this direction. I want to ask the hon. the Minister with his superior knowledge of the problem, particularly in the north-west but also in other parts of the country, to go into this matter seriously when he has to deal with these things through the State Advances Recoveries Office and through the Land Bank. I am sure that he is very well aware how serious this problem has become both in the northwest and in certain other parts of the country, and I want to ask him to do everything possible to have these uneconomic units consolidated We often talk about the depopulation of the platteland. I contend that in an indirect manner&#x2014;I would almost say in a direct manner&#x2014;these uneconomic units are responsible for this depopulation in many cases. We may have two or three farmers who farm on uneconomic units. Instead of its being consolidated into one economic unit, we find that the three units are all sold to a man who has the necessary capital. That is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister with his knowledge and experience not to stop at a consolidating Bill which creates the necessary machinery but to have an investigation made into every sphere and ensure that those Departments co-operate very closely in order to solve the problem. It is a practical problem that we have to deal with daily. I can give the House the assurance that I have to deal with it daily, and to-day was no exception. We have the cases of people who have been caught up in this problem. They have uneconomic units and because they have been caught up economically, they simply cannot obtain or afford an additional unit. That is why it is necessary for us to make use of all the machinery and organizations at our disposal to assist in solving this problem in South Africa. The necessary means must be made available. This is one of the greatest evils that threatens our agriculture in South Africa to-day. And it is not confined to certain areas. When I think of the great northwest where I come from, I say that this is a problem which one experiences in virtually all parts of the north-west. I am in complete agreement with what was said by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town&#x2014;that if a man wants to start farming to-day, he needs a fairly large amount of capital in order to be able to farm economically. That is why I want to make an earnest appeal to the hon. the Minister to give attention to this aspect and to do what he can to make the new legislation as practicable as possible and to apply it in order to assist in solving our problems.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SADIE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make use of this opportunity to correct a few statements made by the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). She referred to me specifically in her speech and she attacked me in connection with three specific matters. Why she selected me I do not know. But in all three attacks she completely missed the target each time. I want to reply briefly to the three attacks for the sake of the record. In the first place the hon. member for Drakensberg said that the meetings which the two Ministers of Agriculture held in the Free State last year&#x2014; and she referred specifically to me as though I had confirmed this fact&#x2014;were meetings by invitation only; in other words, that only Nationalists were admitted to the meetings. I want to say here that that is the most untrue statement that she has ever made and she has made many untrue statements in this House. Nothing of that nature happened. These were public meetings which were open to the public. Those meetings were advertised far and wide and in order to confirm what I say here I want to say that at one of the meetings at which I was present the so-called leader of the United Party in the Free State put certain questions to Ministers in his capacity as a farmer. He and a large number of his followers were present at the meeting. So that accusation of the hon. member for Drakensberg is completely untrue.</p>

<p>Oh no, I asked the Whip, the hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst), to call her because I wanted to reply to her. I was not able to enter the debate sooner. But now I want to ask the hon. member to issue this invitation to his whole party and to the hon. member for Drakensberg. I am again going to ask the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing to address a meeting in my constituency this year and if he can find time to do so, I want to ask the Whip to invite the United Party in the Free State to that meeting. They will be welcome because this is the only way in which the United Party supporters in the Free State hear the truth. When the United Party speakers hold meetings in the Free State and the Nationalists do not attend those meetings, they have no audiences. We invite them to our meetings. The same holds good for the other accusations of the hon. member for Drakensberg. She said that I held secret house meetings in my constituency. I want to say that that is also an untruth. It is true that I held report meetings in every branch of my constituency, most of them on farms, but everyone was welcome to attend those meetings. It is precisely because of this fact that things are going so well with the National Party in my constituency. The hon. member accused me further of having said certain things at these secret house meetings in pursuance of what she was supposed to have said in the House and in pursuance of an accusation which she made against me in regard to what I was supposed to have said last year. I just want to say that during a report meeting in my constituency&#x2014;and she referred specifically to Bultfontein&#x2014;as far as I can judge from a United Party pamphlet which was distributed there shortly before her arrival (I do not know whether she or the United Party organizer was the inspiration of this distorted United Party pamphlet), but at a meeting at Bultfontein which I addressed and at which the United Party supporters were present and where questions were put to me, they referred amongst other things to what had happened during last year&#x2019;s agricultural debate here and the United Party supporter who asked the questions did not know quite how to frame his questions. He was ashamed to say to whom he was referring and I had to help him by saying: &#x201C;I think that you are referring now to Aunt Sannie,&#x201D; and he agreed. This United Party organizer, a certain Mr. Hanoke, distributed a pamphlet in which he made a certain quotation from Hansard, including an interjection in which I was supposed to have asked: &#x201C;Do you think that that is humiliating work?&#x201D;, in pursuance of what the hon. member for Drakensberg had said. That was where he stopped. Just for the purpose <i>of</i> the record I want to make the full quotation here. The part they quote in their pamphlet is as follows [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is to become of those people who are unprepared for that work? Where must they go? Must they come here to sweep the streets of Cape Town or must they load parcels on to the trains, or what must become of them? Must they clean offices in Pretoria or Johannesburg? Is that what they must do?</block>

<p>That is what the hon. member for Drakensberg asked and she did the same thing here to-day. On the first occasion I asked by way of interjection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> Do you think it is humiliating work?</block>

<p>To which she replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want the Minister to tell them that they need not do that humiliating work.</block>

<p>These were the words of the hon. member for Drakensberg. Then the hon. the Minister said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say that they must be efficient.</block>

<p>To which the hon. member for Drakensberg replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I want the hon. the Minister to tell me what alternative work he is going to give them. He has said this afternoon that there should be fewer farmers on the land.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member sat down to give me an opportunity to put a question to her. I put this question to her&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">May I ask the hon. member whether she thinks that the work that she has mentioned here is humiliating work?</block>

<p>Remember, she had just said so! She then said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No, I do not think that it is humiliating work.</block>

<p>Then I said to the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But that is what you have just said.</block>

<p>To which she replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No, the hon. member said that it was humiliating work, not I.</block>

<p>From what I have just quoted to you you will see that it was she who had just said that previously. This merely shows that the hon. member tries to make political capital out of the agricultural debates simply because that party has nothing constructive to offer, with the exception of one hon. member who spoke today to whom I shall refer just now. I really think that this debate was a triumph for the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing because of the fact that no criticism at all was passed of the policy that he is following. There was one exception and I want to congratulate the hon. member in this regard. The hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) said that research must be done in connection with marketing as far as the Egg Control Board is concerned, and he said that new markets must be found. I want to refer him to the Report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and <span class="col_6649_6650" refersTo="page_0657"/>Marketing, who has this to say on page 2 of his report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Apart from the work of two committees, viz., the committee to inquire into the Bantu Markets for Agricultural Products and the Co-ordinating Committee on Local Advertising by the Control Board, a number of individual Marketing Boards are engaged in finding additional outlets for their products. The Egg Board for instance, is sponsoring a campaign undertaken by a firm of experts in this field.</block>

<p>This is precisely what has been advocated by the hon. member. His was a constructive suggestion but from this report it is clear that this was already being done by the Egg Control Board before he mentioned it.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite have stated in the past, and to-day as well, that they are tired of hon. members on this side and people outside saying that the farmers should farm in a better fashion, that they should produce more, that they should farm more efficiently and that they should produce more cheaply. If it is such a terrible thing for an appeal to be made to the farmers to farm more efficiently, what do those hon. members actually want? Do they not also want efficiency in the sphere of agriculture just as in all other spheres? After all that is the only way in which one can meet foreign competition. If our farmers do not keep pace with and adapt themselves to world conditions and if they do not farm more efficiently, it is obvious that they will fall behind the industry in other parts of the world. It is necessary for the Department and the Minister and all who are really interested in the industry to urge our farmers continually to be more efficient. This is also in their own interests. This is the only way in which they can raise their profit margin. Hon. members have said that things are going so badly with the farmers. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I feel obliged to correct a charge which has been levelled by the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) at my colleague, the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee). I was not in the House but I gather that she said that during a visit of his to the constituency of Marico, when he held a series of meetings there, the public appealed to me after his departure never again to ask him to visit the district to hold meetings. That is not true; she has sucked that out of her thumb. At three well attended meetings the public listened with interest to and appreciated the speeches of the hon. member and they also told me that the hon. member would again be welcome in Marico. I do not know where the hon. member for Drakensberg gets her information from. She must have sucked it out of her thumb.</p>

<p>The agricultural industry is one of the most important economic branches in our country and I, together with other representatives of platteland constituencies, am very proud to know that there are 118,000 active farmers in the agricultural industry who provide the country with its most elementary needs and who ensure that there is food in the larder. These 118,000 farmers represent 10 per cent of the Whites who are actively engaged in the economy of our country. They own 106,000 farms comprising 83,000,000 morgen of land plus 25,000,000 morgen which are farmed by tenant farmers and share croppers. This land is valued at R3,400,000,000 and the farmers have invested no less than R4,521,000,000 in that land. When we add that together it amounts to R7,921,000,000&#x2014;excluding the immovable property and movable property&#x2014;and when we think of it that the farming community has liabilities to the value of R395,000,000 we find that they are solvent to the tune of R7,526,000,000 which proves that the farming population controls an appreciable part of the economic structure of the country and are consequently good businessmen as well. I have data here which show that of the institutions which give credit against mortgage bonds farmers, including retiring farmers, are responsible for 18.6 per cent. That is higher than the figure in respect of insurance companies which invest only 17.5 per cent and the Land Bank with 14.5 per cent and other institutions which invested less. That shows you, Sir, what our farmers are also achieving in that field. We are proud of the fact that those 118,000 farmers have been successful in contributing 10.4 per cent to the gross national income, as the hon. member for Groblersdal said a moment ago, which means an amount of R846,700,000 and that represents an increase of 37 per cent since 1952. If we compare that with the increase in the agricultural production of other countries in the post-war period, we find that this is 50 per cent higher than in the case of Western Europe and approximately 25 per cent higher than in the case of North America. If this phenomenal development could take place in a country like South Africa with its uncertain and unfavourable climatic conditions, it says a great deal for courage and ingenuity and power of perseverance of the South African farmer. It also says a great deal for their ability to apply those effective farming methods which has enabled them to produce more per smaller unit to produce more maize, wheat, etc., per morgen, to make better use of technical guidance in circumstances which are totally different from those in Europe. In South Africa farmers go in mainly for extensive farming which makes it much more difficult to achieve that high production on smaller units than in other countries. This progress is also accompanied by problems. It has meant that more has been produced and that there has been a higher percentage of production as far as agricultural products are concerned than the increase in the growth of the population and that more has been produced particularly as far as certain agricultural products are concerned than can be consumed locally. Production has exceeded local consumption. I have in mind products such as wines, maize, citrus, cheese <span class="col_6651_6652" refersTo="page_0658"/>and eggs, etc. The production has exceeded the consumption in our own country. That means that one of our great problems is the disposal and export of those products, their distribution on the local market and their exportation at competitively low prices overseas. Our most important problem is the high costs of production. Over the last ten years there has been a tremendous rise of over 50 per cent in the price of land; in the maize area it was from 42 per cent to 72 per cent; in the wheat area from 9 per cent to 13 per cent; in the cattle area the increase was from 41 per cent to 89 per cent and in the sheep area from 36 per cent to 51 per cent. That represents an average increase of approximately 56 per cent. Then you have the increase in farming implements of approximately 12 per cent and the increase in wages which the farmer has to pay, of approximately 24 per cent. The general average increase was approximately 20 per cent to 30 per cent over the past ten years while there was a decrease in the prices obtained for the products. If all these factors are taken into account we realize what we as farmers actually require from the Minister, namely, that in so far as marketing is concerned, the Government should really assist us and see to it that the most modern methods of distributing the farmers&#x2019; products right up to retail trade and the consumer are applied, and that the most modern methods of packing should always be studied so that the product can reach the consumer in the most attractive form as is the case in the retail trade as far as textile goods and other articles are concerned so that the product can be marketed profitably. The product must be advertised in such a way that the public is actually tempted to buy something which they do not perhaps even need. That is what we need as far as local marketing is concerned and that also applies to our exports overseas. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when the hon. the Minister replied before lunch, he did not reply to one of the specific attacks that hon. members on this side made on him in relation to agricultural prices. We dealt specifically with dairy products, and also with other products, particularly in relation to the cost of production. We gave him chapter and verse. I pointed out the shortage of milk in Natal to-day and I quoted what the M.O.H. of Durban said, and what the Secretary of the Producers&#x2019; Union said. Others quoted what the Natal Agricultural Union said, but he did not reply to one of those charges. Sir, we are not dealing with this on a political basis, but as a matter of economics. You cannot go on producing at a loss. Then he wonders why there is a tremendous reduction in production and why we are now importing cheese and condensed milk. I dealt with the figures supplied by his own Department ever since 1958 to this year. There was only one figure I had not got to when my time elapsed, and that was the question of the retail price of milk in the controlled area in Natal, where the only change in the retail price of milk upward has been a small charge allowed on fresh milk, and that was in the retail price to cover the extra distribution cost fixed by a wage determination made on behalf of those engaged in milk distribution. But the extra wage costs of the producer have not been taken into account at all. To-day we are all paying higher wages because we have to compete with commerce and industry, and with the policies of this Government we will be more and more in competition with commerce and industry due to the standard of living of the non-Whites going up throughout the country, and if we wish to retain our labour we will have to pay higher wages, but the Minister is not prepared to take that cost into consideration when determining the cost of production. The Government on the one hand says to all producers who engage labour that they hope they will put up wages. The Railways, the largest employer, did not put up wages to any extent, but we are asked to do it, and when we do we are not allowed to include it in our costs, but commerce and industry can allow for it in their charges for whatever they produce. The farmer who produces industrial milk actually had a reduction of 2c per lb. of butterfat, and more or less a similar equivalent was worked out per 100 lbs. of industrial milk during the last two years, although his fodder and labour costs have increased. When we listened to the Minister, the way he dealt with the whole question of the cost of production, we begin to realize why during the recess in the Free State the farmers, not on political lines but purely on the question of agricultural economics, felt that they had no confidence in this Minister. But listening to the Minister and then in due course to the hon. member for De Aar-Colesberg, who tried to defend him, and tried to make out that the farmers were making a good living to-day, why is it that this Minister and the Minister of Finance and other Ministers boast that this Government is such a fine farmers&#x2019; Government and why do they make all these millions of rand available in loans to the farmers, to save them from going insolvent? It is because the prices are completely uneconomic. Those who rely on overseas markets, except perhaps for wattle to-day where we are having competition from quebracho, the fruit farmers and others who rely on their own marketing efforts are doing well, but those who have to rely on the Minister and the control boards are all suffering because this Minister fixed the prices at an uneconomic level, and he is using the Marketing Act not to protect the farmers, but he is prostituting the Act to keep our prices down. He must either subsidize the cost of production or subsidize the consumer so that the farmer can make a decent living.</p>

<p>In his reply to me the hon. the Minister asked me whether I had not recommended doing away with quotas, and would I recommend doing away with fresh milk quotas in the Durban area, because there is a shortage of milk. I want to deal with this very fully. I <span class="col_6653_6654" refersTo="page_0659"/>want to ask the Minister whether he would recommend doing away with quotas in the Durban market or any other fresh milk market like Johannesburg or Cape Town?</p>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is too low. The very fact that 127 producers of milk supplying Durban have gone out of business is to my mind sufficient evidence that they cannot produce at this price, and to-day there is a shortage of 1,000 gallons a day in Durban alone, whereas in other years there were surpluses, which shows that the price fixed by this Minister is uneconomic. [Interjections.] If the Minister knows anything about it&#x2014;and I do not think he is a suitable man to control the milk market and the prices to the consumers; he does not seem to know anything about it judging from the way he has fixed the price of milk&#x2014;he should know that the whole basis of getting <i>a</i> satisfactory milk supply all the year round is a quota price for a regular supply, i.e. for those supplying the market with a certain quantity every day all the year round; and the surplus price is paid when there is a surplus of milk. But when there is a shortage, the surplus falls away, and on that surplus milk the people who produce the surplus milk which is used in the time of shortage earn a higher quota in the ensuing year. That is how it operates, and if the Minister does not know that it is time he did his homework. It is quite impossible to stabilize the milk market without a quota. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to refer to a few aspects of the maize marketing system. The one-channel system of marketing was introduced in 1944 when we were experiencing shortages in contrast to the period of surpluses that we are now experiencing. But in spite of that it was found necessary to retain this one-channel system of marketing. This system has certain unfavourable results. Firsly, there is a uniform price for maize throughout the country. This means that the producer who is close to the market in actual fact subsidizes the producer who is some distance away from the market, and it is also an encouragement to produce maize in regions which are perhaps less suitable for that purpose. The fixed margin of profit which is enforced by the one-channel system is an average one, an inflexible one, and at the moment we need a more flexible system. There are also the administrative expenses connected with this system which are adversely affecting us at present. The crux of the whole matter from the farmers&#x2019; point of view is that the present price control measures are not the most suitable measures to effect a fair distribution of personal income amongst the maize farmers. It is becoming clear that we will not be able to continue in this way for very much longer and that we will have to consider determining price differences on a regional basis as well. We will have to inquire into the position. I know that many problems are inherent in this system and that an investigation of this nature will bring many problems to light, but it is necessary for us to start thinking along the lines of price determination on a regional basis. I am making an appeal here particularly for the Eastern Transvaal which at the moment is being penalized more than any other region under the present system. Time will not permit me to discuss this matter fully but the hon. the Minister is aware of the fact that the price determination of maize at the moment is most unfavourable to the Eastern Transvaal. Let us come back to the question of an average price for the country. This we find is to the detriment of certain areas, and particularly the Eastern Transvaal. [Interjection.] The hon. the Minister of Information says that it is favourable to other areas but we want to have a fair regional distribution so that one man does not feel that he is subsidizing another who may perhaps be farming in a less favourable region.</p>

<p>I want to make another point in this regard and that is that the position of the production areas in relation to the harbours from which we export about half of our production today must also be considered and that we must also investigate the matter to try to effect a fair basis of distribution in this respect as well. There is also the aspect of distribution which I feel should be investigated and our aim ought to be to keep the costs as low as possible when this regional division takes place, and to eliminate handling as far as possible. I am convinced that we can find a better market for our maize locally. The Government has made an effort in this regard by introducing the stock factor into the crop regions, a very well-meant scheme, but unfortunately in practice it has not always appeared to produce the results that has been envisaged in this regard. But I feel that ways and means can be found to supply the feeder of slaughter stock with maize at a low internal price. We must of course bear in mind the economic use of maize in a programme of this nature, and I believe that I can say without fear of contradiction that generally speaking we do not make the best use of maize as a stock feed. When we see this against the price structure for other commodities, I feel that we are not making the best economic use of maize.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to ask the hon. the Minister to have a thorough investigation made into a system, firstly, of regional prices, but also to go further and to work out the implications and give us an opportunity to consider the application of a system of guaranteed adjusted minimum prices, floor prices, on a regional basis for our maize. I know that there are implications and dangers in this connection but I do not think that we have the necessary information at our disposal to be able to pass judgment and draw a comparison between the present one-channel system and a system of adjusted minimum regional prices.</p>

<p>In all cases they have been opposed to the decisions of the various boards. The Marketing Act has given us stability in this country. It has established boards for each branch of farming, boards which control their own affairs and bring about stability. If we had not had the Marketing Act, the farmers would have been ruined. Some of them say that the United Party was responsible for that Act. Well, it was passed under the policy of General Hertzog and General Smuts, the same man whose downfall they caused. But what did they do? What then happened? On 4 September they introduced emergency regulations and they shelved the whole of the Marketing Act. Everything was done by means of emergency regulations. Our wool was sold by means of emergency regulations. Our meat market was controlled by emergency regulations. They even went so far as to close down the agricultural college at Grootfontein. That is what the United Party did. Let us take the case of wool. If we consider the great losses that the farmers suffered under their system we know why it was that the wool farmers received the small sum of &#x00A3;10,000,000 for their entire wool clip. The next year the amount was again &#x00A3;10,000,000. It was after this side of the House proved that this United Party scheme was completely hopeless that General Smuts went north and got us a 15 per cent increase when Australia only got 10 per cent, but all this came from the National Party. What have we done since we did away with that control system of theirs? The lowest price that we have ever got for our wool since the National Party came into power has been &#x00A3;36,000,000 as against &#x00A3;16,000,000 which was the highest that the wool farmers received under United Party Government, towards the end of the war. These are the people who want the wool farmers to believe them. All our sheep were slaughtered because they were commandeered. They commandeered the farmers&#x2019; sheep at Cradock at 7&#x00BD;d. per lb. and the best lamb went for 9d. per lb. They also fixed the price of maize at 19s. 3d. There was no basis at all. The highest price that we ever got was 21s. Then it came down again to 19s. The maize farmers produced more than we needed and what did that United Party Government do? They exported that maize and they took &#x00A3;5,000,000 out of the pockets of the farmers and paid it into the Treasury. After the National Party came into power Minister Havenga repaid &#x00A3;2,000,000 into the reserve fund and since that time the maize farmers have flourished. Just think of what the crop was at that time and compare it with the present crop of 17,000,000 bags! These are the people who think that they can go back to the platteland, but the public remember them very well. The Strauss scheme brought them to where they are and that is why they will stay there. They all had to leave the platteland and go to the cities and now they want to return to the platteland, but they can forget about that. I want to say that there are only two problems experienced by the farmers in South Africa. Prices are quite stable and everything is worked out on a sound system, a system that has been worked out by experts and is administered by efficient boards and a sympathetic Minister. But there are a further two points. Those prices are quite adequate but there are two factors that we cannot control and that we must try to control. The one factor is drought and the other is uneconomic holdings. This good Government is trying to find solutions to these two problems. The Orange River scheme is being tackled. Where farmers are farming on uneconomic holdings they are being given economic holdings. We will ensure that the small-scale farmer does not go to the cities. The small-scale farmer will be saved. The son of the farmer who went to the cities under the United Party Government will also be saved. We will see that he is given an economic holding to farm. If we can solve these two problems, and they are going to be solved, South Africa will have an excellent future.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words about meat. We think that the meat scheme can perhaps be improved. The hon. the Minister has appointed two commissions. The first was a departmental commission and the other was the Abattoir Commission. I am convinced that when the new scheme comes into operation that scheme will work very well indeed. We will know how much we need throughout the country and how much we can export. That is why I am convinced that the farmers are safe in the hands of this Government and they will always be safe there. There are not many farmers who are poor Whites to-day. The people in my part of the country are very grateful to the Government. Just think of what it has done by buying up the uneconomic holdings in the Fish River Valley and by placing those people on economic holdings. It is a sympathetic Government that does this sort of thing. I want to ask whether hon. members opposite have made any constructive suggestions to-day? Everything that they have suggested has been aimed at destroying the Marketing Act. They have made wild statements and have gossiped about the hon. the Minister, but the farmers know them well. We will never take them back. They talk about the Free Staters but when one talks with those Free Staters and asks them to vote for the United Party they say that they will never do so. Not only this, but their Bantu policy is so pathetic that a farmer will not even listen to them. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Cradock and Namaqualand have made a great fuss of the debt of gratitude which the farmers owe to the Government. The hon. member for Namaqualand in particular has <span class="col_6657_6658" refersTo="page_0661"/>told us how the farmers thank the Government at agricultural congresses. Sir, the farmers are courteous and hospitable people, but I do not think the hon. member should confuse the farmers&#x2019; courtesy and hospitality with satisfaction.</p>

<p>In a debate such as this the limelight usually falls on the farmers and their interests, but I do feel that a debate of this kind would be unbalanced unless attention was given to the interests of the consumers. Between the consumer and the farmer there exists the old unbreakable bond of need, and since the Minister is charged with the responsibility for the marketing of agricultural products it is his duty to see to it that that need is met in such a way that both the farmer and the consumer are served in the best possible way.</p>

<p>I do not want to talk about the farmer as such at all because I know too little about farming, but I want to talk about the consumer. I do not want to talk about the consumer in general nor do I want to talk about the consumer in the rural areas because there are great differences between the rural consumer and the urban consumer in respect of particular products. I want to confine myself exclusively therefore to the urban consumer.</p>

<p>There are large numbers of factors in the marketing process which I simply cannot understand and which thousands of other people are unable to understand. When one talks to the farmer he continually complains that his prices are not high enough, and anybody who has listened to this debate objectively to-day will have come to the conclusion that in many respects the farmer as such has a good case when he complains about his price structure. As consumers we are also told that the prices paid to the farmer vary; we are also told that there is a big gap between the prices received by the farmer for his products and the prices which we as consumers have to pay on the markets. When we talk to the middleman about this matter he tells us that the farmer is the guilty party; when we talk to the farmer he either tells us that we as consumers refuse to pay or that it is the middleman&#x2019;s fault. We as consumers do not know where the difficulty lies but what we do know is that however much the farmer&#x2019;s prices may vary, whether they are high one week as in the case of meat, and low the following week, there is always one stable price to the consumer, and usually a fairly high price.</p>

<p>If the hon. member had listened he would have heard that I was referring to the large urban markets. The price to the consumer, on the other hand, remains absolutely constant; there is no variation there; he pays 25c or 27c for the poor type of mutton and for a nice piece of mutton he pays as much as 40c. Where does the difference come in? It is out of all proportion. If one has the <span class="col_6659_6660" refersTo="page_0662"/>money to buy a nice leg of mutton and one has to pay 40c, one is simply paying through the neck. Mr. Chairman, I feel unhappy. I believe that it would be a mistake to try to play the consumer off against the producer because I believe that the producer in South Africa not only fulfils a very essential task in our economic structure, but I also believe that he earns his money in a very hard way.</p>

<p>Grapes, to deal with fruit for a moment, cost 10c or 12c per pound at the beginning of the season, that is to say R200 per ton of grapes. I personally know from my own experience that if a grape producer gets R40 per ton, he throws his hat into the air. Even in the middle of the season I still pay 5c per lb. or R100 per ton! Compare that with the farmer&#x2019;s R40. Sir, something ought to be done about this enormous gap between the prices which the farmers receive and the prices which the consumers have to pay. I feel that a great deal can be done to eliminate this impossible situation perhaps by instituting a proper inquiry into the system of distribution. I am one of those people who believe, perhaps mistakenly, that no nation has the right to export its food, for example&#x2014;let alone to subsidize the export of food&#x2014;unless it has first seen to it that the food requirements of every citizen of the State have been fully met and unless it ensures that its people are able to afford the prices of agricultural produce. I feel that these things should be properly gone into by instituting an inquiry into the system of distribution. I make this suggestion to the hon. the Minister with all due deference.</p>

<p>I will come to the hon. member for Maitland; the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) did not make his point clear and in passing I want to tell him that the floor price for mutton has been raised a few times over the past few years, because it had to be adjusted as a result of the average basic selling price. Then for the third time prices were raised again through the medium of a few adjustments that were made in regard to the various grades. There has been a gradual rise in the price of mutton.</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member spoke about the meat price. But it is not my intention to devote much time to the hon. member because all he did was to make a number of statements without giving details.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the hon. member for Maitland and I want to say immediately that a general complaint is that the difference between the price that the producer receives and the price that the consumer has to pay as far as certain grades are concerned is too big. But what is the true position? I am pleased that the hon. member did not adopt a specific attitude; he asked for an investigation. The argument that the buyer always uses is that he buys at a basic floor price which fluctuates to a very large extent from day to day, perhaps in regard to the same grade of meat. I do not know whether the hon. member actually said that this was the case in regard to the same grade of meat.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. KOTZE</person>:</from>

<p>There are two kinds of first grade meat. There is the fat-tail type and the non-fat-tail type. If the fat-tail type is too fatty it is downgraded to 8c and nobody can complain about that. Farmers who send that sort of meat to the market are people who have not followed the guidance given to them through the medium of research. I myself have sent that sort of meat to market but it has been so fatty that nobody could eat it. I am not complaining about it because I breed sheep for the karakul market&#x2014;the fat-tail type. I make up the price with my ewes. If the hon. member goes to my constituency, Gordonia, he will find ample proof of what I am saying. It is the farmer&#x2019;s own fault if he receives a low price when he sends that sort of sheep to market. It is because he has not wanted to follow the guidance given to him by means of research; he has not marketed the usual mutton-breed. As far as the extraordinarily high price is concerned it is clear to us that there is a gap somewhere. I agree with the hon. member that this complaint can be investigated to see whether it is well-founded. The butchers contend that this gap is not so great. The meat is auctioned on the hook and it may appear that the difference between the producer price and the consumer price is very marked because the distributor may buy a particular grade of meat on one market at a somewhat lower price than he may have to pay for the same meat on the next day. On one day he may pay 19c and on the next day he may pay 25c but that difference is to the advantage of the farmer. That play is there all the time and it is allowed to remain in order to stimulate the market in favour of the producer.</p>

<p>The consumer will always pay that price as things stand now. It has not yet been proved that the distributor receives too high a price in all the controlled areas. I agree with the hon. member that this is a matter that can be investigated. He did not try to be clever; he merely asked that the matter should be investigated.</p>

<p>I want to raise another matter briefly in passing because there have been so many <span class="col_6661_6662" refersTo="page_0663"/>complaints about how badly things are going with the farmers. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that in my constituency the prices of farming products are higher than they have ever been before in the history of Gordonia. Prices generally are high. The price of mohair is high: the market for skins is good; the price of dried fruit is high; the price of sultanas is high. Lucerne is being sold at top prices, meat prices are high and cotton prices are being maintained on a high level through the medium of the State. No farmer in my constituency need complain about the prices that he receives for any of his products. Where farmers are still struggling and have struggled this is and has been due to drought. It is due to drought and nothing less than drought. I want to associate myself with the words of appreciation of the hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. G. de K. Maree) to the State for the assistance given to the farmers during periods of drought. If there is a constituency in which the farmers are always complaining, like the constituency of Port Elizabeth (West), that then is the fault of the representative that they have sent to this House. The hon. member should take a look at himself. We should not only look to the hon. the Minister; we should look to the representative of the constituency as well because the State is not sympathetically disposed towards the north-west alone or towards my constituency and not towards the constituency of any other member.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in connection with wheat prices, a point that was also raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West). He lost sight of one fact completely. I do not resent this fact because I know that he is a cattle farmer. He was discussing something that he did not know much about. What I do resent is the fact that he raised the matter here before he had acquainted himself with the facts. The point that the hon. member has overlooked is that the price of wheat is determined over an average period of five years. If setbacks do come and adjustments have to be made, this determination is made over a period of three years. That is the first point that he overlooked. The hon. member attacked the hon. the Minister, but who determines those prices? The Business Committee of the Winter Wheat Area which consists of 11 directors of Sasko, plus the two representatives of the Free State appointed by the South African Agricultural Union, plus another one from the Transvaal, deals with this question of production costs, entrepreneurs&#x2019; wages, and so forth, and there is the Wheat Commission that is composed of representatives of the Wheat Board plus a representative (the Chairman of the Business Committee) of the Winter Wheat Area and other representatives from the Free State, the Cape and the Transvaal. They, together with the Division of Economics and Markets, determine the price. The producer price that is paid to-day is accepted by the representatives of the producers. I just wanted to put this point to the hon. member. Not that I am in complete agreement with the representatives of the producers; not at all; but if he had had more knowledge of the matter he would have raised certain aspects which we could have argued about on common grounds. Unfortunately the hon. member could not discuss all the ramifications of the price structure because he does not have a knowledge of them and that is the reason why we get nowhere in a debate such as this. It is such a pity. That is why we do not make any progress in a debate such as this although we have practical experience of all these things. We simply cannot get past certain points.

<p>When one listens to the hon. member who has just sat down one can only believe that the farmers of Gordonia have never been in such a good position as they are to-day. However, I want to refer to the Minister&#x2019;s reply on a subject which I raised this morning, and I must say that I am very distressed indeed by the attitude which the Minister took up. I can, of course, appreciate the fact that it is not this Minister alone who has to deal with this weighty subject; it is the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, his colleague, the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services and the Minister of Economics who have to deal with it and it always seems to be very difficult to pin anything down definitely because of the fact that we are dealing here with three Ministers. I feel that if the producers themselves were taken into the Government&#x2019;s confidence and if they realized what the position was with regard to the big expense that they have had to face in connection with their grain bags and their wool packs there would be an outcry in the country, and I sincerely hope that before we meet here next year, this position will be clarified in such a way that these extra burdens carried by the producers will have disappeared. I think it will bear repetition that the grain farmers are bearing a burden of about R3,000,000 every year in the case of grain bags and in the case of wool packs about R300,000 to R350,000 a year. Those are enormous figures which we cannot pass over lightly. Sir, I look to the Minister first because I feel that if he digs in his toes he must achieve some results. He occupies that position and we have to look to him to try to save the situation.</p>

<p>The Minister also made some reference to the matter raised by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren), and that is the question of all the levies and the reserves built up over the years by the control boards. I do believe, as the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town rightly said, that it represents an amount of R100,000,000. However, I want to deal with one specific commodity and that is wool. Here the position is very clear and easy to calculate. Our wool clip comprises plus-minus 1,000,000 bales, 300,000,000 lbs. of wool, and it is quite simple to see what the producer pays because he pays R3,000,000 per annum. In the old currency, <span class="col_6663_6664" refersTo="page_0664"/>30s. per bale. Well, to me it has always been a frightening sum and it still is; it is more frightening as we go on from year to year in view of the fact that we have already built up in this one fund which we call our Wool Stabilization Fund an amount of plusminus R25,000,000. Added each year to this R25,000,000 is a sum of R1,200,000. That alone goes to show how fast this fund is being built up. I want to submit at this stage that if there was no market, but if the price was fixed, then with the sum of money which they have in reserve to-day, they could comfortably buy up the entire wool clip. I think it is as well to remember that this investment of the Wool Commission, which, of course, is your Stabilization Fund is distributed as follows: About R8,000,000 is invested with the Public Debt Commissioners, R12,850,000 with the Land and Agricultural Bank and R2,362,000 with banks and other institutions, and a small amount in property. But the interest alone on the present investment is R1,200,000, which is an enormous amount of money. The interest alone is sufficient to meet all your expenses, and yet we are told to-day by the Minister that the Wool Board requires more money for development. They already get R1,800,000 from the producer each year. I wonder if the Minister realizes what empires are being built up. Does he realize that the more money these people get the bigger they are going to develop?</p>

<p>They will eventually have such an empire that this amount will be doubled. I do want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that the time has arrived when the Minister should use his power to suspend the levy. I am not saying that he should withdraw it, but that he should suspend it then he can always reintroduce it. It means that he would put into circulation amongst the farming community R1,200,000 a year. Just imagine what a stimulus that would be. Sir, I have not been able to make up my mind whether members on that side say that the farmers are well-off or badly off; it is a sort of ding-dong battle. Those who are well-off apparently sit here, but when I get outside this House I find the position very different. I mean, we are not all in the same position as the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. H. F. Bekker) who has to shear 300 to 400 bale of wool a year. But it is perfectly clear that if the Minister could allow this R1,200,000 a year to flow into the economy it is going to make a great difference to the country and it is going to relieve the farmer of what I regard as a very unnecessary burden. It is no use referring this matter back to the Wool Board for their decision. The people who are controlling these boards are in very good positions; they are not worried about the small farmer who is probably shearing ten or 15 bales and who, every time he shears, has to make a contribution of R3 on each bale of wool. Quite apart from that, look what he is paying on his wool pack; he is losing 40c on his wool pack; that is another unnecessary expense. I would appeal to the Minister to give this particular matter very earnest consideration and to endeavour to bring about the suspension of this one particular levy until such time as it becomes clear that the fund requires further money.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, if you ever needed evidence that the policy followed by the Department was the right one, then you got it to-day, particularly from hon. members opposite, because every one of them who asked that certain things should be done in regard to our marketing has pleaded for matters with which we are already busy dealing. If only they had read the annual report of the secretary, seeing that they are pleading for a campaign to promote the sale of eggs or butter or cheese, they would have seen in that report that this is already being done; they would have seen that the sale of agricultural products is already being promoted by boards, special committees and so forth in order to stimulate the consumption of those products.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down and who spoke about the wool levy fund has adopted precisely the same standpoint as I have on various occasions, that where one has a stabilization fund and a scheme for the marketing of wool, such a stabilization fund will not be sufficient if one has a market which tends to drop season after season; if one gets a particularly fast drop in the course of a season these funds would not be able to stop it. I said it this afternoon, and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town referred to it. The fund can only cope with fluctuations in the season. I also said this afternoon that we need much money to advertise wool, because wool is a fibre which has to compete with synthetic fibres. Large sums of money have to be spent in promoting the sales of wool and in advertising. It is necessary to spend much money on advertising, as is done by the International Wool Secretariat. I myself said here to-day that I wonder whether the time has not arrived when we should rather take a smaller proportion of the levy for the stabilization fund and then under the present circumstances use the rest to advertise wool. I just want to point out to the hon. member that the wool levy fund is paid directly by the wool producer; it is not paid by the consumer, but by the producer himself. The wool producer has his organized associations of which he is a member. The Wool Board is composed entirely of representatives of the associations of the wool producer. There are no other people on the Wool Board. The representatives on the Wool Board are all nominated directly by the producers&#x2019; associations. The wool grower himself, by means of his associations, asked that that fund should be established for his own protection. The wool producers requested it; they recommended <span class="col_6665_6666" refersTo="page_0665"/>it to the board, and the board advises the Minister. How can the Minister now tell them: &#x201C;Under no circumstances are we prepared to allow you to build up funds&#x201D;?</p>

<p>But I want to come to what hon. members said this afternoon more particularly in regard to the dairy industry. We all know that the dairy industry last year found itself in particularly difficult circumstances because of large surpluses. We could not close our eyes to those surpluses; something had to be done in that regard. Now let us just have a look at our export figures. In 1960-1 25,300,000 lb. of butter was exported; in the 1961-2 season almost 15,700,000 lbs. of butter were exported. Our exports of cheese in 1960-I amounted to 7.100.000 lbs., and in 1961-2 to 7,800,000 lbs. These exports are all done at lower prices than the inland price, in other words, at a loss as compared with the price in this country. These losses had to be recouped, and not only that, but these quantities of butter and cheese had to be stored. Storage costs constitute a tremendously important factor as far as this sort of product is concerned. The Government, in consultation with the Dairy Board, decided that a situation was developing which we could not allow to continue, because the export market is not such that one can continue to suffer such losses and then to recoup them by means of the interior prices. Steps necessarily had to be taken, and steps were in fact taken. There was a reduction in the price of industrial milk and of butterfat, but the Government also contributed its share towards that. Because it is an important industry, the Government said: We cannot allow our dairy industry to go under in the face of this threat, and therefore the Government put an extra subsidy on butter production. The subsidy on butter for 1962-3 alone was R4,600,000.</p>

<p>And what was the sacrifice that the farmer made?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The sacrifice made by the farmer was precisely the same as the amount contributed by the Government. The farmer received 2&#x00BD;c less for his butter and the Government contributed 2&#x00BD;c from the taxpayers&#x2019; money in the form of a subsidy. To allege that the Government has no sympathy with the farmers is nonsense. Circumstances have changed for many reasons. They have changed because a reduction in the price has led to <i>a</i> greater consumption of butter in the country. They have also changed because of the advertising campaign which has led to a greater consumption of cheese. Circumstances also changed for other reasons. Our climatic conditions were such that production fell tremendously. Just take South West Africa, Under normal circumstances South West produces 6,000,000 to 7,000,000 lbs of butter, but for the year concerned it only produced about 2,000,000 lbs. I am not even talking about the other parts of the country. Of course when circumstances change and the supplies warrant it, it is obvious that one can reconsider the price and again meet the producer. Hon. members know that that happens. We saw what happened last year in the case of mealies. When there was a surplus of mealies, and because the price in the previous year did not lead to a sufficient contribution to the stabilization fund, someone had to pay for the export losses, with the result that the levy on maize was increased, resulting in a fall in price. But circumstances this year have changed to such an extent that it is not necessary to impose the same high levy. We did not then say that the price should be reduced to its present level; we said that they must just take what they needed to cover the export losses and no more. It is for that simple reason that the farmer this year gets more for his maize. To allege that the Department and the boards are there only to try to reduce the prices of the farmer is surely the greatest nonsense in the world. We must be realistic. If circumstances occur which make it necessary to take certain steps, then those steps must be taken. We can take those steps in two or three ways. We can let the producer alone contribute, or we can let the consumer in South Africa contribute to such an extent that the interior consumption is reduced, or we can let the taxpayers contribute. But now the Government takes the wise step of asking all three of these groups to make their contributions. If the producer then also has to make a contribution, he must do so because it is really his product which has to compete in the foreign market.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) had much to say about wheat prices. He alleged that wheat prices were reduced because there is no cost basis which can be accepted by the Minister. But that is not true.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The fact is that in 1947-8 a survey of costs for the wheat industry was made. That cost survey was used for 12 years as the basis on which floor prices were fixed. The wheat producer himself, and not I nor the Department, repeatedly, from time to time, at conferences and congresses asked for a new cost survey. On three occasions the Wheat Board decided to recommend to the Minister to have a new cost survey made. I told them on various occasions, because I myself am a wheat farmer and I knew it, that a new cost survey would indicate that the production costs were reduced. But they asked for it and it was done, and it did show a reduction in production costs as compared with the 1948 survey. The wheat farmers held conferences and this new survey was put to them. They accepted this new survey, although the Marketing Board felt that some prices in the new survey were put too high, such as e.g., the price of lamb. In spite of the fact that the Marketing Board considered that the price of lamb was calculated at too high a figure, I was also prepared to <span class="col_6667_6668" refersTo="page_0666"/>accept it as it was and to stand by the wheat farmers in that respect. That had the effect that there was a reduction in prices because it was found that in the past the costs were calculated at too high a figure if the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage remained the same. In this price fixation the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage was also increased as compared with what it was before. In the past 5 per cent was allowed for interest on certain items, and here 6 per cent was allowed for the same items, which amounted to an increase of almost 4c per bag. Over and above that, another 2c were allowed above the cost. Now the hon. member says we should have a basis.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister? In 1961-2 the Minister granted an increase of 7fc because production costs had increased. Was the new cost survey in use already then? Why reduce the price again in 1962-3 by 12c and ascribe it to a reduction in the production costs?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I have just explained to the hon. member that a new cost survey was made. The former increase in cost was in terms of the old survey made in 1948. The new survey came into use last year. Does the hon. member understand it now? The new prices are based on the new survey. On the basis of the new survey, which was accepted by the farmers, the entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage is 6c higher than in the past. The hon. member should bear in mind that the price for wheat is a price fixed in advance. The price which is now being fixed is not in respect of last year&#x2019;s crop. How does the hon. member know what the coming crop will be like? The hon. member advanced the argument that the Minister is waiting until the wheat farms are first producing before he fixes the price. This is the only product in South Africa the price of which is announced in advance. All the other prices are announced at harvesting time. Does the hon. member now want us to wait until harvesting time, and if it is a bad crop we must tell the people that they will get more? The hon. member knows that this survey is taken over five years and the production also over five years.</p>

<p>Hon. members referred to the various methods which should be applied to stimulate the internal consumption of our products. If I have to reply to all the questions put by hon. members, it will take me the whole afternoon to do so, but I just want to refer them to the report of the secretary. There they will see what schemes have been put into operation to promote the consumption of these products. Hon. members should bear in mind that in so far as the promotion of the consumption of agricultural products is concerned, one cannot just make a wild statement and say that if the Natives eat one egg per day, so many more eggs will be consumed. Hon members should remember that food products compete with each other. If one uses more butter, one uses less peanut butter. If one uses more eggs, one consumes less meat, and if one eats more fish one eats less meat. So we have this competition between the various products. It is so easy to say that the Minister and the control boards must see to it that agricultural products are sold and the boards must advertise. But if a board advertises one product, it does in competition with the product of another board. Hon. members should realize that. If meat prices go up too much the people eat more fish. If the price of a certain type of bean becomes too high for the mines, they buy a different type. It is all well and good to advertise, and that is being done, but foodstuffs replace one another. The hon. member said that the consumers should be properly protected. I agree with him The consumer is the most important factor in the farmer&#x2019;s sales of his products. It is in the interest of the producer that prices should be kept as low as possible for the consumer, so that the consumer will use as much as possible of it. We so often hear that the middleman is the exploiter, but who are really the consumers? All the middlemen are also consumers. All the people who deal with the distribution of a particular type of foodstuff are consumers of that foodstuff. We have of course the problem of the high distribution costs. I have already mentioned in this House that to distribute one pint of milk&#x2014;and the price of milk is strictly controlled, costs just as much as the farmer gets for that pint of milk. That is in fact one of our problems. Therefore it is also the function of the Department to ensure that research is done in regard to distribution costs. It is not so easy simply to say what the reason is for the high cost, because distribution costs comprise a tremendous number of factors. One of the factors which raises the cost of distribution is the fact that we have speciality shops. Then we have to ask ourselves whether it is in our interest to close those speciality shops and to have larger organizations which supply food. Would that be in the interest of the public? Another thing which increases the cost of distribution is the deliveries the shopkeepers have to make. The consumer cannot go to the shop, with the result that the shopkeeper has to deliver. Now we ask whether it will be in the general interest for shops to remain open later? There are many factors which influence the cost of distribution. One can take the matter to the other extreme and say that people should be allowed to compete with each other at all hours. All those are problems with which we are faced.</p>

<p>Then I want to come back to the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood). The hon. member spoke about the fresh milk prices. It seems to me the hon. member did not understand what I said at all. He alleged that it was due to the price policy followed that there is not enough fresh milk in Durban. I then told him that if it can be ascribed to the price policy, then it is surely not necessary to have a quota system there: why must one then protect the farmers by <span class="col_6669_6670" refersTo="page_0667"/>means of the quota system, because if it is not economic they will certainly not produce. I put a simple question to the hon. member. He alleged that the Minister was responsible for the fact that there was not sufficient fresh milk. I asked him whether he was prepared to recommend that the quota system be abolished? Then he told me that I understood nothing about the position, I did not know what was going on there. But that is not the point, Mr. Chairman. There was no tampering with the price of fresh milk.</p>

<p>If the price of fresh milk is too low, I again ask the hon. member whether he is prepared to say that the quota system should be abolished? If your production is too low, why limit it by means of quotas?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury referred to the question of land prices. Other hon. members also referred to it. If there is one factor which raises our production costs, it is land prices. I have already said on various occasions that I think land prices are much too high in South Africa. But it is impracticable for the Government to step in and to determine the price of land. Because one allows the farmer the liberty of paying what he likes for land, the Government cannot be expected under all circumstances to keep all the farmers on the platteland. If a farmer is prepared on his own initiative to make an uneconomic investment, he cannot expect the State to save him and to keep him on the land. If he can stay there on his own initiative, well and good, but he cannot expect the State to undertake the function of keeping him there. Secondly, he cannot expect the State to fix prices at such a level that he can produce economically under all circumstances on land for which he has paid an uneconomic price. I think it is very essential for our farmers, when buying land, to take into account more carefully the investment they are making. Until about 15 or 20 years ago the main investment in agriculture for production purposes was the price of land, but to-day, with mechanization, one needs a much greater investment.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kuruman also referred to the price of butter and milk, in regard to which I have already explained what the position is. The point the hon. member really made was that the price increases according to the butterfat content of the milk. We are all aware of the fact that good cheese is made from milk with a high butterfat content. This difference in price is of course based on certain tests which were made. But I can also see that where the price of milk falls and the difference remains the same, one can then have an imbalance between those prices. I think one can only solve this problem by investigating what the position is and what the experience of the factories is.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand spoke about the poultry farmers. He did not say much more than to refer to advertising, to which I have already referred. I want to point out to the hon. member that poultry in particular is one of the products which can be produced so economically to-day that it can compete with mutton. It is one of the articles which competes with other articles of foodstuff, as I said a moment ago. That is also one of the reasons why one cannot just fix any price for a product, because one has to bear in mind the competitive product. The hon. member for Turffontein made the accusation that the Department does nothing to encourage farmers to produce products other than maize. The hon. member is talking the greatest nonsense in the world. The farmers are being advised all the time to produce wool and meat and other products. The Department has gone out of its way to prove to farmers that it is more economic to produce silage than to produce maize under certain circumstances, because silage can be fed to their stock. The hon. member also referred to soya beans. He said that the board had said that they did not control soya beans. But does the hon. member know how a product is controlled under the Marketing Act? The producers of that product must first ask for control. Then investigations are made, and 66 per cent of the producers must ask for it before the product can be controlled. The Minister must be convinced that the majority of the producers want it. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services is continually investigating alternative products to see what the farmers can substitute for maize; and not only to replace maize, but also to find a product which is a legume in order to improve the maize lands. The hon. member never wrote to my Department about it. He is under an illusion. He wrote to the Department of Agricultural Technical Services about it, and now he accuses me of not having replied to it. The hon. member should in future address his letters correctly.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill provides for the building of a new railway line from Fochville to Houtkop. The report of the Railways and Harbour Board in which the building of this line is recommended was tabled on 14 May 1963 and it contains complete details concerning the line and also the reasons why it has to be built.</p>

<p>At present approximately 25,000 tons of goods are being transported daily over the main line from Klerksdorp in the direction of the Witwatersrand. This tonnage will gradually increase and it is expected that by 1970 it will amount to approximately 45,000 tons per day. In both directions between Klerksdorp and the Witwatersrand the present goods traffic amounts to approximately 46,000 tons per day and this tonnage will increase to approximately 82,000 tons per day by 1970. The ore traffic from the Postmasburg area destined for Vanderbijlpark is expected to increase from the present figure of 1,700,000 tons a year to 4,700,000 tons by 1970.</p>

<p>In order to handle this traffic efficiently, it was until recently the intention to effect certain improvements to the existing main line between Klerksdorp and the Witwatersrand via Bank Station in order to increase the carrying capacity of that line. However, as hon. members know, since August 1962 certain subsidences have taken place both under the railway line and in the immediate vicinity, particularly in the Carletonville area. Although the existing railway line has thus far not been seriously affected by the subsidences, the question has arisen whether it will be advisable for the Administration to rely mainly on this railway line for the transportation of heavy goods and main line passenger traffic. A gravimetric survey has consequently been made of the section between Bank and Oberholzer and as a result the incidence of subsidence in the future is expected to increase rather than decrease.</p>

<p>Apart from the aforegoing consideration, suburban passenger traffic in the Rand area is making increasingly greater demands on existing railway facilities, with the result that it has become increasingly more essential to keep through goods traffic out of that area as far as possible. Under present circumstances a large proportion of that goods traffic is still passing over the railway lines which carry that intensive suburban passenger traffic.</p>

<p>In order to solve the problems facing the Administration, the conclusion has been reached that the best solution will be to reinforce the existing railway line between Potchefstroom and Fochville up to main line standards, and to connect Fochville with Houtkop. The new line between Fochville and Houtkop will be approximately 23 miles long and it is estimated that it will cost R7,500,000; it will be up to main line standards and it will be electrified. As hon. members know, the existing railway line between Potchefstroom and Fochville is of branch line standard. In order to ensure that in future it will be able to carry the heavy main line traffic, the line must be re-routed, where necessary, and at the same time it must be electrified and reinforced up to main line standards. The portion of the section between Potchefstroom and Fochville is approximately 30 miles long and it will cost approximately R6,300,000 to strengthen it according to main line standards.</p>

<p>As the result of the gravimetric survey I have already referred to, it has been ascertained that the existing main line between Frederikstad and Midway, which passes over <span class="col_6673_6674" refersTo="page_0669"/>a dolomite formation, is potentially dangerous in so far as subsidences are concerned. Experimental bore-holes have been sunk, and as the result of the information so acquired the railway line in the vicinity of Bank Station has already had to be re-routed for a short distance in order to put it on safer terrain.</p>

<p>It is therefore essential that the alternative main line via Fochville should be brought into operation as soon as possible; the work will be tackled with the least possible delay and it is hoped to make use of that line by the middle of 1965 already.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that heavy goods and passenger traffic will have to be taken over the alternative main line, the intention is gradually to increase its carrying capacity by means of centralized traffic control. Certain technical difficulties in connection with the introduction of this system of control on electrified railway lines still have to be investigated, and because it may take some time before those problems are solved the intention is to provide temporary station facilities between Fochville and Houtkop. Eventually there will be no manned stations on this section.</p>

<p>In the Estimates of Expenditure on Capital and Betterment Works there has already appeared for a few years a preliminary provision for the building of a railway line between Fochville and Houtkop at an estimated cost of R4,400,000 but hitherto a Construction Bill for the building of this line has not been introduced because up to now it has not been urgently necessary. I intend later during this Session introducing additional Estimates in which, <i>inter alia,</i> financial provision for the proposed railway line between Fochville and Houtkop will be made, so that a start may be made with the building of that line.</p>

<p>As a result of the alternative main line which will now be provided between Potchefstroom and the Witwatersrand via Houtkop, the existing line via Bank will of necessity in future be used to a lesser extent. Both goods and passenger train services will still be scheduled over that route to serve the local communities and the gold mines, and it will also still act as a link for the railway line to Lichtenburg and Pudimoe. It is not the intention summarily to suspend all improvements planned for the section Potchefstroom-Randfontein, and the provision of essential facilities to comply with operating requirements will still receive attention.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has already explained the general characteristics of the new line and also the circumstances which have given rise to the placing of this measure before the House to-day in order to get the necessary authority to proceed with the work. He has also outlined the method to be adopted for financing the line and the general overall effects of the new line in relation both to existing railway organization in that area and the new developments. As the hon. the Minister has told the House, the placing of these proposals before the House at this stage, although they probably would have had to come in some form or other sooner or later, probably sooner than later, has resulted from the combined effect of the subsidence which is occurring adjacent to a portion of the line, somewhere in the Carletonville area and also the tremendously heavy increase, particularly goods traffic as well as passenger traffic, now having to be conveyed to and fro over the area principally served by the line which is being affected or may become affected by the subsidence. It would seem that what is happening is that the huge industrial development, both in heavy and light industry, which is taking place in the Vereeniging, Sasolburg and Vanderbijlpark area is undoubtedly making heavier and heavier demands on the Administration, both for the raw material coming in and for the finished product which has to be moved out, either towards the Reef area, where so much of it does go, or to other parts of the country. It is also due to the very big increase in suburban passenger services serving the entire Reef area, the affected line forming portion of the system, and, in particular, traffic to and from the very large concentrations of people built up in the non-White-residential areas which are so rapidly being developed around the Reef and particularly in the vicinity of big industrial areas. As a matter of fact this is one of those occasions when nature seems to have taken a helping hand in one respect in pushing the Railway Administration to make a decision to provide a line of this nature, whereas without that little prod it might have taken some time to reach final agreement.</p>

<p>Not only nature, but also the mining industry.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Well, nature took a hand as well as far as the subsidence is concerned. That gave it a final little push. In a job of this magnitude there are naturally many different interests at stake, interests which do not always see eye to eye, that it is almost impossible to expect that everybody will view the route which the new line is to take as being the most suitable from their point of view. We in the House, as the Minister has said, have had the benefit of the comprehensive report submitted by the Railway Board with a plan of the lay-out of the new line and while it may be difficult to find a solution which is not going to meet the criticism from one portion or other of the areas affected, the Bill does in general give effect to what is in the best interest of the Administration and the country generally in view of the terrain to be covered. Sir, I think some idea may be obtained of the magnitude of the task which has had to be decided upon from a study of the tremendous increase in the goods traffic alone over this area. For instance, over the main line traversing the area from Klerksdorp via Potchefstroom to the Reef, the total traffic to-day is 46.000 tons per day or roughly 16,550,000 tons a year. By the time this line is completed in about 1965 that load will have increased to <span class="col_6675_6676" refersTo="page_0670"/>61,000 tons per day or a total of about 21,000,000 tons a year, and by the end of this decade, in 1970 the goods traffic alone will more or less have doubled over this line. It will then be 82,000 tons per day or 29,500,000 tons a year. I think that alone is complete justification for bringing forward a proposal now to put the line on a new route where it can be trouble-free if there is any extension of the subsidence. We do find in the report of the board itself that after a comprehensive survey of the whole area, they have come to the conclusion that as a result of the survey carried out in the area referred to by the Minister as being over the dolomite area, &#x201C;it could be expected that the occurrence of subsidences was more likely to increase than decrease in the future&#x201D;. With the good record of the Railways for caution and care for the traffic, both human and goods, that it carries, I think the Railways had no alternative but to submit these proposals. One feature of the new line will be to give the Railways an opportunity to demonstrate the proficiency and efficiency of the new road safety measures which we discussed in the House a little while ago, particularly where they affect provincial main road and railway traffic. This line will cross the provincial main road in that area at a number of points, and according to the plans that we have before us and the estimates and specification provided, there will be the modern type of road over rail bridges provided at all provincial main road crossings. Special features will also be adapted for the separation of traffic at all main road crossings or secondary road crossings other than the provincial main road crossings. One can only express the hope that the Administration itself, as I have no reason to doubt they will do, will in completing this line take the most adequate precautions for ensuring the safety of the very large volume of traffic which does move about in that area. In one area the line also does affect certain vested interests in regard to a part of the large non-European development in the area. There the Bill provides for compensation to be paid to the owners of certain portions of that area which will have to be utilized in order to provide access for the railway. Sir, as is to be expected in any matter of this sort, as I mentioned earlier, there will be a difference of opinion between the interests concerned. I understand that an inquiry was held some years back in which the various authorities concerned and the agricultural industry as a whole did meet and discuss with the Administration certain proposals with regard to an increase to the railway capacity in that area. This was before they were affected by the subsidence. Those meetings have taken place and they show the need not only for the expansion of the railway system in that area but the need to cater for the different interests concerned. The line will be one of major importance to the developing industrial area there; it will be one of major importance to the Reef as a whole. If the subsidence goes any further it is only natural that a certain volume of the traffic at present being conveyed over the existing line will be curtailed. There must be different interests there which have been built up largely as a result of the service provided by the existing line. There must be developments which have occurred there as a result of the original provision of these rail facilities. Whatever is to be the future fate of the existing facilities, one would ask that the Administration, to the best of their ability, will safeguard the existing rights and interests which have been built up as a result of these facilities hitherto afforded to them. We will support the Bill as one which is necessary not only for the Administration itself but which is also in the best national interest and which is also to some extent a pointer to the sound development which is taking place in the whole of that area.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill of course deals with the proposed railway line that affects my constituency very intimately, and I should like to mention a few small matters to the hon. the Minister. We quite appreciate that the construction of this line is a matter of urgency, and that is why I should like to bring three matters to the Minister&#x2019;s attention. The first is the name of the station Houtkop. The community at Houtkop comprises only a few railway officials, but the fact of the matter is that the administration of Houtkop falls within the municipal area of Vanderbijlpark. The hon. the Minister will know that we have been negotiating about it for many years. One realizes it is not an easy matter to introduce a passenger service for Vanderbijlpark. I readily concede that at the moment we have a junction; that we have sidings for the industries; that we have a parcels office rendering good service; but now it happens that with this junction of Fochville-Houtkop to the Rand, or conversely, the heavy passenger traffic to the south or conversely from the south to the north, will come very close to Vanderbijlpark. As I have already said, Houtkop falls within the municipal area of Vanderbijlpark. Furthermore, if the geographical situation is looked at, it will be realized that the whole eastern Free State&#x2019;s people who wish to catch the train to Cape Town, to the south, now in all probability will be able to use Houtkop. Even the people of Vereeniging will probably use Houtkop. That applies to Vereeniging, Heilbron, Vrede and the whole of the eastern Free State and Vanderbijlpark itself. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, having regard to all these practical considerations, whether it is not possible to call Houtkop Station Vanderbijlpark Station in this replanning. I should like to point out that all the branch lines serving the industrial areas are joined at Houtkop. All consignments of ore, etc., comes to Vanderbijlpark via Houtkop. I may also point out the tremendous development that has taken place in that area. An amount of R56,000,000 will be spent there during the next few years, and in Vanderbijlpark alone, from now until the end of 1965, as many houses as are in existence at Sasolburg <span class="col_6677_6678" refersTo="page_0671"/>at the present time will be built. For that reason I think it will lend status to Vanderbijlpark and it will be the proper thing to do for such an enormous population, to change the name of Houtkop Station to Vanderbijlpark Station. And then, accompanying that, to take into consideration that since Houtkop is at the present time situated some distance away in the veld, reasonable facilities should be provided for both goods and passengers. As this is completely new planning, I think this will be the proper course to adopt. The hon. the Minister has also pointed out that there will be no manned siding between Fochville and Houtkop; in other words, Houtkop and I hope the future Vanderbijlpark Station will definitely be the great junction for the Vaal triangle and for the eastern Free State.</p>

<p>Then there is a final point I should like to mention, and that is that the golden highway, i.e. from Johannesburg to Vanderbijlpark. Sasolburg and the Free State goldfields, will of course cross this line once it has been constructed. I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that the traffic on this road is colossal. The road was built in 1953 and since then it has had to be rebuilt in consequence among others of the exceptionally heavy traffic. That traffic is very fast traffic. The road has been built in such a way that it lends itself to rapid traffic. It is a road too that has already taken great toll of human lives at various other points, and I should like to appeal very earnestly to the hon. the Minister that a bridge should be built over or under&#x2014;at that point probably under the road&#x2014;the railroad. I know the environment and I know that road, and I can predict here to-day already, that if that is not done, in spite of all the other good methods adopted at the present time to make crossings safe, the crossing there will claim lives as from the first day unless a bridge is built. There is a gravel road crossing this macadamized road in that vicinity, and even with the little traffic on that gravel road, several people have already lost their lives in collisions between cars using the macadamized road and cars approaching the macadamized road via the gravel road. Those are the three matters I wish to bring to the urgent attention of the Minister. The first is the change of name of Houtkop Station to Vanderbijlpark Station: the second is the question of good and effective traffic and goods facilities at Houtkop Station, and thirdly the question of a proper crossing where this railway line and the golden highway will cross each other.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister will agree that the section of line between Bank and Welverdiend which includes the area of subsidence between Oberholzer and Bank is probably one of the most important sections of line on the whole of our railway system because apart from the line going through the Free State, this section virtually links the whole of the northern railway system to the southern railway system. It is virtually the only rail link. I mention this because when we read what traffic increases are anticipated over the next four or five years over this section, it is surprising to find that it first requires a subsidence before positive action is taken to relieve a situation which obviously has been known to the Minister&#x2019;s planning council, apart from the Railway Board, that is to say this anticipated increase of traffic over this section of line. I mention this because on former occasions we have asked the Minister to give an indication of the future planning that has been taking place, and I mention it also because as the Minister knows representations have been made by important bodies such as farming associations and the Vereeniging Municipality on one occasion, I think, and other important bodies representative of industry and commerce with regard to this matter. The proposals contained in this Bill obviously provide the solution to the situation which the Railway Administration and the Minister have faced over this particular section. Having said that, there are a few points I would like to make to the Minister. I think the Minister will remember that I raised the question of this subsidence in Committee of Supply. At that time the Minister gave a public assurance that the Administration was watching the position on that particular section, where there was a possible danger to life, most carefully. If I remember correctly the Minister also stated that instructions had been given that an investigation was to be carried out as to the likelihood as to further subsidences in this area, and on a subsequent occasion, in reply to a question put to the Minister on the Order Paper, he gave further information which may have hinted at the proposals now put forward in this Bill. Sir, I would like to emphasize what is stated in the report itself; it says that as a result of gravimetric survey, &#x201C;It could be expected that the occurrence of subsidences was more likely to increase than decrease in the future.&#x201D; We are faced here with the situation that there is no hope of completing this line within the next two years. In other words all existing traffic together with any increased traffic, despite the fact that the diversionary route to the Free State is practically jammed chock-a-block, will still be conveyed over this section, and I would like to ask the Minister whether he can give a categorical assurance to the House and to the travelling public that the Administration will take the greatest care with regard to trains which traverse the Oberholzer-Bank section. May I ask too if, apart from the relaying of the track which is taking place at the present time, the Administration has given any consideration to the complete relaying of that section of the track where these subsidences are likely to occur and where the gravimetric survey indicates that the track may be laid with comparative safety. It is clear that this Bill is designed not only to cope with the danger of subsidences in that area but also to meet the traffic needs of that section of the railway line.</p>

<p><span class="col_6679_6680" refersTo="page_0672"/>Then with regard to the cost, it is estimated by the board that the total cost will be about R7,500,000. That is the total estimated cost for construction and electrification of the 23 miles of new line. The Minister quoted a figure this afternoon which I did not quite catch, but if I recall correctly he mentioned the figure of R6,000,000&#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, the estimated costs of building the line is given here in the Estimate included in the report namely R7,500,000. Obviously the Potchefstroom-Fochville section will have to be brought up to main line standards. There may be diversionary or minor works, apart from the complete relaying of the rails, in order to bring the line up to main line standards. But must I take it that the figure mentioned by the Minister this afternoon was R6,000,000. I am sorry I did not catch the figure.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Well, that will make a total estimated cost of nearly R14,000,000, which brings the cost per mile for the whole section of the line to a comparatively high figure. Obviously the R6,300,000 will have to be voted on the additional Estimates and will appear under certain heads such as the relaying of the track and electrification, or is it going to be shown as a total estimate for the total reconstruction of this section of the line? We have found in the past that these items are put on the Estimates as minor items and works which are carried through for a period of time. This is virtually an assessment of a completely new section of line between Potchefstroom and Houtkop. I shall be glad if, when the Minister replies, he will indicate how these moneys will appear on the additional Estimates; whether the amount will appear as a globular sum for the whole construction or whether it will appear under different heads such as electrification and so on, with no indication of what the particular moneys are for. We have the Estimates before us and we know what the electrification will cost; we know what the track system will cost; we know what the minor works will cost, the capitalization and the interest; we have the globular amount for the 23.8 miles chain, but we certainly have not got it in regard to the Potchefstroom-Fochville section which is a virtual reconstruction, and I shall be glad if the Minister can give us some information in that regard.</p>

<p>My other point is this: The report makes it perfectly clear that the traffic carried over the Free State section, the Vereeniging-Bloemfontein-Kimberley section, has already reached maximum capacity and that the construction of this new section between Potchefstroom and Houtkop will mean that there will be relief on that line and that the need for diverting the traffic will no longer exist to the extent that it does at the present time. But the report also emphasizes that a large portion of this additional traffic which it is estimated for the next five years will come from Postmasburg, a lot of which will have to travel to Newcastle. The report emphasizes that this diversion will mean that this traffic coming ex Postmasburg destined for Newcastle will go via Potchefstroom, Fochville and Vereeniging to Germiston, and then go south from there. If you look at the railway map it does not seem entirely correct to me, because the traffic will still make a detour. I do not see how it is going to help the position because the traffic will still travel on the double line through Meyerton to Germiston and then along the main line to Newcastle. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he could indicate at this stage what plans the Administration has for making the line between Redaan and Grootvlei a line of main line standards so that the through traffic to Newcastle will not have to traverse the Witwatersrand system at all.</p>

<p>I just want to ask the Minister whether he can give us an indication because I know this matter is of interest to other hon. members. As the hon. member for Simonstown has said, we on the Witwatersrand particularly welcome this development because it is in the interests of our industrial economy there and also in the interests <span class="col_6681_6682" refersTo="page_0673"/>of the railway system and the passenger traffic carried by the Railways.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to raise three matters. In the first place, the map that appeared in the newspapers in respect of this proposed new line indicated that the mainline for passenger traffic will now run as follows: Johannesburg, Germiston, Vereeniging, Houtkop, Fochville, Potchefstroom, Cape Town. That means that the East Rand route once again is being loaded and that Germiston will have still more traffic. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister why the other route cannot be used, namely Johannesburg-Langlaagte-Houtkop. It will reduce the burden on the East Rand, and it will at least bring the West Rand, which now actually will be losing their main line service, within reach of a station such as Langlaagte for those who wish to travel to Cape Town.</p>

<p>The second matter I should like to mention is the question of vested interests along the existing line, which will not exactly become obsolete now, but which will lose much of its value. I am not really the Member of Parliament concerned, but one feels that as interests in the area where these subsidences have taken place are affected and since the railways are being removed, attention should be given on the part of the Government to the owners who are going to be prejudiced in consequence.</p>

<p>The third matter I should like to mention concerns the existing line between Randfontein and Potchefstroom. That line has recently been tremendously improved, because we were unaware of the subsidences. I know of two very expensive overhead bridges completed during the past financial year. I was given the promise that during this year a further crossing would be eliminated between Middelvlei and Randfontein Station. It is a very important and dangerous crossing. In recent times 68 people have been injured there and more than 18 people have lost their lives as a result of collisions. I know that crossing was going to be eliminated, but because it is now proposed to divert the main line, it seems to me that this matter is going to be reconsidered, according to the Department. It will amount to this, that we shall possibly have to wait a very long time before that crossing is eliminated. In view of the fact that trains will still continue to move across this dangerous crossing, I should like to ask the Minister to see to it that that crossing is eliminated as soon as possible.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to say a few words with reference to the new development taking place there in consequence of the circumstances mentioned by the hon. the Minister and which are known to all of us. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister what the position of the station at Oberholzer is going to be in future; will they proceed now with the proposed station they were building or will there be a change in the general layout of the station, or will there be a reduction in the amount of money to be spent there? Secondly, I should like to express my regret that as a result of a natural phenomenon in the dolomite formation there, this has really come about. Subsidences have occurred as a result of the extraction of gold and the pumping out of water. I am sorry that Carletonville, which is a progressive town, the thirteenth biggest city in the Republic of South Africa as regards its population, will now not, as we may expect, become the centre via which a main railway line will be running. In spite of the disappointment there is, I should like to assure the Minister that we act like grown-up people; we understand the position that this new railway line will have to bypass Carletonville. I am sorry that this is so, and at the same time&#x2014;before you stop me, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;I should like to express the hope that these subsidences will not recur, because it is a terrible thing not to know whether your home will still be there the next day.</p>

<p>Then I should like to express the hope that the Railway Administration will carry out the diversion of the railway line between Potchefstroom and Fochville in such a way, even if it should involve a little extra expenditure, that it will cause the least noise and inconvenience to the inhabitants. At the time when the old Fochville-Potchefstroom line was constructed, it was not visualized that Potchefstroom would expand so much. As there were only two little trains running per week, on Fridays and Tuesdays, the people built their homes near the railway line. It was quite an occasion to hear the trains passing. According to the report it is now going to become one of our main lines and according to the tonnage that will be carried over the proposed Fochville-Potchefstroom line, it will now become a very busy section. I should like to urge, on behalf of that whole environment, that the proposed railway extension should cause the people there the least inconvenience. All of us are taxpayers, are we not; the life of the Railway will last till the end of time, but our lives are limited. The Minister must please be merciful and spare the people there any possible inconvenience they may have to suffer.</p>

<p>Furthermore I should like to congratulate the Minister on this expeditious action. We know what the Opposition would say if there were to be an accident in consequence of a subsidence. While we deplore it that this should be so, I express to the Minister our thanks, on behalf of my constituency which is most affected by this diversion. We want to congratulate him on this expeditious action taken in order to prevent possible accidents and loss of life. We hope that the proposed diversion will be completed as speedily as possible at the least cost and with the least delay.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) said that nature had played a part in speeding up the building of the new line between Fochville and Hopeville. I interjected and said it <span class="col_6683_6684" refersTo="page_0674"/>was really the mining industry which had played a very significant part. What I meant by that was this that it was as a result of the activities of the gold-mining industry in that area that we have had those subsidences. It is dolomite formation and there are big underground caves filled with water. As a result of the pumping out of that water subsidence has occurred. The dolomite has deteriorated, it has started to break away and that has resulted in those subsidences. As a matter of fact, I am not so sure that I have not got a claim against the mining industry. I have even told my legal adviser to inquire into the matter to see whether I cannot claim the cost of this new line from the mining industry. They are directly responsible for these subsidences.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) has asked that the name of the station Houtkop should be changed to Vanderbijlpark Station. I have no objection to that. I suggest that he should approach the municipality of Vanderbijlpark and the residents of Houtkop to apply officially for that. I shall then know that the request comes from the community as a whole. I know the hon. member represents the community, but I do not believe he has discussed it with them as yet. Let them make official representations and I assure him I shall consider it favourably. Of course if there is a need for additional facilities at Houtkop for handling passengers and goods, it will be provided.</p>

<p>As regards the bridge across the highway, I should like to ask the hon. member to look at the route map attached to this. He will then see that provision is made for the construction of bridges across all the important roads.</p>

<p>My reply to the hon. member for Simonstown in connection with the part which nature had played is also my reply to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant). He said he was surprised that it took a subsidence to get the Minister to build a new line. The position is actually this: A new line has been contemplated for some years; provision has been made for it in the Estimates. I explained in my opening remarks that a Construction Bill had not yet been introduced. Had no subsidence occurred the new line would probably not have been built for some years. The existing line with the contemplated improvements would have been quite adequate to convey all the traffic that will be offering over the next few years. The introduction of centralized traffic control from Klerksdorp to Midway was contemplated; as a matter of fact tenders have already been issued. With the introduction of centralized traffic control and the provision of certain other facilities on that line the Midway-Klerksdorp line would have been able to handle all the traffic offering for quite a number of years to come. These subsidences were quite unexpected. As usual the Administration did not go to sleep on the job. Directly they occurred geologists were appointed to inquire into the whole matter, test boreholes were sunk, the line was deviated between Carletonville and Bank and a decision was taken that the new line must be built immediately as a matter of urgency. As I have already explained the existing line will continue to be used but it will be used mainly for local traffic and traffic to Lichtenburg and Pudimoe.</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know whether we had given consideration to the complete deviation of the existing line. Consideration has been given to that but the whole of the area is of dolomite formation. There is no place in the vicinity of the existing line where a new line can be built with any safety. That is the reason why the line has to be built from Houtkop to Fochville. We also inquired whether it should be built from Fochville to Midway, but if that line is built it will also go over certain dolomite formation. To be on the safe side, therefore, we decided to build it to Hopeville.</p>

<p>In regard to the additional Estimates, as usual, of course, the amount required is split up under the heads &#x201C;Electrification&#x201D; and &#x201C;Construction&#x201D;, The hon. member suggested that the traffic to Newcastle from Postmasburg should go via Redan and Grootvlei. That will be a detour as I said by way of interjection. The shortest route will be over Meyerton to Union and from Union to Natal.</p>

<p>Will you give an assurance that all precautions will be taken?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>All necessary precautions are taken. There is continual inspection. There are permanent speed restrictions on that line where it goes over dolomite formation and subsidence can be expected but it is also quite possible that no subsidences will occur. I am acting safely and that is why we are building a new line.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) has asked whether main line passengers could use Langlaagte. It is proposed that the main line passenger trains should go via Langlaagte to Houtkop and then from Houtkop to Potchefstroom. As regards the construction of bridges between Randfontein and Middelvlei, as the hon. member knows, that is a matter for the standing committee. That committee must decide whether it will be necessary to construct that bridge over the crossing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) asked what the position of Oberholzer will be. So far as I know, all the new works have nearly been completed there. From the nature of things, buildings will not be permitted to stand there in an incomplete state; all of them will be completed. Then the hon. member also asked whether something could be done in connection with the new railway line between Fochville and Potchefstroom to safeguard the residents there against unnecessary noise and inconvenience. Both the hon. member for Potchefstroom and the hon. member for Ventersdorp and the residents of Potchefstroom have made representations to me, <span class="col_6685_6686" refersTo="page_0675"/>as they know, in regard to the junction of the Fochville line with the main line, and the diversion of the Fochville line so that the junction will not be at Potchefstroom Station, but away from it. The one proposal was that the junction should be just north of the Mooi River and the other was that it should be at Klington. I have caused both proposals to be very thoroughly investigated, but it will involve tremendous additional expenditure. It will mean a longer line, there will have to be a manned station beyond the bridge and although I have much sympathy with the residents of Potchefstroom I cannot justify the additional expenditure which will amount to more than R1,000,000 in the one case and much more in the other. So I am afraid the junction will have to remain where it is. However, there will not be so very much noise, because electric units will be used on that traject and not steam locomotives, to pull the trains. The real noise they make is when they sound their hooters. Since all the level crossings will be eliminated, there will be very little reason to use the hooters. So I think the residents of Potchefstroom will be able to sleep quite peacefully.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions, adjourned on 17 April, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>It is almost six weeks since the hon. the Minister for Social Welfare and Pensions moved the second reading of this Bill. We listened then with great interest to his introductory remarks. I want to tell him that we on this side of the House welcome the Bill and that we are going to vote for it. We shall move various amendments in the Committee Stage. Other speakers will deal with those changes which we should like to see in this Bill. I feel it is necessary for such a Bill to be passed as soon as possible, and that it should be carried out in effect as soon as possible.</p>

<p>It has been said that we have approximately 100,000 alcoholics in South Africa. This Bill not only deals with the 100,000 alcoholics but it also deals with drug addicts and people who up to now we have been unable to deal with, people who make a nuisance of themselves for one reason or another. In this group of people, I think, we have to include beggars, hoboes and tramps whom we find in the streets of our cities. I think that we, together with the Minister, are undertaking a very big experiment in this country. It is a vast experiment which has not yet been tackled by any other country. I sincerely hope that the work which is now going to be undertaken will be of such a nature that we will be able to set an example to the other countries who wish to deal with this most serious problem. I know that we are going to have great difficulty in carrying out the provisions of this Bill because we are going to deal with people who are not ordinary people. To a large extent we are going to deal with a class of person who is to some extent mentally deranged. It is because the Minister has recognized as a fact, in this Bill, that alcoholism is a disease and must be treated as such, that drug addiction is a disease and must be treated as such, that these people who suffer from alcoholism and drug addiction are in a class apart from the other people with whom they have been grouped previously. He is going to have difficulty in dealing with the alcoholic because of the various social levels that he will find amongst the alcoholic and also because of the various levels of mental ability of alcoholics. Amongst these people you will find, I think, a greater proportion of, I would not say more civilized people, but certainly a greater percentage of better educated people than you would imagine. In my own experience I have found that almost 60 per cent of the alcoholics I have come into contact with, have been people with a very good background and a very high standard of education. If we have to deal with these people on the same basis as you have to deal with those who are not so well educated, and those who have different outlooks in life, I think the Minister is going to find difficulty if he houses these different types of people in the same establishment. So the first difficulty he will have to overcome will be to try to separate the various classes of alcoholics. Then there is a further difficulty you will have to meet because once this Bill comes into operation you will find that a number of those alcoholics suffer from other diseases as well, diseases which will also have to be treated, diseases which have resulted as a result of his chronic alcoholism. It is for this reason that I want to urge, at this stage, <span class="col_6687_6688" refersTo="page_0676"/>that the Minister should make sure that his Department works hand in hand with the provincial hospitals. You see, Sir, we have this difficulty; this is the Central Government administrating a health problem; we have this further difficulty that we have a Social Welfare Minister administering a central health problem which in reality should fall under the provinces via the Minister of Health. These difficulties will have to be worked out by the Minister and his Cabinet. He must recognize that if alcoholism is going to be treated as a disease he might find that Social Welfare will have this particular branch of the provisions of this Bill taken away from it. I would be very sorry to see that but we must beware of such a thing happening. So I would suggest to the hon. Minister that he retains the care of these people even though it will necessitate health measures and that he works in collaboration with the provinces.</p>

<p>We will come to the stage very soon where we are going to have a large number of alcoholics housed in various institutions, and the basis of this Bill as it is now emphasizes rehabilitation and occupation in the treatment. I see further difficulties that the Minister is going to have because, as I see it, it is not sufficient to simply keep the alcoholic occupied. That is one aspect of treatment; physiotherapy is another aspect, good feeding is another aspect of the treatment. But the difficulty that we are going to meet soon is to have sufficient personnel for these institutions who are specialized in this particular type of work. I know, and I think the hon. Minister is fully aware of it, that we have a shortage of that group of nurses who have had an opportunity to study this particular branch of therapy. Not only have we got a shortage of nursing staff, but we also have a shortage of medical personnel to deal with that. This is going to be a new venture as far as we are concerned, and it is no good us getting into a rut and simply having a retreat where an alcoholic or a drug addict is housed and say &#x201C;Well, you are going to stay here for three years, and during that time we hope that you will no longer want to drink and when you come out of here, after three years we hope you are going to be cured&#x201D;. I know that it takes a long time to break the habit of drinking. But I also do know that it is a habit which is readily acquired again for a second or a third time, even after a long period of abstinence. During the three years that we have that individual under control, we have to find other ways and means of dealing with the alcoholic, and here is where he requires the assistance of a first-class research team. We have got to find out what is happening in other parts of the world, and we have to use any successful plans in our own institutions. There must be other ways of treating an alcoholic, other than what we have got set out here. Whether it is going to be shock treatment, whether it is going to be massive doses of vitamin, whether it is going to be operations to the brain centres, that is for these people to see to. We have got an opportunity of starting now on the right foot, and it is my earnest plea to the Minister that he should leave no stone unturned to make sure that he has got the best personnel in these institutions and that we continue to improve our knowledge both as a result of what we find out in these institutions and as a result of what is going on in other parts of the world. If we do that, we will have a model for other people to work on. If not, then I am afraid that all we are going to have here is a home for the derelict. And that is what we do not want.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to go on very much longer because there are several people on our side of the House who want to put their views on these matters, which I have briefly outlined here. But before I sit down, I want to say to the Minister why I personally welcome this Bill. Firstly, I say that the alcoholic must be separated from the other misfits of our society. During the years that I have been a general practitioner in a large city, and in a part of a city where unfortunately I have come into contact with very, very many cases of alcoholism, I have found that when the father is a drunk or an alcoholic, the family suffers; they suffer mentally and they suffer physically. When the mother is an alcoholic, the family suffers, the children suffer, the husband suffers. When both are alcoholics, as very often happens, one following the other, then you find no family life whatsoever. You find children who are best taken out of such a home.</p>

<p>Maj. VAN DER BYL; The children often also become alcoholics.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. member says, the danger is that when these children grow up, they in turn become alcoholics. Over and over again we have heard stories of a father assaulting a mother in the presence of the children. We have heard over and over again that these cases are brought to the notice of the police or to the notice of the resident magistrate and yet they are put down as domestic squabbles and nothing is done. I hope now that if reports come from welfare officers to say that something must be done to these people who are leading lives which are ruining their children or others near and dear to them, something will be done and that the people who are responsible for the unhappiness in families will be taken away and looked after. If they are going to be taken away, they must not be taken away under a stigma. They must be taken away just as if they were sick people needing treatment from a specialist. There is no difference if we are going to say that alcoholism is a disease. Then it is a disease in the eves of everybody and it must be treated as such, and we must never point a finger at these people, because it is possible that our own at some time or other may be subjected to strains leading to such a disease.</p>

<p>I like very much the clause in this Bill which deals with after-treatment. That to me <span class="col_6689_6690" refersTo="page_0677"/>probably is one of the most important aspects of the treatment of alcoholism; not only to treat them during their stay in the hospitals, but to make sure that when they come out of the institution via the hospital, they will be well looked after, that they will be under supervision. Here I say to the Minister that he must do everything possible to make sure that large industrial concerns, that business establishments, that city councils, village councils, no matter where these people come from, shall help in the rehabilitation and after-treatment. They must be settled in permanent employment, they must be given outlets for their abilities. They must not be shunned by society. These things I hope the hon. Minister will take into consideration and make sure that when they come out of the retreat, they will not be thrown back again because of the stigma which may be placed on them by some people.</p>

<p>As far as the other group of people are concerned, those that will not work, those that beg, those that make use of a crippled state of health to make a livelihood from the alms that they collect in the streets, these people must also be rehabilitated, but in their case I feel the great thing is occupation. They must be made to produce something which they can sell, something which is saleable, and they must take a pride in the work they turn out. Here again I cannot see any of these people being cured without special treatment because to me these people also suffer from a disease, from some mental quirk. What makes them want to sit on the side of the road with a deformed hand out rather than go to work and use the good hand? These people must be made to take an interest in life, must be shown that it is not as easy as they think to sponge on the goodness of others. If they do not do it, then it may be necessary to even take punitive measures of some sort. I have got my own ideas about these things, about how these people should be treated. I do say that those who are physically fit in body, those who are able to work, must be made to work. They must know that to eat you must work. I hope that these people will be taught the importance of doing a day&#x2019;s work. As I said once before, we in this country cannot afford to have in our population hundreds of thousands of won&#x2019;t works. There is no room for them. They are not included in the unemployed. They are employable. There is work for them. But they are the people that will not work, and for them special measures must be taken to teach them to work, to teach them the goodness of work, and when they come out they must be put to work and kept at work.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to just say to the Minister that we on this side of the House hope that this Bill will bring to South Africa a measure which will save not only the hundreds of thousands of alcoholics but the dependants of these people, will be saved from unhappiness. It will save the country hundreds of thousands of rand. That is what it costs the country to keep these people going. I hope that the children from these broken families will soon be united in families which can be united.</p>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I think I have the right to say, from what the hon. member has said, that we can infer that the other side of the House also welcomes this Bill. That being so, I should like to say from this side of the House that I think this it is one of the Bills introduced this year which is welcomed, and ought to be welcomed, by all. It is the kind of Bill on which there certainly will not be disagreement, and it would be wrong if we were to quarrel about it. Here we are concerned with people who need our sympathy. I can also tell you, Sir, that there is tremendous interest in this Bill. I know that this side of the House has for years insisted upon it, and there have been discussions and there has been keen interest from all quarters to have such a Bill introduced in the House, and I assume that on that side too there has been a real desire to have this Bill brought before the House.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has pointed out that alcoholics ought to be divided into various categories. I think there is much to be said for that, but the truth of the matter is that much progress is being made with this Bill in that the alcoholic is now separated from all other social misfits and deviates. It is a big step forward. I agree with the hon. member that the alcoholic frequently is a person from a very good family. I think it was his experience in practice too that one finds that people who are addicted to liquor, are without exception good people. When sober, they are the best fathers to their children and the best husbands to their wives. But when they take to the bottle, the circumstances in those homes become tragic. I do not think, judging from the report we have, that we realize how serious the problem of alcoholism is. We do not have very reliable figures before us, but we do know it is a very grave problem. Certainly it has destructive consequences in South Africa. People practising certain professions particularly see this from day to day. The hon. member has referred to cases where the father is addicted to liquor; sometimes the mother follows; sometimes they drink together. What he has said is quite true, that many children coming from such families also become addicted to liquor. But now I have to add at once that in a very large percentage of cases it is found also that children from such families are the very ones who have such an aversion to excessive indulgence that they are the very people who try to stop others from drinking. I say this merely by way of introduction.</p>

<p>In welcoming this Bill, I think it will be a good thing for the country to take note that we are not always indulging in political squabbling here in the House of Assembly. I have frequently been asked what part of the work I do is devoted to party politics, and I do not think it is more than 10 per cent or 15 per cent. And I am very active in party politics. <span class="col_6691_6692" refersTo="page_0678"/>I do not believe that more than 10 to 15 per cent of my work really is of a party political nature. The rest is the kind of thing we are dealing with this afternoon, to render the country a service to a greater or lesser extent&#x2014;we to a lesser degree, and the Minister and his Department to a much greater degree. I also think that this type of legislation with which we are dealing here this afternoon is proof that South Africa bears the stamp of civilization, that we are a grown-up nation. Only civilized people, only adult people and nations who care for these kinds of people and who place this type of legislation on their Statute Book, really attempt to solve such problems. Having said that it bears the stamp of civilization, I wish to say that civilization also to some extent bears the stamp of alcoholism. I know that in the under-developed countries there are large numbers of people who are addicted to intoxicating liquor. But it seems to me it is one of the things that does not disappear with the advent of civilization. If one looks at other countries&#x2014;I am not very keen to mention other countries&#x2014;then France is a country that is constantly being brought to one&#x2019;s notice. Surely France is one of the most civilized countries in the world, but it is one of the countries with the greatest problem as regards alcoholism.</p>

<p>But apart from that, I think another fact that must be recognized is that this type of legislation testifies to the culture and refinement of the South African nation as a whole.</p>

<p>Now I should like to point out that alcoholics are no longer regarded as criminals, and I wish to welcome that cordially. We know that in Clause 14 (1) of this Bill it is provided that if in a criminal court it appears that an accused falls within the provisions of Clause 14 (1), he may be dealt with differently from an ordinary criminal. Then the proceedings in such a court may be converted into an inquiry. In addition the public prosecutor is required to call for a report from a welfare officer. I sincerely hope that this procedure and what follows will persuade an increasing number of alcoholics to report themselves, or will move their relatives to report them for treatment. They are no criminals. I do not wish to plead for alcoholics and inebriates, but one thing is certain and that is that an inebriate is not a criminal primarily. While under the influence of liquor he may perpetrate acts that border on crime, or may even be crimes, but primarily such a person is not a criminal. One therefore wants to welcome it heartily that they will now become inmates of retreats. Another point I wish to mention in passing is that while we are in earnest in regard to this whole matter, I think there are a few groups of people who deserve the thanks of this House and of everyone who is interested in this matter, and they are the large number of private individuals who exert themselves from day to day to assist inebriates, to assist deviates and try to bring them back to a normal life, and particularly the large number of people who were addicted to alcohol but have now been cured, and are endeavouring to bring back to normal life those who have lapsed into that unfortunate state.</p>

<p>As one has this sympathy with these people &#x2014;and after very serious reflection I agree with the people who say that alcoholism is a disease &#x2014;I should like to make one more remark. The hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) asked me whether overeating also is a disease. But when this is analysed, I think alcoholism must be classified as an abnormality which one could rightly call a disease. It is a fact&#x2014;and I hope that the alcoholics who may come to hear of this debate will particularly take note of this&#x2014;it is a fact that far more than 50 per cent, and perhaps 75 per cent, of these persons may be cured either temporarily or in many cases permanently of their problem. Where one pays tribute and thanks to the people who as individuals, as churches or as other bodies devote their time and their energies to assisting these people, I think there is still another group, and that is the staff of these retreats where these people are treated, who deserve our appreciation. I do not know whether you have already paid a visit to one of these retreats. I had the privilege once of visiting one of them, and when one sees the devotion, love and sympathy these workers show in dealing with these people who are committed to their care, they really and truly deserve our praise and our thanks. In regard to the proposition that alcoholism is a disease, I should also just like to say that there is no doubt that alcohol is a poison. However, the social problems we are faced with may be attributed to the fact that alcohol is such a weak poison and takes effect very slowly. A man has to consume a very large amount of alcohol over a very long period before he will actually be affected physically. And because that is so, we have to cope with the enormous social problems. That is an additional reason why we welcome this legislation which makes it clear beyond a doubt that it is now made the task of the State to assist these people and to aid them.</p>

<p>Having referred to inebriates with sympathy I should like to emphasize in conclusion&#x2014;for I do not think we need speak at length on this matter, save to emphasize that we welcome it&#x2014;that while one feels that provision must be made and that an alcoholic must not be regarded as a criminal; and while one feels that he should not be dealt with together with other misfits; and while one feels that his treatment should aim at his rehabilitation, and that his treatment should also include the other diseases and illness manifestations that go with alcoholism; while one accepts all those things, I should yet like to say that this measure of sympathy should not be construed further as meaning that one has any sympathy with a person who drives a vehicle while under the influence of liquor. I want to separate these two things very clearly, and I think too that the members of the judiciary must not infer from this debate that such a person should also be dealt with sympathetically. The <span class="col_6693_6694" refersTo="page_0679"/>fact of the matter is that a person who while he is under the influence of liquor voluntarily gets into a vehicle and voluntarily drives that vehicle&#x2026;</p>

<p>He certainly realizes that he is dealing with something that moves, and I feel that we should not endanger the lives of the public, of children and of others, and even their possessions, in any way because we are now dealing with a different aspect of alcoholism. I think we should distinguish very clearly between these two things. Let us admit it is a disease, and that the problem of the man is that he cannot stay away from liquor. But I cannot accept for one moment that this disease also includes the act of driving a vehicle under the influence, and that must remain an offence that is heavily punishable in South Africa.</p>

<p>I should like to thank and congratulate the Minister sincerely on this splendid piece of work before the House. And not only that, but also his overseas visit in the second half of the year to give attention to the problems of the people who are entrusted to the care of him and his Department, deserves our thanks. I want to tell him that he has a Department of which I believe both sides of the House are very proud. We are grateful for the work done and the sympathetic attitude adopted by them in respect of cases we submit to them. I may say that in recent times particularly I have been receiving speedy attention, sympathetic attention from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, and I have no complaints at all, especially when one takes into consideration the tremendous amount of work they have to perform, and I think if one moves about among the people in general, one will find the same thing. We want to say to the Minister that as he has such a Department, and as he has plans for the future, we as a House and as a nation are very grateful to him not only for the work he himself is doing, but also for what his Department is doing. We hope that what he aims at with this legislation will be very fruitful and that in the coming years we may perhaps introduce into this legislation such improvements as time may show us to be necessary, but we realize that at this stage we do not want to introduce too much perfection in this legislation, while we do not yet have full experience of how it will work.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I would like first of all to commend those members who drew up this report of the inter-departmental committee of inquiry to investigate the treatment of alcoholics and also the valiant efforts of the Minister and the Department in transporting the recommendations into the Bill now before the House. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) mentioned a very interesting point when he said that he agreed with the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) that it was essential to differentiate between types of alcoholics, because there were different types of alocoholics coming from different social strata. I would like to make the point here that this is already done in the provincial hospitals with psychiatric treatment, and I would join with the hon. member for Rosettenville in urging on the Minister the closest possible link between the Department of Social Welfare in administering this Bill and the provincial hospitals that have for a long time past dealt with alcoholics. I am referring particularly to Tara Hospital in Johannesburg that deals with the neurotic cases of alcoholism and the Park Road Hospital here in Cape Town, which does excellent work in the treatment of alcoholics. It is a very important point that alcoholism to-day is treated as an illness and that it is so regarded by this Bill. It is in the same category and it is as severe as tuberculosis. When tuberculosis is arrested in its early stages, the patients have complete confidence that they will be able to recover, and even where the disease is in an advanced stage they can be treated with the correct drugs and receive medical attention and they have many years of useful life before them. Doctors all over South Africa are in direct contact with alcoholics, and those who are at the clinic at the Johannesburg General Hospital, who are psychiatrists, have urged the Government to introduce legislation to treat alcoholism as a disease and to give alcoholics every chance to rehabilitate themselves. I think that this Bill to a large extent sets out to achieve that purpose. Recently Dr. Gillis, the chief psychiatrist at Groote Schuur, who is also in charge of Park Road Hospital, said that alcoholics are embedded in the community and the greatest problem is to get them to hospitals and to rehabilitation centres for treatment. But the community always has a silent conspiracy to keep the alcoholic away from the type of treatment which can be his salvation, because many people still regard alcoholism as a disgrace rather than a disease. Therefore we on this side of the House feel that the Bill should be welcomed, and that it reflects the advances made in the treatment of alcoholism, and one of the most important principles implicit in the Bill is the realization that punishment may fail in its purpose of treating the alcoholic, who is a sick man.</p>

<p>I feel that I would like particularly to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the statement in the report of the inter-departmental committee in connection with work colonies for White women, on page 44, where it says that White women who are incurable alcoholics and whose degree of mental deviation and general circumstances are such that they cannot benefit from the existing rehabilitation centres should be sent to work colonies. The committee took note of these representations and recommended that certain types of people who are not amenable to adjustment should be sent to work colonies.</p>

<p><span class="col_6695_6696" refersTo="page_0680"/>I should like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to certain clauses in the Bill. There are many improvements which are to be welcomed. I think we should welcome the improvement in regard to the committal of persons convicted of criminal offences to institutions which are not the same institutions as those to which alcoholics are committed. Specialized treatment will be given to the aloholics. There are other provisions which I feel should be commented on, like the extension of time in Clause 29 from one month to six months. While this increase may seem drastic, it appears to be necessary. After consultation with doctors and hospitals, the period of one month was not considered adequate for treatment of the alcoholic, and therefore medical opinion agrees that the extension to six months is justified.</p>

<p>But I would like to criticize three points in the Bill and I feel that if the Minister would consider these criticisms the Bill may to some extent be adjusted. The first of these is in Clause 6, which deals with the establishment of the National Alcoholism Advisory Board and the composition of the board. I notice that while two members will be drawn from the Department and eight from the provinces and five will be selected from the Minister from among persons who are actively interested on a voluntary basis in the problem of alcoholism, the Minister has not included the psychiatrist. I would have thought that it was essential to have a psychiatrist on this board, who could give his advice on the type of problems with which the board would deal. Psychology and psychiatry play a major part in the treatment of alcoholics and the role of the psychiatrist is recognized in this report of the inter-departmental committee. It is recognized that the psychiatrist is called in for consultation on numerous occasions and he visits the work colonies regularly. Talbot House Women&#x2019;s Retreat in Pretoria North is visited regularly by a psychiatrist. At Tara, which is a psychiatric hospital, they deal with the psycho-neurotic cases of alcoholism, and also at the psychiatric clinic of the General Hospital in Johannesburg. So I feel that there is ample support for a psychiatrist being a member of the board.</p>

<p>There is another matter. In regard to the appointment of the board, I notice that no period of time has been inserted, although it is recommended in the report. It says that the members shall be appointed by the Minister for a period not exceeding three years, but I note that this has been left out of the_ Bill. One may well ask the Minister why this recommendation was not included, and why this period was not specified.</p>

<p>There is a further point I referred to earlier on, under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, and that is the question of finance. The amounts that are recommended here on page 110 of the report are an expenditure of R400,000. Under this year&#x2019;s Vote, the amount for these particular institutes is only R20,000. At the time I asked the Minister this question he said that there might possibly have to be adjustments in the future. I will be glad if the Minister can give us some idea as to how the finances will be adjusted and how it will be spread over the next four years, including the capital expenditure, to implement the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<p>Finally, I can say that if the Minister can give the House these assurances on these clauses, that he will seriously consider the suggestions I am putting forward, this Bill can be commended as a forward step in combating alcoholism and it will be welcomed by members on this side of the House.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I think speakers on both sides of the House have already emphasized it very strongly that this legislation is definitely an important step forward, but in order to understand it better you must look at its background, Sir, namely, the very thorough investigation which was conducted by an inter-departmental committee and which brought out a very significant report which actually resulted in the legislation which we have before us to-day. When you read that report and the legislation before us you are impressed by the fact that we are dealing here with a very important national problem which is very complex. It is clear that when we seek the cause for this problem of alcoholism it is quite wrong to think that you can point to one single cause. This report makes it clear that this is a problem with many different aspects. We have, in the first place, those people who maintain that the reason for alcoholism is purely physiological, that it is simply an illness with physical causes. But then you have other authorities who emphasize the psychological aspect of it and who find, on examining the alcoholic, that he has a peculiar personality, or a tendency to run away from reality. Then you have the sociologists who emphasize the social factors, the effect of the environment on the person, the example set by the masses, the influence of cocktail parties which have an effect on the weakling and cause him to degenerate into a confirmed alcoholic. It is very difficult to say which one of these various factors is the most important. The only thing which any scientist can say is that all these various factors must be emphasized equally strongly. That shows you why it is necessary for us to have legislation in order to cope better with this problem. That is essential because when you think of the results of alcoholism you realize what a destructive effect it has on society. From the purely economic point of view of absenteeism, those people who stay away from work because they are incapable of going to their work and the decline in their ability to work and their greater suspectibility to accidents, we find that all those factors have a tremendous adverse effect on our economy. Similarly in society, when you go into the matter and see the large percentage of children who are cared for in institutions you find that the majority of them are there because their homes have been broken up as a result of the abuse of alcohol. <span class="col_6697_6698" refersTo="page_0681"/>When we talk about protecting the family and building up the family, it is absolutely essential that this problem be given attention to and that we should try to approach it scientifically and combat it effectively.</p>

<p>Apart from that, therefore, there is the health of the individual. We know what adverse effects alcohol can have on the human system and also on his spirit. The alcoholic is the most unhappy person. If we are really concerned with his health and his innermost happiness it is our duty to try to solve that problem. The old-fashioned approach was simply to push the alcoholic aside as a weakling and an outcast and the treatment of those people simply consisted of their being sent to work colonies where they often came into contact with criminals which created a second problem for those persons who already had a problem. The result was that a certain stigma attached to the institutions which had to rehabilitate the alcoholic with the result that the alcoholic regarded himself as an inferior being and he often tried to avoid those institutions; he never went there voluntarily. The methods of treatment were therefore not effective nor the places where they were treated and consequently the results were not effective either.</p>

<p>This legislation represents a very important step forward because the problem is now being placed in its right perspective and a new approach towards the alcoholic is now being placed before the public. Above all, this legislation opens the door once and for all to a very thorough programme of research so that the very root cause of this problem can be investigated, in order to ascertain what should be done to solve the problem. A clear distinction is drawn in Clause 14 between the alcoholic and the maladjusted person and that is why there are two separate institutions where they are to be treated. You have the retreats to which the alcoholic can go for treatment, places which concentrate on his problem and all his symptoms. Whereas the maladjusted person goes to another institution; the two are no longer grouped together. That is why the alcoholic will now for the first time receive the attention of people who know how to approach his problem.</p>

<p>This legislation also makes provision for an interchange of activities between reform schools and retreats so that a person who is at a reform school and who shows the same symptoms can be transferred to such a retreat for treatment. Clause 4 lays the emphasis on the physical, spiritual and moral rehabilitation of the alcoholic; it paves the way for the correct treatment, medically, psychologically and morally. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) said she was sorry that a psychiatrist had not been appointed to the board. I shall deal with that in a moment but this legislation lays great emphasis on the important role which the psychiatrist must play in the rehabilitation of the alcoholic. Clause 16 makes provision&#x2014;and this is very important&#x2014; for treatment outside the institution. There are people who will benefit more by being treated in society than by being treated in an institution. The court has the power to defer the committal of such a person to an institution for three years if the welfare officer reports to that effect. We are also very grateful to notice that this Act makes ample provision for the after-care of such a person. What strikes me in particular is the fact that this Act, unlike the old Act, is not only concerned with the person while he is an alcoholic but it aims at doing more; it tries to establish an organization like Sandra to do preventive work on a larger scale. In the past, due to the lack of funds, this problem could not be brought sufficiently to the notice of society by way of guidance, etc., but that will be possible in future. That is why I think this legislation is a very important step forward in every respect, particularly when we bear in mind that the board to be appointed will no longer be known as the National Work Colonies and Retreats Advisory Board but indeed as the National Alcoholism Advisory Board. The emphasis is therefore placed on the kernel of the problem, and the committee also recommended that the composition of the board should be as representative as possible so that the various aspects, the ethic, the social and the medical, can all receive attention on that board, and that the necessary teamwork between the provinces and the Departments should be there.</p>

<p>I just want to return to the importance of the psychiatrist. Clause 6 provides that the five persons to be appointed, after the Department is represented, will be appointed on the strength of their personal interest and personal knowledge of the problem. If there is any psychiatrist who has concentrated his attentions on this field with distinction the Minister will obviously designate that person as one of the five to serve on the board. That is why I think the board will be composed in such a way that it will meet the problem of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North).</p>

<p>I want to conclude by emphasizing that we must be careful that we do not regard alcoholism merely as an illness and that we do not undermine the responsibility of the person by treating him as a patient. Rehabilitation work must be done. He must be taught to realize that he is not of the value that he should be. That is why I think the main task, not only of these institutions, but of the welfare organizations and the churches and everybody in future, will be to stand together to rehabilitate the alcoholic effectively.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened with great interest to the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter) in regard to this problem of alcoholism. He is a man who has a vast knowledge of social problems by virtue of his calling.</p>

<p>There are certain aspects of the Bill which I would like to comment upon, but before doing so I think it is necessary to indicate that this problem of alcoholism, which was <span class="col_6699_6700" refersTo="page_0682"/>really highlighted by the report of the interdepartmental committee, is a very serious one. The committee said that alcoholism was prevalent in the community. Therefore the introduction of the Bill is welcomed by this side of the House. But while acknowledging the fact that alcoholism is an insidious disease which the public still has to be instructed to accept, we have a Bill before us which aims at rehabilitating these people and therefore we want to support it, but at the same time I think it is rather ironical that a Bill has been published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> to amend the Liquor Act, and although it has not yet been tabled in this House it is one which I believe will make strong liquor much more readily available, and it is one which could aggravate the problem of alcoholism. I think the establishment of the National Alcoholism Advisory Board is of such importance that the introduction of a major amendment to the Liquor Act should not be entertained at this stage.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister seeks to establish a board to attempt to combat this problem of alcoholism and he as a responsible member of the Cabinet should endeavour to see that a measure is not introduced which will aggravate the position.</p>

<p>In regard to the Bill before us, I believe an important aspect is that the principle involved in this Bill is to place the accent rather on the rehabilitative measures than on the punitive measures. It attempts to find ways and means to bring about the successful rehabilitation of alcoholics, but I believe, too, that there are certain aspects of this Bill which require emphasis. One is to see that a person is not committed to such an institution unless all other attempts at rehabilitation have failed. He should be committed to an institution as a last resort, because it is a drastic step in the life of any human being to be committed to an institution. There is provision in the Bill whereby an order may be postponed at the discretion of the magistrate, and I believe that aspect requires particular emphasis, to ensure that persons are only committed as a last resort.</p>

<p>There are various clauses one can comment upon, one being that the stigma of having been committed to a work colony is being removed through the renaming of these work colonies and classifying them as rehabilitation centres for maladjusted persons and retreats for alcoholics and drug addicts. I believe that the renaming of these institutions will to a certain extent remove that stigma. The clause which establishes the National Alcoholism Advisory Board, Clause 6, will replace the Work Colonies and Retreats Advisory Board, and therefore we are going to have a board established which will devote its entire energies to the problem of alcoholism. The question that I would like to ask the hon. Minister is this: Our present position in regard to the Advisory Board on Work Colonies and Retreats is that they submit a comprehensive report which covers all aspects concerning maladjusted persons and alcoholics. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether now that this board is going to deal purely and simply with the problem of alcoholism they will not be able to have laid on the Table of the House the comprehensive report that we have been accustomed to from the board. The report covers all aspects of rehabilitation such as the rehabilitation centres and the retreats, and it does appear from the functions of the new board that it will now merely confine itself to the question of alcoholism, and therefore we will not have the opportunity of having available to us the various facts and findings and recommendations of the board which we have received in the past dealing with the whole question of rehabilitation centres and maladjusted persons. With regard to the point that was raised by the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) the question of the period of office of this particular Advisory Board, the position has now been altered in that previously one of the functions of the Work Colonies and Retreats Advisory Board was to report to the Minister once in every calendar year, and those who are interested in this particular problem have looked forward to receiving these reports because they have been most instructive, particularly the report covering the year 1956 where very important recommendations were made. A large number of these recommendations are to-day embodied in the Bill before the House, and they do not merely cover the problem of alcoholism but the whole question of the rehabilitation of maladjusted persons as well as the rehabilitation of alcoholics. In terms of the Bill before the House this Board will now be required to report at least once every five years, whereas the previous Board was required to report once in every calendar year. I would like to know from the Minister whether it is his intention that reports shall only be tabled once every five years or whether there is any possibility of these important reports being tabled more regularly. Similarly the previous board which is now to be abolished was appointed for a period of three years, and in accordance with the Bill now before the House the new Board is to be appointed for a period of five years. I would also like to know the reasons why this Board should be appointed for a period of five years and not a period of three years. Now, Sir, there are other important recommendations <span class="col_6701_6702" refersTo="page_0683"/>that have been made by the Work Colonies and Retreats Advisory Board. They have throughout their reports high-lighted certain aspects which they believe require attention, and one is the question of the treatment which inmates receive at the various institutions. They call for certain reforms in regard to the treatment. Sir, the National Work Colonies and Retreats Advisory Board&#x2019;s sixth annual report for 1956 on page 11 said this in regard to treatment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Board is convinced that the treatment still leaves much to be desired. It has become obvious that the great majority of inmates are committed to the work colonies on account of their excessive drinking habits. This Board feels that it has become absolutely essential to add at least a minimum number of specialist staff members to the establishment at the work colonies, persons such as a psychologist, a sociologist, a medical officer and an educationist.</block>

<p>Sir, these are important matters in regard to treatment. Although provision is made in the Bill before the House whereby treatment shall be provided at these institutions, there is no indication as to whether it is to be specialized treatment or whether there is to be any alteration in regard to the treatment at present given at these institutions. Sir, while dealing with the question of treatment, another aspect which I think is a very important one is in regard to the classification of these various institutions. Under Clause 8 special provision is made for classifying retreats and rehabilitation centres into different categories and different divisions. A similar provision existed under the Work Colonies Act of 1949 which is now to be repealed and replaced by this particular Bill and I believe that particular attention should be given to establishing institutions for younger persons committed to these institutions, retreats and rehabilitation centres.</p>

<p>Separate institutions?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>If possible I believe that separate institutions should be established. The Department of Prisons in its more modern approach to penal reform, has deemed it wise to establish a separate prison for young persons from 18 to 23 years of age, known as Switzerland, and I believe that it is important that a separate classification, if possible, should be devised whereby young persons from the age of 18 to 23 can be maintained in separate institutions so that they do not come into contact with the older, more hardened type of won&#x2019;t-work or alcoholic, because it is a recognized fact that if these younger persons come into contact with the older, hardened type, it may have a detrimental effect rather than a beneficial effect upon them. I believe that one of the important factors is that younger persons are becoming excessive drinkers and in some instances alcoholics. It is a great tragedy but the present trend is that young people are drinking at a much earlier age. Indeed the latest report of the Work Colonies and Retreats Advisory Board showed the average age of inmates at Sonderwater, for instance. Out of a total of 336 there were no less than 60 of these persons, almost 20 per cent, under 25 years of age. Similarly the inter-departmental committee&#x2019;s report on the treatment of the alcoholic sets out evidence from Alcoholics Anonymous in Port Elizabeth to the effect that the average age of members has dropped from 50 to 35 years of age. I believe that one of the functions of an advisory board is to devise ways and means of protecting young people from becoming excessive drinkers and falling foul of the law, invariably under the influence of liquor. For instance, there was a report in America some two years ago which showed that out of 12,000 cases of juvenile crime, 31.7 per cent of the cases were directly linked to excessive drinking while 17.4 per cent were indirectly connected with excessive drinking. A total of 49.1 per cent of juvenile crime therefore is attributed to excessive drinking. I believe that one of the functions of that Advisory Board can be to assist the Minister in cases which I have seen for myself where young school boys and school girls, admittedly not dressed in school clothes, partake of liquor in bar lounges where they are served without any questions being asked. I believe that strong action should be taken against those persons who supply strong alcohol to these young people. I have often found, in assisting to run youth clubs and youth organizations that young persons of 16 years of age whom I know are still schoolgoing, have arrived at these functions under the influence of liquor. When I have asked them where they obtained the strong liquor, the reply in nearly all instances has been that they have been drinking at a bar lounge. I believe that this habit of our younger generation to partake of strong liquor is something which has a serious effect on our community and which aggravates our social problems. I am not alone in stating this particular point, because I would like to remind the House that the National Welfare Organizations conference that was held in 1956 also urged the Government to take steps in regard to the question of young persons partaking of strong liquor and also called upon the Government and other welfare organizations and churches to bring to the notice of our young people, our future generation, the dangers of liquor and excessive drinking. For instance, the recommendation of the National Welfare Organizations Board in 1956 was that legislation should be introduced to prohibit advertisements which misled the public by creating the impression that alcohol helps, amongst other things, to make one physically fit and strong. They then went on to suggest&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board suggested that a national campaign should be launched indicating how disease, wastage of manpower, wrecking of homes and loss of property result from the excessive consumption of alcohol.</block>

<p><span class="col_6703_6704" refersTo="page_0684"/>These are recommendations and suggestions which were made by the National Welfare Organizations Board as far back as 1956. I do hope that this Advisory Board to the Minister will take into account all these various trends and difficulties which arise in regard to our future generation. The use of strong liquor amongst our young people should, I believe, receive the attention of this Board, and an effort should be made particularly amongst the children to show them the danger of partaking of strong liquor.</p>

<p>There are other aspects in regard to this Bill, such as the question of dealing with those persons who are not necessarily alcoholics but are habitual won&#x2019;t-works. This is another important matter because we know that in a city such as Durban, during almost every holiday season there is an invasion of what are known as young battlers. These young persons make a living by begging a few shillings or a few cents off different persons and often become a public nuisance, particularly at places of entertainment; they can often be seen congregating outside cinemas, particularly when there are midnight shows. Sir, the police are not in a position to do anything in regard to these persons. The police cannot take any action against them unless they can be arrested for vagrancy, and many of them cannot be so arrested because they might have a few rand on them. They cannot therefore be arrested for vagrancy, although there are cases where they are brought before a magistrate and told to leave the city. Now, with the provisions of this Bill I hope that it will be possible to take some action against many of these persons who do not come under the Children&#x2019;s Act, because up to the age of 18 they can be taken before a Children&#x2019;s Court, but if they are over the age of 18 there is nothing that can be done to bring about a rehabilitation of these young persons. I believe that with the shortage of manpower in South Africa we must utilize every possible means to rehabilitate those persons who are habitual won&#x2019;t-works. Provided careful investigation is made, I believe that a great deal of benefit can be derived from these rehabilitation centres, provided that the persons who are committed there are persons who will benefit by the treatment that will be made available. At the same time good use should be made of the provision in this Bill for the postponement of a committal order so that the person concerned can be treated within the community. On the question of social welfare officers provision is made whereby inmates may be released on licence and placed under the care of a social welfare officer or any other designated person. Here I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is in a position to state whether he has sufficient staff to maintain proper supervision in regard to these persons who are released on licence. If not, there is also provision made that they can be released into the care of some person or society, and if that is to be the case I think the hon. the Minister should make some provision whereby that person or that society can obtain some form of financial assistance from the State, because these welfare organizations, of course, are encouraged by the State and receive certain subsidies. But there are often other aspects of welfare work in respect of which no subsidy is paid. For instance, at the Lulama treatment centre in Durban a social welfare worker on the staff of that organization is not receiving any subsidy from the Government. I believe that where these persons are to be committed to the care of a society such as a welfare organization, some provision must be made to give them financial assistance. Sir, the question of placing people under the care of social welfare officers in terms of a postponement order so that they can receive their treatment within the community, is indeed a very important aspect and one which is stressed in the Report of the Inter-departmental Committee of Inquiry into the treatment of alcoholics. As I mentioned earlier it is indeed a drastic step to remove persons from their community. We often find that when they return to society they are shunned by their friends; they find it exceedingly difficult to find employment and often they find that their whole domestic life has been upset and that their family unit has completely disintegrated. Often because of domestic problems which prey on their minds these persons abscond from our present work colonies. I hope that that particular aspect will receive as much attention as possible, and also the other important aspect of after-care hostels. We know that in terms of the Work Colonies Act of 1949 provision was made for after-care hostels, but unfortunately the State has not been able to establish any of these after-care hostels. I understand there are certain approved aftercare hostels that do receive a subsidy from the Government and naturally they must be encouraged. Wherever possible I believe that the services of welfare organizations must be used to the full. But at the same time I feel that where the State sees that it is necessary to do so, they should endeavour to establish these after-care hostels which will be of great assistance to those persons who have been released on licence or discharged from these retreats and rehabilitation centres. Often these persons who are released on licence disappear completely after they have come back into the community where they are required to report to a social welfare officer. They perhaps find that life outside the institution is not what it used to be. They then move on to another town and one loses track of them completely. In no time those same persons are back again at an institution. All the good work that has been done, all the treatment that has been given to them, all the specialized treatment at that institution, has then been wasted. I think a vital link in the whole pattern of rehabilitation is to have sufficient after-care hostels where these persons can receive the necessary guidance and discipline and assistance to get on to their feet in the community again.</p>

<p><span class="col_6705_6706" refersTo="page_0685"/>The question of the approved hostels is provided for in Clause 11. In terms of Clause 12 these organizations can receive financial aid from the Central Government, and I hope that where there are organizations which are willing to establish these approved hostels, no difficulties will be placed in their way in getting the necessary financial assistance from the Government. The question of the committal of a person and his retention in an institution is another matter of vital concern because the Bill contains drastic provisions in regard to the committal of a person to an institution. For instance, it is provided that on the first committal that person shall be committed for a period of three years, and should that person subsequently be committed to an institution, he is committed indefinitely. I think it is a very drastic step to commit a person for an indefinite period. I believe that some form of appeal, should be made available to the inmate so that he can obtain his release. Provision is made that the Minister may release such inmates at some subsequent time, but I do feel that the provision that the second committal shall be for an indefinite period is an extremely drastic one.</p>

<p>We do not want to lay down a maximum period because if a person is put in an institution for three years, it does not mean that he stays there for three years. He can be released at any time within the three years.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder if the Minister has any objection as far as the subsequent period is concerned to say that a person may be detained there for a period of three years or less. As it stands now it is merely an indefinite period. The first committal is for a period of three years or less. The second time, however, he may be committed to the institution for life. [Interjection.] As my hon. friend here says, there cannot be anything more &#x201C;maximum&#x201D; than &#x201C;indefinite&#x201D;. It does appear here that the committal for the first time will be for a period of at least three years or it might be less should he be released on licence, but his subsequent committal is for an indefinite period, and I believe that this provision is too wide and too drastic in its present form. However, there are other members on this side of the House who wish to comment on that particular aspect.</p>

<p>Sir, with these comments I would like to say that as far as we on this side of the House are concerned we view this Bill as a great step forward in regard to the rehabilitation of alcoholics and other maladjusted persons, and we do hope that this measure will produce better results in regard to rehabilitation. The latest available figures show that just over 40 per cent of those persons committed to work colonies have been successfully rehabilitated. I hope that in terms of this new legislation, this new charter for persons who have become the victims of the disease of alcoholism and for other maladjusted persons, greater success will be achieved than in the past and therefore we wish this Bill well.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>It is gratifying to find so much unanimity in the House to-day. But that was to be expected, because I am convinced that this Bill will be approved of by all the people in the country. I am convinced that there are hundreds of thousands of people who are grateful to the Minister for having had the courage of his convictions in introducing this Bill. I am certain that even long after he has gone, this Act will still stand as a monument to his love for his people and the services he rendered to them.</p>

<p>Amongst other things this Bill provides for the appointment of a National Advisory Alcoholism Board. The function of this board will be to advise the. Minister in matters affecting alcoholism or in regard to any other matter which they want to bring to the notice of the Minister, or which the Minister entrusts to them. A further function of the board is to co-ordinate the various services, particularly in regard to treatment. Treatment, as you know, takes place in various spheres There is danger of overlapping, and therefore it is a good thing that this board will be a co-ordinating factor. But there is another function, namely the conducting of research in regard to the causes and the treatment of alcoholism; the initiation and the planning of research. I hope that the board will regard research as its main function. We know so little in regard to alcoholism. What we dish up so facilely as facts is mainly based on guesswork and therefore I believe that research on a much higher level will have to be done. We heard a moment ago from the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. Venter) that there are experts who consider that the causes are to be found only in physiological disturbances. It is impossible to consider at this stage that there can be only one cause of alcoholism and therefore I say that research should be done on a very wide physiological level, seeing that it is maintained that its cause lies in malnutrition or in a glandular disturbance, or that it is perhaps due to factors of heredity. Research will have to be done in both the psychological and in the sociological spheres Others again think that the whole problem can be solved if only the ethical principles of the deviate concerned can be set right again if he can be brought back to his religion again. There are many such contentions, and therefore I hope that this Advisory Board will regard research as its main function, because <span class="col_6707_6708" refersTo="page_0686"/>there must be factors which contribute towards whether a man is likely to become an alcoholic or not. We so easily say that alcoholism breaks up family life. That may be so; I am not denying it, but it will be interesting, if research is done, to determine to what extent a broken-up family causes a man to become an alcoholic. It would be interesting if research could ascertain to what extent these realistic advertisements one sees in regard to liquor influence the young man or woman in becoming an alcoholic in future. We all know how realistically parties or picnics where liquor is consumed are depicted in the cinema, in the Press and in periodicals, as if liquor can be substituted for good food. When one notes that bottles stores advertise even in school magazines, one begins to wonder whether a limitation should not be placed on those very realistic advertisements for liquor.</p>

<p>The basic idea of this Bill is education and rehabilitation. It is the continuation and the extension of the policy already accepted in 1949 in the Work Colonies Act, but we now go further and try to separate the criminal aspect from the alcoholic aspect. We try to remove the stigma. We try to keep the person out of prison, and the emphasis in this Bill is therefore not laid on punishment but on training and rehabilitation so as to become worthy citizens. That is why provision is made for physical education and for mental development and treatment. That is also why provision is made that the person&#x2019;s doctor, who is responsible for his physical health, will have a say and will be allowed to help him; and that is why there is provision for the psychiatrist to be able to treat his mental condition. That is also why the social worker will play his role in trying to remedy the social problems of the person. It is also gratifying to see that provision is made for such a person to have the necessary contact with his Minister, who can help him to find his bearings again. The whole idea is to get away from the idea of imprisonment. Isolation in a prison leads to despair, but with this assistance which is given to the alcoholic he will be given a new courage and new hope for the future. I want to emphasize what the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) said, namely that until such time as the contrary is proved we must accept that the overwhelming weight of evidence points to the fact that the alcoholic is a sick person. Until such time as the contrary is proved, we must treat him as such and he must be given all the privileges which any other sick person would enjoy if he went to hospital. If we do it in that way, we can confidently expect the co-operation of everybody concerned, and we can also expect to receive the co-operation and the gratitude of those whom this Bill is intended to help. I just want to refer for a moment to the fact that provision is made for separate institutions for the various population groups in our country. I do not mention that with a view to the political aspect. I just want to emphasize that I regard it as essential that the person should receive treatment amongst his own people. The alcoholic has a better chance of being cured if he is treated in the environment to which he is accustomed, and find himself amongst people who understand him. I want to emphasize the question of after-care to which other hon. members have already referred. It is essential that before a person is sent back into the world, employment should be obtained for him. I wonder whether it is not perhaps part of the duty of the State to make provision for such people in the Public Service, even though only temporarily. It is absolutely essential that there should be no stigma at all attaching to such a person when he is released. There must be no sense of guilt. Everything possible must be done to help this person and to prevent him from backsliding. Everything possible should be done to train him to be a worthy citizen. The method of community treatment proposed in this Bill will largely be an experiment, but I believe it will be a good experiment and I am convinced that it will not only help the man and his family economically, but that it will assist him to regain his self-confidence more quickly and in that way make him a more stable member of society.</p>

<p>I just want to say a word in regard to the financial assistance. From what I hear, the S.A. National Council for Alcoholism is not being well supported by the public as regards funds at all. I am told that they always have to struggle to carry on. It is a pity that it is so. It is gratifying to see that in terms of this Bill the Department will grant greater financial support to these organizations, and that the State is prepared to do more. I just want to mention one aspect which will perhaps be unpopular in certain circles. I want to suggest that it be considered whether it is not possible that the liquor industry should make provision for funds for research either by way of voluntary donations or by way of special taxation. One can argue the point; I do not want to go into it, but I just mention it as a possibility. Should not this industry which is perhaps the indirect cause of the problem of these people make its contribution by providing the necessary funds for research in order to assist these people? In other words, I want to associate myself with the remarks of former speakers in welcoming this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Far be it for me to answer many of the points made by the hon. member who has just sat down on which he is so qualified to speak save the point which he emphasized and which was originally made by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) that he was very pleased to see that the alcoholic was now to be treated rather as a sick person than something in the nature of a social misfit. I welcome that part of this Bill particularly which gives to the courts of this country the opportunity, indeed in many instances obliges the court, to treat alcoholics as patients. The experience of many of us who practise in our courts has been that where you have clients who are alcoholics <span class="col_6709_6710" refersTo="page_0687"/>there is nothing the court can do to treat them on a different basis from any other person. I am very pleased to see those provisions in this Bill relating to these people.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down, like many other hon. members before him, has followed the hon. Minister in referring to this Bill as if it dealt only with alcoholics. The hon. Minister&#x2019;s speech when he introduced the Bill at the second reading was based on the assumption that this Bill dealt with alcoholics. Indeed, Sir, the inter-departmental commission which sat on this Bill was specifically referred to the question of alcoholism. The terms of reference of this commission were to inquire into, to take evidence, and to report as soon as convenient upon methods of treatment to be applied in the rehabilitation of alcoholics bearing in mind the services rendered in this regard by the Department, the adequacy of these services rendered by the Department and welfare organizations in relation to alcoholics. In talking about the need for an inquiry the commission says that the need for an inquiry has arisen from the increasing interest in comparatively recent times by the State and private initiative in rehabilitation services to alcoholics. There is no doubt that all the attention that was directed to this Bill was directed to a Bill to deal with alcoholics. Everyone who has spoken so far talked to it on that basis. The hon. member for Rosettenville also mentioned some people who, although they may not be alcoholics were somewhat <i>in extremis,</i> i.e. tramps, hoboes, and beggars.</p>

<p>The Bill, as it stands, appears to me to go much further than that. I hope the Minister will give us some assurance as to the sort of person this Bill is intended to cover. I wish to refer particularly to Clause 14. According to Clause 14 the sort of person who may be brought before a magistrate and who may be committed to one of these institutions fall into five categories. In almost all of these it is probable that the person has got to that stage because of drink. In only one of these categories is the person definitely identified as an alcoholic and that is category (b), a person who is addicted to drink or drugs and in consequence thereof squanders his means or injures his health or endangers the peace or in any other manner does harm to his own welfare or the welfare of his family. That is the only category which specifically deals with alcoholics. Sub-paragraphs (a), (c), (d) and (e) do not necessarily deal with alcoholics. They deal with a number of people who, by reason of the circumstances set out in this clause, are social misfits. Tramps, beggars and hoboes are definitely dealt with here. These are people who are <i>in extremis</i> socially. If one looks at the last of these categories namely a person who leads an idle, dissolute or disorderly life, I think we are going perhaps a little further than even the category of alcoholics or that extraordinary category of people to whom the hon. member for Rosettenville has referred. As the clause stands I think we might be covering the type or person who is simply leading an idle life. For myself, and I hope the Minister agrees with me, the man who leads an idle life, while committing no social indiscretion (or perhaps committing many social indiscretions) is not a person whose social freedom should be restricted. And I do not believe the Minister has in mind to deal with such a person. I go so far as to say that even if the Bill were passed in this form a person leading a dissolute life but not doing any harm to anybody would not be committed by a magistrate. But it seems to me that under this clause you may well be able to call in that class of social phenomenon which our society has produced called the ducktail. The hon. Minister nods his head.</p>

<p>No, I am not nodding my head; I cannot quite hear what you are saying.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will tell us whether a ducktail, if I may use the expression to describe the sort of person I have in mind, is in fact to be included under this provision. Because, if so, I think this House ought to have a little more information relating to these people as to whether this is the proper way of dealing with the problem of duck-tails. I do not believe it is and I do not believe that the hon. Minister intended this Bill to cover ducktails because the Minister did not mention them at all in his speech. Indeed the Bill which is a replica almost of the Bill which was framed and adopted by the inter-departmental committee during the recess makes no mention of these people. I wonder whether the provisions for rehabilitation, in so far as they may apply to alcoholics&#x2014;I accept that they do; I am not qualified to say whether they do; I accept medical opinion that this Bill is necessary for the treatment of alcoholics&#x2014;can be applied to solve the problem of ducktails. The investigations certainly did not go so far and I hope the Minister will give us an assurance that this Bill is not intended to meet this position. I hope the Minister will, when we come to the Committee Stage, give consideration to any amendments that may be moved in regard to this matter. Whatever the position is, Mr. Speaker, whether or not this Bill is intended to cover the group of people I have mentioned, what I want to point out to the Minister applies in any event; it applies more to those people who are not alcoholics but who are committed in terms of this Bill. Because, whether or not the places to which these people are to go are prisons&#x2014; I accept they will obviously not be prisons&#x2014; whether a stigma will attach to those people (the Minister said there would not be; be that as it may), the fact of the matter remains that these people are to be deprived of their liberty for a certain period. This is a very important circumstance in the lives of these people. It is true that they are deprived of their liberty by the court. The court goes into the matter, it hears evidence in the matter, the person who is to become an inmate has representation, <span class="col_6711_6712" refersTo="page_0688"/>if he wishes to, all the facts are placed before the court, that is true.</p>

<p>But he is nevertheless deprived of his liberty for a period which can be three years; it may be less. Throughout this period there is no way in which, on his own accord, the person who is so detained is able, as a right, to have his case reviewed by the same authority who put him in there, i.e. the court. The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) has dealt with this matter. In terms of Clause 19 if a person is detained for the first time he is detained for a period of three years. It is true that he may be released before that period on the recommendation of somebody like the hon. the Minister. But on the second occasion he may be there indefinitely unless some recommendation is made for his earlier release. The point is, however, that the release he gets is a release in the discretion of and ordered by an executive or administrative authority, not by the court. In saying this I am not doubting at all the <i>bona fides</i> of the doctors and officials concerned with it but there may well be circumstances where someone should be released before his period is over.</p>

<p>In this regard the hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) has said&#x2014;and I think this is accepted by everyone in this House&#x2014;that if there is one thing we know very little about it is alcoholism. We know very little about the treatment of alcoholism. I accept what my medical friends tell me that in treating an alcoholic you need a minimum period of one year in which he should be detained and kept in an institution. That may well be so. But do we know enough about alcoholism to say that the man should be detained in the discretion of those persons who are in charge of these institutions without having a recourse to a court as of right to have his case reviewed even if that review only takes place after the expiration of one year but before the three years have elapsed. I was shattered to hear the hon. member for Rosettenville say that there are 100,000 alcoholics in South Africa. I do not know how many beggars tramps and hobos there are But if there are a 100,000 alcoholics I shudder to think how overcrowded our institutions are going to become. We have had experience in this country of the overcrowding of our mental institutions. As soon as these institutions become so overcrowded you open the door to administrative mistakes or to the possibility of people administratively overlooking cases which should be reviewed and which the staff does not have the time to review.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that I think this is a very bold experiment. I support this Bill wholeheartedly because I believe it is a way of dealing with alcoholism.</p>

<p>In saying that I bear in mind these other categories that I have mentioned. As far as they are concerned, while so little is known about alcoholism, even less is known about the difficulties and the reasons for the appearance on our social scene of this phenomena amongst our young people, namely the ducktail problem. I hope the Minister will have sympathy with the amendments that will be moved, amendments that will give to the inmates of these institutions the right, although it may only be after a certain period as far as alcoholics are concerned, to go to court to have their case reviewed and get their release from what will otherwise be an incarceration unnecessarily for a much longer period than they should be there.</p>

<p>As far as this Bill is concerned it is extremely wide in relation to Clause 14. Will the Minister give us an assurance that this Bill is not intended to deal with the problems of duck-tails or with social misfits but that it is intended only to deal with alcoholics. If that is so I hope the Minister would accept an amendment when the appropriate time comes to limit the operations of this Bill to alcoholics and perhaps to the cases mentioned by the hon. member for Rosettenville, i.e. beggars, tramps and hoboes. These latter categories are extreme cases but as far as the ducktails are concerned I hope the nod of the Minister&#x2019;s head did not indicate that this Bill was meant to deal with ducktails because I do not think there is any basis upon which this House can pass this Bill to deal with ducktails. I accept it is to deal with alcoholics and I hope the Minister will enlighten us as to just how far it is intended to go and as to his attitude towards the amendments which will be moved giving to the inmates the right to have their cases reviewed before the expiration of the three years.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN NIEROP</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened very attentively to the speeches dealing with what is probably one of the biggest problems not only in South Africa but throughout the world in general. I am very glad that this House is able to give its attention in a calm atmosphere to a matter which to a very large extent affects the future of our nation. I could not follow the previous speaker very well. He supports the Bill as far as alcoholism is concerned, but he does not want it to be applied to &#x201C;ducktails&#x201D;. I should have been pleased if he had added &#x201C;cocktails&#x201D; because I think there is a close link between the two. I think there would be fewer ducktails if there were fewer cocktails. I welcome the changed outlook in this House and even in the Department. On behalf of those people who think as I do, I want to convey my thanks to the Minister for the change which he has brought about in his Department. I remember that a senior official of his Department said some time ago that in rearing a baby one must remember that wine has a greater nutrition value than milk. To-day we have the position that the Government and the Minister have come forward with legislation which will be welcomed by every person who has the welfare of our people at heart. As far as this Bill is concerned I think it will be welcomed even by those people who regard others as narrow-minded and as &#x201C;spoilsports&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_6713_6714" refersTo="page_0689"/>I was surprised to hear from the hon. member who spoke first this afternoon that he regards alcoholism as a disease. I think the hon. member will remember that when he was at university his professor often told him that alcoholism was the cause of this, that or the other illness, but I do not think any professor ever told him that alcoholism as such was a disease. Alcoholism is the new name for something which we do not like to call by its correct name. I am very glad that the medical practitioners have taken part in this debate. When I go to a medical practitioner and ask him what is the cause of my illness, I expect him to call a spade a spade and to tell me what the disease is and what the cause of it is. I expect him to tell me that I am overindulging in this, that or the other respect and that that is the cause of my illness. This afternoon, however, I heard medical practitioners talk about ways of treating the disease after the person has become ill, but I did not hear one of them say what was the cause of it. There would have been less alcoholism but for a certain fruit. If we had no liquor in this country it would not have been necessary to take measures to combat this disease. I personally do not believe that it is a disease. If one calls alcoholism a disease then one can also call smoking a disease; one can call dagga-smoking a disease; one can call overindulgence in food or anything else a disease. If the consumption of liquor is a disease then there is just about nothing on earth which is not a disease. Since we are discussing this Bill this afternoon, I also hope that the time will never come in this House when the proposal will be put forward that we should discuss the causes of what we want to obviate here this afternoon. I hope that we shall never make it easier for persons than it is for them to-day to become the victims of this disease which we are trying to combat to-day. If the medical practitioners on both sides of the House who spoke this afternoon apply in practice what they said here this afternoon, and that is simply to tell people how they can get rid of the disease without telling them what the cause of it is, then I would not want any one of them to be my doctor.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with the clauses in detail because that can be done in the Committee Stage. I want to pose the general question, however, whether this House is aware of the role which alcoholism plays. I differ from those medical practitioners who say that it is only a certain group of people in the higher strata who suffer from this disease. That may be the case in their own practices. There is a large group of people, however, who never go to medical practitioners and who are the victims of alcoholism. There is no gainsaying the fact that the greatest troubles in this country are caused by the misuse of liquor. I think if you go to the mental asylums and institute investigations there and ask the physicians why people are committed to mental asylums, they will tell you that the misuse of alcohol is the cause in many cases. If you go to our courts of law you will find that in many cases the misuse of liquor is the cause of the breaking up of families or the unhappiness that one finds in many families. In many cases, when troubles of any kind arise, one finds that they were caused by the misuse of liquor. If there had been no abuse of liquor it would not have been necessary to appoint a committee to inquire what can be done in this matter and this Bill would not have been before the House to-day either. That is why my plea to this House to-day is that when opportunities present themselves to discuss the causes of accidents and of the appalling conditions that we see in our streets and that we find in certain homes, the matter should be discussed in this House, as we are doing to-day, on its merits in the interests of our nation. I do not want to go into this at greater length. I just want to express my thanks to the Minister and his Department, and I want to give the Minister the assurance that this legislation which he has introduced here to-day will do more good than any legislation, perhaps with the exception of two or three measures, which has been introduced in this House over the past 25 years since I have been a member.</p>

But I want to give the Minister the assurance that anything which the Government does to strengthen the morals of this nation or to combat diseases and evils, will have the full support of the nation. I think the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) rather put his foot into it when he said towards the end of his speech that he wished to exclude sick persons who drive motor-cars. But surely if one is ill one cannot help it. Whether one drives a motor-car or a train or rides a bicycle, if one is ill then one is ill. This only goes to show that alcoholism is not a disease but that it does cause many illnesses which reduce people to such a state that they become a danger not only to their families but also to members of the public in the street.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) that we possibly do not all lead the blameless life that he appears to lead. Apparently he is going against all modern medical knowledge when he is denying the fact that alcoholism is in fact considered as a sickness. In any country that has any pretentions to modern practice of medicine, alcoholism is treated not as a crime but as an illness, and people are rehabilitated on those grounds. The hon. member talks about discussing this Bill in a calm atmosphere. I think he would possibly have been more relevant if he has said that we would discuss it in a sober atmosphere, and that of course is what I intend to do. I want to point out to the hon. member that there was more alcoholism in the United <span class="col_6715_6716" refersTo="page_0690"/>States in the days of prohibition than there has been since those days. When prohibition was enforced, evil results of drinking were far more noticeable than is, for instance, the case in the United States to-day when prohibition has been withdrawn. The hon. member should realize that it is not easy to impose restrictions on other people, according to his own particular standard of behaviour. Drinking of alcohol is one of the things which, in fact, mankind has been accustomed to for a long time and as long as it is done in moderation, a large number of people do not think that it is as serious a matter as the hon. member for Mossel Bay deems it to be. But when it is not done in moderation it becomes alcoholism and it becomes a danger to society, it becomes an illness and it must be treated as such. Like other members on this side, I want to tell the hon. Minister that I am very glad that this Bill has been introduced, because I believe that it is an important improvement in many respects. I believe for instance the recognition of the basic principle that one must treat alcoholics in a way different from criminals. But there are other things too which have brought about improvements in the existing situation. I see that in the hon. Minister&#x2019;s speech when introducing the second reading, he mentioned that the ideal is to set up a national plan of action to cope with the problem of alcoholism, and he mentioned <i>inter alia</i>: (a) The expansion of hospital and other facilities for the treatment of alcoholics in the community; (b) the establishment of one centralized complex of State retreats for Whites and one for Coloureds where alcoholics may be compelled to undergo treatment. In passing, Sir, I want to ask the hon. Minister if he means to exclude Bantu alcoholics, or does his use of the word &#x201C;Coloureds&#x201D; in this instance include anybody who is not European? I would be interested to know whether he specifically meant or did not mean to exclude Africans from sub-section (b). Then the hon. Minister went on to mention the expansion of private institutions for the treatment of alcoholics, separated from the community, and the expansion of social, supervisory and after-care services by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions in co-operation with private welfare organizations. I believe that all that is going to be of the greatest value to this country, and I think all of us are very pleased indeed that the hon. Minister is indeed visualizing an overall plan of action which goes outside the scope of the Bill that we are considering to-day.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to say one or two things about the clauses of the Bill which I feel could possibly be improved. I firstly come to Clause 4, which has already been mentioned by other speakers, the &#x201C;purposes for which persons are detained in retreat or rehabilitation centres&#x201D; for rehabilitation. I want to ask the hon. Minister whether he is contemplating, and I hope he is, a change in the existing situation, whereby persons who up to now have been confined to work colonies have been put on hard physical labour in fact. I have had letters from people at Sonderwater and other institutions complaining that when they arrived there as alcoholics, having been sentenced to a term of detention of three years, they were simply put on pick-and-shovel work. I sincerely hope that in terms of this new Bill, the hon. Minister is not contemplating a continuation of that system, which I think is absolutely useless. First of all people who are alcoholics are sick, they are physically debilitated, and putting them on pick-and-shovel work is not going to rehabilitate them.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>You do not build up sick people by putting them on hard physical work. You first cure the illness from which they are suffering and then you attempt to give them the sort of physical work of which they are capable. But certainly an habitual alcoholic is not capable of hard labour of the pick-and-shovel type, which if the letters to me are to be believed, is the sort of work on which they have been put at Sonderwater as well as at some of the other institutions. The hon. Minister mentioned Sonderwater in his second-reading speech in terms of considerable praise. I must say that I have had a letter written by a man who is obviously well educated, a letter incidentally signed by six people, all of whom are inmates of Sonderwater. I hope the House will excuse me from disclosing these names as I have been specifically asked not to do so, but I would be prepared to show this letter to the hon. Minister for him to act on, provided of course, as I am sure he would do, he would give me his assurance that there will be no victimization of any kind. But I must say that according to this letter, the type of work to which the alcoholics have been subjected is hard physical work, they complain about the food, they complain that the people put in charge of them are people without any experience, without any training, or rather any education in the handling of alcoholics and that they are summarily categorized by these people. If they commit any breach of the rules of the institution, they suffer severe penalties, simply on the categorization by such people who are in charge. There are various other complaints. I think the handling of those people certainly requires a change and I hope that Clause 4 (a), which makes mention of the physical condition to be improved by means of physical training, does not envisage the sort of hard labour that work colony inmates had been subjected to in the past.</p>

<p>There are one or two other things I want to mention. In Clause 14, I think there ought to be some time limit in this definition in respect of the person who can be sent to a rehabilitation centre, or retreat, for a period of up to three years and possibly longer. It surely should be a question of a person who habitually squanders his means of livelihood, <span class="col_6717_6718" refersTo="page_0691"/>or who habitually does not support his family. As far as I can make out from Clause 14 there is no time limit imposed as to the length of time in which a person has been squandering his means of livelihood by betting, gambling or otherwise and who fails to provide for his own support or for that of any dependant. Is it six months, a year, two years? What time limit is there before a person is committed to a retreat or a rehabilitation centre?</p>

<p>Sub-section (4) of this Clause 14 also should be explained in a little more detail in so far as the term <i>&#x201C;</i> engaged in remunerated work&#x201D; does not appear to include persons who are self-employed, persons for instance who are running their own agencies, or door-to-door salesmen. I realize that very often that is rather an unreliable form of earning one&#x2019;s living, but nevertheless &#x201C;remunerated work&#x201D; may, strictly defined, be taken to mean somebody who is getting a wage or a salary. I wonder if the hon. Minister here contemplated self-employed people as well, and again if there is any time limit within which these people may appear to have been habitually unremunerated.</p>

<p>I want to say that I think Clause 15 (1) (c) is a very good clause, and I also think that sub-section (5) is a very good sub-section because up to now I do not think that a person who was on the point of being submitted to treatment at one of the centres, had the opportunity of defending himself, but now that opportunity is being given to him. I wonder if the hon. Minister has contemplated making sub-section (4) of Clause 15 also obligatory, in other words, that the magistrate holding an inquiry &#x201C;shall&#x201D; direct that the person in respect of whom the inquiry is being held be examined by a district surgeon or by a psychiatrist. Once we have decided that alcoholism is a sickness and that it should be treated medically, it seems to me that it is desirable to make it obligatory that the magistrate should get the opinion of a trained psychiatrist in this regard. I am glad that it is now obligatory for the magistrate to get a report from a social welfare officer. That is an improvement, but it is the next sub-section that worries me, and I would be prepared to move an amendment in Committee, but it is just possible that the hon. Minister may have some reasonable explanation, in which case I would not like to waste the time of the Committee by moving such an amendment. I believe that Clause 15 is a great improvement in so far as it enables the postponement of commitment. I am a bit worried about this question of the three years as a sort of minimum period, although I realize that a person can be released sooner. But laying down that the initial commitment must be a period of three years, seems to me a bit lengthy in view of modern treatment of alcoholics, and I wonder whether the specific period of three years should be inserted, even though I realize that a person can be released at an earlier stage. Would the hon. Minister give more details in this respect in view of existing medical practice to-day as far as the treatment of alcoholism is concerned?</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying again that this Bill is a great improvement and I will certainly support the second reading of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I regard this Bill as one of the most important pieces of legislation introduced in this House this Session. In my opinion it really has a broader significance than just the combating of alcoholism. In saying that I want to pose the question at once whether the time has not come when alcoholism should be dealt with in a Bill as a separate problem, because I regard the key to this Bill as Clause 14. That clause relates to five classes of persons. The first consists of those whom I would call wasters, people who because of misconduct neglect or fail to support their families. I regard them as the wasters; the second class consists of those who are addicted to liquor and drugs; the third class consists of the beggars and the fourth of the hoboes, people who do not earn an honest living, and the last category consists of what I would call the tsotsis, the &#x201C;ducktails Five classes of persons are really dealt with here therefore, and we have to do here with legislation dealing with the consequences of modern social life. We are not dealing here with the causes but with the consequences of modern social life. Everyone of these five classes of persons is the product of our modern social life. What we are dealing with here is really a sociological problem in the main. I do not want to go as far as some speakers have done and concentrate entirely on alcoholism, because the immediate cause of alcoholism is probably of a physiological nature. It is probably a disease, a disease of the body, but that disease of the body owes its origin to a psychological cause, probably inhibition, frustration, which in turn is due to the fact that the person is a misfit in society. The sociological, psychological and physiological causes are interrelated therefore but they do not arise simultaneously; the one follows upon the other. The hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) was perfectly correct therefore in saying that we must not place too much emphasis on the &#x201C;ducktail&#x201D; but rather on the cocktail. In discussing the causes, we must seek those causes in modern society. Since I want to view this Bill from a broad angle, I do not propose to confine myself to alcoholism alone. I also want to deal with the other four classes, to whom very little reference is made in this Bill, although practically all of them are going to be treated alike. I want to pose the question therefore whether the board which is going to be appointed should not be a board dealing with alcoholism and maladjustment. Why is it a board dealing only with alcoholics and not with maladjusted persons as well, because, after all, there are other maladjusted groups of persons who should be dealt with in terms of this Bill. And if it is not the intention to deal with <span class="col_6719_6720" refersTo="page_0692"/>these other maladjusted persons, is the obvious course not to introduce a Bill dealing with alcoholism only and to deal with this matter as a separate subject?</p>

<p>I think the position of the wasters, the position of the beggars, is just as much a problem to society as that of the alcoholics. I should like to put this matter in the right perspective therefore. We cannot deal with alcoholism as a separate subject. There are also the other maladjusted persons who form part of our society and who need our attention just as much as the alcoholics.</p>

<p>As far as the Bill itself is concerned, it prescribes a particular legal procedure as to how the various classes of persons have to be dealt with before they are committed to certain institutions. I want to put a few questions, and I do so not because I do not welcome the Bill. I wholeheartedly support the Bill; I think this is a big step forward, but I do want to ask whether we are not sticking to the letter of the law too much by still following the old procedure of going through the courts in committing these people to institutions? It is the very fact that we use the machinery of the courts that places a stigma on such a person, the stigma of being a criminal. By going through the courts we place a stigma on that person. He is then regarded not as a maladjusted person or a person who is ill but as a criminal, because he is committed to a certain institution by the magistrate. Has the time not come when we should seriously consider the question of introducing a different procedure and getting away from the old procedure that had to be followed under our Criminal and Procedure Act in dealing with these persons? To a large extent we are still following the procedure of having these persons committed to an institution by the magistrate, by the court.</p>

<p>If a person who is an alcoholic wants to be committed of his own free will to a place where he can be treated, he still has to follow the old procedure of going through a magistrate; the magistrate first has to deal with his case even if he wishes to go voluntarily. The stigma then attaches to him that he appeared before the court. If I contract an ordinary illness I go to hospital without having to go via the magistrate. I feel that alcoholism is a disease, and if that is so it should not be necessary for people to be committed by a magistrate. I feel that we already have the necessary social welfare machinery in South Africa to be able to deal with such cases without going through the magistrate. We have the necessary machinery. When I say &#x201C;we&#x201D; I mean our modern society. We are really responsible for all five classes of people with whom we are dealing here. It is our responsibility as a modern society, because modern society is responsible for this. In the pre-war period we had few of these cases. Alcoholism is <i>par excellence</i> a phenomenon of modern life. Wasters, gamblers, people who go to races, are the products of modern life. The same applies to hoboes. In our childhood days I never came across a hobo on the road. It is a phenomenon of modern life and I think it is the responsibility of modern society to look after these people. We are responsible for it and we must not attach the stigma to them that they are criminals.</p>

<p>I heartily welcome this Bill because it distinguishes between alcoholics and other maladjusted persons, but I want to draw a further distinction. I should like to see that we also distinguish between the other groups of maladjusted persons. The Minister has the power under Clause 2 to draw that distinction, and I should like this distinction to be carried further so that the waster will not be put into the same category as the hobo; so that the tsotsis will not be grouped together with alcoholics. We should draw that distinction and place each category in its own institution.</p>

<p>There is another point in this Bill which I heartily welcome and that is that provision is being made for a certain amount of aftercare. However, I just want to say that in my opinion the period of after-care is too short. I think it should be slightly longer, and that also applies to those persons who voluntarily ask that they should be committed. I think the period of six months should be extended because we have ample medical evidence that it takes a minimum period of 12 months to rehabilitate an alcoholic. Where a person voluntarily presents himself for treatment the maximum period should not be six months as provided for in the Bill; it should be a longer period so that he can be completely rehabilitated. I want to congratulate the Minister most heartily on this Bill. In bringing this Bill before the House he has rendered a service to the community.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I accept naturally the principle of the establishment of these proposed rehabilitation centres. I accept this Bill wholeheartedly, but with a certain amount of misgiving because of the drafting of one or two of the clauses. In the years after the war, the question of alcoholism, which is one of the curses at which this Bill is aimed, created great difficulties. When a war breaks out, Mr. Speaker, any knights of the road that there are in existence immediately join up for various reasons, mostly their own, and on demobilization, they are thrown back on society with others who through weakness of character or as a result of their war experiences, seek solace in drink and sink to a mode of life which we have seen, bringing hell to their families and friends and to themselves. At one time the organization I had the honour to be with had a file on each and everyone of these knights of the road&#x2014;those unfortunate chaps who had been drunks or tramps before the war, and the others much younger, who joined this unhappy band, and I am pleased to say, very pleased to say, that over the years, many, very many, of these men found their place in life again. In those days, Mr. Speaker, we had many, many discussions on the question of bringing <span class="col_6721_6722" refersTo="page_0693"/>pressure to bear on the Government of the time to take compulsory powers to put these fellows inside for the benefit of the country and the people of the country. The idea was of course to put them into retreats not in goals. Mr. Speaker, in those days, not so very long ago, many a man was in favour of allowing another man to go to hell in his own way if he wanted to, as long as he was causing no great disturbance in the country. Notwithstanding the arguments, that I have heard again to-day about their way of life bringing sorrow to families, friends and relatives, in those days we decided against pressing for compulsion, and I know and every hon. member here must know, of men who redeemed themselves, men who were in the gutter and who suddenly found their manhood again and mastered this dreadful disease. I would be surprised if there is a single member of this House who does not know of such cases. Mr. Speaker, I mentioned those who left the army and who became alcoholics and brought sorrow and shame to those around them. They were civilians, joined the forces and became civilians again and as civilians, citizens, most of them found their place again and can now hold their heads high without having been compulsorily confined for three years. Mr. Speaker, many years have passed since I dealt with such matters, and it seems to me that the world has gone backwards. Where I could find it in me to stand by my comrades in those days, comrades who stood by me, I find it more difficult now to stand by men and women who are stricken by what my doctor friends now call a disease. When I say &#x201C;I find it more difficult to stand by them&#x201D;, I mean that I find it more difficult to take up the standpoint that there must be no compulsion which this Bill now brings in regard to their going into retreats. Present-day life may be more difficult and the future may look more dangerous, but there seems to be to-day an easing of the social conventions and a disregard of the teachings of our fathers which can only bring unhappiness and misery in the future and which definitely demands the intervention of the State. It is with a heavy heart, therefore, that I have come around to agree that there must be compulsory powers of committal in certain cases, but in some respects this Bill goes too far. It could be that a man passes his life in a rosy glow without ever being objectionable or breaking the law, and he is perhaps just lucky enough not to have to work for a living and he is still a fellow one is always pleased to meet. But as this Bill is drafted, such a man could be committed for three years. It is no use someone saying it cannot happen. If there is such a provision in the law, it may be implemented at some time, and this man will be put inside for three years with no right to appeal to the courts but only to the Minister, who in terms of the Bill would have to refer to the management committee of this institution. In this respect the Bill is much too drastic. I refer again to men whom most of us know, men who have redeemed themselves and have reformed themselves, and who have restored happiness to their wives and children. But under this Bill those chaps could have been put away for three years. There are certain amendments being proposed to deal with the two kinds of case I have mentioned, the gentle alcoholic who will never do any harm, and the man with the capacity to pull himself up, and there is also an amendment coming to deal with the question of an appeal to the Court in certain circumstances. Those amendments will be moved in the Committee Stage and I hope they will be accepted in the spirit in which we are putting them forward. Compulsory committal is a drastic measure, and whether it will be humanely administered or not is beside the point, the clause must itself be fair.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) mentioned the question of the ducktails. As he said, the report of the Committee really dealt only with the question of alcoholism, but it is obvious that this Bill will apply to ducktails also. Well, I have misgivings, just as my colleague has, about this question. I think most of us regard ducktails as objectionable young people who do not work and sponge on their families, and the old saying that the devil finds work for idle hands to do comes into play, and the world has changed, and much for the worse. Family discipline, I am told, has gone to a large extent, and I am told that the youth to-day runs wild. I do not agree. The so-called ducktails wearing side whiskers and tight trousers are often seen, but those of my generation will remember that we often wore tight trousers, so tight that you could not put them on over your boots, and then came the Oxford bags, and now tight trousers have come back and they probably look strange to us. But I do not believe that the youth of to-day is any worse than we were. In fact, I believe it is better. They are more aware of the possible dangers that may happen. This Bill will give drastic powers to officials. Any member of the public, like a next-door neighbour, can make a sworn statement that a youth is leading an idle and dissolute life and he may be committed for three years. It may be necessary, but it seems a very drastic power. My only hope is that the Minister will accept the amendments we will move. I have had lots of fights with my own social welfare friends on this particular matter, and with my doctor friends. My only fear is that the amendments which we propose, if accepted by the Minister, will not be sufficient to cover the possible difficulties that I fear may arise and which I have mentioned. I support the Bill in principle, although to me compulsion is abhorrent, but under to-day&#x2019;s conditions I am afraid it is necessary to accept that there must be compulsion. I hope the Minister will accept that our amendments are intended to protect the innocent and not to weaken what he intends doing in any way. These arguments will be expanded in the Committee Stage, but I hope I have said enough so far to make the Minister realize that there are many pitfalls lying in the way <span class="col_6723_6724" refersTo="page_0694"/>of implementing this Bill, even if he accepts our amendments. The Minister has a reputation of being a tolerant man, and we need tolerance in the world, although perhaps we need tough laws as well. The hon. member for Rosettenville said this was an experiment in regard to alcoholism. Sir, many experiments have taken place throughout the world. I was once in Sweden. At that time Sweden had liquor laws which looked as if they must curb, if not prevent, much of the misery resulting from liquor. Before a man in Sweden in those days could buy spirits, he had to prove that he had paid all his household accounts, and even these provisions failed miserably. I can only hope that everyone in this House will use his influence and put himself completely behind the Minister in an endeavour to make this Bill a success.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>A great deal has been said in regard to alcoholism and the fact that it is a disease, and it seems to be established in the minds of most people and scientists that that is the case, but as far as South Africa is concerned there do not seem to be any reliable statistics that prove this, and to evaluate the menace that it is. Reports say that alcoholism is now the world&#x2019;s fourth killer disease and it has been computed that in this country R60,000,000 is wasted annually, I suppose by the excessive consumption of alcohol and by the resulting loss in man hours. It is interesting to note that there are people who exhibit similar symptoms to those of alcoholism without the causal factor of alcohol and they are regarded as being in need of treatment. In many cases the modern treatment is to treat them with the so-called tranquillizers. Some laymen believe that alcohol is the finest tranquillizer, but its excessive use leads to very serious results. It is gratifying to see that in this Bill not only alcoholism is dealt with, but also the question of the excessive use of drugs. Here I am not referring to habit-forming drugs, but to the drugs which are available under normal circumstances to the public, and which have been subject to abuse and which in many cases have led to a great deal of unhappiness. In the report of the inter-departmental committee reference is made to the various organizations which will now fall within the purview of this Bill, and emphasis is laid on the continued existence and expansion of the services provided by voluntary organizations. These voluntary organizations in many cases are staffed by public-spirited people, who give up a great deal of their time and effort to fight alcoholism, and it is fitting to pay tribute to these people for the wonderful work they are doing and the assistance they render to the State organizations. But I believe that in many respects their efforts are hampered by the constant fear of insufficient finance. It has been reported to me that many of these organizations have to exist on very slender subsidies, either from the municipalities, the provinces or the State, and in one particular case in Durban, the institution known as Lulama, lack of funds causes considerable anxiety to the people who work so hard on its behalf. If one takes into account the cost of treating an alcoholic, which varies from R36 to R46 a month, one realizes that funds are necessary. In the case of Lulama the financial position is a very serious one. In 1962 they collected in fees from the patients a sum of just over R5,000, but the actual cost of the treatment given to the patients, some of whom undertook to pay and eventually did not, was R7,000 odd, and during that time the Provincial grant received by this organization was R4,500, so they were immediately faced with a shortfall of some R1,900, and they still had to continue their operations. Many of the helpers are giving their services free, and the doctors act voluntarily.</p>

<p>Arising out of the report of this inter-departmental committee, it is interesting to note the high proportion of staff to patients in many of these institutions. I trust the Minister will take cognizance of the recommendation in the report in regard to the educational qualifications of certain members of the staff. At the moment some members of the staff are required to have only Std. VI, but the committee recommended a minimum standard of education of Std. VIII. Another aspect on which I should like to ask the Minister for his opinion is in regard to the Unemployment Insurance Act. The inter-departmental committee in considering this aspect was quite definite and said in paragraph 527 that persons who are not fit to work due to alcoholism receive no unemployment benefits, and the committee recommends that there should be provision made for the payment of benefits to alcoholics undergoing treatment. This is important, because later on the committee again refers to the matter. It referred to the lack of statistics regarding the loss of man hours and emphasized that the number of alcoholics who can be rehabilitated and resume their normal productive functions would increase considerably if facilities were available and if alcoholics were brought into contact with treatment at an earlier stage by means of educating the public. Surely that applies to a great extent to people who come under the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act. There are two suggestions I should like to make in regard to the composition of the Council. The first is that there should be definite provision in the Bill to make sure that there is a representative from each province, and the second is that of the remaining five members to be appointed, at least three should be medical practitioners engaged in and with practical experience of the treatment of alcoholism. I put forward these suggestions because they come from people who are actively engaged in the treatment of alcoholics. They feel that both these suggestions should receive the Minister&#x2019;s consideration.</p>

<p>I was interested to see the other day in the editorial of a well-known newspaper a small paragraph about alcoholism&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_6725_6726" refersTo="page_0695"/>Alcoholism is perhaps unique among the diseases of man, for that is how it must be regarded, in that he wittingly chooses to inflict it upon himself in the communal, if not in the personal, sense by continuing to manufacture the substance that causes it.</block>

<p>That is an aspect the Minister should consider seriously, in regard to the powers of the board appointed in terms of Clause 6. I do not know whether there is a clause in the Bill to make such provision, but I would like the Minister to refer to the board the aspect of the advertisement of alcoholic beverages. The hon. member for Umbilo referred to it briefly, and also the hon. member for Odendaalsrus. I am referring primarily to Press advertisements and advertisements over the commercial radio. I was quite shocked the other day. I was talking to a young man of 20 about the advertising of alcoholic drinks over the commercial radio. He was not a prude, but he took strong exception to the fact that alcoholic beverages were advertised during teen-age and young people&#x2019;s programmes on the commercial radio. I think it is an undesirable state of affairs. Many of the Press advertisements give glamour to alcohol which creates a wrong impression in the minds of young people. Many of these advertisements are a credit to the brains that conceived them. They deal with every type of liquor and they cater for every age. from the very young to the mature. While I would be the last person to suggest that there should be any control over that form of advertising, we are now introducing legislation to deal with an urgent problem. We should approach the whole matter in an objective way and begin at the beginning. Vast sums of money are spent on advertising and encouraging people to take alcohol, and the appeal is mainly to the youth. I feel that while that appeal is made it would be as well always to issue a warning and I want the Minister to consider agreeing that every advertisement should carry a warning at the bottom, just a little reminder, to the effect that 6 per cent of the people who take strong liquor become alcoholics&#x2014;one in 16. Let the people realize that while they are young. I realize that people who are brought up in a happy home can probably accept these advertisements at face value, because they receive guidance from their parents, but what about the young people who come from broken homes? Surely these advertisements have a greater impact on them. Is it not only fair that when they experience the impact of the advertisement, they should also be told of the danger arising from excesses? I should be glad if the Minister would give consideration to that aspect, and I should like to refer him to the report of the Cronje Commission of 1957 on this very subject.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I should like to ask the Minister whether he will stress, when the Advisory Board is constituted, the need to consider every educational aspect in regard to the treatment of alcoholics. This is a matter which was put forward by a voluntary social worker, that there is a very great need for the provision of funds to establish bureaux to collate all the statistical data so that we can take a completely objective view of the problem.

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The great difference between alcoholism and other addictions is the fact that it is the only addictive drug which is freely available. All the other drugs which lead to addiction are difficult to obtain. They are tied up with regulations, much worse than the old licensing regulations for alcohol, and are only supplied to certain shops and to people with certain qualifications. Alcohol is the only one which is freely available and is the only one which is built on a large industry which employs and enriches a large number of people. If alcohol is to be accepted as a drug which leads to addiction, it should therefore be a drug which is difficult to obtain, but so far from that, the State reaps revenue from it. It encourages the sale and manufacture of this drug, and even further, it permits extensive advertising, as was mentioned by my colleague. What do we find? Firstly, the State makes money out of alcohol, and now it must spend money in order to cure the people who have become addicts. It is a question of profit and loss. Presumably the profit is greater on the industrial side than the loss on the social side which results from it. However, I do not want to talk about alcohol too much. I want to say that I agree entirely with the Bill, as we all do on this side, in that it separates the addict from the &#x2018;won&#x2019;t work &#x2019; and the work-shy, and it separates the criminal, even the criminal alcoholic, from the sociological sinner, and to that extent it is a good thing. It is a fallacy to think that this country is ahead of anyone else in this respect. We are not by any means the only country where this is taking place. In the U.S.A. in 1954 they spent $2,600,000 on the rehabilitation of alcoholics, and in the ten years previous to that they spent $9,000,000. It therefore shows that this is a world-wide problem, and we must ask ourselves why we have been able to protect the drug addict but not the alcoholic addict. In past years drug addiction, which was not carefully controlled, was looked upon as rather a romantic thing, and we have literature from people like De Quincey and Baudelaire and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, all of whom wrote about the pleasures of drug addiction. In the past we had songs glorifying Bacchus. We had the &#x201C;Lost Week-end&#x201D;, lauding the pleasures of alcohol addiction. Alcohol, taken in excess, <span class="col_6727_6728" refersTo="page_0696"/>leads to complete physical and mental breakdown and it is extremely difficult to cure. I do not want to dampen the enthusiasm of the Minister and his Department, but they are faced with a problem which has never yet been solved. Medical science knows no cure for alcoholism. The difficulty is that when the man seems cured he is sent back into society, where he is surrounded by social drinking. This does not exist in the case of any other drug addiction. If a man is a morphine addict, he does not move around in a society where everybody else takes morphine. Drug addiction is not looked upon with approval by society; it is something which one is rather ashamed of. Society frowns upon it, but society does not frown on the alcoholic to the same extent, and the best the Minister can do is to bring the man back to the point where he can go out again into the world. The Minister cannot hope to cure the man entirely. The only thing he can hope to do is to get him not to do any drinking.</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting</i></p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned for supper I was on the point of discussing the Committee which the hon. the Minister had set up and I wanted to draw attention to the fact that those hon. gentlemen who sat on that Committee arrived at the conclusion that alcoholism was an illness. But amongst the members who constituted that committee was only two doctors&#x2014;who after all are the only people who are authorities on illnesses&#x2014;one of whom I understand has been on administrative work for the last 30 years. Consequently, I feel that the authority, for stating that alcoholism is an illness, is somewhat tenuous.</p>

<p>I think we ought not to lose our sense of proportion because everything in the garden of alcoholism is not remedied by the setting up of retreats and the introduction of various other methods of treatment. A great deal more research must be carried out and some explanation must be found for the question why people become alcoholics, what the different types of alcoholics are, and whether all the types can be put together in the same retreat, etc. Let us, for instance, take the decadent group, i.e. the group showing some evidence of hereditary alcoholism. It might be said that there is not a great deal of evidence for this, but I have come across such cases myself. I know of a family who stemmed from a drunken grandfather. There were four children in this family and one of them was a drunkard whose children too are drunks. So far as we know, it was not a question here of shortage of money or of unhappiness. It simply runs as a strain in the family.</p>

<p>Then there is the impassioned drunk&#x2014;tense, emotional straining for escape. This type takes to drink because they pity themselves, and having taken drink, they forget to pity themselves. Then there are the spineless drunks&#x2014; the vagrant, the criminal with a low intellect, the man who cannot think. He drinks because any other form of amusement, even watching a circus or going to a cinema, requires some measure of thought and concentration. But he does not want to think; all he wants to do is to put the bottle to his lips and drinks and while he drinks, he forgets. Finally, there is the self-aggrandising type, i.e. the man who drinks because he feels he is a failure. Being drunk, he forgets that he is a failure and imagines himself to be a great man.</p>

<p>Apparently all these different types of alcoholics have not yet been studied. Then there is also the question of alcoholism in relation to race. This is an aspect of the utmost importance to this country. I have not been able to find any evidence to the effect that the Government or the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Justice for that matter, has made any real effort to find out whether there is a pattern in the drinking habits of the various races of this country and, if so, what that pattern is. Racial habits are important things. Let us, for example, take the history of the Red Indians. Anybody can tell you&#x2014;you can also read it in any history book&#x2014;that when the Red Indian was given drink, it was the end of him. That is, however, not altogether true. At first the Red Indian followed a definite pattern of drinking. At that time bottles were not available to him with the result that he bought barrels. And so long as he bought barrels, there was no evidence that he drank too much. That is so because the barrels were bought by the tribe and then placed under the control of the chief who set the pattern of drinking. Once traders brought bottles in, however, this pattern changed. Then you find the Red Indian buying bottles of drink and drinking it by himself. That spelt the end of the Red Indian.</p>

<p>Against this the pattern of drinking on the part of the Negro of America is quite different. After being freed from slavery, they took life gaily and took to drink. But they did so happily. They did not go into corners to drink. His attitude was that of a happy chap drinking to have a good time. Most interesting is the position of the Jew. The Jews are amongst the most abstemious people in the world. For that there is a reason and that is that the Jewish youth is brought up to regard drinking as a form of ritual. For the orthodox Jew there are 198 occasions during the year when religious functions are associated with drinking. Amongst the orthodox Jew in America you will find one drunkard out of every 100,000 while amongst the reformed Jew, i.e. the Jew who has broken away from his religion and from his religious observances, you will find seven drunkards out of every 100,000. In other words, as the religious life is relaxed, so drinking increases.</p>

<p>Let us look at the foreign-born Americans. In New York the Irish constitute 25.6 per <span class="col_6729_6730" refersTo="page_0697"/>cent of the drunks, while the Jews constitute .5 per cent.</p>

<p>What I am trying to demonstrate is that we should study the habits of the people for whom we are responsible. There is no evidence whatsoever to show that the Government has taken any trouble to look into this aspect of the matter. All that is being done is to assume that the White man&#x2019;s pattern of drinking, i.e. the pub, the hotel, off-sales, is good enough to encourage others to drink. The Black woman is already complaining. She says that it is not the habit of her people to drink in pubs, or to go to beerhalls. They normally drink at home where the woman makes the drink, guests are invited and when the drinks are finished, they all go home. We Europeans have a great responsibility. The Minister particularly has a great responsibility to see that research is carried out into the drinking patterns of a race. There is no doubt that every race in this country had known alcohol even before the White man appeared. Let us accept that. But what pattern emerged from that? Did the White man when he came here or as he trekked north, find alcoholics? Of course he did not. Why do we not try to find out why he did not find any? It is we who have created alcoholics by our pattern of drinking. We have forced the other races into our pattern of drinking, thereby creating alcoholics amongst them.</p>

<p>This is a very good Bill and will, I hope, bring with it some measure of success. Right throughout the afternoon we have been listening to an eulogy of the alcoholic. We have tried to make a hero out of him because we are going to spend R400,000 to look after him. We want to treat him kindly, we want to help him. But let us also think of the people who have to pay the R400,000. What of the families of alcoholics? Who is going to look after them? Will the Department of Social Welfare do more than to provide them with bread without butter? These are things too which need consideration. This Bill is full of good intentions. We are going to give a man leave, we are going to give him free accommodation, we are going to find work for him, there will be supervision over him, etc. But all this needs personnel; and where is the hon. the Minister going to find them? They certainly do not exist in his Department at the present time because he has not enough workers now to carry out all the work his Department has to perform. How is he going to create further personnel? I want to suggest one means of help and that is to enlist the aid of the sociology departments of the universities. In the medical field students are used to help run the hospitals. Every medical student has to put in three years of hard work in hospitals looking after the sick. If sociologists are going to be trained at universities, then one way for them to obtain practical knowledge is to spend some time in these retreats and rehabilitation colonies. The hon. the Minister should enlist the assistance of the Department of Education in this respect.</p>

<p>I also suggest that he speak to his colleagues in the Cabinet and ask them to consult him when they pass laws concerning alcoholics. He should see to it that if we have to accept alcohol in this country, and I think we must, it should interfere as little as possible with the lives of people. There is a half truth in what the Malan-Commission said about drinking at home. It said that drinking to excess in the home was unthinkable. But many of us whose work brings us in contact with the public, know that a lot of drinking is indulged in at home. As a matter of fact, one out of every six alcoholics is a woman and women do their drinking at home. Nearly all of them are started off on the downward path by their husbands, because they are faced with the problem that if they do not drink with their husbands when these came home, they will leave home to go and drink with their friends. Consequently, they start having a drink together, at the start merely for companionship. Who can blame them for that? But then slowly they start drifting further down until you find the secret drinker&#x2014;the alcoholic.</p>

<p>This is a Bill which tries hard to help the country. This effort, however, is being severely handicapped by our own habits. It is ourselves who have created this problem of alcoholism. Of course, the only way in which it can be solved, is by abolishing liquor. That, of course, is impossible. We have heard it being argued that prohibition was a failure. I should say that prohibition was never given a real chance. If it was properly applied, it might have succeeded but to apply it to one area while in the adjacent areas drink was manufactured freely and from there imported into the area where there was prohibition, meant that prohibition was never really given a chance.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not keep you much longer, Mr. Speaker. The only other thing I want to say is that I was shocked as I listened to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) when she was discussing what was happening at these work colonies. She spoke of punishment, of bad administration and of bad food. I have no means of finding out whether that is true or not, but if it is true, then provision should be made in this Bill for these rehabilitation centres to be investigated by independent persons from time to time, the more so since it is going to be difficult for the public to get access to them.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened with interest and appreciation to the debate on this subject. Having heard the pleas of members on both sides of the House, I want to say that I am prepared to accept this Bill. I therefore hope <span class="col_6731_6732" refersTo="page_0698"/>that hon. members in the circumstances will support me still further.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I will not have time&#x2014;nor can it be expected of me&#x2014;to go into details in my reply to the second reading debate. The Committee Stage will offer more opportunity for that. In my introductory speech I said that I was looking forward with great expectations to the debate on this measure. My expectations were realized. The measure was approached by hon. members on both sides in an objective manner. I want to express my appreciation for that. The hon. member for Durban (Central) said he foresaw difficulty in the administration of this Bill, because we do not have the necessary staff. But he also said that this is a social problem which will never be solved unless we completely prohibit the use of alcohol. There are so many things one can say on this subject. What is beyond all doubt, however, is that the abuse of liquor, amongst other things, as a phenomenon in our national life has the result of handicapping the nation. It creates social problems. On the other hand, society must carry on. We must carry on from sunrise to sunset, and the same to-morrow. We can only carry on if we build on a sound national structure, which in turn can only be based on a sound family structure. One finds a sound family structure only in those families where social evils have not yet led to the erosion we so often find to-day.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member to tell the country that this legislation is the legislation of all of us. In that way every one of us must help to form public opinion. The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) was the first speaker on that side. He said that he welcomed the Bill and that not only should it be accepted, but it should be implemented. In fact, every speaker after him adopted the attitude that the Bill should be accepted and implemented not only by the Department of Social Welfare but by all of us. Society should give its support to this measure which is based on sound social principles. The hon. member for Rosettenville said: &#x201C;We are going to have our difficulties.&#x201D; He is quite right. I know it, and my Department knows it too. Not only do we know that we are bound to experience difficulties, but we also know that we are dealing with difficult people. We are dealing here with social maladjusted persons, whatever the reason for their maladjustment may be. Not only are they difficult people, but you are also having to deal with individuals who differ from each other. In this respect much research still has to be done. Hon. members also pointed to the necessity for it. This research forms part of the objects of this Bill. Our object is to give society the benefit of the results of this research, and also the employers who are in daily contact with their employees. It is only a small group of people in society who form the consensus of opinion of that society. From there that opinion spreads outward in everincreasing circles. It is propagated further because the people have respect for the persons who evolved those ideas.</p>

<p>Hon. members quite correctly pointed out that not only do we need staff to implement this legislation, but also people with the right spirit. But as far as I am concerned, I am convinced that we will find people with the right spirit. In fact, we already have them. With this legislation we are adopting a new course in regard to the treatment of socially maladjusted persons. If we now put our shoulder to the wheel and tackle the matter with goodwill, I am sure that we will achieve better results than we have hitherto.</p>

<p>So many hon. members emphasize the importance of family life. That is gratifying. We must restore family life. A person is removed from his family circle and placed in an institution, but he has to make a comeback and he must receive after-care. We must ensure that the family will be prepared to take him back, and society must be prepared to welcome back as a citizen of the country that man to whose rehabilitation so much time and care have been devoted. I want to emphasize that. He must be accepted in society again so that he can play his role once more. The object of this rehabilitation is to assist a maladjusted person to find himself again, to discover himself anew and to see himself in the light of having a particular vocation to fulfil both in society and in his family circle.</p>

<p>This legislation removes the prison stigma from these people. From now on these institutions will no longer be work colonies but places of refuge and rehabilitation centres. We are convinced that these institutions should not be in the nature of work colonies. No stigma must adhere to them. Therefore we decided in future to call the institution at Sonderwater Magaliesoord.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) asked me about places of refuge for women. I just want to say that land adjoining Magaliesoord has already been purchased for this purpose. In fact, we have already started to dig the foundations. An amount of R200,000 already appears on the Estimates of the P.W.D. for this work. The Government is prepared to make its contribution towards implementing this legislation, and to such an extent that its success will be ensured. Hon. members emphasize the fact that these institutions will be the institutions of all of us. Their success or failure will therefore be in our hands.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) referred to complaints which had been brought to her notice. In this regard I want to tell her that these places will be inspected regularly. For example, I intend visiting these institutions regularly every year. Proper supervision will be exercised and I can tell her that I am not aware of any of the adverse conditions to which she referred. Nothing has come to my notice in that regard. She has not revealed the name of the person who gave her the information, although I certainly would not prosecute that person. But I will make the hon. member an offer. I will arrange for her to visit the institute at Magaliesoord without anybody <span class="col_6733_6734" refersTo="page_0699"/>knowing about it in advance. But then she should not take the Press with her to have herself photographed. She is very fond of doing that. But I will arrange for her to go there so that she can see for herself what goes on there. And this invitation applies not only to her but to every hon. member who wants to visit these institutions during the recess. We can arrange for all of them to go there together.</p>

<p>Together with other hon. members, I want to express my thanks to all who combat this evil in private. There are many families in this country who are continually struggling with the particular social evil in regard to which we are introducing this legislation. I want to express my appreciation for what is done in the lonely family circle and in the community by church institutions, welfare organizations and everybody who is interested in the matter. We have had some constructive criticism in regard to the composition of the Board. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) said that we should have a psychiatrist on the Board. I just want to tell her that the Department of Social Welfare will be represented on that Advisory Board. As the hon. member for Kimberley (South) has already said, some of the five members to be appointed may be outstanding psychiatrists, and not only that, but people who take a sociological and psychiatric interest in these particular people. Somebody said that this legislation was essentially experimental. That is what I said right from the beginning. We shall have to make adaptations as we go along. If there are things which hamper us, it will be the duty of Parliament to amend and to improve the Act. Somebody asked why the Board is being appointed for five years and not for three years. It is impossible to appoint it for three years. When one starts a new undertaking, it is very difficult if the Board is appointed for such a short period. A start will hardly have been made when the three years will have elapsed. That is why we made it five years.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) referred to the five-yearly report of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and said that he would like to have an annual report. But the local boards of the separate institutions issue annual reports which will give hon. members all the details of what progress is made and how the whole matter is progressing.</p>

<p>Hon. members referred in their speeches to the second period. When someone is committed for a second period, that second period will be indeterminate. The man who is committed the first time runs the risk of being committed for three years. Most of them, however, only stay there for one year. They are committed for three years, but to the extent that they make progress physically and mentally they are re-classified into groups and they are released after a year. I have already said that they are released on trial. Then they can see whether they are able to find employment. If a man is sent back a second time for three years, we can keen him there for three years. But I have considered this matter and have discussed it with my officials. I just want to tell hon. members that I have considered very seriously this matter as to whether we should not accept an amendment to the effect that the question of the second three-year period be omitted.</p>

<p>Hon. members put a few other questions which I should like to reply to briefly. I would not have cared to have been in this House if there had been a debate since 3 p.m. until now as to whether alcoholism was a disease or not. Scientists, medical men, social workers and the clergy can argue about it for months. I would not like to be there while they discuss whether it is a disease or not. It is the result of a social evil. It has its ethical aspect, its health aspect, its sociological aspect and probably also the aspect of heredity, as one hon. member said. This Committee has gone into the matter very thoroughly and has found that alcoholism is a condition for which a multiplicity of causes exist, namely medical, psychological, ethical and social. Each of them plays a role and therefore the case of each individual person is so difficult to study. One must know what the cause is in the case of each individual before one can know how to treat him and to enable him to rehabilitate himself with the assistance he receives, and again to re-enter society.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) referred to Clause 15 (4) (d). I have given attention to it. She says that we should substitute the word &#x201C;should&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;may&#x201D;. I may just say that if a report is received from a welfare officer, ten to one it will be to the effect that this person is not an alcoholic, or that one is not addicted to drugs, or that the other one does not fall into one of the other categories. In such a case there is no necessity for a report. That is the problem. I hope she will reconsider the matter, and I will also devote attention to what she has said.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) posed a very difficult question as a lawyer. Like other hon. members, he discussed the causes for this evil and philosophized about it, which was fitting in this debate, and to which I listened with interest. He wanted to know why we called the Board the Alcoholism Board and not the Alcoholism and Maladjusted Persons Board. Alcoholics constitute the greatest group. Alcoholics and those persons addicted to drugs are the people who need special attention, and therefore we separate them completely from criminal types. We also separate them from other maladjusted persons. That Board cannot be anything else because it consists of people who mainly specialize in the treatment of the alcoholic. We have not yet reached the end of the road in so far as this Bill is concerned. The hon. member was quite correct. Next year we will have to deal with the following report, which deals with other social problems. As we progress, we can make the necessary changes. At this stage I think it is necessary, in so far as this Board is concerned, for us to confine ourselves specifically to the implementation of the functions <span class="col_6735_6736" refersTo="page_0700"/>which the Bill entrusts to it, viz. the rehabilitation of alcoholics and drug addicts.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I have just about covered the whole field. Once again I wish to express my appreciation for the speeches we have had from men of experience, from medical men and from those who have dealt with these maladjusted persons in the institutions of the country, like the hon. member for Kimberley (South), men with first-hand knowledge of the problems connected with this matter. I want to express my appreciation for the fact that members on all sides of the House gave their blessing to a measure which is intended to serve the best interest of South Africa and the future of our people.</p>

<heading>AMENDMENT OF FIRST SCHEDULE OF THE DEFENCE ACT</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<p>That this House, in terms of sub-section (2) of section 104 of the Defence Act, 1955 (Act No. 44 of 1557), approves of the First Schedule to that Act being amended&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) by the substitution for the definition of &#x201C;superior officer&#x201D; in sub-section (1) of section 1 of the following definition:

<ol>

<li>&#x201C;&#x2018;superior officer&#x201D;, in relation to a person subject to this Code, means any officer, warrant officer or noncommissioned officer subject to this Code who holds a higher rank than such person, or who holds the same or an equivalent rank but is in a position of authority over such person: Provided that no person subject to this Code who is not a White person as defined in section 1 of the Population Registration Act, 0554 (Act No. 34 of 0554), shall be deemed to be the superior officer of a White person subject to this Code: Provided further that a White person subject to this Code who, irrespective of his rank, is appointed in authority over any person subject to this Code who is not a White person as so defined, shall be deemed to be the superior officer of such last-mentioned person;&#x201D;;</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(b) by the substitution in section 50&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) for sub-paragraphs (iv) to (viii), inclusive, of paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of the following subparagraphs:

<ol>

<li>&#x201C;(iv) discharge from the South African Defence Force;</li>

<li>(v) detention for a period not exceeding two years;</li>

<li>(vi) reduction to any lower rank, <i>to</i> non-commissioned rank or to the ranks;</li>

<li>(vii) reduction in seniority in rank;</li>

<li>(viii) a fine not exceeding 54 pounds; or</li>

<li>(ix) reprimand; or&#x201D;;</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(ii) for sub-paragraphs (iv) to (viii), inclusive, of paragraph (c) of that sub-section of the following subparagraphs: &#x201C;(iv) discharge from the South African Defence Force;

<ol>

<li>(v) detention for a period not exceeding two years;</li>

<li>(vi) field punishment for a period not exceeding three months;</li>

<li>(vii) reduction in seniority in rank;</li>

<li>(viii) a fine not exceeding 25 pounds; or</li>

<li>(ix) reprimand.&#x201D;; and</li>

</ol>

</li>

<li>(c) by the substitution in section 128 for paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) of the following paragraphs:

<ol>

<li>&#x201C;(a) if he is married or is a widower or divorced person who has a child, stepchild or legally adopted child who lives with and is maintained by him, one-third of his pay; or</li>

<li>(b) if he is unmarried, two-thirds of his pay.&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

</li>

</ol>

<p>In this regard I just want to explain that in terms of the provisions of Section 044 (2) of the Defence Act, 0557 (Act No. 44 of 1957), the State President, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament obtained by resolution, may by proclamation in the <i>Government Gazette</i> insert any new provision in the First Schedule of the aforementioned Act, or may amend or repeal any provision thereof.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the motion proposes to amend Sections 1, 50 and 128, but in regard to Section 1 (1) I want to draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the statement I made on 19 February 1963 in this House in connection with the Government&#x2019;s decision to establish a Coloured Corps as part of the Permanent Force. From the nature of the matter members of the aforementioned Corps will be given military ranks and, for obvious reasons, it is therefore necessary to replace Section 0 (0) (xix) by a new sub-paragraph, as it appears in the motion, as the result of which it will, for example, not be possible for a non-White sergeant to arrest a White soldier or to exercise authority over a White soldier.</p>

<p><span class="col_6737_6738" refersTo="page_0701"/>In terms of Section 91 (2) of the First Schedule of the Act, the penalties set out in subsection (1) of the aforementioned Section have been arranged in a decreasing order of seriousness. A sentence of discharge out of the S.A. Defence Force has more serious consequences than a sentence of detention, demotion in rank of field punishment will have. Therefore it is now proposed that in the case of privates the sentence of dismissal from the S.A. Permanent Force, which at present appears as No. vi in the existing list, i.e., paras, (b) and (c) of Section 91 (1) of the First Schedule, are moved up to fourth place. The other penalties will therefore come down one step on the list and will eventually, as they appear in the motion, also appear in the First Schedule as Items v, vi, viii and ix; Item vii, however, i.e. &#x201C;with reduction in seniority in rank&#x201D;, is a new penalty which is being introduced in the case of privates. It sometimes happens that a private soldier commits an offence of a less serious nature which justifies punishment of some sort. In the case of officers, there is already provision in para, (a) of Section 91 (1) for a reduction in seniority in rank, and it is considered desirable in the interest of discipline that provision should be made for a similar penalty in respect of privates.</p>

<p>In regard to para, (c) of the motion which refers to Section 128 (2), I must explain that in terms of para, (a) of that Section, as it reads at present, a member of the S.A. Defence Force who is serving a sentence of detention for non-serious contraventions forfeits only portion of his basic remuneration and that his cost-of-living allowances remain unaffected. As hon. members know. Sir, the consolidation of cost-of-living allowances with basic remuneration took place in 1958 already, with the result that a member now in fact forfeits a larger portion of his total income than the Legislature originally envisaged. It is therefore the intention to scrap paras, (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) of the aforementioned Section and to replace them with the paragraphs indicated in para, (c) of the motion. It is calculated that the forfeiture of one-third instead of one-half of the basic remuneration of a married man will restore the position to what it was before consolidation. Furthermore, it is also the considered opinion that a widower or divorced member who maintains a child, step-child or legally adopted child should be treated on the same basis as a married member, and the necessary provision to give effect to that is contained in para. (a). In so far as unmarried members are concerned, it is proposed that one-third of his remuneration, instead of four-fifths, will remain unaffected in order to enable him to cover essential items of expenditure like pension contributions, insurance premiums, etc.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has given us an outline of the ground covered by this motion. The State President will now have authority to promulgate regulations. As a matter of historical interest one&#x2019;s mind goes back to the battle we had years ago to persuade the then Minister of Defence to have that provision included in the Defence Act, a provision of which the Minister himself is now deriving the benefit.</p>

<p>The motion itself deals, as the hon. the Minister has stated, with certain amendments under Section 104 regarding the First Schedule of the Defence Act. It also entails amendments to what in military parlance is known as the &#x201C;Code&#x201D; which covers in general the discipline, the offences and the legal procedure under which the men of the services function once they adopt the uniform. I want to ask certain questions in regard to the amendment proposed under paragraph 2 (a). I may say right at the outset that in regard to the remaining paragraphs (b) and (c) one accepts that in general they are proposals which have been found necessary as the result of experience, particularly in view of the expanded defence force which we are building up. As far as we are concerned they are matters of adjustment called for by professional defence people and generally we do not propose to raise any queries on them.</p>

<p>Coming back to paragraph 2 (a) I should like to have some clarity so that there will be no room for misunderstanding in regard to the application of these provisions under the stress of emergency or war-time conditions as opposed to peace-time conditions. I would say without any question that if ever there is a necessity for regulations governing the armed forces to be crystal clear so that the officer in charge who has to carry them into effect need not waste time thinking over what he should do, it is during a time of emergency or under war-time conditions. The regulations covered by (a) not only apply to the peace-time operations of the Defence Force, when generally one can see them carried into effect without difficulty. They also apply to war-time conditions when there may be causes not foreseen, causes that may develop suddenly in a time of crisis which may make it somewhat difficult for the individual responsible to give effect to the proposals. Under the definition of &#x201C;superior officer&#x201D; laid down in this particular section&#x2014;and that includes the various grades of commissioned and noncommissioned officers of the land, sea and air forces, right down to the serving personnel&#x2014; the Population Registration Act is under certain circumstances being applied by this amendment to the Defence Forces. I am merely stating that as a background to the questions I want to put because we accept that seeing that that is the law of the land this is a necessary provision. I am not questioning the application of it. One must accept that the race classification of the Population Registration Act is now being applied to the Defence Force. The provision aims to make it clear that no non-White serving officer, non-commissioned officer or soldier, depending on circumstances, shall be deemed to be a superior officer of a White person serving under the Code. I want to be realistic in dealing with this: I do not want to put any <span class="col_6739_6740" refersTo="page_0702"/>obstacles in the Minister&#x2019;s way. This proposal in broad outline follows the general practice which exists in most Western defence organizations where the main body of the personnel is White. But in the main the armed forces&#x2014; and I speak of the armed forces in general not only our own&#x2014;have their own method of meeting that position when it arises. In general they manage it very successfully without having to resort to hard and fast legislation. It seems a pity that under the conditions under which we live it has been found necessary to provide for it by legislation as in the case such as now brought forward by this motion. It ties a very hard and fast obligation on serving officers who, as I have stated before, may find themselves in circumstances where it is very difficult to carry it out. At the same time one must accept it that a position can well develop where it is desirable to have the position crystal clear to the people concerned so that there can be no slipup. It is also necessary to realize that just as in the case of the wrong application of an indefinite regulation, the too severe application of this definite one may do just as much damage. I must in fairness say that during World War II, this side of the House, as the then Government, found it necessary to introduce a somewhat similar regulation as is now proposed by this particular section. It was felt that under war-time conditions more clarity was needed by the officers in the field and that was done by way of regulation. With our own experience to guide us, even though we regret that it is necessary to reduce it to legislation, we do not intend to oppose the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s proposal.</p>

<p>We want to get clarity regarding certain aspects of the two provisos at the end of (a) in the motion. I will take the last one first which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided further that a White person, subject to this Code, irrespective of his rank, is appointed in authority over any person subject to this Code who is not a White person as so defined, shall be deemed to be the superior officer of such last mentioned person.</block>

<p>Under many conditions which may be taken for granted, the amended definition of a superior officer in this motion might be regarded as indicating such an appointment as the section refers to. The section very definitely reads &#x201C;irrespective of his rank, is appointed in authority&#x201D;. What is the qualification there? On the whole the position may well rest on the clarity of such an appointment. I want to ask the Minister, when he replies, to clarify that position. Who is to make such an appointment if it has to be made, especially an appointment which may have to be made under stress of battle or stress of other similar circumstances by somebody who has very little time to think about it. Or does the hon. the Minister assume that such an appointment will develop automatically as a result of population registration classification as mentioned earlier on in this section? I think that is one point on which we must have some clarity. I do not think this is as simple as it looks. There have been great changes in the composition of world armies even during the last eight or ten years. The Republic is one of the few, even among the smaller nations which does not include non-White combatant troops in its defence organization. The greatest contribution which could accrue to our security would undoubtedly be an agreement with one of our neighbours to the north of us or better still an agreement with an overseas power which still has responsibilities which it wishes to maintain in Southern Africa. In practically any of such circumstances we may at once be faced with a difficulty which may arise from the operation of this regulation under any system of combined operation which would naturally follow from such an agreement. It may well even be a major obstacle to the promotion of such a desirable agreement. As the hon. the Minister is probably aware promotions to high and responsible ranks are permitted in the majority of the major Western defence organizations to include non-Whites who can qualify on merit or experience and with the over-all conditions applying to the particular post concerned. Our nearest neighbours make extensive use of non-Whites in their defence organizations. The personnel and officers in command of our own defence organization could, and usually do, deal very successfully with these problems as and when they arise, but by legislatively defining these regulations we may be restricting the authority of the senior officers on the spot in having to deal with any sudden emergency which may develop especially in cases where the forces available on the spot are inadequate to deal with their task. I can quite well understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty in this particular case. Far be it for us on this side to wish to add to those difficulties. We are not playing politics in this matter; it is a matter of defence which is vital to the country. But we feel it is necessary to outline some of the problems which, from experience, we know may well develop. Problems which may well have to be faced at a time which allows very little time for thought. I should like to have the Minister&#x2019;s views on the points raised, particularly how he proposes to cope with these particular features which I have pointed out. There may well be differences between ourselves and any potential allies that we may be fighting in company with at such a time. But these are important factors affecting all of us. They are important to the Republic as a whole. Once we start legislating to cover features like these we do Open a door which we may find it somewhat difficult to close at a time when it seems more important that we should be able to close it quickly.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I think we can express our appreciation this evening of the speech and the attitude of the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). The hon. member raised a few very interesting points about which I should like to <span class="col_6741_6742" refersTo="page_0703"/>say a word or two. He particularly raised the question as to what is going to happen when the last portion of 2 (a) has to be put into operation, and that is where a person occupying a lower rank is appointed in charge of a corps of a different colour in which there is a person who occupies a higher rank. I think this clause is perfectly clear. I want to refer the hon. member to the Afrikaans text&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; ongeag sy rang, in gesag gestel is oor enige van hierdie Reglement onderworpe persoon wat nie &#x2019;n Blanke, soos aldus omskryf, is nie, die meerdere van laasbedoelde persoon geag word.</block>

<p>I think it is stated perfectly clearly here. That is the position when a person has been placed "&#x201C;</p>

<p>&#x201C;in authority&#x201D;. Who can appoint a person in authority? It must be a superior officer. No person on his own authority, for example, can go and take over the command of a corps, even though it is a non-White corps, in which there is an officer or a non-commissioned officer who occupies a higher rank than he does. As far as my experience goes&#x2014;and I think the hon. member has had the same experience&#x2014; it happens quite frequently where officers are taking a course that a person occupying a lower rank has to act as instructor. It does happen. But even though that instructor occupies a lower rank than the officers taking the course, those officers are subject to the authority of that specific instructor, irrespective of the rank he occupies.</p>

<p>The other difficulty which the hon. member raised is one which I think he can leave to circumstances, and that is what is going to happen in the event of joint action together with a neighbouring state, for example. It may be difficult, as he has correctly said, to decide in those circumstances who should be in command. But where joint action is taken and it becomes necessary for somebody to take command I do not believe that a person who has not been appointed by an officer occupying a higher rank than the officer occupying the highest rank in that corps will assume command. I think that is perfectly clear too. But in cases of joint action, to which the hon. member also referred here, with other states or with neighbouring states where this does not apply, I think it is unthinkable that legislation passed by us would affect our neighbouring states. It would simply not apply there. It is unthinkable, for example, that a sergeant or sergeant-major would feel himself called upon to assume command over the corps of a neighbouring state in which there is a lieutenant or a captain, for example, irrespective of his race or colour. No, I think this clause has been framed clearly and I think we can accept it as it stands. There should be no difficulty about it. The main thing is that a position is being cleared up here which might have given rise to difficulties if this Bill did not make the necessary provision for it.</p>

<p>In the past I have not taken part in defence debates in this House, but there is such an important principle involved in the motion moved by the hon. Minister of Defence that I feel that I must say something on this matter. I particularly must say something because of what the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) has just said. Sir, it is too easy an escape hatch these days for the Opposition constantly to say that it cannot play party politics with matters which are contentious. Too easy when they want to support those measures, although they express regret that legislation has to be introduced&#x2014;nevertheless, because it is a difficult matter, and because they &#x201C;do not want to make things more difficult for the hon. Minister&#x201D;, they support such contentious issues as the one we are dealing with now. As far as I am concerned, it deals with a vital principle, and I cannot support what the hon. Minister is proposing. It deals with a principle which is in direct contradiction to the principles for which I stand and for which the party that I represent stands. It epitomizes racial discrimination, and the motion of the Minister goes directly contrary to the whole basic principle that merit shall be the yard-stick. Therefore I intend to oppose the motion of the hon. Minister. This motion that the hon. Minister has introduced is on a par with all the other racial obsessions that we have in South, Africa, it is on a par, for example, with the idea that no non-White doctor, however well qualified &#x2026;</p>

Sir, if it is dangerous to do this in South Africa, I want to say at once that if we do not have non-Whites oh our side in any time of difficulties in South Africa, no regulations, no legislation, nothing of the sort will in any way put South Africa out of danger. There is only one way to put South Africa out of danger and that is to make a friend and not an enemy of non-Whites in South Africa, and that goes for non-Whites in <span class="col_6743_6744" refersTo="page_0704"/>the army, just as it goes for non-Whites in any other walk of life.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>One can understand the attitude of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). These liberals have lost all touch with the realities of the situation. The fact of the matter is that we are dealing here with a factual position for which we have to make provision and the Minister is trying by means of this proposal of his, having regard to the pattern that we have in South Africa to-day and the facts that we have to accept, to make provision for that situation. In other words, we differ from the hon. member. I think we are only trying to be realistic under the present circumstances and we are now giving the Coloureds in this country an opportunity which they have not had in the past, an opportunity which they would very much like to have and for which the Coloured Council asked. I want to say that we are faced here with a situation which this side of the House did not really want to accept previously, but we must prepare ourselves for the defence of this country, and to that end we have to take this step. I know that after the war the Cape Corps was abolished and the so-called Cape Corps Auxilliary Service was instituted. The Cape Corps Auxiliary Service rendered valuable services within the limited duties placed upon them, but we must recognize the fact that they were never really very successful as part of the Defence Force because they did not form an integral part of the Defence Force; they were practically just a sort of appendage of the Defence Force. In establishing a corps now which is really going to be an integral part of the Defence Force in a non-combatant capacity, well trained in the handling of arms to be able to defend themselves, I think we are taking an important step here, in the first place, in the interests of the Coloured, and in the second place, in the interests of the defence of South Africa, because in this way we are releasing Whites who can now be used for more important services. Unfortunately, I came in too late to hear the whole speech of the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). We realize that there are going to be difficulties. I believe, however, that the last war demonstrated that ways and means can be found whereby Coloured divisions can operate alongside White divisions in the Defence Force, or whereby they can even sometimes work together very intimately in a division, and all that is being done here is to make legal provision for that position.</p>

<p>The Government has at long last appreciated the part the Coloured people can play in the defence of this country, and everybody welcomes the statement by the hon. the Minister that he is going to revive the Cape Corps. The hon. Minister will know, and the House knows, that we, as Representatives of the Coloured people in this House, have for years made a plea for the establishment of a Cape Corps, and we are happy to know that our pleas have been answered and that the Cape Corps will now be re-established. It is a great pity that this proviso should have been introduced in this proposal. It is really unnecessary, and the hon. Minister knows that it is unnecessary. Those of us who know the Coloured people know that it is unnecessary. Therefore it is a great pity, because the Coloured people who want to serve their country, and who have served it in the past with great distinction, and brave men they were too, will not read this proviso with a good heart. I do not want to deal at great length with it. The Coloured people are used to this type of legislation. I can only express my regret that it was found necessary to introduce it. I want to go further. The hon. Minister should realize that the Cape Corps now to be revived will stay for ever, I believe, as part of our defence forces in this country. They will not be a temporary army, they will not be a temporary unit. The Government would never have revived the Cape Corps unless&#x2026;</p>

<p>My point is that I am not in favour of the proviso because there are other means of dealing with the Cape Corps than by attaching this stigma to the Coloured people, under this proviso. I merely want to point out to the hon. Minister that he could &#x25A0;ooercome this proviso referring to White people giving orders to Coloured officers when the White man is of a lower rank than the Coloured officers by excluding all White people from the Cape Corps. For instance, we are hoping that there will be a Coloured medical corps with Coloured doctors, and a Coloured doctor surely would be entitled to be a commissioned officer on the same basis as a White doctor, and he surely would be either a lieutenant or a captain by virtue of his medical profession. Now, if you have linked with the Cape Corps a medical corps as part and parcel of that corps, with Coloured doctors as captains, surely the hon. Minister must appreciate that in that case he cannot, by this proviso, allow a sergeant or a corporal who is European to give orders to the captain who is a medical officer in the Cape Coloured Corps.</p>

<p>I know. The hon. Minister will say that that sergeant or corporal must be appointed for special duties. But all I am trying to point out to the hon. Minister is that my opposition to this proviso is that it need not be made part of our legislation if the hon. Minister would so expand the Cape Corps as to be a complete army of itself with its own officers, its own medical corps, its own instructors in every phase. For that reason I am obliged to vote against this motion, because I believe it is unnecessary, and you are going to harm the Coloured people in their desire to join up. Mr. Speaker, you may feel that I am going too far if I continue, and therefore I will sit down.</p>

<p>To begin with I should like to express my thanks to the Opposition who are being practical enough to realize that we in South Africa have a certain way of life and that we adhere to that way of life when we wish to do certain things. This Government in particular has strong views on certain matters. As far as the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) is concerned, I cannot even argue with her over this matter. Her philosophy differs so entirely from ours that we cannot even discuss this matter. What I want to do here is to do a good deed to South Africa by establishing a Cape Corps, but at the same time I want to pay my respects to the Coloured people of our country by establishing a Coloured Corps which will form an integral part of the Army. But in doing so I do not want to cause discord and friction from the beginning. Having regard to the pattern of our national life we would immediately cause friction if we acceded to the request of the hon. member for Houghton and of the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). It is my duty to build up goodwill and co-operation right from the start. Let the future look after itself; our immediate task is to build up co-operation and goodwill. The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) has already replied in an able manner to the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). I want to say to the hon. member for Simonstown that if it should happen at some future date that we have to fight together with our neighbouring states, we are certainly not, when our lives depend on it, going to allow a regulation such as this to stand in our way. If it becomes necessary to do so, the regulation will be changed, or they will change their regulation if it becomes necessary. It depends whose regulation is best suited to the circumstances. During the last war, as the hon. member for Simonstown has pointed out, they had practically the same thing in practice.</p>

<p>I can understand the hon. member for Houghton. She is always out to get in a dig against the Government and against the Opposition; hence her opposition. But what I cannot understand is the attitude of the hon. member for Boland, who has pleaded in the past that we should establish a Cape Corps. We are doing so now, not because he pleaded for it but because we think it is the right thing to do. I do not care who proposed it. Even if the hon. member for Houghton puts forward a good proposal we will give effect to it. What the hon. member for Boland is doing now is to try to score a little political advantage.</p>

<p>Oh yes. The hon. member knows what our way of life in South Africa is. If a White member of the Defence Force walks in the street and does something, does the hon. member want a non-White non-commissioned officer to be able to punish him? What does that lead to? That is precisely what we want to obviate here, because that sort of thing would cause the greatest trouble and friction right from the start. We would only cause friction and we would never be able to get the necessary co-operation. Let us build up co-operation from the bottom instead of always trying to start at the top. I do not think it is necessary to say more than that.</p>

<p>Fourth Order read: House to go into Committee on Defence Amendment Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<block name="quote">On Clause 2,</block>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>This Clause 2 consolidates powers and responsibilities previously spread over other clauses in the Bill, Clauses 5 and 13; it also applies a number of provisions in regard to a combined Defence Force as well as various other functions. I want to confine my remarks for a moment to Clause 2 (2) (d), which says that any member of the South African Defence Force or any portion thereof may at all times be employed &#x201C;on such police duties as may be prescribed.&#x201D; Now police duties hitherto have been the prerogative of the Permanent Force. Under the provisions of this particular Bill from now on the Citizen Force will also fall due to carry out these police duties if and when ordered to do so under this particular clause. The paragraph I am referring to has no restriction at all in regard to which portions of the Defence Force may be called out for police duties. The hon. Minister in his second-reading speech stated that it was only intended to use men who had been specially trained for military police duties. Now we have not the slightest objection to that limitation that the hon. Minister mentioned in his second-reading speech. The use of Citizen Force men as military police. Our objection is really that the Bill before us does not provide for such a limitation. The Bill before us contains no effective limitation in regard to who can be employed. One accepts without any question the hon. Minister&#x2019;s undertaking and assurance that he in his capacity as Minister of Defence would not employ people other than the trained people that he referred to. But, Sir, the hon. Minister, like the rest of us, will not always be the Minister of Defence. We are by no means permanent in this establishment. He may be succeeded, he may be drafted to another job, as we might be, and his successor in office may well feel that he is not bound by the undertaking given by his predecessor. In other words that he is bound to carry out the terms of legislation which is on the Statute Book. That is why we are asking that there should be some limitation imposed. If we are going to have legislation to state that any member of the Defence Force or any portion or members thereof may at all times be employed on police duties, and we want an exemption from it, then the only logical way is to have that exemption included in the legislation which we are now adopting, in other words, a proviso to sub-section (2). The Opposition feel so strongly in regard to this particular reservation that, in regard to the very wide scope that this particular subsection (2) now imposes on the Defence Force as a whole, we believe it is necessary to have a limiting proviso enshrined in the Bill. We believe that this can be done by means of our amendment without weakening the security control the Minister is endeavouring to bring about. There is not the slightest idea on our side of attempting to limit the Minister to a restriction which will make it impossible for him to carry out the security measures that he requires. We accept the grounds for this security given by the hon. Minister in his second-reading speech, particularly in respect of the country districts. There may be occasions when this additional support is necessary for a limited number of police in that area.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>This clause has nothing to do with that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The particular paragraph (d) in Clause 2 in regard to &#x201C;police duties as may be prescribed&#x201D; read in conjunction with Clause 15 which says that if the resident magistrate in the area concerned, considers the position so serious, he can make use of the Defence Force to assist the police, shows that there definitely is a link-up between those two clauses. But in any case, whether it has to do with that particular clause or not, we feel that the employment of the young trainee, virtually a schoolboy who has more or less only left school and has had very little military training, very little experience and very little discipline as far aS military police duties are concerned, establishes a very strong case for the exclusion of such young trainees from the duties laid down by this sub-paragraph (d). We feel that there should be some limitation there, and that is why I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To insert the following provisions at the end of paragraph (d) of the proposed new subsection (2):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that no member of the South African Defence Force, other than members of the Permanent Force, who has not completed a minimum of six months of his military training shall be employed on the police duties provided for under this paragraph.</block>

<p>If it so happens that the hon. Minister feels that that limitation will so deplete the number of men that he has available to call up, then we feel that that could very easily be met by bringing into this particular sub-section (2) in the very first proviso an amendment to add after the words &#x201C;Defence Force&#x201D; &#x201C;or officers and men who have been placed on the reserve within five years prior to 1 January of the year in which their services on police duties are required in terms of paragraph (d) of this subsection&#x201D;. That will then give the Minister a supply of trained men who have been through their training in the Defence Force, who are scattered all over South Africa, who have ample knowledge of the districts in which they live, and who are probably known to the Police Force as men of responsibility who could be called upon in emergency. We are not wedded to the exact wording of the amendment, but something along those lines should satisfy the Minister and his department. It should be quite easy to keep the Police Force in any area acquainted with what reservists are available in that area by means of keeping an <span class="col_6749_6750" refersTo="page_0707"/>up-to-date list of reservists in the police office, amended once a year. It does seem that it Would be a better solution than having to depend on the trainees. I would commend that to the hon. Minister if he feels that our amendment is likely to be too drastic and would weaken his Defence Force to such an extent that he would not have sufficient men to go found. But we do feel that this House owes a duty to these young chaps who are called up under our extended training scheme, to safeguard them in their first six months of training against being called out for specialized duties of a police constable. We stress the point that they are &#x201C;specialized duties&#x201D;, police duties which aim at the preservation of law and order with the minimum of force that it is possible to apply, as opposed to the military training which moves in the opposite direction. We feel that the least that the House can do is to exercise that safeguard. We have got these lads coming up in increasing numbers from all over the country. They can by no means be termed as soldiers until they have had an amount of training, and even six months is inadequate, but six months we are prepared to accept. I would ask the hon. Minister in all seriousness to approach it, and realize that we are also approaching it in a constructive light, in what we believe is the best service that we can give to the lads themselves, to the Defence Force as a whole and to the Republic.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. H. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>I think we might still have agreed with the amendment perhaps but I do not think it should be moved at this stage. Where police duties have to be performed we know that the services of young men, although they have not had six months&#x2019; training, can be used, in view of our limited manpower, for other services such as office work, for example, and for guard duty and various other services which are not covered by their military training. In these circumstances where emergencies may arise I do not think that the Minister should accept this amendment. Although the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) means well in proposing it I feel that the hon. the Minister ought not to accept it. But I want to refer to another matter in connection with the same clause and I should like to ask the Minister for an explanation. Clause 2 (3) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A member of the South African Defence Force may, subject to such limitations and restrictions as may be prescribed, be required to serve in any portion of that force, and, any such member serving in any armed service, arm, formation, corps or unit or performing any duty in respect of which a special allowance is prescribed, shall not be entitled to such allowance whilst serving in any other armed service, arm, formation, corps or unit or performing any other duty.</block>

<p>What I should like to know from the Minister is this. We know that there are people in the Defence Force who receive special pay and certain allowances. They are persons who have been in the Defence Force for years, and if they are transferred in war-time or during a disturbance to another portion of the Defence Force and they do other work there, they do not receive those allowances. Take the case, for example, of an artisan who receives a certain remuneration and certain allowances and who is called upon to do clerical work. He now loses that remuneration and his allowances and his whole budget is upset. I should like to hear from the Minister whether that is the case and how it is proposed to deal with those cases.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the changes this clause brings about in the principal Act are fundamental and have other repercussions in regard to the organization of our Defence Force which I would like to discuss later. But at this stage I wish to confine my remarks to lending support to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Simonstown. This clause refers to the duties of the Defence Force. In terms of Section 5, Chapter II of the Defence Act, the Defence Force consists of three distinct arms, the Permanent Force, the Citizen Force and the Commandos. The duties prescribed in this clause in paragraphs (a) to (d) are precisely those which have stood for many years in respect of the functions of the Permanent Force. In respect of the A.C.F., the functions prescribed in (a), (b) and (c) have been applicable for many years, but (d) has never applied, i.e. the police duties as may be prescribed. The A.C.F. was excluded from that. That is quite clear from Section 13 of the Defence Act. In terms of Clause 28, the chapter dealing with the commandos, they never had any one of these duties. Their responsibility for service is described in Chapter 10 of the Defence Act, and deals with the liability for service in times of war, but there was never any general liability laid down for the commandos. Now for the first time these three arms are all given the same liability and duty in respect of the defence of the Republic, suppressing internal disorder, and service in the preservation of life, health and property, and the maintenance of essential services, and police duties. Now for the first time they all have the same duties. In regard to the Permanent Force, I do not think there can be any doubt as to their capability to exercise police duties. They have always been looked upon traditionally as a supplementary force, to support the police. In respect of the A.C.F., we are now prescribing police duties for men who in some instances will be trained to a large extent, but also under the new system they will be men who have had no training whatever. And when we come to the Commandos, we give police duties to a large body which is practically wholly untrained, in the sense of the training that the Permanent Force and the A.C.F. receive. I think it is wholly unreasonable for the Minister to use the argument that he will take only a section of them. We are dealing with the clause as it is worded. The Minister may give assurances, but he may not be there forever, and other Ministers are not bound by the assurances given by this <span class="col_6751_6752" refersTo="page_0708"/>Minister. We are legislating for the statute book, and therefore it is necessary to have adequate safeguards. We accept all the arguments of the Minister, but the Minister should also appreciate our point of view as we are attempting, in the amendment moved by my hon. friend, to insert the necessary safeguard, so if the men are used for police duties at any time we will have the assurance that they are trained men. As far as I can see, that is what the amendment means. It only asks that men are used with a minimum of six months&#x2019; training, but in terms of this clause the Minister may call out for police duties untrained men in the Commandos and I do not think anyone opposite will argue that a Commando member is as well trained a man as the member of the A.C.F. or the Permanent Force. I would plead with the Minister to consider this amendment favourably.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein correctly says that we pass laws for the Statute Book, but look what the hon. member now wants to place on the Statute Book. He now wishes to place on the Statute Book a provision that no person may be used for specific services unless he has had six months&#x2019; training. What would that mean? It would mean that these people who are already in training camps and whose services could have been used with advantage to protect the lives of people, their health or property, cannot be used until such time as they have had six months&#x2019; training.</p>

<p>As the amendment reads it asks that the following words should be inserted after (d). But I want to say this even in connection with police duties. The hon. member says that these people must have six months&#x2019; training.

<p>He wants to use the Reserve Force. How many of them had more than three months&#x2019; training except those who went on active service? The hon. member now wants to exclude specifically these people who may already be in a training camp and whose services could be used advantageously at very short notice. I think it would be foolish for any commanding officer, when he knows that people are untrained and that he can call in other men, to make use of the services of untrained people. After all, that is why we have commanding officers. But it is unthinkable to lay down by law that those people cannot be called in. The hon. member will realize that the support which he is giving to the amendment of the hon. member for Simonstown holds no water, and I am sure that the Minister will not accept it.</p>

We only wish to make sure that untrained men are not used for civil police duties. We do not want to prevent men from being used for police duties but when they are used we should like them to be men who have had more than six months&#x2019; training. The police to-day regard their training to be of such a nature that whereas in the past they trained men for five months, the training is 12 months to-day. I do not think we are asking too much of the Minister. We do not want to be difficult but we only want to make sure that men are used who have a certain amount of experience.</p>

<p>It is remarkable but once a person has misunderstood anything he continues to misunderstand it. Let us start with the last speaker. The hon. member for North East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) has made the point that we want to use men for police duties who have not been trained, but let me repeat this: The police duties are prescribed and according to the definition clause of the Act &#x201C;prescribed&#x201D; means in respect of matters relating to salaries and (b) in respect of any other matter prescribed by regulation. Those duties are prescribed by regulation and here we have the regulations. I gave them at the second reading. The hon. member for Turffontein now says that all the hon. member for Simonstown wants is that only those people who have had at least six months&#x2019; training should perform police duties. But the hon. member for Simonstown asks for that only in respect of the Citizen Force member and not in respect of Permanent Force men. If we were to be so unwise as to use people who have not had any training, surely we can use Permanent Force men who join to-day to-morrow and there will be nothing to prevent us from doing so. But we are not doing that. Where is it provided in any Act that a person first has to be trained as a pilot before he is allowed to fly an aeroplane? No one is so foolish as to let him fly an aeroplane until he has been trained. Where is it provided in any Act that a gunner must first be trained as a gunner before you allow him to operate a gun? That is simply not done and for the same reason it is not provided in any Act that a person must first have been trained as a military policeman before he does that work; that is simply not done. Even if we get another Minister he will, as sure as Heaven, not put a man in an aeroplane who has not been trained, and he will not use a person as gunner if he has not been trained and he will not use him as a military police unless he has been trained. That is the position. Why do they persist with this argument then? This clause has nothing to do with defence force men assisting the police in times of emergency for 24 hours. The clause states clearly that they will perform those duties as prescribed by regulation. The regulations have always prescribed certain police duties and those police duties are only in the military field and for military people. [Interjections]. It is not even to guard a bridge. The position is simply this that where we want to use the Citizen Force we have men who are in the camps for nine months. We are also training them to perform military police work, but even a member of a commando, in terms of Section 38, can be allocated in which case he is not there for only a few days. If he is allocated to the Citizen Force he is there for a long period and if he has to be used for police duties he will be trained for it. I want to make an appeal to the hon. member for Simonstown. There has really been a misunderstanding. It is clearly stated here that those people who have to do police duties in terms of this section must only do those duties as prescribed.</p>

<p>I suppose the hon. member for Simonstown never thought of it that his amendment does not state that a member of the Permanent Force must have six months&#x2019; training. I can use him for police duties the very next day after joining if I want to be so irresponsible. [Interjections.] The hon. member definitely stated that he did not want untrained men to do police duties, and he said that is all the hon. member for Simonstown wanted. But the Permanent Force men have not all been trained. If we want to be so irresponsible, we can use a volunteer to the Permanent Force to-morrow for police duties, if he signed on to-day, but we do not do that, and we never have done it before. Why should we now do it with A.C.F. men?</p>

It also refers to contraventions committed by somebody subject to military law, and contraventions committed in respect of weapons, ammunition, aircraft, ships, etc. They are all contraventions as prescribed, and this clause only deals with police duties in that regard. The other duties referred to in Clause 15 are something totally different. We can discuss that when we come to Clause 15, but this has nothing to do with it. I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>First of all, with regard to the Permanent Force, the exclusion of the Permanent Force was deliberate in the amendment. It has always been regarded as the duty of the Permanent Force to back up the police if necessary, and it operates under completely different conditions to the A.C.F. Any new Permanent Force trainees are part of a unit being trained under their own officers. They are not scattered about the country as the A.C.F. trainees could be. The two things are quite separate. We have accepted the provision made in the original Act in regard to the Permanent Force and we have only raised this issue in regard to the A.C.F. When we come to the prescribed duties, it is true that (d) says &#x201C;on such police duties as may be prescribed&#x201D;, but when we go on to Clause 2 (4) it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any such member who is employed on police duties shall have all such powers and functions as are by law conferred upon or entrusted to a member of the South African <span class="col_6755_6756" refersTo="page_0710"/>Police Force&#x2026; and shall in respect of acts done or omitted to be done by him be liable to the same extent as he would have been liable in like circumstances if he were a member of the said Force, and shall have the benefit of all the indemnities to which a member of that Force will in like circumstances be entitled.</block>

<p>He may have his duties prescribed by the regulations, but the regulations may be changed without reference to this Parliament. What we are legislating for at the moment is something to go on the Statute Book as permanent legislation, and our objection is that we will place on the Statute Book something with no limiting qualification of any sort except any qualifications contained in regulations, which may be changed from time to time, and we say this is wrong. It is not the correct procedure for these boys who have virtually come straight from school and within the first six months of their training to be liable for duties such as laid down in sub-section (4). This House knows full well the widespread powers now vested in the Police Force. Even an experienced policeman has his work cut out to keep pace with the knowledge of what he is entitled to do, and this Bill grants those powers without any reservation to such Defence persons as may be drafted for police duties. There is no qualification, whatever the regulations may say. We are most anxious to help in this regard, but I think it is incumbent upon the Minister to insert in this legislation the safeguard we are asking for, particularly in regard to the trainees of the A.C.F. It is as simple as that. The Minister, like the rest of us, may not always be there, and someone else may take his place. If it is changed by Parliament, that is well and good. Parliament can change any law, but that is the body which should be able to make the change, and that is why we want this precaution enshrined in the legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown does not want to accept the Minister&#x2019;s explanation. I think it is a question of legal opinion as to what is stated in the clause. The duties for which these people will be used will be as prescribed. The hon. member says that only people with six months&#x2019; training must be used for those duties but if we say that we shall be eliminating 95 per cent of the trained reserves and of the Citizen Force. The only people we have to-day who have had more than six months&#x2019; training are those people who served in the last war and for the rest, those people who started their nine months&#x2019; training last year. In previous years nobody received more than five months&#x2019; training in the Citizen Force or in the Commandos. In other words, you are eliminating all those people..

<p>I think we should get clarity from the Minister in regard to his interpretation of what constitutes police duties. I gained the impression that the Minister has in mind that by making it compulsory on all three arms of the Defence Force that they should do police duties, he will draw up regulations prescribing how certain members of those forces will be used on police duties for military purposes. The regulations quoted by the Minister are entirely confined to military police duties.</p>

<p>Let me prove to the Minister by his own Act that he completely misunderstands the matter. The Minister will agree that Section 13, which lays down the duties of the Permanent Force, says &#x201C;on such police duties as may be prescribed&#x201D;. Section 90 says how they will be used and says &#x201C;subject to the provisions of this Act the whole or any portion or member of the Permanent Force may at any time be employed on service on such police duties as may be prescribed&#x201D;. The whole force, in other words, would then have to be spent looking after itself, which is utterly ridiculous, if you interpret the law as it stands. In other words, the employment of military personnel on police duties is directed entirely to the conception that they will be used to supplement the ordinary police. Surely that is the interpretation and it has always been so. When the Minister reads out these regulations, he can change them at any time. He merely has to Table them in this House. And these regulations refer only to the Permanent Force and deal with the protection of military property, and they have nothing to do with the A.C.F. performing police duties because they can establish their own military police without having an Act of Parliament, and if the Minister consults his advisers he will find that that is so.</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<p>(1), (2) and (3) The Department of Health subsidizes the distribution of skimmed milk powder in order to combat kwashiorkor other nutritional diseases. The subsidy is calculated are 5 cents per pound of milk powder and is available to all local authorities which apply therefore and are able to distribute the milk powder efficiently and to the satisfaction of the Department of Health where malnutrition occurs.</p>

<p>For this purpose a sum of R20,000 was allocated last year of which only R8,892.was used because the scheme was only approved in May 1962 when many local authorities had unfortunately already drawn up their estimates for the financial year.</p>

<p>The subsidy has been introduced permanently for the purpose of the distribution of milk powder to all racial groups. For the present financial year an amount of R40,000 has been allocated for this purpose.</p>

<p>(4) The Department is continually taking steps by means of correspondence and personal negotiations to bring the scheme to the notice of local authorities and to secure their co-operation.</p>

<p>In addition to the subsidized schemes, milk powder is also being distributed by full-time district surgeons and departmental health centres in cases where it is considered essential by the Department.</p>

<p>Third Order read: House to resume in Committee on Defence Amendment Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>[Progress reported on 27 May, when Clause 2 was under consideration, upon which an amendment had been moved by Mr. Gay.]</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Last night when the House adjourned we were dealing with the amendment moved to this particular Clause 2, by this side in an endeavour to make certain that untrained members of the Defence Force, particularly the trainee section, would not be called upon to carry out police duties as set out in paragraph (d) of sub-section (2) of the clause. The hon. the Minister had made it clear that it was his desire to obtain authority to use the Citizen Force personnel for military police duties, a duty which has hitherto been confined to members of the Permanent Force. We also made it clear that we did not have the slightest objection to the use of Citizen Force members for this purpose under the new defence set-up. But the Bill contains no provision limiting the service to that particular duty. The Bill makes it quite clear in sub-section (2) that the South African Defence Force or any portion of member thereof may at all times be employed on such police duties as may be prescribed, and then in sub-section (4) says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any such member who is employed on police duties shall have all such powers and functions as are by law conferred upon or entrusted to a member of the South African Police Force established under the Police Act, 1958 (Act No. 2 of 1958)&#x2026;</block>

<p>It then goes on to say that he shall have the benefit of all the indemnities to which a member of the South African Police Force would in like circumstances be entitled. We adopt the attitude that while we are quire prepared to accept the Minister&#x2019;s assurance and undertaking that he as Minister is only interested in using these men as military police, the Bill which we are discussing&#x2014;and after all it is the Bill on which we have to make our decision&#x2014; does not impose any limitation but provides for the full scope of ordinary civil police duties. It is not restricted to military police duties; it covers the full range of police duties. We have put our views to the Minister across the floor of the House, pointing out that we feel that those duties should not be imposed, under the present system of defence training, upon the new trainee who has just been called up, who in many cases is of immature years, without experience and without training. We moved an amendment with a view to limiting the use of members of the Defence Force, other than members of the Permanent Force, on police duties, unless they have completed a minimum of six months of military training. We felt that that was the minimum security that we were justified in accepting, and we asked the Minister to give that request his most careful consideration to see whether he could meet us in that respect. I do not propose to deal with this matter at great length. The Minister has had the opportunity overnight of considering our amendment, and I am living in hopes that he may find it possible to accept our amendment, if not precisely in the form in which it is worded here, then in some other form which would give a similar limitation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister will recall that last night I indicated that there was another aspect of this clause which I felt should be discussed in Committee, because there are other matters which affect the Defence Force as a whole and which fundamentally arise from this clause. I think the Minister will agree with me that this clause fundamentally affects the entire structure of our Defence Force and the way in which it can now be used for the immediate defence of our country, as opposed to the situation that prevailed in the past. The words of subsection (2) are significant because it is stated here that &#x201C;the South African Defence Force or any portion or member thereof may at all times be employed&#x2026;&#x201D;. When we consider Clause 17, where the force will be in a state of perpetual mobilization for immediate use, I think other aspects arise under this clause, particularly as far as the training of the Defence Force as a whole is concerned. Under the Act as it now stands, the Minister can use the Permanent Force immediately without resorting to general mobilization, but when it comes to the use of the Citizen Forces and of the Commandos in respect of internal disorder then he can use them immediately but he is not able to use them for the purpose of national defence unless certain steps have been taken. Under the old conditions there was merely a liability for service, but the Minister first had to take certain steps before members of the Citizen Force and of the Commandos could be called up, but as this clause is worded, read in conjunction with Clause 17, it means in fact that your entire Defence Force is in a perpetual state of I readiness and can be used immediately. I think the Minister will agree with me that that is so. If that is so, if these three arms&#x2014;the <span class="col_6775_6776" refersTo="page_0720"/>Permanent Force, the Citizen Force and the Commandos&#x2014;can now be used together, then the degree of training that members of the force have received is a matter which cannot be treated lightly. This clause in fact means that the Minister will be able at any time to use almost 90,000 men for the defence of the Republic&#x2014;something like 10,000 in the Permanent Force, or slightly less, and at least 10,000 in the Active Citizen Force and approximately 70,000 in the Commandos, if one can accept the paper strength of the Commandos as being correct. The Minister can use them immediately for defence purposes. If that is so, then the question of the use of these respective arms of our Defence Forces and the degree of training which they have received are very pertinent questions. We have no doubt about the training of the Permanent Force, and under the new system under which a ballotee is trained for nine months continually to begin with and then receives subsequent periods of training, I do not think there can be any doubt that they will be capable and trained men whose services can be used effectively in the service of their country. But then we come to the third arm which consists of the bulk of our Defence Forces, men who under the amendments made to the Defence Act in 1961 are also in a sense ballotees. I refer here to the Commandos. In 1961 it was provided for the first time that escapees from the ballot may now be drafted to the Commandos. In a sense therefore they are also ballotees because in terms of the Act they are compelled to serve in the Commandos. The Commandos, as we know, are at present largely made up of volunteers, and I would like to ask the Minister in view of these fundamental changes to give very serious consideration to the acceptance of our amendment. I think the matter becomes even more significant in the light of the threats which are now being made against our country at Addis Ababa. The question of ensuring that adequate training is given to our Defence Forces is even more important now in the light of these latest developments. I think the Commandos have always been looked upon, in time of war at any rate, as supplying the necessary internal security needs, but that means that these men must be trained. I think before the Minister asks us to agree to these wide provisions and to this fundamental change in the whole structure of our Defence Force he should give us some indication as to what he has in mind with regard to the training of the bulk of our Defence Forces, namely the Commandos. I think the time is past when we can leave it to men to decide whether it pleases them to turn up for training or not. I noticed a report in the newspapers the other day that a commanding officer had complained that only about half of his Commando turned up for week-end bivouacs and that he could take no disciplinary measures. That position is quite unsatisfactory, and I suggest to the Minister that when he asks us to agree to such a fundamental change in the whole defence structure of our forces he should give us some indication as to what he has in mind and particularly with regard to the training of the bulk of our manpower.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>It has everything to do with the Bill when we are asked to recognize that the Commandos may at any time be used for the purposes set out in this clause in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d). Under the Act as it now stands it has never been possible to use the Commandos in this way; the Minister ought to know his Act. The provisions of Section 90 of the Act are perfectly clear. The procedures are perfectly clear; mobilization first has to take place and all sort of things have to happen, but under this clause, together with the powers granted under Clause 17, the Minister can use these powers immediately without resorting to mobilization. They may at any time, in terms of this clause, be called out in defence of the country, and if that is the obligation that is placed upon the Commandos, the Citizen Force and the Permanent Force then they have the right, as men prepared to defend South Africa, to claim that they should at least be given the minimum training. I think the Minister should tell us at this stage, because it is most relevant to this provision, what steps he intends taking and what he envisages with regard to the training of our manpower. Let me emphasize again that the Defence Forces, in terms of this clause, are not separately considered as the Permanent Force, as Commandos and as Citizen Forces; they are considered as a whole, and if considered as a whole it brings into the net all 90,000 men whose names are registered in the Minister&#x2019;s Department and at least a part of them has received insufficient military training and they are entitled to receive at least a minimum of training. Sir, we are all aware of the threats which have been made against us, and I think everyone will welcome these provisions which introduce a fundamental change in our defence structure, but then I think the onus rests on the Minister to tell us what he envisages with regard to adequate training for our men in the various arms of our Defence Force.</p>

<p>This morning I once again gave all the attention possible to this whole matter, but after having once again reconsidered the matter, I am more convinced than ever before that I dare not give in. I shall reply to the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) in a moment. I shall first reply to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant). He says the entire structure of our Defence Force is now being altered in consequence of this clause which provides that our Citizen Force and our Commandos also may perform such police duties as may be prescribed. I cannot see how that alters the structure of our Defence Force at all. The hon. member also asked what I was <span class="col_6777_6778" refersTo="page_0721"/>going to do about the training of our Commandos. I doubt whether you, Mr. Chairman, will permit me to reply to that, but I shall continue until you stop me.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Simonstown. It is very clear to me that his concern is that he is afraid that, as we are now able to use members of the Citizen Force and the Commandos to perform police duties, it may lead to difficulties if we were to use untrained people to perform police duties, because those people will be undisciplined. There is no thought of doing that. At the present time we have the Provost Regiment Voortrekkerhoogte for instance. That regiment has been in existence since 1960. So all the members of that Regiment who trained in it during 1960, 1961 and 1962 are people who have received three months&#x2019; Citizen Force training. Therefore all those people whom we have been training for this very kind of work, and who will be grouped into various divisions when it becomes necessary, cannot be used by us because not one of them has had six months&#x2019; training. It will virtually lead to disbanding that whole regiment, except for the small group who received training last year. I should like to point out that the possibility does exist that a person who is untrained will be used here and there on special occasions. I accept that such a possibility may arise in an emergency. But that self-same position exists in the police at the present time. The hon. member for Turffontein told me recently that I should remember that the police are now trained for a year, and here I do not even want to agree that people should have had six months&#x2019; training. I know the police are now trained for a year, but Section 34 of the Police Act says specifically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever there are not in any locality sufficient ordinary members of the force available to perform police duties or any particular police duty therein, or to convey any person in lawful custody from such locality to any other place, the Minister of, if authorized thereto by the Minister either generally or in any particular case, any commissioned officer, magistrate, additional magistrate, assistant magistrate, Native Commissioner, additional Native Commissioner or assistant Native Commissioner in that locality may appoint as special constables to act as such so many fit and proper persons as may be necessary for the performance of any such duty as aforesaid.</block>

<p>Here there are people who have not had a single day&#x2019;s training and the police may even use them in terms of their Act in certain circumstances. The police may appoint an ordinary person to perform police duties, a man who has not had a single day&#x2019;s training. I should like to put this question to the hon. members for Turffontein and Simonstown: Supposing Commando members guard a certain place. That will be one of the duties they will perform in wartime. Suppose someone wants to break in there or do mischief. A member of the Commando may not arrest that person under the Act as it stands now. Surely we cannot permit that. All he can do is to shoot that person; he has no alternative but to shoot that man, because he cannot arrest him. No, we cannot go so far. It is. very clear that we want to use trained people. We train them, but we cannot accept this amendment at all, because then we shall not be able to use three-quarters of the people in the regiment we have trained for this purpose. Furthermore, if in a state of emergency we have to have someone arrested or transported, we cannot do so, or if in an emergency we have to post people as guards in a street, with instructions not to permit members of the public to enter that street, and they nevertheless do so, we shall be unable to arrest those people unless we have this power. We want these powers because we want to use these people on such occasions. I am really sorry that in this case I am unable to meet hon. members of the Opposition. We have misunderstood one another on this point right from the beginning, and I think that as a result of that we have set a conflict in motion which is now just dragging on while in fact there is nothing to it. I wish to repeat that we want to train these people; we are training them in the same way as we are training the police; but there may be occasions where we may even require the services of a man who has not been trained. If a person has to be arrested where these people are on guard, I really and truly cannot send a man for six hours on horse-back to go and look for somebody who is trained before the man may be arrested. We must have the power to arrest that man.</p>

<p>Clause, as printed, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 3,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 3 deals with the conditions of service of men who are called up and who are in employment when they are called up. It deals with the duties and the responsibilities of the employers towards their employees. If I may say so, under this amendment, employers are not called upon now to make the same sacrifices on behalf of the Defence Force as they were in the past. I am not going to criticize the content of the clause to that extent. The hon. the Minister is not only the Minister of Defence calling up men for service, he in turn is a member of a body of employers, and the body of employers of which he is a member is the Government of South Africa.</p>

<p>I should like to ask on what conditions do our Government, through the hon. the Minister of the Interior, release men for service if they volunteer for service? The hon. the Minister will remember that I spoke about employees in the Railway Service but I am now speaking generally of employees in the service of the Government. Supposing a young civil servant accepts a commission in the Active Citizen Force and then goes to college for a course, as he would be required to do, does the Government release him on pay? That is the point I want to come to: Does the Government release him on pay? Because the Railway Administration does not. The Railway Administration treats its employees in a most unpatriotic manner when compared with other great employers in the country. The Railway Administration is a law unto itself. They are part of the Government and still not of the Government. Therefore, I should like to know what the position is in regard to other employees in the Civil Service? I am sorry the hon. the Minister of the Interior is not here because I assume they will be released through his office. I want to know whether a young officer who has been a civil servant and who is called up will receive pay while he is absent. I want to quote the following in regard to the Railways&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was the practice in the past to grant special paid leave to railway servants irrespective of whether they have been released for compulsory or voluntary defence duties.</block>

<p>That has now been cancelled. I am speaking especially about officers because that is the comparison I am making with the Railways. These young men are selected after they have served their compulsory service because they were senior N.C.O.s or warrant officers. They are invited to accept commissions. They are treated in a manner by the Railways which I regard as most undesirable and I should like to know what is done by the rest of the Civil Service.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from><span class="col_6781_6782" refersTo="page_0723"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>There are times when you raise matters in this House about which you feel particularly strongly. I want to raise the matter in regard to this clause which amends Section 4 of the original Act dealing with the duties of employers but which gives some concession to ballotees who may be prejudiced by their military training. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to reconsider the period of four months that is provided for in this clause; this being a period considered to be in his favour when it comes to the questions of promotion and remuneration. I do not want to discuss the details. I made the appeal once before during the second reading. I hope the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) and other members on the Government benches will also make this plea, namely that the Minister extends this period of four months. The Minister&#x2019;s attitude is that he cannot do this because this is a question of national safety, that it is a matter of the man having taken his chance at the ballot box. But if that is so, surely the responsibility should not only rest on the man who goes to serve but a measure of responsibility should also be placed on the shoulders of the man for whom that soldier will work when he returns from his period of service, in other words, his employer. The advantages are all in favour of the employer; there are very few advantages to the ballotee. This is a concession. It must be realized that throughout their life, in regard to their normal promotion, in their advances for pay and in regard to their seniority, these men will be prejudiced in comparison with the chap who sits next to him simply because their names were drawn out of the ballot box. [Interjections.] If that hon. member who is so concerned about cinemas and films and sex and so on were more concerned about the interests of the fighting men of South Africa he would not make such stupid interjections.</p>

<p>Sir, I repeat my plea to the hon. the Minister. I am not going to advocate a period here but I think the period of four months as laid down by this clause is too short. It constitutes too great a prejudice to these men who are called upon to serve their country. They have no choice about the matter; their names are drawn in the ballot box. I know there are hon. members on the Government benches who feel as strongly as I do about this matter. I am not going to move an amendment, Sir, but I would again ask the Minister to give deep consideration to this matter. If he feels that he can do something about it I want to ask him to do something about it in the Other Place. I know all his arguments against it. I admit there is some merit in them, but the counter-argument I have put to the Minister is that if a sacrifice has to be made do not let it be made all on one side. Let the employer also make a sacrifice for the defence needs of the country by having to give these men, when they come out of their time of service, an equal opportunity with the man whose name was drawn in this ballot box. I hope my hon. friend, the member for Pretoria (West) who has made such a strong plea about this in the past, will support me in my plea to the Minister to-day.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot fully agree with what the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) is asking, because I think it is unreasonable. In regard to the apprentices he has accused me of now pleading for something I was unwilling to plead for under the Apprenticeship Act, but I should like to explain that there is a very great difference. An apprentice is undergoing training for which he is paid. I do not want to go further into that, Mr. Chairman; you will not permit me to do so. I wish to do to-day what I did in my second-reading speech. I do not wish to urge that the people should have leave, sick leave and salary. But I feel very strongly about one thing which I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice, namely the date of the salary increase. The man who goes for his military training loses nine months&#x2019; salary save for what the Department pays him. In most cases, private employers do not pay salaries to ballotees. Now this legislation also penalizes him in respect of his incremental date. In other words, the man who makes the sacrifice of going to camp as a ballotee is not penalized for one year only in respect of his salary, his leave and his sick leave, but he may be penalized for four or five or six years in respect of his incremental dates, and he may be put back four months as against his colleagues who were not balloted. I feel that this last point, namely his incremental date, is too great a sacrifice to demand from the man who is called up to go and work for nine months at a reduced wage in many instances. I am not asking that the employer should pay him; I am not asking that he should give the man his full leave and sick leave, because I must say I think that going to camp is better than any leave for a man. The physical development they undergo as ballotees in the camps is better than their sick leave and better than their ordinary leave. So I am not going to ask for that. Nor am I asking that the people should be paid in full. But I ask that the incremental date be recognized as the incremental date to which that man is entitled. I plead most earnestly for that. I hope that if the Minister does not see his way clear to doing so to-day, he will consider making some concession in this regard in the Other Place. I feel that we are asking the man to make this sacrifice for the period he is in camp, that he has to sacrifice his leave, his salary and his sick leave, but we also ask him to surrender, when he returns from camp, four months for a number of years as regards his incremental date which also affects his salary. I feel this sacrifice is much too great. I should&#x2019; like to appeal to the Minister, if he does not see his way clear to-day, to consider introducing an amendment in the Other Place.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I will not keep the House long, but I should like to reply to the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. <span class="col_6783_6784" refersTo="page_0724"/>Durrant). He referred to sacrifices here. I wish to put my point of view very clearly. I do not regard the ballotee who proceeds to camp for military training, as making any sacrifice. I regard it as a privilege he receives, a privilege whereby he is enabled to receive training to perform an essential service for his fatherland. I want to persuade those people to get that idea out of their heads. We are not concerned with a sacrifice here. We are dealing with a privilege. I wish I were young enough to share that privilege. Those hon. members think they are now buttering up those young ballotees. They do not know what is going on. Those people keenly desire to receive training. Hon. members opposite gain no political advantage by championing the cause of those people at their youthful age and by saying it is a terrible sacrifice they are making. It is not a sacrifice. It is a privilege and I regret one thing in my life, namely that I did not have the opportunity to receive such a thorough training.</p>

<p>I wish to add that no school can really provide the discipline those young men receive in the camps; nor can the community provide it for them.

I do not think it is fitting that hon. members opposite should now try to catch a few votes by pleading for those people and pretending it is such a terrible sacrifice.

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has asked how the people who go back for further training are treated. I may just say that all officers and non-commissioned officers who enrol for extended service are paid their full salaries plus their allowances by the Public Service.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) urges that more than four months&#x2019; recognition should be given. Let me say this now&#x2014;I am also saying this to the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt)&#x2014; that this period was decided upon in collaboration with the Department of Labour. I have no knowledge of labour matters, and for that reason these boards fall under the Department of Labour. Defence has no knowledge of it. I must admit that the matter raised by the Hon. member for Pretoria (West) has now also stirred my heart. I shall have that matter discussed properly with Labour and the labour organizations. However, that cannot be done Before this legislation reaches the Other Place. But it is something I shall cause to be properly investigated during the recess. Perhaps the people will have to suffer this year if we change it later on.</p>

<p>However, I cannot concede the point regarding this period of four months. We are simply going to render the young ballotees a disservice if we make this period too long. If we make the period too long, those men will not find employment. The employer is going to discriminate against him when he applies for work. If he cannot prove that he was not drawn as a ballotee he is not going to find employment if that period is made too long. And then nothing can be done to that employer because he is not discriminating against a person in his employ; he discriminates against someone who is not in his employ. If a person loses four months in this way, I think he can do so for the sake of his fatherland. We have heard all the threats. Two years ago I referred to it, and certain hon. members scoffed at me. We have now heard these threats again; they are there and we cannot ignore them. We must prepare our country. I trust the time is not far off when we shall train every young man for military service. It cannot be done at present as yet, but we are working in that direction. We are increasing the number every year. We want to train every young man, whether he has flat feet or not. I cannot agree to an extension of the period but I shall discuss the matters raised by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) with Labour.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. the Minister of Labour is not here to-day to assist the hon. the Minister with this matter which he says is a matter for Labour. I am afraid I do not quite agree with the Minister there. This is an amendment to Section 4 of the Defence Act. When Section 4 of the Defence Act was inserted there was no consultation with Labour. This refers to the duties of employers. It tells employers they cannot penalize a man because he is doing service. The employer commits an offence if he fails to provide facilities for a man to serve. There was no consultation with the Department of Labour; it was a defence need. I have said nothing about the Apprenticeship Act. That position was discussed when that legislation was before the House at the time when I made my plea to the Minister in regard to apprentices. We are dealing here with the position of all ballotees. It is quite obvious that under the existing system, when a man is called up the moment he leaves school, he is not going to be prejudiced because he has not started any work yet. So he cannot be prejudiced in any way in regard to his future. But many men come in who were formerly exempted. What is their position? Many men were exempted so as to enable them to finish their <span class="col_6785_6786" refersTo="page_0725"/>studies.

<p>He was exempted in the national interest. It was not an advantage to him to be exempted. The Exemption Boards do not say &#x201C;I am going to give you the advantage of being exempted just because you want to be exempted&#x201D;. He was exempted in the national interest. He was exempted from undergoing training immediately because it was considered necessary that that citizen should first perform other training. Perhaps he had to go to university or perforce he had to undergo some other specialized training. Does the Minister want to deny him that in the national interest? Then I am amazed at the Minister for making such an observation. It was not his fault; his application was duly weighed and considered and he was granted exemption in the national interest.</p>

<p>Of course he asks for it. He puts his reasons before the Exemption Board and the Exemption Board weighs them on their merits. If the Exemption Board considers that his reasons are such that they do not justify the exemption, they will never grant it. I submit to the hon. Minister that it is not a vast problem here. It is an issue affecting a small number of persons because in the long run, as the present system operates, those classes of persons, who are exempted will get less and less, and I plead again with the Minister to reconsider the position. I am not discussing the apprenticeship provisions as laid down in (2)<i>ter.</i> I am discussing (b) (i) where it reads &#x201C;have the right to reckon in respect of any one unbroken period of such training more than four months of the absence from his employment occasioned by such training as employment in the determination of such increased remuneration&#x2026;&#x201D; Here you have a chap who let us say is in the Civil Service; he got exemption, he resumes employment in the Civil Service* but now for the rest of his life in regard to the others that he works with, he is prejudiced in his remuneration, in his seniority and in his promotion, merely because he conformed to the law of the land and having been balloted for he served his country. But where does the State suffer? The State is making no sacrifice in that regard as an employer. It can happen in regard to any big corporation or company, and the Minister in his reply to the second reading said that if there is to be made a sacrifice they must realize that it is made in the national interest. All I ask is let the sacrifice be a two-sided one, and not a one-sided one. Why should the soldier make all the sacrifices and the employer make none?</p>

<p>On Clause 10,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>The establishment of these Air Commandos is welcomed by everybody, I think by the public as well as by the pilots concerned. The asset we have in our private aviation and our private aircraft is an asset that will and will have to be used during time of war, and it is as well that in peacetime we should link these people up with the people with whom they will have to co-operate and that they should receive training. Another important point here of course is that this training, this joining of the Air Commandos by the people in peacetime, is on a voluntary basis. In wartime they will be compelled in the national interest to come and do their work as they did during the last war too, and the sooner they qualify themselves for that the better it will be for all concerned in the end.</p>

<p>I have seen the circular issued by the Minister&#x2019;s Department in this connection and forwarded to private pilots, and I should like to offer a few points of criticism. I hope the Minister will accept it in the spirit in which I am making it. It is a very good document, but I should like to make a few suggestions. In this document emphasis is laid on light aircraft. Now at present one has the same problem in respect of aircraft that one has in respect <span class="col_6787_6788" refersTo="page_0726"/>of motor-cars, namely to know where to draw the line. What is light and what is heavy?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I thought you old chaps who were concerned with it knew about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>The point I should like to make is that the Minister should not draw that line too soon. I do not want him to exclude from this scheme everything that seems to be heavy, because one of the objects of the Air Commandos is the transport of personnel, equipment and casualties, and in this respect the heavier type of aircraft is more useful and more important. So I hope the emphasis will not be laid too heavily on the lighter types.</p>

<p>The next point I should like to raise is in regard to the pilots themselves, of course, and in the first place I should like to remark that I notice that all the pilots should be younger than 50 years. I think that is a great pity. The older pilots are people who have much flying experience, civil flying experience, and in many cases they are the people who have military experience. They could be of great importance to the Minister with their experience, their skill, and what is more, they are more levelheaded than many of the younger men. Young pilots have a way of being a little bit wild, and these people could exert a sobering influence upon them. I am not saying the Minister should take people on crutches as pilots but he has a very good standard to use as a criterion and that is the commercial licence. The commercial licence for pilots at the present time requires them to pass a very stringent medical test, and when a man has reached the age of 60 years, and he is still able to pass that test, he can still render very good service. I know, for instance, pilots of more than 60 years of age who are still flying all types of aircraft and who are able to do any kind of civil work, and who are eminently suitable for this kind of work. I do hope the Minister is not going to eliminate them because they are older than 50 years. If they are physically fit enough to pass that stringent test they are required to pass by the Department of Civil Aviation, I am convinced that they can still render outstanding services to the Minister. These elderly people are the very people who own their private aircraft to-day, the aircraft the Minister also wants. Many of the young men who fly have to hire aircraft from commercial firms or from clubs, etc. The result will be that many more pilots will be available for this work than the number of available aircraft, whereas if we have these older men with their own aircraft, the problem will be solved to some extent.</p>

<p>My final point in this regard is that I notice they are going to be bilingual units. I am very pleased about that. In this respect I also wish to ask the Minister not to be too strict as regards the bilingualism. If a person is not quite fluently bilingual, yet is a good pilot, give him a chance.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member now wants a definition of light aircraft, and he: says we require some of the heavier types. However, he has not indicated where he himself would really draw the line. He refers to heavier aircraft without defining them himself. But I believe we may accept with safety that the light aircraft the hon. the Minister has in mind in this legislation extends to a twin-motored aircraft capable of carrying about six passengers, and of which there are quite a number in South Africa. The majority of these are in commercial use and not in private use. They are capable of taking six passengers with a maximum freight load of approximately 2,000 lbs. If we go beyond that class of aircraft, we find there is virtually a gap in South Africa, and that there are only a few aircraft between that type and until you come to the Dakota type, DC.3 and further on. There are a few of them in South Africa and they are mainly in the service of large companies, great organizations in South Africa, and they are used in the employ of their directors, etc. So there really is no problem for the hon. Minister in making a choice. The line draws itself. The private aircraft contemplated for this purpose falls into a clearly defined category. The type above that in any event was, I believe, never contemplated when provision was made for Air Commandos.</p>

<p>All right, we shall accept that the hon. member did not say what he said. If I were to take myself, the hon. member may think I am young and I shall then have to take the risk that he may call me wild, but the kind of training these people are going to receive and the type of work the Department is contemplating for them, is work that will be exacting. It will be work that will require a fast reaction time, and if the hon. member as an ex-pilot will be honest, he will admit that a man&#x2019;s reaction time as a pilot deteriorates every day, and when one has reached the age of 40 years, our civil aviation regulations already provide that one has to subject oneself to an annual medical test, and the hon. member really has no argument as to why people of 50 years and older should have to do this somewhat exacting work and perform these somewhat exhausting duties. The hon. member will, as a pilot, once again agree with me that to take night training, to take a course in instrument flying, if it is not a daily practice with one; is particularly <span class="col_6789_6790" refersTo="page_0727"/>exacting. To take people who use aircraft for their business&#x2014;which I do not think was contemplated in this provision&#x2014;and to incorporate them into the scheme cannot bring us any additional benefits. The more successful pilot is the young man, the man full of vigour, the man with a capacity for training and the one who can improve his knowledge through training with the Air Commandos. I also believe that at this stage there is no room in the structure of the Air Commandos for these people in an administrative capacity. To that I would add that the Air Commando may well develop into a further operational role in circumstances we cannot foresee now, where there will yet be room for the more experienced pilot, perhaps on the ground, where we could to a very large extent make use of his flying knowledge. I do not think the hon. the Minister will hesitate for one moment to make use of the knowledge of those people and also to make provision in the regulations for employing those people in an administrative capacity or in the hundred-and-one branches there may be when such an Air Commando&#x2019;s operational role is extended.</p>

<p>This Clause 10 deals with compensation in regard to the use of private aircraft for Commando purposes. Now there are a few issues which I would like to place before the hon. Minister because I think they are pertinent to the issue of compensation and the organization of the Air Commandos. What are the facts? We have registered in South Africa something like 675 aircraft. Those were the figures for 1962. That is the total figure, commercial and privately owned, and of the 675 let us write off 75 as commercial aircraft and twin-engined aircraft as mentioned by the hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg (Mr. J. W. Rail). That will leave a minimum say of 600 privately owned aircraft which can be used for these Air Commandos.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to hear that. But there are other issues in regard to these private aircraft. There are complaints made about the manner in which they have been serviced and the renewal of certificates. It is known that over 50 per cent of the 600 are more than ten years old, and that is one of the reasons why quite a number have not taken out licences, because of the expense of putting them into service. Private owners have had difficulties about it. These are practical issues in regard to the availability of aircraft, and I raise it for this reason that if there are large numbers that are out of commission at the present time and that can be brought into commission by men who are prepared to play their part in an Air Commando, then the Minister should indicate the nature of the compensation of the use of these aircraft that his Department is likely to need. If a number of these aircraft have not been relicensed by the private owners and they are prepared to play their part in Air Commandos, will, the Minister&#x2019;s Department; for example be prepared to meet the cost of putting these aircraft again into operation?</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>You see, Sir, there are a lot of issues that revolve around the matter. The Minister I think at one time indicated that he would pay the men whilst in the air at the rate of R6 per hour, or something like that, a&#x201D;Very small amount. My information is that it represents hardly anything in covering the cost, because if the men are going into training&#x2014;and I believe they have to complete a minimum of ten hours&#x2014;it is not only the time that they are in the air for which they are paid R6, but they have also to meet capital cost and cost of servicing the aircraft, in keeping the aircraft in a state of preparedness because what on earth is the use of an Air Commando if the aircraft when they are called upon to be used for training, the owner turns round and says &#x201C;I am sorry, my aircraft is pot in a state to fly, is not ready to fly; I have not been able to put it into commission, it is due for service&#x201D;? What is the use of that? Then the whole scheme will collapse if everything depends on the owner of the aircraft and he is in a position that he cannot do anything about it. If the hon. Minister refers to the Department of Transport, he will find out that over 50 per cent of the aircraft are more than ten years old. The hon. member said just now that the number is less than 600. Will 500 be a reasonable estimate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Still less.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Even less than that? Take 400 as a reasonable estimate; 50 per cent of 400 is 200. Then you have a maximum of 200 privately owned aircraft that can form the Commandos, and if those 200 aircraft are not in commission and are not ready for service, then the Department of Defence can invite them for training, but what can the Minister do if the owner of the aircraft turns around and says &#x201C;I am sorry, my aircraft is not fit to fly&#x201D;? These are practical issues, and that is why I think it is so important that when you are dealing with a clause which provides for compensation, subject to such conditions as the Minister may lay down, adequate compensation should be offered and the compensation paid by the Department should be adequate if these men are prepared to contribute their private aircraft and maintain them in a condition to fly. I hope the hon. Minister will be in the position to make a statement on the nature of compensation to be paid across the floor of the House or at some other time in order to see that we have an efficient system of Air Commandos.</p>

<p>I did not wish to cross swords with the hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg (Mr. J. W.

I am pleading for the older men because they have already completed their training. They do not require any more training for this type of work. They are doing it almost every day now. Let us look at the services required from them: Reconnaissance, communication flights, light transport, evacuation of casualties, etc. These people can do that type of work. They have their own aircraft with radios, and they can establish communications if necessary. They do not require any more training.

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) has made certain suggestions. The first is that the aircraft should not be too small, that we should not draw the line too closely. I agree with him in that regard. We shall need fairly large ones and I accept the position to be as stated by the hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg that the biggest aircraft in private hands to-day are small aircraft. But we shall go into that. The second plea of the hon. member for North-East Rand has cheered and gratified me. It is a long time since last I heard a man pleading for the old people, but to-day we had one. But I myself am a little nervous about using a man of over 50 for this type of work. It is true that these are probably the people who own the best aircraft. I have no experience of flying, but I have heard that a man&#x2019;s powers of observation, his reactions, drop rapidly after just over 30 years of age. Now it seems to me to be stretching the point a bit too far to use a man of 50.</p>

<p>I accept that is so, but that is an entirely different kind of flying. But we can go into the matter and if there is anything that can be done for an old man, I shall always gladly do it. The hon. member for Turffontein now pleads in regard to remuneration. Permit me to tell the hon. member that this R6 the men are receiving _is not received only during the period of training, during those hours when they are being trained at a bivouac, but they receive the R6 during their ordinary private flying hours, when they do their own work. The man would be flying in any event, and because he is a member of the Air Commando he receives R6 an hour, with a minimum of 18 hours if he flies that long; if he flies for less than 18 hours, he receives nothing. But for all his flying time between 18 and 24 hours, for his private work, he received R6 per hour. The man is receiving a very considerable contribution. When engaged on his private work, he receives it because he has become a member of the Air Commando. And this is the beginning of the Air Commando system. We shall see what is necessary in due course. I may just say that as far as I have now been able to ascertain, the rush is so great that we shall have a surplus, and we are most certainly not going to repair at Government expense those aircraft which cannot be used now, in order to incorporate them in the Air Commandos.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 11,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I dealt with this particular clause at the second reading, and I pointed out that it was much more difficult to deal with this clause in detail at this stage than was the case with regard to Clause 10. Under Clause 10 the hon. Minister and the Department of Defence can lay conditions under which a young man can be trained as a pilot, a member of an air crew or of the ground staff, and he will get so much per flying hour, etc., and people could under that insure their aircraft and they would be flying under civil aviation regulations. But as soon as an aircraft comes under Air Commando conditions, in other words, they are called up for service as are other personnel, this proviso in Clause 11 comes into operation. I intimated then to the hon. Minister that when we reached the Committee Stage I would deal in some detail with this clause to see what protection the aeroclubs would have in relation to their aircraft and personnel, because the proviso says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the Government or any person in the service of the State shall not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any bodily injury, loss of life or loss of or damage to property or livestock&#x2026;</block>

<p>Will the hon. Minister tell us at what stage these people will cease to be flying as private fliers? If they go on Air Commando at what stage do they stop being aircraft flying privately and at what stage do they stop flying under civil aviation regulations, and come under South African Air Force regulations? I pointed out that the whole of their insurance, both as to life, injury and aircraft, would be covered by insurance companies only while they are under Civil Air Board regulations. In other words, if they break the regulations and crash and someone is killed, that pilot, who is the servant of the company concerned, breaks the regulations and they will not pay out. Having been chairman of an aeroclub, and also chairman of a private flying company, I know a little about this side of things and how very careful you have to be on that side. We trained people for the Air Force before the last war but we did that on a so-much-per-hour basis. But the moment our aircraft were taken over by the Defence Force, from the time they took off from our aerodrome (they took over some five aircraft of ours with our whole personnel, ground staff, pilots, <span class="col_6793_6794" refersTo="page_0729"/>the lot), they came under the Defence Force. I want to know from the hon. Minister: Under the Air Commando system will they then fly as defence aircraft, or are they then still looked upon in view of this proviso as still flying privately, paid for at so much per hour? Then, of course, you will have to make provision for your refuelling, servicing and all the rest, but that could have a very big repercussion in relation to loss of life and injury. Mr. Chairman, people are going to be flown by these private aircraft, whether they are owned by private individuals, by commercial companies or aeroclubs. If a Defence Force officer in the course of duty, especially if he is called out for security purposes, and he is told to fly over certain positions low, because there is no airfield, and his engine gives out (most of our privately owned aircraft are single-engine aircraft), and there is a crash with loss of life, who is going to be responsible? The private insurance companies cannot carry the risk. I am sure they will not carry it, but what will be the position of officers of the Defence Force, other than those of the Air Commando, who may be flown, like gunner officers who want to look over the territory, and they fly low and a crash occurs? Perhaps in coming back and running out of fuel, especially with the tremendous wind-storms we get especially on the High Veld, they may have to force-land and crash, and not only is the aircraft damaged and life lost but you also damage valuable livestock. I cannot see how the Minister can say that the State will not be liable for any such damage to property or the injury suffered. I think that by now the Minister must have something in view on this point, because I think it is most important that that should be cleared up before any Air Commando is established, because on this will depend whether it will be a success or not.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot foresee that during the training of the Air Commando any flying contrary to the civil aviation regulations will be undertaken. As it is at the moment, the civil aviation regulations lay down that one should not fly below 500 feet, and they lay down various conditions in regard to cloud and visibility, and one cannot fly below 1,000 feet above built-up areas. I cannot see how, even used operationally, these aircraft can fly contrary to the civil aviation regulations. The hon. member is aware, too, that when there is an instructor with a pilot undertaking training he is allowed to fly below the altitude of 500 feet, if the aircraft is registered in the training category. If flying from an airfield licensed for night-flying, and again accompanied by an instructor, that is also allowed by the civil aviation regulations. I cannot see how an aircraft used in an Air Commando can be expected to operate in any role which entails going beyond the provisions of the civil aviation regulations. It is different, of course, if the aircraft is used in another role altogether, if it is used in a military role, which is not foreseen at the moment.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 11 very clearly provides that a special allowance will be paid to an officer of an Air Commando for the partial defrayment of the cost of his private flying. When Clause 10 was under discussion, the hon. Minister said that the remuneration was being paid to the pilot while he was doing private flying in his own time. Now Clause 11 provides exactly the same. It says that there will be defrayment of the cost of his private flying, provided that the Government will not be liable for any damage to life or property or livestock in connection with such private flying. I interpret this to mean that this amount of R6 an hour is being paid to the pilot while he is doing private flying and at the same time he is a member of the Air Commando. I cannot foresee how under any circumstances, even during the course of the 23 hours&#x2019; training, any pilot in the Air Commando can fly contrary to the civil regulations. I interpret this as not going beyond the regulations laid down by the Department of Transport, and I cannot see how it will in any way affect the insurance of an aircraft or the regulations under which it is flown.</p>

<p>As I see it, Clause 11, as well as Clause 10, are the two clauses on which the success of the Air Commandos will depend. If we encourage people to use their private aircraft, we will make a success of it, and we are just as anxious as the Minister is to see the Air Commandos become a success.</p>

<p>My point in rising is to ask the Minister this. The points raised by both the previous; speakers mainly concern what are teething troubles in the establishment of the Air Commandos. Provision is made in both this clause and Clause 10 for the allowances, etc., to be paid, to be decided in consultation between Secretary for Defence and the Treasury. I want to ask the Minister that when drawing up these allowances he should envisage these teething troubles and provide for them in his scale of allowances. Aircraft to-day are far too valuable for the ordinary private individual to allow his plane to be used in training for military service if he is going to be debarred from any compensation in case of an accident. The plane will be used under conditions which are not quite the same as those under which the pilot usually flies. I ask the Minister to give that fact careful attention, because if we are going to establish the Air Commandos we must be generous in compensating these people on whose support we must depend. The State cannot regard this use of their <span class="col_6795_6796" refersTo="page_0730"/>private planes as a bonus offering to the individuals concerned, and I ask the Minister and his advisers to give that aspect careful consideration, and, if anything, to err on the side of leniency rather than to be too parismonious. This is a new venture and we must break new ground if we want to make a success of it.</p>

<p>You will notice that we say there that the various labour organizations will be represented. It has been pointed out by the Department of Labour that this will make the board unduly clumsy, and hence this clause. All that happens now is that it is laid down in the law that employers and employees must be represented on the board, but it will depend on the Minister of Labour in consultation with the Minister of Defence who will be appointed and from which bodies, in order to represent the employers and the employees on that board. Consequently all bodies cannot claim representation on that board.</p>

<p>I wish to raise another point with the Minister, because I think it may avoid some difficulty in future in regard to a possible clash of interest between the Manpower Board and the Exemption Board. If the Minister looks at sub-paragraph (ii), it says that the Manpower Board may determine from time to time which categories or portions of categories of persons employed in or practising any particular profession, industry or trade should be exempted from military service. In other words, the board may determine that a group of apprentices in the engineering trade should be exempted. They may say that 50 per cent of them should be exempted, What will be the position of the exemption boards? Because exemption boards may receive applications from individual citizens for exemption from military service, and it will be more than likely that a number of these applications for exemption may fall in the category which is being exempted by the Manpower Board. The last thing we want is that decisions of the Manpower Board should be used as an escape route from the ballot. I think we must avoid that. If we apply the ballot system, all men must be equal in the draw, and no privileges should be granted. The only privileges which can be considered are the needs of the State. I think therefore it would be, a mistake that if you get certain applications made to the Exemption Board for exemptions which may also fall in the category exempted by the Manpower Board, the Exemption Board should not give those exemptions merely because they fall in the category exempted by the Manpower Board.</p>

I hope the Minister will bear this point in mind.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This amendment mainly relates to the legal provisions which apply to the appointment of auditors to co-operative societies and companies. Section 43 of the Co-operative Societies Act merely provides that a co-operative society shall at every annual general meeting appoint an auditor for the current financial year. The meeting may reappoint the same person or another person. So consequently the serving auditor is always uncertain whether he will be reappointed, particularly when he has fallen into disfavour with the manager of the co-operative or the members of the directorate for some reason. It is suspected that there have already been instances where co-operatives have replaced their serving auditors because the auditor concerned has reported unfavourably on some aspect, and this has reflected on the management of the co-operative. As the Act reads at present, it would be comparatively easy, with some degree of unilateral organization, to have a serving auditor replaced at an annual general meeting. The proposed amendment therefore provides that a resolution to replace a serving auditor will be invalid unless written notice thereof is given not later than on the last day of the financial year to the board of the society or company concerned, and the auditor as well as the members of the co-operative society have been informed thereof.</p>

<p>The Public Accountants and Auditors Act, 1951 (Act No. 51 of 1951) <i>inter alia</i> provides for the registration of public accountants and auditors and the Bill amends sub-section (1) of Section 43 of the Co-operative Societies Act to provide that a co-operative shall appoint an accountant and auditor who is registered under Act No. 51 of 1951 and is in public practice.</p>

<p>Save in the case of the first auditor of a co-operative society or where a casual vacancy arises, in which case an auditor may be appointed by the directors, it is proposed that an auditor of a co-operative society shall be appointed by the members of the co-operative society. The auditor acts as the watchdog of the members, and therefore it is desirable that the members should make the appointment.</p>

<p>To provide for instances where the members of the co-operative society or the directors thereof fail to appoint an auditor for some reason or other, it is provided in the Bill that such appointment may be made by the Registrar of Co-operative Societies. The procedure followed in the appointment or reappointment of an auditor of a co-operative is set forth more clearly in the proposed subsections (9) and (10). In terms of these subsections it is provided that the auditor concerned and the members of the co-operative society must be informed beforehand of the intention to appoint someone else as auditor of the society or company.</p>

<p>As regards the remuneration of the auditor, provision is made in the proposed sub-section (12) and this amends the existing sub-section (8) to this extent that it is provided that the remuneration shall be paid out of the funds of the society or company instead of out of the income as the relevant sub-section now reads. This is done with a view to greater clarity because as the Act reads now, the impression may be created that the remuneration of the auditor may only be paid if the cooperative society has earned an income.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment also obliges the auditor to forward to the Registrar of Cooperative Societies a copy of any report he drafts in the exercise of his official functions as auditor of the co-operative society. Under present circumstances the auditors sometimes hesitate to do so because some of them afraid it may offend the directorate or the management particularly when an interim report is submitted which, as the Act reads now, must be lodged with the Registrar by the Cooperative only at the end of the year.</p>

<p>In this Bill the specific right is now granted to an auditor to attend at his own expense any general meeting of a co-operative society and to make a statement at that meeting in relation to any books, documents, accounts or balance sheet he has examined or report he has submitted, or to make representations in connection with any matter affecting his appointment or his remuneration. As the position is now, an auditor of a co-operative society may attend the general meetings only at the invitation of the directors, and he may make only such statements and give such explanations as the chairman may call for; and in such cases the attendance is at the expense of the co-operative society.</p>

<p>If co-operative societies were to be compelled under all circumstances to bear the expense when an auditor attends a members&#x2019; meeting, it implies firstly that the auditor is placed under an obligation to attend such meetings, which may embarrass him if two or more co-operatives of which he is the auditor <span class="col_6799_6800" refersTo="page_0732"/>were to meet at the same time in different towns or localities. Furthermore it would subject the co-operatives which hold a series of meetings, that is to say, various meetings at different places on different days, to comparatively large extra liabilities in respect of the auditor when regard is had to the fact that sometimes as many as 20 or more such meetings are held and the auditor has to be remunerated at professional fees. Distant small co-operatives, for instance the non-White cooperatives in their own areas, may find it impossible to bear this additional liability.</p>

<p>Although it is intended to give the auditor every opportunity to enlighten or address the members, the problem arises that an auditor does not view the importance of his information in the same light as the members of the co-operative society, and members may hold the view that hearing the auditor further is a waste of time. Therefore it is indicated in sub-section (16) that the statement he wishes to make should be within the limits which members may determine at the meeting. It is not intended that the auditor&#x2019;s mouth should be shut, yet on the other hand it is a members&#x2019; meeting and members ought not to be deprived of their democratic right to control the meeting. The idea of restraining a possibly irresponsible auditor by means of adjournment of the meeting is not regarded as in the interests of the co-operative society. Since the Bill was read a first time, the Accountants&#x2019; and Auditors&#x2019; Council has proposed a small amendment to sub-clause (16), and I am prepared to move it at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the amendments contained in this Bill were drafted after consultation with the Co-operative Societies Council as the representative of agricultural co-operative societies, the Co-operative Societies Chamber as representative of commercial co-operative societies and the Council of Accountants and Auditors as representative of the auditors&#x2019; profession, and are intended to give greater protection to the auditor of a co-operative society or company, and to enable him to perform his functions more efficiently.</p>

<p>When amendments were made to the Cooperative Societies Act last year, representations were made from both sides of the House and also in the Other Place, that this safeguard should be introduced into the Act, to protect the auditors in such cases, and pursuant to those requests I am now introducing this amendment Bill.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House support this measure. We think it is a good measure; we think it is very necessary and that it will be much better that the auditor should be a little more independent. As the hon. the Minister has said already, he must never feel when he submits a report not altogether favourable to the directors, that there is any possibility that he may not be re-appointed. We think it is a very good thing that he should be more independent so that he may criticize whenever he thinks it is necessary to do so. The directors of co-operative societies are not always businessmen, and so it is a good thing that a watchful eye should be kept on them. We on this side are in full agreement with this legislation and we shall therefore support it.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>I think we welcome this Bill, generally speaking, because it eliminates some shortcomings in the Co-operative Societies Act. In the first place I welcome the provision that when other auditors are to be appointed, the members of such a co-operative shall nominate the new auditor before the last day of the financial year. It is frequently found that members propose a change of auditors, and then it occurs months after the end of the financial year, with the result that the auditors then are placed in an extremely difficult position when the old auditors have already been doing the audit of that co-operative society for months. This Bill now provides that a change of auditors may be proposed but that it shall be done before the last day of the financial year. I think that is an improvement and that it completely clears up the whole position. The appointment of auditors of course is intended to safeguard the interests of members.</p>

<p>There is only one difficulty I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s notice, and that is in connection with the remuneration of the auditor. It is provided now that the remuneration of the auditors should be fixed by the members. I think that is correct, because it will place the directors in a difficult position if they have to fix the remuneration of the auditor, but at the same time we know what happens at general meetings. One of the members may rise in the meeting and propose, quite injudiciously, without any idea how much work the audit involves, a certain amount as auditor&#x2019;s remuneration. The proposed amount may be too little or it may be too much, and therefore I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will consider providing that the fees shall be fixed by the general meeting on the recommendation of the board of directors, or that there shall be an appeal to the Registrar of Co-operative Societies who could then fix the fees whenever there is a dispute as to the amount. That will then be a way out when the fees, as proposed at the general meeting, are too much or too little. The hon. the Minister may perhaps tell me that if the fees are too low, the auditors simply will not accept it, but then the directors will be in the position that they cannot nominate other auditors. Therefore I should like to suggest that the Minister should consider making provision for a right of appeal to the Registrar so that an injudicious proposal adopted at a general meeting may be rectified. Furthermore, I think this Bill is necessary to protect the interests of the members, and to see to it that justice is done to them. As the Minister has already said, auditors will have the right to attend meetings and to make statements there. I have already said that it serves <span class="col_6801_6802" refersTo="page_0733"/>to protect members. I welcome the provision that they should do so at their own expense, for otherwise the directors are again placed in the difficult position that they have to approve the travelling expenses. So it is better that the auditor should attend meetings at his own expense. Mr. Chairman, we welcome this change in so far as it affects auditors. We think it is a good step in the right direction.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>There is one aspect of Clause 1 on which I would like clarification from the hon. the Minister. Sub-section 1 provides that the auditor who could be appointed must be one who is registered under the Public Accountants and Auditors Act. In other words, he is a professional auditor belonging to a professional organization and is recognized as such. But sub-section (3) provides that all appointments of auditors under this section shall be subject to the approval of the Registrar who may confirm or reject any such appointment without assigning any reason therefor. This seems to be a somewhat unusual provision. Here we are getting either (a) the directors for a short term or (b) the members themselves at an annual general meeting, appointing a professional man, a man whose status is recognized by virtue of membership of a professional society, and yet at the same time you say that the Registrar may reject that appointment if he so wishes. I do not know of any cases where the appointment of a qualified professional man is subject to the control of any Government Department or official. Compare the position here with the position under the Companies Act. Under the Companies Act there is no proviso that an auditor appointed at the general meeting of the company shall be subject to the approval of the Registrar of Companies. Here you are dealing with a profession, a very honourable profession, if I may say so, and I would like the Minister to tell us why he is providing in this clause for the Registrar to have the right to decide whether an auditor is acceptable or not.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) I should just like to tell him that if his request, namely, that members should not fix the fees of the auditors at the general meeting, were acceded to, it would to some extent frustrate the object of this amendment Bill. The fact of the matter is that when an auditor&#x2019;s fees are fixed, it will of course normally be on the recommendation of the board of Directors to the members&#x2019; meeting, but on the other hand it may very easily happen, when a board of directors cannot get along with an auditor, that they may fix his fees at such a low figure that the auditor will not be prepared to work for that fee. Then the same object is achieved which the Bill seeks to prevent. Of course, I am accepting that there will be mutual consultation between the directors and the members when there is good co-operation, and where these circumstances do not arise.</p>

<p>Now I come to the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin). The Registrar of Co-operative Societies of course has much greater control over co-operatives and a much greater obligation to co-operative societies than the ordinary Registrar of Companies has in respect of companies. The Registrar of Co-operative Societies has to see to it that the provisions of the Co-operative Societies Act are carried out, and there may be many other reasons, apart from his opinion that an auditor is incompetent, why he thinks that the auditor is not a suitable person or that he is not able to do the audit of that co-operative society. There may be various co-operatives who have the same auditor. The Registrar may be convinced that such an auditor will not be able to audit the books timeously. So the Registrar of Co-operative Societies must therefore retain the power to refuse, although he will seldom if ever exercise that power. But there also are instances where auditors of co-operatives have acted, and where it actually was found that the work was not done properly, and that other co-operatives then again wish to appoint those auditors. In such a case also the Registrar may use his discretion and say that he is not prepared to approve that auditor, because the balance sheet and the accounts must when all is said and done be lodged with him and he has to approve them. It is the most important reason for this provision.</p>

<p>Sixth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Marketing Amendment Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>As from 1 March last year a scheme was introduced in terms of the Marketing Act for the regulation of the marketing of fresh milk and fresh cream on the Witwatersrand and in Pretoria and Bloemfontein. A similar scheme which was already in operation in Cape Town was incorporated in this scheme.</p>

<p>The main object of this scheme was to achieve orderliness in the marketing of fresh milk and fresh cream in these four areas and to promote stability, and particularly price stability, in this branch of our agriculture. The scheme affects milk and cream destined for human consumption in that form, or for the manufacture of ice cream. It distinguishes between industrial milk used, e.g., for butter and cheese production, which is controlled in terms of the dairy scheme which falls under the control of the old, established Dairy Products Board, and fresh milk which is daily used by consumers in the cities, which is controlled in terms of the Milk Scheme by the Milk Board.</p>

<p><span class="col_6803_6804" refersTo="page_0734"/>The Milk Scheme also covers sterilized milk and cream and pasteurized milk and cream. Fresh milk is pasteurized on a large scale and sold as pasteurized milk. Because sterilized milk and cream may possibly be regarded as products different from fresh milk and fresh cream, the Act was amended last year, with retrospective effect, to provide that the words &#x201C;milk&#x201D; and &#x201C;cream&#x201D; also include sterilized milk and cream. Pasteurized milk was, however, regarded as still being synonymous with milk and no amendment was made to the Act to provide that milk and cream also include pasteurized milk and cream.</p>

<p>In the main the validity of the Milk Scheme was, however, attacked, <i>inter alia,</i> on the grounds that the scheme also had reference to pasteurized milk which, it was alleged, was no longer milk in its natural form. In view of the fact that the pasteurization of fresh milk is done on a very wide scale (in Pretoria, for example, practically 100 per cent of the milk is pasteurized), a fresh milk scheme must necessarily also apply to pasteurized milk. Consequently an amendment of the Marketing Act is proposed which will include pasteurized milk and cream in the words &#x201C;milk&#x201D; and &#x201C;cream&#x201D; respectively. The amendment is also made retrospective to 18 June 1951, the first date on which provisions were inserted in the Act specifically providing for fresh milk schemes. It is necessary, <i>inter alia,</i> to prevent the present Milk Scheme from possibly being declared invalid on the ground that it also refers to pasteurized milk.</p>

<p>Although sterilized milk has already been included in the Act with retrospective effect, the present Milk Scheme has also been attacked on the grounds that certain proclamations which have reference to the scheme were not affected by the legislation which was given retrospective effect. Consequently provision is now being made that it should be considered that all the relevant proclamations, notices and actions also refer to sterilized and pasteurized milk and cream.</p>

<p>Another matter for which provision is made in the Bill refers to the registration or producers. Hitherto the Milk Scheme has been applied by means of a system in terms of which all fresh milk producers and the distributors should be registered with the Milk Board before they may deliver or distribute milk in the controlled areas. The board runs a pool and the net proceeds of all sales are then distributed among the producers concerned.</p>

<p>In regard to the requirement that producers should first register with the board before they are allowed to distribute fresh milk or fresh cream in the controlled areas, the board must practically automatically grant applications for registration, because there is no provision in the Marketing Act in terms of which it can refuse to register a producer on the grounds e.g. that there is already a sufficient number of registered producers. The principle of limiting the number of primary producers (farmers) in any branch of agriculture is not as yet, contained in the Marketing Act, nor is it the intention to introduce it into that Act.</p>

<p>In practice, there is on the whole a fairly constant short-term demand for fresh milk. All supplies in excess of this quantity must be diverted into other channels, e.g. to cheese factories, condensed milk factories, etc., and at appreciably lower prices than those obtainable in the fresh milk market. At the moment producers can at any time of the year enter the industry, and that creates problems for the Milk Board in its attempts more effectively to regulate the distribution of milk. For this reason the Milk Board has made representations to me to clothe it with the powers, if necessary, to register producers only once a year. The board will then at least have greater certainty as to the quantities of milk which will be delivered during the year and will be able to regulate its sales programme more effectively than is the case when during the year new producers apply for registration every time it suits them.</p>

<p>After consultation with the National Marketing Council, I have decided to accede to the request of the Milk Board and to ask this House to approve this necessary provision in the Marketing Act. The proposed amendment which I am submitting to the House is that the Milk Board should be given the power, with my approval, to allow all applications for registration as producers to stand over for consideration on a date to be determined by the board. At least one such date should be fixed in each calendar year, and all applications on hand on that date must be considered. The board will therefore be able to withhold registration from a producer, who has applied for registration and qualifies for it, for a maximum period of 12 months.</p>

<p>The proposed power is aimed at promoting stability in the fresh milk industry. Its object is not to limit the number of people concerned in the fresh milk industry, but to ensure that they join in an orderly fashion and at specified times. It will assist in the marketing of fresh milk being done on an organized basis and in the best interests of the industry.</p>

<p>Then there is one further amendment which is proposed, namely that the scheme will be able to provide that only producers of the product concerned may be appointed as the representatives of producers in the control board concerned. This is also done in view of the litigation against the Milk Scheme. That scheme contains such a provision and it was attacked because it was alleged that it was illegal in view of the fact that the Marketing Act has no such provision. It was also alleged that this provision prevents a director or official of a company which is a producer from being appointed as a member of the board.</p>

<p>The object of the provision is clear, namely that only milk producers, and no other persons, may represent milk producers on the board. This is not a principle foreign to the Marketing Act, which already requires that nobody may be appointed to represent the producers <span class="col_6805_6806" refersTo="page_0735"/>of slaughter stock unless he is a <i>bona fide</i> farmer. The proposed provision will apply to any scheme, but is not obligatory as in the case of slaughter stock, seeing that it simply provides that a scheme may provide that only producers may be appointed as producers&#x2019; representatives. Where in practice this is not considered necessary, such a provision will not be included in the scheme. This proposed amendment is also made retrospective to 29 June 1956 the date on which the Cape Town Milk Scheme, which also contained such a provision, came into operation. It is particularly necessary to make the legislation retrospective, because the validity of the present Milk Scheme as a scheme was also attacked on this ground.</p>

<p>To sum up, it may be said that the proposed amendments are intended on the one hand to save the Milk Scheme from possibly being declared null and void by the court, and on the other hand to increase the efficacy of the scheme. It is a scheme in regard to which numerous producers have been exerting their energies over a long period and which hitherto has in general shown such good results that this scheme can be described as a successful institution for the promotion of the fresh milk industry in the areas concerned.</p>

<p>We greatly welcome this change. I speak on behalf of all the fresh milk producers when I say that this change is definitely an improvement. I want to say immediately that we producers are sick and tired because, every time the Minister has come with good intentions to protect the interests of the producers, of placing the production of fresh milk on a sound basis and of arranging the distribution thereof as well as possible for the benefit of both the producer and the consumer, the distributors have always come forward and prejudiced the case of the producer in the courts on the strength of technical legal points in order to promote their own interests. We have become sick and tired of that and I hope the hon. the Minister has now succeeded, through his legal advisers, to close once and for all every possible loophole through which these self-interest-seekers have crawled in the past. We as producers have suffered thousands of pounds damage. This measure which is an improvement on the existing Act is a guarantee that we shall realize the real price for our milk. I think the public ought to know this and I think this is the opportunity for stating it. There was a time before this scheme came into operation when the fresh milk producers, who worked under the old quota system, had to deliver milk under uncontrolled conditions, to the distributors on the market for which we received only surplus prices while that milk was sold at the full price. In that way we producers lost thousands and thousands of pounds. We have been struggling for practically 20 years for this scheme and our main enemies were those people who abused the fact that the producer could not accompany his milk to the market and could not himself supervise the weights and the fact that the producer could not determine, when he received a card in his can that 10 or 20 or 30 gallons milk was sour, whether that was so. We simply had to accept it. Where we have been struggling all these years to get such a scheme in order to place the marketing of our milk on a sound, and orderly basis those people have consistently opposed us. I think we have now reached the end of this court case story, the end of these self-interest-seekers. This scheme has brought about stability. Never before, I can almost say over the past two centuries, have the fresh milk producers in the Transvaal been as satisfied as they are to-day as far as the marketing of their product is concerned. We have stability to-day and we are at least being treated honestly. I must honestly say that there is a new spirit amongst the fresh milk producers&#x2014;and there are many of them. I think there are roundabout 1,000 or 1,200 fresh milk producers who deliver milk in the controlled areas of Johannesburg and Pretoria. This orderliness, this stability, this assurance of honest treatment, will result in our being able, as time goes by, to conduct our fresh milk production operations on a more scientific basis.</p>

On behalf of the fresh milk producers I wish to pay tribute to the hon. the Minister to-day for his determined attitude in coming forward with this amendment in order to protect our interests as well as the interests of the consumer.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>May I have the privilege of the half-hour please, Sir? I am participating in this debate particularly, because I believe the time has come when this Government, particularly this hon. Minister, have indicated, I think mainly for political and for propaganda purposes, that they are no longer prepared to accept as a fact what the Tomlinson Commission accepted, the Tomlinson Commission of which this hon. Minister was a member, that there would always be a large number of Natives permanently settled in our urban areas. The Tomlinson Commission estimated that by the year 2000, if everything possible and impossible which it had recommended, had been done, that figure would be round about 6,000,000 Natives. They would probably be increasing faster than the White population of the Republic of that time. The Minister accepted that when he was a member of that Commission. The Prime Minister, in his capacity as Minister of Native Affairs at that time, accepted that as well when he indicated in 1955 that the time-table which would satisfy him would be that in 50 years time there would be equal numbers of Europeans and Natives permanently settled outside the reserves. Of course the Natives permanently settled outside the reserves are probably growing in numbers as fast, if not faster, than the Whites, remain a thorn in the side of the party propagandists. It seems to me that they have now made up their minds that they are going to do away with them. They are going to do away with them physically in some cases and if not physically then by eviction in other cases. With the co-operation of this Minister they tackled that task. As I say, I believe it has been tackled chiefly because of their difficulty in meeting the propaganda which is made as a result of that acceptance and I believe it is being done for political and propaganda purposes. This Minister has tackled it both legislatively and administratively. It is tragic that it should be this Minister who is spearheading that movement because one feels with his experience and his background as a member of the Tomlinson Commission he ought to know a great deal better. It is for that reason, Sir, that I am going to move at this stage at once&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To reduce the amount by R5,000 from the item &#x201C;Minister, R11,500&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I know that I cannot speak of the legislation but I can speak of administrative action as to what the Minister is doing through his Department. I want to give just three examples of the sort of thing that is happening in pursuance of this fantasy that there are going to be no more Natives permanently settled outside of the reserves.</p>

<p>The first example I want to deal with is the projected removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. I am not quite sure who lays claim to the paternity of this idea, whether it is the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) and the hon. member for Mooresburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) or the hon. the Minister of his Deputy or perhaps the Prime Minister himself. Be that as it may, Sir, it would appear that the Western Cape has been singled out for special treatment, special treatment in terms of a decree whereby it would seem that all the Natives are to be removed from the Western Cape and are to be replaced ultimately by Coloured labour. What we are entitled to ask first of all is just what area is envisaged for this purpose? I have never seen it accurately defined. What is meant by the Western Cape? The hon. the Minister originally, and I quote from a speech he made in 1956, seemed to think the Western Cape was everything west of the great Kei River. Since then, probably as the difficulties involved made some impression, the line seems to have moved further west and the area involved has become a little smaller. We have never been clear as to whether Port Elizabeth is to be included or is to be excluded. It seems now possible that Port Elizabeth is to be excluded so the line must be further west of that. Of course, when the difficulties experienced by the Knysna industrialists have been brought to the attention of the Department perhaps it will even go further west than that, because timber-milling without Bantu labour is becoming a very real problem as industrialists in the George and Knysna areas will tell the Minister. I think it is quite clear that the duty of the hon. the Minister is clearly that he must tell us exactly where that line is going to run. He must tell us what he means when he speaks of the Western Cape. He must tell us exactly in what areas provision has to be made in accordance with this policy if it is ever to be carried out. I think he has also got to tell us just why this step is to be taken. Originally the idea was said to be that it would protect the Coloured people from Bantu competition in the field of labour. Then we had an original idea from the Minister&#x2019;s colleague, the hon. Minister of Community Development, who said it would help to prevent miscegenation between Coloureds and Natives. Now we hear other voices. Now we hear voices based on arguments that this is simply the one area to which the Native has never had any claim; this is the one area from which he must be excluded. It seems as though the whole foundation of their argument is fear and the hope that if the rest of South Africa is in trouble with the Native people then at least the Western Cape will be free. They seem to regard the Western Cape as the stronghold of White civilization which could be relied upon to hang out even if there was trouble in the rest of South Africa. That is the logical conclusion of their argument. I think the Minister knows I think the hon. the Prime Minister knows; I think most people with any commonsense know&#x2014;that the destiny of the Western Cape is bound up inextricably <span class="col_6809_6810" refersTo="page_0737"/>with the destiny of the rest of South Africa whether we happen to like it or not.</p>

<p>Why then this projected removal? Is it perhaps because it is intended to demonstrate to the rest of the country that full separate development is after all possible regardless of the consequences? You see, Sir, one fact does stand out and that is that this projected removal will be a test in microcosm as to whether the Minister&#x2019;s overall policy is a practical proposition. Already it has been said by industrialists and commercial men that the difficulties are so great that the only way to solve this problem is to postpone it. Now what are those difficulties and how is the Minister going to meet them? The first of those difficulties, I think, is that if this scheme is to be carried out it would be to attempt a sociological and economic revolution in fact; an attempt in fact to say that at least 140,000 Natives (65,000 men and 75,000 women) are to be moved from the areas in which they are at the present time. That is if we define the Western Cape as the greater Cape Peninsula. But if we take the Western Cape as the area west and southwest, including Humansdorp, then, according to research done at the Stellenbosch University, it seems that the figure would be 252,000 Bantu of whom 160,000 odd are men and 92,000 are women. It would seem that of those roughly 100.000 are in rural areas and 150,000 in urban areas. I mention those figures because by any standard this tremendous uprootal, even over a number of years, will decree that that number of people are no longer to make their living in their present occupations; no longer to live in the areas where many of them were born and that there is going to be attempted to set in reverse the process that integrated them into the economic life of the area in which they are at the present time and to re-employ them in areas which at the present time apparently have no attraction for them from the economic point of view. I believe they can only be re-employed in other areas, if at all, at extraordinary costs. I believe that at the present time there is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that employment can be created for them or that it will ever prove to be sound employment, economically speaking. They will have to be rehoused; they will have to be resettled; they will have to be established in the areas to which they are going to be moved. They have family ties; they have community bonds like anyone else here. Who knows. Sir, what future Berlin wall is going to divide members of the same family if this policy is carried out? Who knows what frustrations it is going to cause? I think we can rest assured that there will be human tragedies in plenty because when there has been a marriage between a Native and a Coloured some children over the age of 18 may be classified one way and some the other. We already know that hundreds of Natives&#x2014;the hon. the Minister is usually very proud of this&#x2014;have been endorsed out of the Peninsula and the Western Cape at the present time every month. They seem to be going to places where they have no hope of making a living. That is the information I have from the areas to which they are going. We know of the complaints of many of the people in the Eastern Province and Border areas about people coming there and squatting on the farms because they have been endorsed out of the western areas and have no employment to go to.</p>

<p>I do not attach too much importance to the Government&#x2019;s promises to provide work before the people are moved. I know the hon. the Minister of Finance, whom I am glad to see here, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Bantoe is nie sodanig uitgedwing nie maar hy moet ingesuig word in die Bantoegebiede en die Grens-gebiede.</block>

<p>I wonder what this means in costs; I wonder what it means in the artificial creation of jobs where natural economic forces have not created them already? I have been talking about costs so I want to give just one example of what it costs to create jobs for people. I want to look at the Swaziland position as reviewed in articles in <i>Optima</i> of March 1962. Swaziland, although a British High Commissioned Territory, is an instructive case in point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Over the past 20 years European entrepreneurs have invested some &#x00A3;40,000,000 in mining, timber, sugar and associated industrial products. These enterprises which do not include the opening up of the Bamboo Ridge iron-ore mine and the railway line to be built to export the ore, have given employment to some 15,000 African males.</block>

<p>That means an investment, Sir, of R5,400 for the creation of each job for each African male. Let me direct the attention of the hon. the Minister of what is happening in South Africa as a whole in respect of population trends. In 1920 the proportion of the non-White population living in the White cities was approximately 14 per cent. By 1960 it had risen to approximately 37 per cent. The sharpest increases were over the years 1940 to 1950 and from 1950 to 1960. If these trends continue there may well be as many as 45 per cent by the year 1970 in South Africa&#x2019;s so-called White cities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I say &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; because we call them White cities but in almost every case there are more Blacks in them than Whites. That is why I call them &#x201C;so-called&#x201D; White cities. At the same time there has been a very considerable drop in the number of males on the land in the reserves. It was believed to be about 40 per cent in 1920; the figure is now estimated by some to be as low as 3 per cent. I cannot vouch for that figure but I know it has been used on many occasions. How then does the hon.<span class="col_6811_6812" refersTo="page_0738"/>Minister of Finance hope, and clearly the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration hopes with him, that the Natives of the Western Cape will be sucked back into the reserves? Where is the work for them? We know that despite what has been happening in the first quarter of this year there was actually more recruiting in the Transkei for Natives for employment in the Western Cape than in either of the two previous years over the same period. The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) was recently chairman of a commission which reported that unemployment amongst the Native people amounted to over 500,000. By any standard that is a high percentage of the population. I do not quite see how with these problems this task can be tackled at the present time with any hope of success.</p>

<p>But then comes the second problem, the second difficulty. Perhaps the word &#x201C;difficulty&#x201D; is an understatement here. Who is going to do the work which the Bantu are doing at the present time in the Western Cape? In Cape Town and the immediately surrounding Boland areas there are something like 65,000 Bantu in employment; probably 35,000 are in industry, 2,000 in the docks, 2,000 in garages, 8.000 in shops and stores, 2,000 doing milk delivery, between 3,000 and 4,000 on the railways, about 1,500 in Government and provincial employ and about 11,000 in miscellaneous and unskilled labour. The Central Government employs roughly 5,000&#x2014;3,000 to 5,000 on the railways and 1,500 in Government and Provincial Departments. What are they doing to set an example? The hon. Minister of Transport squarely met his difficulties. He told these people that one of the troubles was that Natives earned higher wages here than in the rest of the country and that they did not want to be transferred elsewhere on the railways. He told us that he could not get Coloureds to do the sort of jobs which the Natives were doing. That is bearing out the finding of commerce and industry throughout this area who have been faced with those very difficulties. What is interesting, Sir, is that if the Government is having these difficulties then what about other industrialists and other employers? Above all, what about the farming community? The figure for them must be roundabout a 100,000 Natives in rural areas in this area. Where is their labour to come from? We know what is happening on the West Coast already. The hon. Minister is trying to persuade people there to get rid of their Native labour in their factories. Those factories are now competing with the farmers for labour. The wages they are paying are higher than those that the farmers can pay at present prices. What is the future going to hold out for the farming community in the Western Cape if we proceed with this policy? You see, Sir, it is all very well to talk of Coloureds replacing the Bantu. The best figure for Coloured unemployed in the area is between 3,000 and 4,000 to do the work of 65,000 Native males. I know there are many who say that the rate of increase in the case of the Coloured population is in fact so high that they will make up this number very quickly. If that is so all I can say is that manifestly the Coloured population has not kept pace up-to-date with the industrial expansion of the Western Cape. If, in the next few years it has not only got to keep pace with but to overtake that expansion, it can only happen if the industrial expansion is slower, proportionately speaking, than it has been over the last 20 years. This points only in one direction and that is that this policy is going to create uncertainties and problems which are steadily going to corrode the prosperity and the development and the well-being of the Western Cape. Added to that, Sir, is the undeniable fact that light industries will tend to move to areas where large bodies of labour with substantial spending power are concentrated. There seems very little likelihood of those being directed to the Western Cape under policies of this kind. This matter was raised by the Cape Chamber of Industries who thought it necessary to make a statement on the far-reaching economic implications. I want to refer to only two comments in that whole statement. The first was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The utilization of Natives in industry has indeed paved the way for higher level jobs being created for Coloureds. The Native labourer does not displace but promotes the Coloured industrial worker. If the Natives needed in Cape industries were withdrawn the Coloureds who would derive benefits from gainful employment in industries are bound to suffer as a result of the retarding effect on the industrial structure.</block>

<p>Indeed, that has been the picture throughout South Africa. Our modern White economy does not find it possible to advance without greater supplies of Black labour. I have no doubt, Sir, that if this policy is going to be carried out, it is going to have serious repercussions on the development of the Western Cape. One asks oneself why? I have no doubt, Sir, when all the commissions appointed by the hon. the Prime Minister and other Ministers have reported that we are going to find ourselves in the position that the Native, who until now has been permanently settled in the Western Cape, is going to have his permanency undermined and he will be removed but we will still be dependent on a large force of migrant Native labour because we cannot get on without them in this area. That brings me to the second comment of the Cape Chamber of Industries&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To continue to employ Natives but to treat them as though they should not be there is both illogical and short-sighted.</block>

<p>So much, Sir, of what this hon. Minister is doing is both illogical and short-sighted. He seems to a large extent to be oblivious of the state of affairs of the urban Native in South Africa. He does not seem to appreciate his <span class="col_6813_6814" refersTo="page_0739"/>frustrations; he does not seem to appreciate the hardships to which he is submitted as a result of the administration of the Minister. I wonder whether he noticed an article by Dr. Retief of the Department of Criminology of the University of South Africa? He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Amongst the Bantu there is no moral stigma attached to criminal convictions. Rather is an offence regarded as a justified reaction against an unjust measure while the consequent punishment is not regarded as a shame but as a kind of sacrifice for the sake of a better application of justice in the future.</block>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister seems to fail to realize that this drift from country to town is a world-wide phenomenon and it is a phenomenon which is lent impetus here because of the absolute poverty of the inhabitants of the reserve at the present time and because of their inability to support themselves on the economy of the reserves as it exists at the present time. I think the question we want to ask the Minister is whether he can afford to keep so large a section of our population in a position of uncertainty, in a position of impermanency where they are virtually regarded as having their homes elsewhere and their work here in our urban areas. I wonder whether the time has not come for him to consider certain changes in his administration, I realize, Sir, that I am in danger of being very near to pleading for legislation but I think the suggestions I am going to make, while of a pattern of changes for which I can plead on another occasion, do not require changes in legislation. I wonder whether the Minister should not consider the application of influx control not to individual urban areas but to large urban complexes so that there will be a greater opportunity of exchange of labour between jobs, of movement of labour from one job to another and a greater opportunity for families to find employment within the same area where they all have rights. It would certainly give greater mobility to labour in the event of the movement of factories. It will certainly give them a greater opportunity to find jobs of the kind they are seeking. To-day there is altogether too much difficulty in respect of the position of wives and male children over 18 years old. This whole pass system seems to be designed to be applicable to the lowest, the most poorly-qualified type of Native labour or employee. It is not a system, with all respect, that fits the educated, the advanced, the more civilized man. But he gets no bonus for being civilized; he gets no bonus for being a responsible member of society. I wonder whether the Minister should not consider once again the introduction of exemption passes to give a greater sense of stability to those classes of people? This feeling of impermanency amongst them is borne out only too fully when you look at the recent circular issued in respect of the rights of Native traders in the Bantu urban areas in our big industrial complexes. I know this matter has been discussed in this House before. But it seems to me that there are certain questions which the hon. the Minister should still answer us in this regard. The whole theory seems to be that it is the general, and therefore the over-riding policy, not to allow, without good reason, an increase in the number of Bantu residents in White areas who are not employees. Then it goes on to put all sorts of limitations upon them; it prevents them from carrying on more than one business in any area or in different areas; it prevents them from going in for businesses like drycleaners, garages and petrol filling stations, despite the fact that in one complex there are 25 square miles without Bantu-owned dry-cleaning businesses. The whole concept seems to be that those to whom trading rights have been allocated may in future be allowed no sense of permanency. They are not even allowed to erect their own buildings for the businesses they want to establish.</p>

<p>But I want to hurry on to my last example. My last example of the spirit of impermanency which is being created to-day is the use to-day of a policy of the establishment of border industries, to cover, as Professor Tomlinson and the Minister envisaged at the time the report was given out, those who would have to be removed from the land in agriculture in order to rehabilitate the soil and allow the farms to be built up; now it is also to cover the natural increase in the reserve; it is intended to cover those who are to be sent back from the other portions of South Africa to the reserves. And what a poor job has been made of it so far! Instead of sticking to the timetable of the Tomlinson Commission they have in ten years not found sufficient jobs for one-third of one year&#x2019;s quota. The reason is expense. The hon. the Minister knows it. Time does not allow me to take that further. The other reason is that we do not yet know where the boundaries of those Bantustans are going to be. Every representation to the hon. the Minister and his Department leads to new and more peculiar maps. One has been given some idea of what is happening in the Transkei. We still do not know about the Ciskei. What is happening in the Transvaal where 26 per cent of the land is going to be given away? What is happening in Natal where the figure is over 32 per cent?</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has apparently availed himself of this opportunity of trying to criticize the policy of the Minister and the present Government but he must remember that all the criticism which he has levelled today and on other occasions against this Government and more particularly against this Minister is noticed by us; at the same time we wonder what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself has to offer in the place of the policy which the Minister is now carrying out? Time will not allow me Sir, to deal with his last question, namely, where the boundaries are. I think the Minister and other members on this side have repeatedly replied to that. If we pose this counter-question: What will you do if we immediately accept the released areas as the boundaries for the future? Then they are as silent as the grave; we get no reply from them; then they are not prepared to say that they will accept those as the boundaries. It does not avail the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, therefore, to conclude his speech with that question because that has been answered repeatedly, whereas they are not prepared to reply to the question I have just asked. What is the reply to that question? There they sit, Sir, and they cannot answer it; they dare not answer it. But if they do not want to answer that question the hon. the Leader of the Opposition must not conclude his speech with that question because that is a question which does not apply as far as the policy of this Government is concerned, it refers to the 1936 Act. But they do not want to know anything about that. On the contrary, they are betraying their own past and their own careers and everything they have done under the 1936 Act.</p>

<p>Let me touch on a few of the questions raised by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the time at my disposal. I really did not expect the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, with his intelligence, to ask what the meaning was of the word &#x201C;terugsuig&#x201D; (suck back); the sucking back of the Bantu from the White areas to the Bantu homelands. He finds it a wonderful word and he wants to know what it means. Surely he ought to understand that when you talk about sucking back&#x2014;it is a mechanical term&#x2014;there has to be an opening; not, as the hon. member tried to make_ us believe, that there would not be an opening. The process of sucking can only take place when there is an opening, when there is emptiness. Only then can the process of sucking take place.</p>

<p>I hope hon. members will appreciate that the Leader of the Opposition had half an hour but that I only have a few minutes and in those few minutes I want to deal with a few of the points raised by him. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition should remember that whereas it is the policy of the present Government to suck back to their homelands all the Bantu who are resident in the White areas that is a policy which will stretch over years. When we say that we realize that there will be Bantu in the White areas for a considerable time to perform the necessary labour. What do hon. members opposite insist on? They insist upon our creating an additional attraction for the Bantu in the White areas. You must, for example, allow them to own property in the heart of the White area. That is an additional attraction to draw the Bantu from their homelands to the White man&#x2019;s country. That is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is doing and that is what he is actually suggesting in his race federation policy which we have often discussed. Having created that additional attraction he pleads for the abolition of job reservation. What does that mean? If you have to abolish job reservation, with its consequences as envisaged by the hon. gentlemen in his race federation policy, what will be the result? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition concluded his speech in the no confidence motion with the clear statement that it did not only mean representation in Parliament but also in the administration of the country. That means that on a federal basis you will have to have at least three Bantu for every White man in offices. [Laughter.] The hon. member for Yeoville laughs, but hon. gentlemen, do not know what they are talking about. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the administration of the country not only about representation in Parliament. If you want to apply race federation in the administration as well what else does it mean than three Bantu to every White man in the administrative offices, three Bantu to every White man in the police offices, three Bantu to every White man in the Defence Force, if you carry it through to its logical conclusion?</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated it clearly. He did not say only in Parliament but in administrative capacities as well. What does that mean? The hon. gentleman should not use words to which he wants to attach another meaning to-morrow or the day after when those words get him into difficulty. What does race federation in administrative capacities mean other than the position as outlined by me? What else can it mean? Or you must really be talking with your tongue in your cheek. Did the hon. the Leader of the Opposition speak with his tongue in his cheek when he said that or not? When the Leader of the Opposition criticizes the Minister by saying that the process should be hastened, namely, that there should be an additional attraction to draw even more Bantu to the White areas contrary to our policy, and that, over and above that, you must create openings in your administration, in your Police Force and in your Defence Force and <span class="col_6817_6818" refersTo="page_0741"/>in your trades as such, I say that is proof positive that the Leader of the Opposition is prepared with that policy of his to hand the whole of South Africa over to the Black man. Because if you want to be honest with the Black man and you promise him all those things as they have been promised to him under the race federation plan of the Leader of the Opposition, it can lead to nothing else, if it is carried out honestly, but that you must give them <i>pro rata</i> representation in the administration, in all the key positions, in all trades, in the army, and in the Police Force. Otherwise you are not being honest. You cannot shield behind the so-called high qualification for the franchise because the Leader of the Opposition says that job reservation must be abolished. What does that mean? That means that the trades will not remain in the hands of the White man at all. And when you have to hand over your trades in South Africa, apart from your administrative position, apart from your police and your civil service, to the Bantu, you may perhaps temporarily, by giving them an unfair form of federation, have minority representation here but when you deal with hard economic facts and you promise the Bantu that job reservation will be abolished and you tell him that he can now work in the mines, that the lathe is there for him to operate and that all the trades are open to him as they are for the White man, he will do to the White man what he did to the Coloured here in the Cape Province, here in the Cape Peninsula, where he has ousted all the Coloureds from their work.

<p>Since we last discussed this hon. Minister&#x2019;s Vote a year ago, we have heard a lot of this suction process, sucking the Natives out of the White Republic to the Bantustans. But we have also had some facts, facts which have become available, facts as revealed by the census, which show that if there has been a suction, it has been a suction in reverse. The suction that has taken place is away from the Bantustan areas to the White areas. I should like to give the hon. member for Krugersdorp some figures to show that his suction is going wrong, that it is not operating in the direction he wants it to operate. If we look at the 1960 census, we see that the number of Bantu in our urban areas has increased from 1951 to 1960 from 2,300,000 to 3,400,000, in other words, 1,100.000 under the so-called apartheid Government have been sucked into the White area, into the White cities. That is the suction that has taken place. And if we also look at the Metropolitan area, and we take the Witwatersrand where the hon. member himself comes from, we find that in the same period the number of Bantu have increased by 276,000 and the number of Whites by 112,000. Is that going to keep our cities White? Is that how it is going to happen under apartheid? Is that how we are sending the Natives back from the White area to the Black areas? Mr. Chairman, in the same period in which the Native population in our urban areas increased by 1,100,000, the Whites have increased by 500,000. And then we hear day after day that apartheid will keep the Republic White! But the Natives are increasing twice as fast as the Whites under apartheid. And what are these Bantu doing who came to the cities? I suggest to the hon. member that he should go and read this report on Bantu industry divisions, age groups and age occupation groups to see what has happened to these Bantu who have gone to our big cities. You find that comparatively speaking the most rapid increase has been in our industries, the most vital part of future economic development; the future generator and governor of our economic development is industrial development. What is happening? The number of Natives in industry has increased in this period by nearly 100,000, from 227,000 to 320,000. In commerce in the same period they have increased from 100,000 to 157,000. If we look at the proportions, we see that the Bantu in industry have increased by 41 per cent and the Whites by 26 per cent. That is what is happening. The suction that is taking place is that the White economy is sucking the Natives from the rural areas and from the Bantustans to the big cities.</p>

<p>Are these millions of Natives in our cities temporary sojourners as the whole policy of the Minister implies? The whole policy of apartheid is based on that, that they are temporary sojourners. Let us look at some of the facts. The Minister will recollect that eight or nine years ago, he signed a report, the famous Tomlinson Report. Let us see what the Tomlinson Report says about how temporary or permanent the Natives are in those urban areas. On page 28, paragraph 24, the Tomlinson Commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When it is desired to determine how many of the Bantu are already &#x201C;permanently&#x201D; settled in the towns and cities, we are confronted with the problem that the interpretation of the term &#x201C;permanent&#x201D; presents many difficulties in itself and that probably a number of degrees of &#x201C;permanency&#x201D; can be distinguished. Various methods have been applied to determine the extent of the established Bantu urban population. The conclusion has been drawn that there may have been a minimum of 1,036,000 and a maximum of 1,618,000 of such Bantu in 1951, and that the actual number cannot differ very much from 1,500,000.</block>

<p>So we find that the Minister himself accepted in 1954 that out of a total Bantu population of 2,300,000 in the cities no less than 1,500,000 could be regarded as permanent. Now his whole policy is based on the supposition that these people are not permanent. And that was not only the finding of the Minister. More recently, last year, we had a finding by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. They made a sample survey on the Witwatersrand. What did they find? They found on the sample that they took there, excluding mine <span class="col_6819_6820" refersTo="page_0742"/>Natives, that at least 50 per cent of the Natives on the Witwatersrand could be regarded as permanently urbanized, and they further found that 70 per cent never resorted to rural work and never reverted to rural work again. They found that only 10 per cent were really migrant workers. Despite these facts, we find that the Minister&#x2019;s policies are developing more and more towards the basis that all the Natives in our big cities are so-called migrant workers, and that they can have no permanent rights of any sort at all! What a fiction!</p>

<p>Unfortunately facts seem to make no impression upon hon. members there and so we have to keep on repeating them. Because despite these facts, the hon. Minister bases his policy on the illusion that these people are not permanently there. The whole policy of the Government is based on the presumption that these Africans in our big cities are citizens-to-be of states-to-be. They do not regard them as what they are in reality, namely people living permanently in our big cities. And what has happened between 1950 and 1960 will happen between 1960 and 1970, and I will tell the hon. Minister why. He knows as well as I do that all economic growth is dependent on capital formation and having people of the ability and skill to put that capital to economic investment and economic production. What is the position in South Africa? The Minister knows as well as I do that at present our capital formation is of the order of R1,1000,000,000 a year; he knows as well as I do that all that capital formation is in the hands of the White people, and that only a fraction, probably not more than R20,000,000, is in the hands of the Bantu. In other words, the White man will control for generations to come here where the economic development will take place, and surely the White man is going to see to it that the economic development takes place in so-called White areas. He is not going to go to the Bantu areas. But as I have said before, economic development is not only dependent on capital, it is also dependent on human resources. To have economic development one must have skilled people, technically skilled to expand industries, to establish new industries. Now it is very difficult of course to make an assessment of what the relative skills of the Bantu are and of the Whites are in this respect, but there is surely one test&#x2014;if the Minister has a better one, he can tell me&#x2014; and that is to see how many of the different population groups are at the universities. What do we find if we look at that? We find in our universities in South Africa 40,000 White students. By contrast, in the Minister&#x2019;s Bantu colleges there are at present some 500 students, and if we include the Native students in all the other universities, very largely the University of South Africa, we find that altogether there are probably about 1,800 Natives at the universities to-day in South Africa compared with 40,000 Whites. Surely the Minister will see from that too that economic leadership for generations to come must remain in the hands of the White people. That makes it inevitable that the economic development must take place in the White areas, because economic leadership is in the hands of the White people and capital is in the hands of the White people very largely. Therefore despite all the wishful thinking on the other side of the House, the development that we have seen between 1950 and 1960 will continue between 1960 and 1970 and will continue between 1970 and 1980.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>For generations our economy has been such that the Bantu have come to the urban areas. The hon. member for Jeppes is very surprised that that process has not been reversed in the short period of 15 years. If you travel at 100 miles per hour you first have to stop your car before you can put it into reverse gear otherwise you ruin your whole car. Where things have been bungled for all these generations he cannot expect the Government to put them right within the space of 15 years. We are, however, well on the way. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has moved that the Minister&#x2019;s salary be reduced by R5,000. Mr. Chairman, had the Rules of the House allowed it I would not only have moved the total reduction of the salary of the Leader of the Opposition but I would have moved that he be fined for his reckless attitude towards the White man in South Africa. He has referred to the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. I do not know why he is so surprised at that because the policy is not only to remove the Bantu from the Western Cape but eventually from the entire White part of the Republic of South Africa. He spoke about the &#x201C;human tragedies&#x201D; that would occur. Of course there will be cases of hardship. Throughout the world, particularly in a community such as ours, you find cases of &#x201C;human tragedies&#x201D;. But we have to choose between those &#x201C;human tragedies&#x201D; and the &#x201C;human tragedies&#x201D; which are beginning to develop as far as the White people in the rest of Africa are concerned. What about the tragedy of the White man in Kenya? What about the tragedy of the White man in Northern Rhodesia? And what, if they get their way, about the tragedy of the White man in Southern Rhodesia? But they do not take that into consideration. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to apply precisely the same policy which destroyed the White man in the rest of Africa and I shall prove that to him. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition joked about what the Minister of Finance said that there had to be suction power in the Bantu homelands. He asks what will it cost? What will it cost to erect those factories; what will it cost to bring about that development there? What did the suction power cost to suck the Bantu to the cities? What did it cost? Did anybody ask what it would cost at that time? This whole cost argument is the biggest lot of nonsense in the <span class="col_6821_6822" refersTo="page_0743"/>world, Sir. What did it cost to develop our country? What did it cost to develop Cape Town? What did it cost to develop the Railways? Had we asked that question 100 years ago and had we not gone forward, had the Voortrekkers asked what it would cost to do all those things and what it would cost to build the railways, nothing would have happened. But you start your development and development leads to development, riches lead to riches, and there are areas which will have to develop as the rest of South Africa has developed and they will have to go through exactly the same process. To stare yourself blind against the costs is not only to be shortsighted but it indicates that you do not realize at all what is happening in the country and it indicates that you do not realize at all what is happening economically in South Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked who was supposed to do the work of the Bantu to be removed from the Western Cape. In the first place he wants to create the impression that those people are going to be taken by the scruff of their necks and sent back to the Transkei and other areas in their thousands. This process will take place in an orderly manner. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration gave the assurance that the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape, as from the rest of the White Republic, would take place in an orderly manner without it doing any damage to the economy of the country, without it doing any damage to the economy of the Western Cape.</p>

<p>Yes and if the hon. member followed the example of Carel de Wet he would be of some value. Who does the work? We shall simply have to choose in our country. It is going to be a slow and difficult process; it is going to be a long process of adaptation. We shall, however, have to face the fact that we shall have to do our own work. The fact that the English have to do their own work has not harmed them in the least and it has not harmed the Italians in the least. What does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition want? I want to rub it in because the time has arrived for us to examine the alternative closely. What is his alternative? Give the industries in the Western Cape&#x2014;let us confine ourselves to the Western Cape&#x2014; give agriculture in the Western Cape as much Black labour as they want to have. But he goes further. He says that apart from the political consequences, we should give as much Black labour to the industries in the Western Cape as they want. Then he goes further and he says: &#x201C;Do not only give them Black labour but let the wives and children of that Black labour come here as well.&#x201D; Will he deny that? They are the people who object to migrant labour. His pattern for the Western Cape is as follows: Flood it with Black labour as much as you can. Give them all the labour they require, all the Black labour they want to have and let the wives and children come as well. That is their policy for the whole of South Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is not in the least concerned about what the political consequences of that will be to South Africa. His entire pattern is just this: Let us make money and be merry, let us go Black, let Cape Town go as Black as it can, to-morrow we die and it does not matter what the political consequences are. As the hon. member for Krugersdorp has said, he is pleading for the abolition of job reservation. In other words White labour should compete with Black labour in the open market. Destroy the White labourer&#x2019;s position. Destroy the Coloured labourer&#x2019;s position. As long as you can attract cheap labour, do so; bring in the Blacks in their millions, irrespective of the consequences. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition deny that that is his policy? That is the alternative. Then he goes further and he refuses to face up to the political consequences. He makes it very clear, however, that in principle he has no objection to granting political rights to an increasing extent to those people and he has no objection in principle to giving them representation in this House through their own people. I accuse the Leader of the Opposition of this that it is inherent in his policy that Black people must sit in this Parliament. He cannot get away from that because he says they should have eight White representatives: &#x201C;But if the pressure gets stronger I am quite prepared to consider giving them Black representation.&#x201D; In that case he will hold a referendum on the matter. But he lacks the courage to tell us what his attitude will be. Not one of them has the courage to tell us what their attitude will be. As the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark has explained if you think about holding a referendum you are thinking of the possibility of getting Black people here. That is why he is in reality saying that it is his policy ultimately to have Black people in this House. And then? Where is it going to stop? Are you going to stop where Southern Rhodesia is trying to stop and cannot? Are you going to stop where Northern Rhodesia has stopped? There is no difference whatsoever between his policy and the policy of Sir Edgar Whitehead in Southern Rhodesia.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has started the old stupid story that under a United Party Government the country will go all Black. We have just had it from the Leader of the Opposition that despite the Nationalists coming into power in 1948, the rate at which the Bantu have streamed to the cities has been as fast as ever before. In the period in which the hon. member was in the United Party, from 1940 to 1950, the number of Natives in our cities increased between 6 per cent and 7 per cent per year and since he has joined the Nationalist Party there has been no difference at all. The hon. member says we always talk about the cost of establishing and developing the Bantustans, and he asked what the cost was of developing our White economy in the Republic. We have told him already that it is R1,000,000,000 a year, but that happens to be capital formed by the Whites. Does he now imply that the Government will take more than half of that away and invest it in the Bantu states? Where else will it come from? The Minister must realize that if his Bantustan policy is to be practicable, the scale of economic development and its rate will have to be bigger in the Black areas than in the White Republic, for the simple reason that the increase in the number of Natives is far faster than in the case of the Whites, yet all the capital and technical skills are in the hands of the Whites. By 1970 we will find that the rate of increase was just as fast as it was in 1950 or 1960. Despite this rapid flow of Bantu into the White areas and the vast build-up of the Native labour force, we find from the latest census reports that even this rapid growth in the White economy has not been fast enough to provide employment for all the Bantu because we find in Report No. 5 of the Population Census for 1960 that the number of Bantu unemployed between 1951 and 1960 increased from 118,000 to 334,000. It nearly trebled. Now the hon. member says they must all find work in the Bantustans, but there is not even enough work for them in the White areas, so how can they find it in the Black areas? Is it not highly irresponsible for Ministers to run round to-day, when unemployment is so serious amongst the Bantu, and urge people to get rid of their Bantu servants? But we find from the same census report that the number of Bantu women who are unemployed has increased from 6,000 in 1951 to 132,000 in 1960. But this is now the time for Ministers to run around and tell people that they must not employ Bantu. Surely the Minister is irresponsible. This is the time to tell people to employ them, and what is more, the Minister should have a policy for dealing with this position. The census shows that unemployment amongst the Bantu has trebled between 1951 and 1960. I hope the Minister will tell us whether he has any schemes in mind for providing large-scale employment for Bantu in public works. Surely it should be possible to build public roads and sportsfields, and he should have special camps to train adolescents who are unemployed. No, this idea of telling the White people at this stage not to employ Bantu servants is not only irresponsible but stupid, because the whole basis of our economy is the specialization of labour. If the Minister can do his job efficiently, he should specialize in that, and if another man can wash cups and floors he should specialize in that. If the Minister is a better cup-washer than a Minister, then he had better resign as Minister. The fact of the matter is that it is irresponsible at this stage to urge people to get rid of their Native servants, because there is already unemployment. We should try to create employment, and I hope the Minister will tell us what schemes he has in mind to combat this growing unemployment. Surely the trebling of unemployment in nine years is very serious, and it shows the complete impracticability of the Bantustan policy. Where will people find work if they cannot find it in the White economy, in an integrated economy, and under the economic leadership of the White man? There are simply not enough jobs being created for the Bantu. Surely the Minister does not want to turn South Africa into a country of unemployed people. The simple fact of the matter is that even with the most rapid economic development and an integrated economy, we cannot create enough jobs for the Bantu because they are increasing fantastically fast. If the Minister looks at the increase between 1951 and 1960, he will find that they increased by 27 per cent or 3 per cent a year. In our whole economy the unskilled people are increasing much faster than the skilled people. We are not even creating enough jobs in an integrated economy, and surely it is folly to create two economies. The Government has so many plans. They try to plan almost every human activity, but has the Minister ever thought of working out a family limitation policy for the Bantu? It seems to me that that is the only answer, the way things are going to-day, not only with the Bantu but also with the other races. Surely the Minister should seriously consider that for many years the Bantustans will be undeveloped areas, and in all undeveloped areas in the world the people are being urged to limit their families. Has the Minister done anything about that? I should like to hear it, because that would be far more practical than many of the schemes the Government has.</p>

<p>The speech which the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) has just made is one which he has probably made on six previous occasions in this House. He reminds me very much of an old gramophone record. He comes along over and over again with the same figures. In the speech which he <span class="col_6825_6826" refersTo="page_0745"/>made here last year I can show him precisely the same figures which he mentioned here this afternoon, but he simply refuses to learn and to understand what is really going on. He thinks that he makes an impression by mentioning a number of figures, but he makes no impression.</p>

<p>He says that the census proves that over these ten years there has been an increase of 1,100,000 iii the number of Bantu iii the White cities. That is correct, but he does not tell us that the same statistics indicate that there has been an increase of 42 per cent in the number of Bantu in the Native areas. That is one factor which he never mentions. Does he want us to put a stop to this growth and introduce birth control?</p>

<p>Now we come to the next point. He talks about the &#x201C;rapid increase in our industries&#x201D; and he mentions an increase of 100,000 in the number of people employed in industries on the Rand alone. That is true, and we do not deny it; but has the number of industries not increased? Are we not experiencing an enormous industrial expansion in South Africa, an expansion which is unprecedented in the history of the world?</p>

<p>Are we to stop the whole industrial machine and refuse to allow Bantu who want employment to come and work here? They do not remain here permanently because they remain migrant labourers. Does the hon. member think that he proves anything by mentioning these figures? He proves nothing. He also came here with the story about the Tomlinson Report, but he did not quote that report fully because the report goes very much further and says that there are some people who contend that this is something permanent while others say it is not, and they then lay down a yardstick to test whether it is permanent or not. But the hon. member only quoted the report half-way. He talks about a capital investment of R1,000,000,000 per annum which is being made in the White areas, and he says that this cannot take place in the Bantu areas, but in saying that he overlooks the fact that border industries are being established. He has not told us how much capital is going to be invested in border industries in which employment will be given to the Bantu. He creates the impression that this whole investment is being made in the interests of the Whites only, but it is also being made in the interests of the Bantu in the border industries.</p>

<p>Then we come to the question of the boundaries which the Leader of the Opposition raised here. This is not the first time that he has come along with this story about the boundaries; this is probably the seventh time that he has grumbled here about the boundaries. It seems to me that he shows great ignorance in raising this question of the boundaries of the Bantu areas here time after time. There are various members of his own party here who serve on the Bantu Affairs Select Committee. They know that every year on that committee they have to go into a whole series of proclamations in which certain areas are proclaimed, and yet they do not know that in those proclamations the boundaries of every Bantu authority, whether it be a tribal authority or a territorial authority or a regional authority, are laid down in specific terms. I can only infer that those members of the committee are not doing their work because they do not seem to have enlightened the United Party in this connection. The boundaries of those authorities are laid down from beacon to beacon in these proclamations. But that does not mean to say that the Trust areas have not been demarcated as well. Which areas are Bantu areas to-day? They are the scheduled areas and the released areas. If hon. members opposite still stand by the 1936 Act they will know that these scheduled and released areas are still short of the quota which was laid down in 1936 and that additional land still has to be bought. Do they still stand by the 1936 Act? If they still stand by it, then they cannot hold it against us if we purchase additional land.</p>

<p>They now come along with the story that they do not want to purchase land for Bantustans. What is a Bantu area? Because they have now suddenly given the Bantu areas a different name, &#x201C;Bantustan&#x201D;, they refuse to carry out their word of honour. After all, a Bantustan or Bantu area is the area occupied by the Bantu. No, that story holds no water. It is dishonest and it is political fraud on their part. If they stand by the 1936 Act but say that they are not going to purchase land for Bantustans, then they are committing nothing but fraud. Under the 1936 Act we are obliged to purchase that land for the Bantu, and this side of the House adopts the attitude that we are going to purchase the full quota of land, not a morgen more and not a morgen less. That is what the Government has always said, and that is what it is doing. It is nonsense to grumble about boundaries. It is true that we cannot determine in advance where the boundaries are going to be; we still do not know where we can purchase the additional land because in buying land we must also take the Whites into consideration. Hon. members opposite know that if the 1936 Act is implemented we cannot say at this stage where the boundaries will be for all time to come. Moreover, it is foolish to talk at this stage about laying down for all time to come the boundaries of the Bantu areas and the boundaries of the White area. We are trying to consolidate the Bantu areas as much as possible so as not to have one piece here and another piece there. It is very unfortunate that the Beaumont Commission in 1913 did not tackle this matter very systematically; it released pieces of land all over the place, which was not the best way to tackle <span class="col_6827_6828" refersTo="page_0746"/>this matter. We are trying now to consolidate those pieces of land but it is a lengthy process. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I do not think I have ever seen the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) in so much trouble. They are running as fast as they can from the implications of Bantustans and the boundaries. The hon. member spent some considerable time dealing with boundaries, and what has he said? He said that the boundaries are proclaimed and that we have scheduled and released areas, and the favourite reply of Government members when they are questioned in the country as to where the boundaries are to be is: Refer to the scheduled and the released areas. The hon. member knows that the released areas do not mean a thing when it comes to buying land for Bantu purposes. If they want to establish a Bantustan, they are not worried about the released areas. If they think that there is a suitable area to establish an industry on the border and there is no reserve alongside, what do they do? They move the boundaries of the reserves to that spot.</p>

<p>Yes, but the boundary may be shifted at any time. The hon. member for Heilbron says that in terms of the 1936 Act we have to buy additional land because there is not enough land in the released areas. What we want to know is where they will buy that /and? He himself admits that they go beyond the released areas, and we want to know where they are going to buy it. Because when the 1936 Act was passed there was no idea of establishing free Bantu states. The hon. member asks whether we are prepared to stand by the 1936 Act. He knows what our differences are with the Progressive Party on that point, and that we passed a resolution at our Union Congress because we are not going to buy land for independent Bantustans, although we are not opposed to buying land for Bantu occupation, provided it is not bought to become a separate independent state. And the Government is not only having trouble with the White people about the boundaries; they are already having trouble with the new Government of the Transkei. The Transkeian Territorial Authorities passed a resolution asking the Government to buy land for the Transkei, and the reply was given to them &#x201C;that the only &#x2018;motification that the Transkei can produce for getting additional land was the rapid growth of the Bantu population in the Transkei, but the population of the whole world was increasing rapidly whilst the land remained the same, and it is obvious that no country or nation can claim additional land merely because their population increases&#x201D;. They went on to say that the districts referred to by the Transkeian Territorial Authority i.e., Maclear and Elliot and certain parts of Matatiele and Mount Fletcher, are already fully populated and the mere annexation of such populated land to the Transkei would therefore not solve this problem. They went on to point out that better soil conservation and farming methods should be applied. And &#x201C;in terms of its policy the Government is precluded from acquiring White-owned land outside the scheduled and released areas, unless all bodies representing White interests in the area concerned recommend accordingly; White-owned land in those areas is being bought by the Government as Parliament makes funds available&#x201D;. Referring to the question of White-owned farms in Matatiele and Mount Fletcher, the Department pointed out that these farms were situated outside the scheduled and released areas and said that the Government could not acquire this land without a recommendation from all bodies representing White interests in the district. I want to ask the hon. member for Heilbron this: If the Government cannot buy land outside the released areas unless it gets the approval of all the White interests, how will the Government get that extra land?</p>

<p>How is this Government going to comply with the 1936 Act. It is no use running away by telling us that the boundaries are fixed by proclamation and by the released and the scheduled areas. The hon. member knows that they have to find additional land for the Transkei. It is useless telling the Transkei people that they must house all their population there. They know it cannot be done unless industries are started there, and under Government policy industries cannot be started in the Transkei because White capital is needed to do it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) has pointed out that the Black population of the Republic has increased because of the industrial growth, and the hon. member for Heilbron said the rate of this growth was unknown in the history of the world. That, of course, is nonsense. The speed of industrial growth was much greater before the Nationalists came into power. [Interjections.] The Ministers are continually telling the country that we are on the brink of great industrial development, but we stay on the brink. But if there is to be industrial growth there will have to be more integration and more Bantu will have to come into the White industries. Even if the Government manages to establish sufficient border industries to absorb the increase in the Bantu population, we will still have integration because we will still have the Bantu working in White factories, across the border admittedly, but what is the difference between a Bantu working in a White industry in East London or one working in an industry in Cape Town? The problem the Government has is not the Bantu living in the reserves: it is the Bantu in the urban areas. [Interjections.] I am facing up to the fact that the problem is there and no matter what you do or how you</p>

<p>I am now quoting official figures from <i>Landbounuus,</i> but let us assume it is 24&#x00BD;c. In the meantime the Minister tells us that cheese became so scarce during this year that they had to import and the policy he and his Department are pursuing is <span class="col_6829_6830" refersTo="page_0747"/>talk you are not going to get rid of the Bantu population in the White areas. Ask the Minister what he knew when he wrote the Tomlinson Report? He himself pointed out that you could never get rid of the Black population in the cities, and nothing has happened yet to prove that this Government&#x2018;s policy can be carried out.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron says the hon. member for Jeppes makes the same speech every year. He does not make the same speech, but the same type of speech, although his facts are different, because every year the facts become worse and worse, and the facts he quoted to-day were only published on the 20th of this month. Every year the position gets worse and the White areas, so-called, become Blacker. I asked a question of the Minister the other day about the Bantu recruited on direct requisition from the Transkei for the Western Province. This is people directly coming to work, and not people who come back after their leave, and I find that for the first three months of 1963 the figure was almost three times as much as that for the whole of 1961.

<p>I want to discuss this question of the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. It is not only the Western Cape which is going to be affected by this problem but also the Eastern Cape, from which we get the bulk of our Bantu labour. The Eastern Cape will have to take those people back again. They will be sent back not to the White cities but to the reserves and the rural areas. One asks oneself immediately how those people who come here from that area for the very reason that they could not make an adequate living there, can possibly be sent back and what means of livelihood there is for them there. I was not surprised at all to read a little while ago, when a conference of the Cape Municipal Association was held in Kimberley, that a motion had been moved there by Mr. Robbie de Lange, the mayor of East London. We all know Mr. de Lange; he was a Nationalist Party candidate. Let me quote from the <i>Burger</i> of 24 April 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Great concern over the Bantu who are to be moved from the Western Cape to other areas was expressed here yesterday at the conference.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was pointing out that there are great disadvantages attached to the Government&#x2019;s policy to remove the Bantu from the Western Cape, disadvantages not only for this part of the province but also for that part of the province to which they will have to return, namely the Eastern Cape. I also referred to what had been said earlier this year at a Municipal Congress at Kimberley. The <i>Burger</i> of 24 April 1963 contained the following report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Great concern over the Bantu who are to be removed from the Western Cape to other areas was expressed here yesterday at the congress of the Cape Municipal Association. The mayor of East London, Mr. de Lange, stated that the infiltration of Bantu from other areas was becoming a more and more serious problem in the Eastern Cape. There were insufficient avenues of employment for the Bantu in these areas and this had aggravated the squatter&#x2019;s problems in the Eastern Cape in the Border areas.</block>

<p>But he went on to say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Drastic legislation had become necessary to control the infiltration of Bantu.</block>

<p>Sir, is it not strange that while the Government is removing the Bantu from the Western Cape, the people of the Eastern Cape are asking that legislation should be introduced to control the infiltration of Bantu. And this request comes from Nationalists! They are asking for legislation because they know that if the 250,000 Bantu men, women and children who live on this side of the Eiselen line have to be moved it is going to create additional problems for the people of the Eastern Cape. There are not enough factories in the Eastern Cape and there has not been sufficient development and economic progress to make it possible for the Eastern Cape to absorb those people. It is precisely because there has been insufficient development there that the Bantu have had to shift to the Western Cape. If these Bantu are going to be removed to the Eastern Cape on a large scale therefore, we are only going to create a bigger problem in the Eastern Cape because that area is incapable of absorbing so many people.</p>

<p>Over the years the people of the Western Cape have become accustomed to the idea that the Bantu migrate to this area to assist us with our economic development. We have provided them with housing and other amenities; in other words, we have accepted them as a permanent part of the population of the Western Cape.</p>

<p>It is an absolute historical fact that these people have come to the Western Cape during the past 25 to 30 years to help to develop this part of the country. I can produce one cutting after another from <i>Volkshandel,</i> from <i>Commercial Opinion,</i> from the <i>Burger</i> and the <i>Cape Times&#x2014;</i> as a matter of fact from every responsible paper in this country&#x2014;to prove that the Western Cape is very perturbed about the fact that it has always been the Cinderella of South Africa as far as economic development is concerned. A year or two ago businessmen held a congress at Saldanha Bay. What did they say there? The report reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Businessmen see bleak prospects for the Western Cape.</block>

<p>Whenever the Chambers of Commerce meet, whether it be at Paarl or at Worcester, they express their concern over the fact that they are not getting their legitimate share of the economic development of this country. The Government, however, proposes to remove the Bantu from the Western Cape in spite of the fact that it knows that the availability of labour is the main pillar on which economic development of any kind rests.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>We do not want any reduction in the numbers who have entered this area under Nationalist rule during the past 15 years! If the hon. member for Vereeniging is not concerned about the Western Cape, we in the Western Cape are. But what do we find? While businessmen and farmers are worried, we get a Nationalist M.P., like the hon. member for Malmesbury, who said in 1961 that the establishment of any new factory would be a crime against the Western Cape if that factory had to rely on Bantu labour. At the same time, however, these same members go from place to place and say that the Western Cape is not getting its legitimate share of the economic development of this country.</p>

<p>Hon. members on the other side must choose between on the one hand economic development and making available sufficient labour to the businessman, the industrialist and the farmer, and gradual retrogression on the other. Because if the necessary labour is not available, it is an indisputable fact that this part of the country will suffer economically. I want to quote as my witness none other than Professor Schumann, a prominent economist of this country and the pride of that side of the House. What does Professor Schumann say about economic progress and the availability of an adequate labour force? He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the volume of our manufacturing production is to increase by 150 per cent from 1955 to 1975, then probably at least 800,000 to 1,000,000 additional persons will be needed to make it possible. Without immigration no more than 400,000 Whites will become available during these 20 years in the whole of our labour market. It is difficult to say how much of this labour will be used in agriculture and in the mining industry and how many in tertiary industries such as transport and finance, but it is clear that there will be a further drop in the ratio of White to non-White employees in our manufacturing industries unless there is a considerable increase in immigration.</block>

<p>This is what Professor Schumann said in a radio talk which he gave in 1958. These are the facts of the situation, so much so that a year or two ago the farmers of the Winter Rainfall Area met in Stellenbosch and requested the Government to see to it that the Bantu who were indispensable there were not removed.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the two quotations read out by the hon. member, the first being the resolution which was allegedly passed by the Agricultural Union of the Winter Rainfall Region and the second being the letter which the hon. the Minister allegedly wrote to the chairman of the Milk Board. With regard to the relevant congress of the Agricultural Union of the Winter Rainfall Region, the hon. member put it this way that the congress had resolved to request the Government not to remove the &#x201C;indispensable Bantu&#x201D;. In point of fact the congress gave its support to the Government in connection with this policy. That is still the case to-day; they still support it, just as supporters of that side of the House are also helping the Government with the implementation of this policy. In any event, the congress in question specifically gave its support to the Government in this connection but added that where as the result of practical problems&#x2026; [Interjections.] They cannot all be removed simultaneously. The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) laughs. Coming from an hon. member who is an economist, that surprises me. The Government stated very specifically that it was going to remove the Bantu from the Western Cape gradually. In such a process of gradual removal&#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The same applies to the hon. member&#x2019;s reference to the letter which the hon. the Minister wrote to the chairman of the Milk Board; in other words, he sought to create an erroneous impression. Nowhere in that letter is it stated that the Bantu will not be removed from the Western Cape. As far as I can remember it was stated in that letter that the Government in implementing its policy would see to it that no inconvenience was caused to the milk producers, amongst others, as a result of the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape.</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the matter which is really under discussion here. We all know that it is the Government&#x2019;s policy gradually to replace the Bantu in the Western Cape and we all know that we have an alternative source of labour here that we can use to replace the Bantu. But hon. members opposite come along and fabricate all sorts of objections such as the danger of squatters&#x2019; problems in the Eastern Province and things of that kind. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) says that we are faced with a choice between industrial development in the Western Cape with the assistance of the Bantu on the one hand and retrogression without the Bantu on the other. That is how hon. members opposite view this matter. We on this side of the House, however, say that we are fully aware of the fact that if we wish to continue with this policy we are bound to come up against practical problems. But at the same time we say that we are prepared to face those problems and that we are prepared to devise the necessary plans to be able to implement that policy. In other words, we want to make a point of implementing this policy while hon. members on the other side, because they foresee certain problems, capitulate and do not care how many Bantu come to the Western Cape. They do not care either whether colleagues of theirs in this House who live in this part of the country will eventually be able to survive here, nor do they care how many Coloureds are unemployed, and yet they also claim that they seek to promote the interests of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>When one faces these facts and has regard to the large reservoir of Coloured labour here, Coloured labour which at the present time has to go elsewhere to make a living, it is clear that the implementation of such a policy is in fact possible. It will simply require a little effort and a little idealism on our part. But I believe that it will be worthwhile. The difference between the approach of this side of the House and the approach of that side of the House to this matter has been illustrated very clearly in this debate. We on this side of the House want to build up an orderly community for the future&#x2014;for the White man and the Coloured man in the Western Cape, and for the Bantu in his own areas. On the other side of the House you have a party which does not care how much chaos arises in this country. That is the difference between the two sides of the House. The United Party <span class="col_6835_6836" refersTo="page_0750"/>approaches this matter without idealism; they do not care what becomes of the White man in the future as long as their pockets can be filled. When problems arise they become frightened and capitulate. I want to say this to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West): He is at liberty to propagate this sort of policy which he has adumbrated here; he will inspire nobody with it and he will get nobody to support such a policy, because the fact of the matter is that at the present moment people who are supporters of that side of the House&#x2014;I speak from personal knowledge of this&#x2014;are already giving their support at local authority level to make a success of the Government&#x2019;s policy in this connection.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member who just sat down will forgive me if I do not respond to his arguments. There are, however, a few other speeches made by members on the other side, for instance the hon. member for Heilbron and the hon. member for Vereeniging, to which no reply has as yet been made. Now, there seems to me to be two schools of thought amongst members on the other side in regard to the policy of the National Party towards the African.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging evidently visualizes a long-term removal of the African from the so-called White Republic of South Africa, back to the Bantustans. He nods his head; therefore, he agrees that that is what he visualizes, i.e. a long-term removal of the Bantu population and their resettlement in the Bantustans. That this is so was obvious to me when he asked why we could not do our own work, like the Englishman and the Italian did their own work. But the hon. member made one fundamental error. He cannot compare the economies of England and Italy with that of South Africa. England was industrialized gradually, just as the economy of Italy developed historically, with their existing populations and they continue to expand at a normal rate according to their resources. You cannot compare this with the economy of South Africa which is based on 15,000,000 people and which the hon. member now wants to reduce to about 3,500,000.</p>

<p>The migratory labour force in Europe is a minute portion of the total labour force of France, Germany and of the other countries. In this country, however, the African labour force represents a vast proportion of the labour being utilized in industry, agriculture and in the mines. The two sets of circumstances are, therefore, completely different.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging also talked about the capitalization of the reserves, and asked why the Africans could not do it? He said we did it here, and that they should therefore do it there. Does the hon. member not realize that it is no accident that the industrialization of South Africa took place in the areas where it did take place? It did not develop in Vereeniging because the hon. member was going to be the Member of Parliament for that area, but because of the natural resources there. Industrialization developed in the triangle Johannesburg-Vereeniging-Pretoria because of the natural resources in the area. Similarly, industrialization developed in the Western Cape because of certain natural advantages being offered by this area. Exactly the same applies to the Natal coastal region. It so happens that the basic requirement for industrialization and capital accumulation arising out of development does not exist in the reserves.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Why not?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Because the natural resources are not available there. Industries do not grow out of nothing, but only out of locational factors such as raw material, etc., and on the basis of a market which can afford to consume the products&#x2014;not a poverty-stricken market like the reserves. There is no transport nor are there power resources in the reserves. In South Africa to-day over R1,000,000,000 is invested in industries while less than 750,000 people are employed by those industries&#x2014;400,000 non-Whites and about 250,000 Whites.</p>

<p>But I want to come to the difference between the hon. member for Vereeniging and the hon. member for Heilbron who bases his policy on this idea of migratory labour and border industries. Just why people think that by calling people migratory workers and allowing them in their millions will solve any of the problems, I do not know. They are still in our midst, they still want economic and political opportunities and better social amenities. These problems cannot be solved merely by changing the nomenclature, yet leaving those workers still in the White areas. As for the border industries the hon. member for Heilbron must explain to me how he hopes to persuade industrialists to move to the borders in any number and employ these 500,000 workers which the hon. the Prime Minister talked about not so long ago. He said that if we only could employ 500,000 Bantu in border industries we would, in 50 years&#x2019; time, be catering for the entire needs of the Bantu population. Where he gets this figure from nobody, of course, knows. He talked vaguely of what the experts said. I should like to see the experts&#x2019; analysis of this and submit it to the analysis of other experts. It is of course, absolute nonsense. In the first place, one person does not support five, certainly <span class="col_6837_6838" refersTo="page_0751"/>not amongst the Africans. At least two out of every household have got to work to support themselves. And then the border industries are going to pay lower and not higher wages than those being paid in the existing industrial areas. Consequently, all this engendering of further demands for services such as the services of professionals, tradesmen, etc., cannot exist The payment of lower wages is the only inducement to people to go and establish industries in the border areas, and if we reduce the number of Africans employed in industries in the White areas and move them to border areas, we will be contracting the consumer market of this country instead of expanding it.</p>

<p>Apart, however, from the theories advanced by the hon. member for Heilbron and by the hon. member for Vereeniging, another interesting policy is being advanced for outside consumption. This policy differs, of course, completely from the points of view advanced by those two hon. members. I have here a booklet entitled &#x201C;The progress of the Bantu peoples towards nationhood&#x201D;. This is put out for outside consumption. Only in two small paragraphs right at the back of the journal is reference made to migratory labour. For the rest, the entire journal reflects an emphasis on the development of the Bantu, not only in the reserves but mainly in the urban areas of South Africa. There is a lengthy piece about Bantu business enterprises in the Bantu townships of the Witwatersrand having &#x201C;doubled during the past five years&#x201D;. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<p>I do not propose to reply to what has been said by the hon. member for Houghton. As I personally see things, I think the hon. member&#x2019;s time in this House is becoming very short. She has imposed upon herself the task of acting here as the representative of the Bantu, but she is one of the weakest Bantu representatives we have ever had in this House. In all the time that she has been here she has never had a single good word for the White man. She says things in this House, however, which Luthuli is not allowed to say outside&#x2014;and then she is still paid for saying it! This House affords her a platform for the propagation of her views. That is why I say that the hon. member&#x2019;s time in this House is becoming short; the nation&#x2019;s patience with her is becoming exhausted.</p>

<p>The United Party has concentrated its attack on the Government&#x2019;s policy towards the urban Bantu. Every speaker on the other side who has spoken so far has confined himself to the place, the position, the rights and the privileges of the Bantu in the cities. Sir, I told the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) that he was telling a historical untruth. Let me give the Committee the historical facts. I want to indicate how things have developed as far as the urban Bantu is concerned and what our declared policy was in the past and still is to-day. The first fact that I want to state is that the area which is to-day the White area has always been a White area. A second historical fact, if I may use the Transkei and the Ciskei as examples, is that before 1708 there were no Bantu south-west of the Kei River. Another historical fact is that in all the clashes between the White man and the Bantu since 1775&#x2014;and these clashes extended over a period of 100 years&#x2014;the White man has not taken one inch of land from the Bantu. The Bantu were simply pushed back into their own territory. The Whites have never committed an act of aggression against the Bantu. That is a noteworthy fact; it is a claim which no colonial power in the world can make. Another fact is that the Whites have always recognized the boundaries of the Bantu areas in the past. A further historical fact is that the areas which are to-day occupied by the Whites were no-man&#x2019;s-land originally. The areas which were occupied by the Whites, cultivated and made habitable by them, were originally no-man&#x2019;s-land to which the Bantu had no claim therefore. What right then have hon. members opposite to demand settlement rights and political rights on behalf of the Bantu, rights which are in direct conflict with the historical facts?</p>

<p>Although the Whites have never committed an act of aggression against the Bantu, the party over there with its race federation policy, in pleading for the so-called rights of the Bantu in urban areas, is engaged in a gradual process of aggression against the White man in the White areas of this country. This process of aggression is revealed more and more in the policy of that party. Our policy has always been to say that for the foreseeable future we are going to make use of the Bantu&#x2019;s labour within the White area but that we want to develop their homelands where they will then be able to exercise their political rights. They can then come and offer their labour to the White man who is more developed and who has more avenues of employment to offer. That is also in accordance with our historical development because the White man has never gone to the Bantu for employment. The Bantu, on the other hand, came to the White man to earn a livelihood in the days when they were murdering one another and dying of pestilence and starvation. They then sought refuge with the White man. That is a historical fact. The Bantu owe much more to the White man today than the White man owes to the Bantu&#x2014; <span class="col_6839_6840" refersTo="page_0752"/>much more. This policy of ours to develop their homelands where they can then enjoy political and other rights, is based on the fact that their presence in the White area does not entitle them to claim political rights, because that is where the sting lies&#x2014;in their superior numbers coupled with the question of political rights. We want to bring that idea home to them. We will allow them on our conditions to settle in the White area as people who come here to sell their labour to us, as they have done historically. That is a historical fact which nobody can get away from. Sir, one moment the party over there is reactionary and the next moment it is liberal. I do not know whether time will permit me to do so but I should like to read out to the House a letter which an English-speaking person wrote to the <i>Star.</i> He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Is it not a case of the party having produced a label, race federation, and that it is groping for a policy to fit the label? Surely a party must state a definite policy before asking the electorate to vote for it. It should not expect votes and then wish to find a policy.</block>

<p>I want to say here this evening&#x2014;and I think I may as well say it to all those who sit on that side and also to everyone at Addis Ababa &#x2014;that morally and historically we as Whites in South Africa are on firm ground in respect of our claims and our determination to maintain our position as Whites in the White area. We have deprived nobody of anything; we have always given; we have deprived nobody of the opportunity to develop; we have progressively promoted development. Let them come with their threats; let them talk about establishing &#x201C;blood banks&#x201D;, Mr. Chairman; let them threaten us with war; let them talk about training thousands of guerrillas. Those are all hollow-sounding cries. Our statement that we are going to maintain our position here in the face of all those who stand against us rests on a firm historical and moral basis.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened to some interesting expressions of opinion this evening. I intend to deal as briefly as I possibly can with some of them. May I start with the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg)? He was quite emphatic that the Bantu had to return to his homelands. When asked where he must return to the hon. member did not know where to begin or where to end. How does he overcome that difficulty, Sir? I have listened to that hon. member outside this House. I know him. He will promise everything, the sun, the moon, the stars, well knowing that those promises can never be fulfilled. He dealt with the question of influx, as did the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). But this influx is taking place under this present Government as a faster rate than it ever did under the United Party. [Interjections.] My hon. friend knows that is true. The number of Bantu in the White area is increasing at an alarming rate. The hon. member for Vereeniging said that repatriation should take place as a slow process. He accused us of wanting to allow unbridled entry. Surely the hon. member for Vereeniging knows full well that this party has time and again, inside and outside this House, told the public that we would have influx control in the township areas. And we will carry that policy out. The position is just this as far as this labour is concerned: It is being repatriated out, but it is coming in faster than it is going out. Will the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) deny that? The Natives that were repatriated last year are back here in Cape Town; they are back with the South African Railways, they are back as stevedores; many heavy contracting works are employing Native labour that was repatriated out last year. Nobody can deny that. Can the hon. member deny this fact that the Native will be a far more efficient and a better Native in our midst if he lived a family life than otherwise? Can you imagine what would happen in Cape Town. Sir, if we had 100,000 Native men living in quarters out here?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>Living in compounds, yes. But what about your locations? I have discussed this mater as freely as I could outside this House. I want to say this to agriculture in respect of the suggestion that farm goals should provide farm labour, that farm goals will not provide the farm labour that is required if this Government carries out its repatriation ideas. What is conflicting is this: Some hon. members on that side of the House want the Bantu to be repatriated completely. They must not even come back as migrant labourers. How will they arrive at that situation?</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Heilbron. He has been very vague about the boundaries of the Bantustan. He is the person who has been entrusted with the recommendations that have been made to the Government for the future boundaries of the Bantustan. He is wedded to the idea that the 1936 Act must be carried out as far as land is concerned but that is about the only part of the 1936 Act he will adhere to. They have discarded everything else in the 1936 Act. I want to ask the hon. member and the hon. the Minister what is happening in respect of Umdanzane? We put a Bill through this House last year. There are some 200 settlers and larger farmers in that area who were scheduled in last year&#x2019;s Act. Can the hon. the Minister tell me how many farms he has bought? Can he tell me how many have been valued? Can he tell me what arrangements have been made for those people who have to get out to re-establish themselves somewhere else? Does the hon. the Minister realize that those folk on those properties have sold their herds, their machinery and their implements because of the undertaking to take over their farms? What has happened? They <span class="col_6841_6842" refersTo="page_0753"/>are sitting there. And I would ask the hon. the Minister this: Is that his way of depressing the value of that land? If it is, Sir, I say it is shocking, I want to ask the hon. member for Heilbron how much attention he has paid to those White men. He is for ever talking about the Bantu and their accommodation; they have to have this land. What contribution has he made in any debate towards the establishment of the White men who are to be displaced from that land? I want to tell the hon. member that that land which was scheduled last year was not scheduled land before. The areas around Alice are still waiting to be purchased and they have been waiting for the last 15 years. Can the hon. the Minister tell me what is going to happen there?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Do you expect all the land to be bought in one year?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#warren">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>Certainly. I expect it to be bought as soon as possible after it is scheduled, the reason being that that land cannot be bought by anyone else. Can the hon. member imagine what the effect of that is upon those farmers? They got an undertaking from the Government last year that the question of the purchase of that land would be expedited. What has been done about it? Precisely nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I happen to know this much, that valuators have been there and that they have valued that ground at half the price at which it was bought by the present owners. How does the hon. the Minister expect to get established there what he proposes to move from the Western Cape? It is an extremely important matter to the Eastern Cape if they are to absorb any portion of the Natives who are to be repatriated from the Western Cape. There are 300,000 west of the Eiselen line. The Transkei cannot absorb them, nor can the Ciskei. We have one little industry which cost about R2,000,000 that can absorb about 250 Bantu. And you have some 300,000 unemployed Bantu in that area that will have to be absorbed before you can move a single Native from the Western area there. Figures have been given from this side of the House of there being some 500,000 Natives unemployed in South Africa. Does the hon. the Minister realize what this is going to cost the White man of this country? It will cost some R4,500,000,000 to absorb perhaps half of them. I feel that the price which the White man has to pay for this wildcat scheme is out of all proportion to what he would have been prepared to do had apartheid been a practical suggestion.

During the 11 years that she has been here I have never heard her utter one word in favour of the Whites or say anything good of them.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must not try to be funny. Mr. Chairman, I want to come back to this Vote which is the most important Vote in these Estimates. For 11 years this has been the Vote to which the official Opposition have devoted most of their attention. They have made certain statements this evening that I want to deal with. I believe that the United Party will be doing South Africa a service if they will answer a few simple questions here this evening. The first thing that I want to ask them is this: Are they in favour of the influx of the Bantu into the Western Cape? Are they in favour of the influx of the wives of those Bantu into the Western Cape? The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) who asked me such a stupid question just now may perhaps be able to reply to this when he enters the debate just now. The United Party is always criticizing the fact that the Black man is here in the Western Cape and that efforts are being made by the Government to remove him. Let the hon. member for Yeoville tell us whether it is their policy to allow the Bantu to stream unchecked into the Western Cape. Do they also want to allow the wives of these men to stream in here as well? Is that their policy?</p>

<p>They are always saying that apartheid is not the solution to South Africa&#x2019;s race problems. As against this, they have a policy of integration, a policy which must of necessity result in the Black man being spread throughout the length and breadth of South Africa. One cannot see it in any other way. The Bantu have now to come to the Western Cape in their thousands and tens of thousands; they have to stream into Johannesburg and into the whole country. That is the policy of integration as <span class="col_6843_6844" refersTo="page_0754"/>we understand it. When we want to restrict the Native to the non-White areas they ask what of the Native in the White areas. The policy of the United Party is that the Bantu must receive certain rights in the White area. They say that he must receive certain political rights there. We on this side of the House say that we dare not give him those rights. That is the fundamental difference between the two sides of the House. After 11 years we have not come very much further than to differ from one another. The United Party is now advocating certain property rights for the Black man here in the White area&#x2014;not only in the non-White area but in the White area as well. We must see the matter as it is, Mr. Chairman. The Whites have no right to own property in the non-White area.</p>

<p>Wait a moment; we will not gain anything by shouting at one another across the floor of the House. The hon. member can put his case later. I repeat, Mr. Chairman. that it was said in this House that the Native must be given proprietary rights in the White areas. These are facts. I want to ask the hon. Opposition what their attitude would be if the White farmers were to have the right to-day to purchase land in the Transkei. What then would become of those Natives?</p>

<p>What about the traders there?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schoonbee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not talking about the traders now. The hon. member now wants to make an exception of rights that were granted a very long time ago. We are talking about the position as it is to-day. The position is, Mr. Chairman, that the United Party wants to give the Natives two chances as against one chance for the White man. My hon. friend, the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling), pointed out just now that we have stolen nothing from the Native, and this holds good for that side of the House as well as for this side. We have not taken anything from him by force of arms or by making use of our position of authority. The rights which we Whites in South Africa have, have been obtained in a very honest way. I do not think that there is any country in the world that can say that it came by its rights in the same way as we did no matter where that country may be, and this holds good for Australia. New Zealand or America.</p>

<p>There is another matter that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. This is a matter that has often been mentioned outside of this House and also in this House. We have about a million Central African Natives in South Africa, people who, with their Governments, will destroy us to-morrow if they have the opportunity to do so. In the past few days we have noticed reports in the newspapers and have heard reports over the radio in regard to the plans that are being made for the Whites in South Africa. They want to destroy us. Let us face that fact. There are about a million of these foreign Natives in this country. We talk about removing them. Now and again a small group is sent away but the fact is that our mines and various industries are still employing a large number of those Natives. Their number is estimated at about a million. I as a White man want this evening to express my concern in this House at the fact that those one million foreign Natives are here in South Africa. Because Central Africa is such a Utopia and because ours is the country which so oppresses and persecutes the Natives, I think that the time has come for the White Government in this country to take forceful action and remove those Natives from the country.

<p>I just want to say to the hon. member who has just sat down that he has contradicted himself completely by saying first that this was the most important Vote and then complaining at the same time that I only pleaded the cause of the welfare of the Bantu people in this House. It is because this is the most important Vote and because I realize that quite inextricably the welfare of the whole of South Africa is bound up with a contented African population that I devote so much time in this House to this subject. It is quite obvious that this country is dependent on non-White labour; the entire peaceful expansion of South Africa is dependent on good race relations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>And they are dependent on us.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. member. There is mutual interdependence. I have always said that. White and Black are completely dependent on each other. Therefore, Sir, anything that reacts to the benefit of the Blacks will ultimately redound to the benefit of the Whites in this country. If their consuming power is developed, if they are given opportunities and if their racial grievances are removed, quite automatically, Sir, that will redound to the benefit of the White community in this country. On the other hand, if racial grievances are built up in this country, if economic opportunities are denied to non-Whites. White South Africa is going to suffer. And White South Africa is already suffering; it is feeling the tension of the situation; it is feeling the cold wind of disapproval blowing over this country from the rest of Africa and from the rest of the civilized world. That is why it is important that we get our race relations straight in South Africa before we can hope to develop a decent and peaceful rate of progress.</p>

<p>After those general remarks, I want to come down to a specific matter. I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he can give me an explanation for the fact that, like his colleague, the Minister of Bantu Education, he is not spending the amount which is voted to him by <span class="col_6845_6846" refersTo="page_0755"/>this House on his Vote of Bantu Administration. The Trust Account is accumulating reserves because of the under-spending of money voted to the hon. the Minister. In this case the amount is not surrendered, as far as I can gather, but the amount is accumulating in the Trust Account. As far as I am concerned, the overall effect is the same and that is that the money is not being spent for the purposes for which it is intended. I want to give the hon. the Minister an example. In the year 1961-2 an amount of R800,000 was voted to the Trust for welfare services for Africans in the Bantu areas. Of that amount only R18.624 was spent. Can the hon. the Minister explain to me why it was impossible to find indigent Africans in the reserves, which are notoriously poverty stricken, and in drought-stricken areas, on whom to spend this money. What is he saving it for? We spend little enough on direct services for Africans in proportion to the population of this country. The total is something like R72,000,000. The hon. the Minister should not find it difficult to find worthy causes on which to spend that money.</p>

<p>I want to point out that when old age pensions and pensions for blind persons and disability pensions were raised they were not raised for Africans. A bloc sum was voted for the purpose of devoting more money to blind, aged and incapacitated Africans. I want to know why this money was not spent especially when you realize that the amounts paid to Africans, as far as these old age, disability and blind pensions are concerned, are the very miserable amounts of R3.52&#x00BD; per African in the city per month; R3.2&#x00BD; for the town African and only R2.52&#x00BD; for the rural African. Even the hon. member for Vereeniging will agree with me that these are very, very low amounts indeed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schoonbee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>It is still very much higher than anywhere else in Africa.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>And so they should be. Our national income is a good deal higher than that of any other country in Africa. I repeat to hon. members that it is the industry of the Africans as well as the capital and the brains and the enterprise of the Whites that have built up the economy in this country. Therefore they, too, are entitled to some of the benefits. I do not consider South Africa a backward, underdeveloped African territory, even if hon. members on the other side do.</p>

<p>What about the Protectorates under England?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is still no argument. South Africa has a huge national income; it purports to be a modern industrial country run on modern lines and, therefore. Sir, it should behave like a modern industrial country run on modern lines. I think these pensions are miserably low: nobody can possibly live on these miserably small pensions and I think the hon. the Minister should certainly not be saying all those thousands of rand. They should be paid out in welfare services. I want to say, too. Sir, that the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s attitude, as far as famine relief is concerned, leaves very much to be desired as well. Having denied that any bad conditions exist in the country the Government is apparently now making very small amounts available, judging by the magnitude of the problem with which those people are coping in the Northern Transvaal. What is more, he is offering work to people who are suffering from starvation! Surely the first thing to do is to rescue those people from the condition of starvation and thereafter supply them with regular employment if possible or do something to see that permanent relief is afforded these people. But to state that work is offered at 10c per day, or whatever it is, to people who are suffering from starvation and malnutrition is, of course, palpably absurd. This is what is being done. Sir as the hon. the Deputy Minister himself told us the other day. I should like an explanation from the hon. the Minister about this under-spending of amounts under the Bantu Administration Vote.</p>

<p>There are numerous other subjects I want to deal with. I shall start with one and continue with the others at another stage. I want the Minister to explain to me whether it is his intention to stop Bantu trading on their own accounts in the urban areas. I have this Government publication which talks about the development of Africans in urban areas. It shows us this lucky Mr. Tshabalala with a turnover of R1,000 per day, owning many garages, cinemas and so on. Many other Africans are mentioned in other official publications as being entrepreneurs in their own rights in townships, not in the Bantu areas, but in townships there is, of course, mention of Bantu entrepreneurs in the Bantu areas as well. But I am talking about the emphasis which is laid on the development in the urban townships where the vast majority of the Africans with their great consuming power in fact live, and where the growing middle class referred to in this publication in fact lives. Is the Minister going to carry out the policy announced in this circular that as from now on no new licences are to be issued to such people, and that Mr. Tshabalala for instance, is to be persuaded to move his ventures to the Bantu areas? What feeling does the Minister think is it going to engender in the Africans who have virtually pulled themselves up by their boot-strings and managed to establish themselves as a thriving middle class when they are told that for no reason whatever, except some ideology of the Government, they must now uproot themselves and move to the Bantu areas where they know perfectly well they will not be able to advance themselves in the same way?

<p>Mr. Chairman, I referred to the hon. member for Houghton and then asked whether &#x201C;she&#x201D; would please reply to my question. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) does not understand Afrikaans; that is why he misunderstood me. In her first speech this evening the hon. member for Houghton referred very sneeringly to &#x201C;the so-called White Republic of South Africa.&#x201D; She was born and bred in this so-called White Republic of South Africa; she is a citizen of this Republic. I want to ask her now whether, if she is dissatisfied in this Republic, there is anything which prevents her from relinquishing her citizenship and going to a truly White Republic in some other part of the world. Is there anything which prevents her from leaving this &#x201C;so-called White Republic&#x201D; and going to a truly White Republic?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VON MOLTKE</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I shall tell you why I ask that. I ask it because if she goes to another White Republic, where there are no non-Whites, she will have no forum in any Parliament where she can stir up the non-Whites against the Whites. That is the first reason. The second reason is that if she went to a Black Republic like Ghana her White skin would count against her and they would not vote for her there. A Black Republic would reject her; in a White Republic she would not be happy because there are no Natives whom she could stir up, and in this &#x201C;so-called White Republic of South Africa&#x201D; she is not at home either. I want to ask the hon. member once again to tell me whether, if she is not happy in South Africa, there is anything that prevents her from going to another republic? If she is not satisfied with the so-called White Republic, does she prefer a Black Republic? A little while ago the hon. member replied in this House to a pertinent question put to her by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) and she then said that she wanted the Black man in South Africa to have the vote.</p>

<p>Yes, but the difference is that I will be re-elected while the hon. member will never see this Parliament again with the propaganda that she makes here. We have proof that within two years their numbers have dropped from 13 members to one solitary member. However, I think I have said enough to the hon. member. I should like also to take the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) to task for a moment. He says that the Bantu have come to the Western Cape to help us. Is he really so naive as to believe that what he said is the truth? They came to us because they could make a better living here than they could in their homelands. He ought to know that. I want to ask the hon. member this: Is there a single service which is being performed by a Bantu in the Western Cape which is not being performed in other parts of the world by a White man and which cannot be performed here by persons other than Bantu? These are the people, Sir, who are pleading that we should bring millions of immigrants into this country! I challenge the hon. member to tell me which work is being done here in the Western Cape by a Bantu which is not being done by Whites in other parts of the world. Is this how he tries to bring more White immigrants to South Africa? Does he want to attract millions of Whites to South Africa by saying to them, &#x201C;This is Kaffir work; it is not the work of a White man?&#x201D; Is that his policy? That is what he said; that is what he suggested and he was corrected by the hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit). He stated that these people were indispensable. That may be so at the moment, but I ask him again whether he can mention any type of work which is being performed by Bantu in the Western Province which cannot be performed by a White man?</p>

<p>If a Jew can do it in Israel, an Afrikaner can also do it in South Africa.

There is no work in South Africa which is more lowly than that same work is in Israel or in any other European country. But the hon. member wants a certain type of work in the northern suburbs, work which according to him is dirty work, to be done by Blacks. Those Blacks would then have to live amongst us permanently of course. I want to ask him then whether his party&#x2019;s policy is that those people who have to live here permanently are to be given the vote and representation in this House eventually, because after all they will now be permanent residents of the &#x201C;so-called White Republic of South Africa.&#x201D; I should like the hon. member to stand up and tell me what he means by talking about a certain type of work in South Africa which is below the dignity of the White man.

<p>I am afraid the hon. member for Karas (Mr. Von Moltke) has made a very poor contribution to this debate, clean away from Native affairs, and I was wondering whether the hon. member is a citizen of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) spoke of an atmosphere of fear. Mr. Chairman, I can assure him that if the Government&#x2019;s policy is carried out of total separation in this country and that the White areas will be populated by 6,000,000 or 7,000,000 people when this comes about, those people will be the people that will live in fear. The United Party&#x2019;s policy is one of holding the reins of control firmly in a multiracial state, whereas the Government&#x2019;s policy, as it used to be, has been changed and now it has collapsed and is breaking up in a mass of fragments. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) said that under the United Party&#x2019;s policy the Black man would eventually sit in Parliament. I say that under the policy of the Nationalist Party of separate Bantustans, a small White population will be surrounded by what the Minister has promised will be independent states in a commonwealth of Southern Africa. I imagine that under those conditions the future existence of the White man will be very much more precarious than it could ever be under the policy of the United Party. The United Party policy is aimed at maintaining White control in this country and we can do it and we will do it.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a ridiculous question. We have had three members in this Parliament representing Natives for many, many years. That gave the Natives a voice in Parliament and they never asked for more representatives in Parliament. Now the hon. member asks how are we going to peg the number of Native Representatives in Parliament. Just the same as it was done in the past, over many, many years. It was quite easy then, and I do not see why it should be more difficult in the future. But this Government is avoiding its responsibility to our subject races. It wants to grant them independence prematurely and that will bring further trouble to our country. You will never be able to shelve that responsibility. If we in this country are not prepared to accept the responsibility for the development and the welfare of our Native people, some other nation will take over that responsibility. Let there be no doubt about that. It is our responsibility, it is our heritage, we are the guardians of these people, and we will never get away from that, and this country has the assets to enable us to develop the country in the interest of all sections. The Government&#x2019;s policy is not only now a factor in retarding industrial development here in the Western Province, but it threatens the stability of farming conditions, in all spheres of domestic employment, in our hotels, in our homes, everywhere, and in our hospitals as well. I do not need to look for figures. We see this happening around us. I have had farmers coming to me and saying &#x201C;We will have to close down if the present uncertainty continues as regards the labour on our farms.&#x201D; There are hotel-keepers who have said &#x201C;Well, if we are going to have our labour restricted, as the Government threatens, we had better try and get out of the hotel business.&#x201D; Then the Government will have to take over the hotel business as they have done in Russia. That is what this Government is working towards, a communist policy. If you get rid of the Natives who do the work that they do in this country, then the Government will have to accept the responsibility of development, because private initiative and the individual will not undertake it under such circumstances. People living in the Western Province are living in uncertainty and fear, and fear is the most dangerous thing there can possibly be. Where there is fear there is no security, there is no development, it only leads to retardation and eventually economic depression. That is exactly what will happen. I am not frightened, Mr. Chairman. We in the United Party have never been frightened as regards our policy. It has never been a policy propagated from fear. We are prepared to stand up to our responsibilities, and we say that during our period of Government there were conditions of greater peace in this country that there have been under this Government. This Government can talk about the Natives streaming into White areas. They have never come under less controlled conditions as under the present Government. The Government has gone out of its way&#x2014; and we agree&#x2014;to settle these people and to provide proper housing. But after doing that, <span class="col_6851_6852" refersTo="page_0758"/>they say they are going to move them. We want the Minister to tell us and to tell the country, and not to keep it a secret, what his plans are. Tell the country that he will move these people gradually and that he is going to guarantee them employment where he moves them to. The Minister must say what kind of employment he is going to provide for them. At present Natives are moving out of the Western Province, but when I come down by train I find more Natives coming down by train to the Western Province than the number who are leaving. How does this system of the Government work? Can the Minister tell us something about it? And for goodness sake get down to something practical, get down to a practical basis, get out of the air&#x2014;this Government lives in the air with its policies. You cannot govern a country by dreams and visions and things of that nature. The Minister should come down to a practical policy and if he has a policy that is practical, he should give us the necessary information. We can tell you all you want to know about our policy. Our policy was based on General Hertzog&#x2019;s 1936 legislation, and it was a good policy. Now you have this position here in the Western Province. I have been talking about it from the employers&#x2019; point of view. What about the employees? What about the Natives who have been allowed to keep their wives here in the Cape and who have now to send them away? That Native lives in uncertainty. He does not even know whether he can obtain a permit to allow her to visit him. The migrant Native too who comes down here and who has no intention of bringing his wife, comes here to keep the wolf from the door at his home in the reserve. What security has he got? He is threatened that if he goes back to see his wife or anything of the kind, he may not be allowed to come back. I have been into the Native reserves and I have been shocked to find in every home there is either a son or the father of that home away working in a White area. These are not happy circumstances, but they are working peacefully and happily. But we disturb their state of mind by rumours and threats which this Government is responsible for. Let us have peace. People overseas may not like our policies, but if it is carried out in a more sane and practical way, perhaps they will learn to understand it. But this system of propagating uncertainty and insecurity and fear is an evil which this Government is responsible for, and for all time it will be something which we will have on your shoulders.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition put a number of questions to me to which I would like to reply immediately. The first question was in regard to the report of the Tomlinson Commission in which the statement was made that with the tempo of development envisaged in that report there would still be 6,000,000 Bantu living in the White areas, and he asks what my view of the matter is now. I still maintain that, with the tempo of development indicated there, there will after a certain time still be approximately 6,000,000 Bantu in the White area. But hon. members forget to add that the same commission indicated that with the full development of the Bantu areas the possibilities are tremendous. That important matter is always ignored by hon. members opposite, and they neglect to mention it. The Leader of the Opposition asked me who is really the creator of the policy of removing the Natives from the Western Cape; is it the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais), or the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. Van Staden) who evolved this policy, the object of which is gradually to send the Bantu in the Western Cape back to their own areas. I just want to tell him very clearly that this policy rests on a very important principle of this side of the House, that we grant every national group its own living space, and the White man. who really acts as the guardian of the non-White population groups, has the duty so to regulate and plan affairs that every population group will have its legitimate living space and that it will not be exploited by any other group. That is one of the cornerstones of our approach to our colour policy in general in South Africa. We believe that every Bantu national group should have its own living space in its own area and that it should be protected there, so that the other national groups may also have a place where they can live in future and where they may develop and be properly protected. It is for that reason that the National Party has laid down the policy, not to-day but right from the beginning and particularly since 1948, that it will protect the interests of the Coloureds in the Western Cape. I have with me a copy of the manifesto issued in 1948, which puts the matter as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A policy of apartheid between Whites and Coloureds and between Natives and Coloureds will be applied. In the spheres in which the Coloureds have already settled themselves they will be protected against unfair competition by the Natives.</block>

<p>But the more comprehensive report about the Coloureds and the Bantu put the matter more clearly, viz. that the National Party regards the Western Cape as one of the areas in which the Coloured may seek his future and will have to make his living, and that the Coloureds should be protected there against the Bantu. It is a matter of principle. It is no new thing, but was formulated as long ago as 1948. That is why ever since 1948 we have systematically worked in that direction.</p>

<p>What is our policy precisely in regard to this matter? Our policy was stated very clearly from time to time. In the first place, it was stated very clearly by the hon. the Prime Minister, viz. that the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape will not take place in such a way as to hamper the development of the Western Cape. It will be a gradual process to ensure that no disruption of any nature will <span class="col_6853_6854" refersTo="page_0759"/>take place in the Western Cape. But at the same time the Prime Minister also stated very clearly, and I also from time to time have stated very clearly, that we should not forget that we also have a duty towards the Bantu in the Western Cape, and it will be one of the things against which I will set myself with all the seriousness at my command if a policy is to be followed to remove the Bantu from the Western Cape and simply to dump them in a Bantu area where they cannot make a living. I do not think any decent person can propagate such a policy. Hence our policy that the Bantu areas should be developed, and to the extent that they develop and opportunities are created for absorbing the Bantu, so that they can make a decent living, to that extent they will be sent there. That is our ideal in respect of the Western Cape.</p>

<p>But now hon. members should not, on the other hand, make the mistake of saying that it is our policy at this stage just to unload the Bantu from the Western Cape on to the Eastern Cape. That is not the intention at all. We should not forget that in the Western Cape people are working who come from the Ciskei, and to the extent that opportunities are created in the Ciskei, particularly also by the border development, to that extent we will try to let these people go there very judiciously. But there are also many people here from the Transkei, and far be it from us to say that we will simply dump those Bantu in the Transkei and tell them to look after themselves. No Christian party and no decent person could have such a policy. It conflicts with any feeling of decency.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>All the stories being spread that we are going to treat the Bantu in such a harsh way are so much nonsense and mischief sown to make the Bantu inimical towards us. I realize very well that it will perhaps take a reasonably long time, although it may perhaps be accomplished much sooner than most people realize. Now the question is asked: Yes, but can we have enough labour if the Bantu is not available; can we replace him by other labour? My reply is very definitely in the affirmative, for this reason: I want to say that as the result of the wrong policy which was formerly followed, we have committed a very great injustice towards the Coloureds in the Cape. The result was that a large percentage of the Coloureds stopped learning how to work. This is one of the important tasks we have to tackle, because a large percentage of the Coloureds is unemployed to-day. It is quite absurd to think that the people registered in the labour bureaux include all those who are unemployed. I say that the percentage of Coloureds who are unemployed in the Western Cape is much greater than many people think. Remember that there was a time when a large proportion of them simply lived on liquor smuggling. That time is now past. One of our important tasks for the future will therefore be to teach those Coloureds to work again and to help to rehabilitate them. It should not be forgotten that to a large extent we are responsible for that position. Why? One phenomenon I notice on the part of the Leader of the Opposition is that he approaches the whole position of the Western Cape in the Esau spirit. He is prepared to sell the Western Cape for a mess of pottage. We think that is wrong, and even though there may be times when one finds things difficult, one does not have the right to sell one&#x2019;s heritage, because we owe it not only to the White population but also to the Coloured population of the Western Cape to take steps. The tendency was, and one still finds it on a large scale to-day, to see how much cheap Bantu labour one could get. Hence the great influx of Bantu from other areas to the Western Cape, and that policy was not fair towards the Coloured population in the Western Cape. It was an injustice to the Coloured population.</p>

<p>We also had this other phenomenon, that to the extent that the Bantu ousted the Coloured from his employment, the Coloureds started going to other areas, which was not fair towards the Coloureds in the Western Cape. Let us therefore have clarity on the matter, viz. that it is not the Government&#x2019;s policy to allow this removal to take place in such a way that it will lead to disruption here in any sphere, economically, socially, or in any other sphere. It is in no way the policy of the Government to remove the Bantu here and just to leave them to their own devices without taking care of them. Proper opportunities will be created for them when they are removed here. But at the same time we say that a heavy onus rests on us to do our duty towards the Coloured population of the Western Cape, and that is to provide them with living room here and to protect them against infiltration not only by the Bantu but by any other national group from elsewhere: I think it is a moral duty which rests on the White man of South Africa to-day.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition asked me where the borders of the Western Cape are now. I have a map here, and if necessary I can show it to him, but briefly the borders will be such that more or less the following will be the border districts: Humansdorp, Pearston, Middelburg, Colesberg, Hopetown, Prieska, Kenhardt and Namaqualand. The hon. the Leader asks what will happen to the farmers there. Here I want to give the same assurance that I gave to Mr. De Kock, and which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) seems to have misconstrued. I did not write to Mr. De Kock saying that he could rest assured that the Bantu would always remain here. I only gave him the assurance that he and his fellow farmers could rest assured that this Government would look after their interests, and until such time as there are Coloureds who can do that work and do it equally as well, he need not be afraid that the Bantu will be removed. That is a duty we have towards the farmers, and it also applies to the other areas.</p>

<p><span class="col_6855_6856" refersTo="page_0760"/>I quite admit that in this area there are approximately 250,000 Bantu. That seems a large number to remove, but the fact is that they are not as firmly established as some people here profess. On the contrary, I say that those people are anxiously awaiting the establishment of opportunities in their own areas for them to return there. I say that in all responsibility and in the light of all the contacts I have with them. These people are anxious to go back, if only they can have the same opportunities there that they have here. But what is more, hardly a day passes without some of these people returning without our even placing them in employment there, where they are much happier than they are here in Cape Town. The Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude (I will return in a moment to a few of the fundamental matters which have become clear) is this: Allow this labour to flow in unrestricted. I myself saw what Cape Town looked like when we came into power, and I was shocked to see what was going on here. There was not a place or bush on the mountain where they were not living. There was not a shrub under which a Native with a Coloured woman was not to be found. They lived in the bushes. I visited Cook&#x2019;s Bush, and when I left there I gave my friends the assurance that I did not know of a single farmer who treated his animals as badly as those people in Cook&#x2019;s Bush were treated. It was shocking. That is what the whole of the Western Cape looked like as the result of the policy followed by the previous Government, and to-day the Leader of the Opposition propounds the same policy. There a situation was created which bred the germs for the Poqo movement. It was this Government which created order out of chaos. Then it was also said to be impossible. But this Government applied control. Now I readily admit that quite a number of Natives entered the larger cities, but one thing no one can deny, and that is that we have stabilized the position in the Western Cape, and particularly in the Peninsula, so that the increase has been restricted. If we had not stabilized it and this influx had continued, what would the Western Cape have looked like today? One would have had murder and manslaughter here on a large scale. It was the actions of this Government and its policy which saved the Western Cape, and particularly Cape Town, from a blood-bath. Matters would have developed in that direction if this Government had not taken action. I admit again that there was a large measure of inflow recently to the urban areas. Nobody denies that. But we do not forget that the stream would increase as industries developed here. But if we continue with the development of the Bantu areas, the day will arrive when the stream can be turned back, and then the return flow will become increasingly faster. But I shall come back to that when I deal in a moment with what the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) said.</p>

<p>Now the Leader of the Opposition says that sociologically this will lead to a great disruption with these people, but I want to deny it. My standpoint is that those people are not rooted here. They were driven here because they could earn better wages here. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) said that they really came here to develop the Western Cape. The hon. member lives in a dream world. They came here because they could obtain better wages here. They came here because of the bright lights of Cape Town. Of course they helped to develop the area by means of their labour, but they did not come here specially to develop the Western Cape. But I repeat that these people have not taken root here. Even those who were born here have not taken root here. Most of them still have a hankering to return to their own homelands. It will therefore not be a mass uprooting, but rather a mass resettlement of these people. Nor will it be a mass resettlement, but it will be a gradual process which will be handled judiciously.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition said that he had a second difficulty, namely the economic development of the Western Cape. He says that without Bantu labour the Western Cape cannot be developed properly. I repeat that this Esau spirit is a very dangerous thing. Sooner or later it leads to trouble. It is not a good thing to abandon a principle just for the sake of a slight economic advantage. I say that if one just considers the increase in the Coloured population and how many families have already been disrupted because they cannot continue living here as the result of this cheap labour, then I say that we are indirectly committing a crime against the Coloured. If one has regard to their increase and the great duty which rests upon us to rehabilitate those masses who have never learnt how to work, we need not fear that in the future there will be any shortage of labour in the Western Cape. On the contrary, in ten to 15 years&#x2019; time the problem will be to develop fast enough to provide enough employment for the Coloureds. I therefore differ from the hon. member there. That is not a problem for the future, but what will create a problem is if we allow the Bantu to come in here in unlimited numbers and to commit an injustice towards the Coloureds.</p>

<p>The hon. the leader says he has another difficulty. He says this policy creates a great amount of uncertainty in regard to economic development, uncertainty on the part of the White entrepreneur, and uncertainty on the part of the Bantu. There we have that difference again. His policy creates uncertainty, because what certainty have the Coloureds for the future if the Bantu are allowed to enter indiscriminately? And what certainty has the White man if one allows that? Nothing. In other words, his policy is calculated to create the greatest possible measure of uncertainty.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) said that they will see to it that everything is kept in order, but that is easier said than done. One&#x2019;s policy must guarantee certainty for the future, and the policy of the National Party, in spite of all the accusations which are based on fear, remains a guarantee of certainty <span class="col_6857_6858" refersTo="page_0761"/>for every national group in South Africa. The Leader of the Opposition stated a further proposition with which I quite agree. He said that there was a tendency in the world to-day for there to be an influx of people to the cities. That is correct, but that is just where his policy in my opinion does not rest on a moral basis, and where my party&#x2019;s policy does rest on a moral basis. These people stream to the cities, but it should be to cities of their own. [Laughter.] What do we see to-day? We see them streaming to the White cities as an appendage of those White cities. In other words, they do not become full inhabitants of those cities who play a role in the development of that city as is the case in the world to-day. No, that policy views the Bantu homeland as nothing else but a reservoir of cheap labour. [Laughter.] And it sees the Bantu residential areas merely as places where the workers have to live, with a little shop here and there, and so on. But if one wants to have the right development, one should do what we are doing to-day. There is an inflow of Bantu to the cities, but one must guide it in such a way that they will systematically develop their own cities. I want to mention examples and the first one is in the Transkei. Instead of there being a number of White towns, the process should have been just the other way around. It should have been a number of Bantu towns. Nobody is more aware than I am that the Whites there have rendered a service, but the development has been wrong. Therefore one&#x2019;s policy should be to develop cities in the Bantu areas, as the National Party is doing to-day. I frankly admit that some of those cities are near the White areas, but they are still within their own areas. I want to mention an example, and I want to invite hon. members to look at Umlazi. When I made a speech in Zululand three years ago and said that a city would develop there, a Bantu town as large as Durban, the English language Press ridiculed it. They said it was a pipe-dream, but what is the position to-day. The hon. member for Drakensberg said the Minister was again floating around on a cloud up in the sky, but to-day a city is developing there, and the same newspapers which scoffed so much now admit that a town is developing there which will one day be much bigger than Durban. What does one find there? One finds that the Bantu are settled in their own area, and they develop their town and they develop tertiary industries. I want to invite hon. members to go and see what splendid co-operation we have there. There are a few Bantu doctors there and they have told me that never again will they live in a Bantu residential area in the White areas. There is peace and happiness to-day. They have developed tertiary industries, and that is the only policy which can offer a solution for the problem with which we are faced to-day. But then they should not be residential areas where only a number of workers live: they must be full-fledged towns which develop to the full in the Bantu area. It is in that respect that the policy of the United Party is lacking in ethical principles for the development of the Bantu.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition reproached me for having spoken about trade in the Bantu residential areas, but we have repeatedly stated our policy in that regard. We have said that in the Bantu towns no White man and no Indian would be given trading rights, but only the Bantu. And we train them to make a success of that business as far as possible, with the result that in recent years 90 per cent of the trading licences have been issued to Bantu, whereas formerly it was only 50 per cent or 60 per cent. We say that in the Bantu residential areas in the White area we grant them those businesses which provide for their everyday needs. We are not prepared to have competition between White and Bantu traders in the Bantu residential areas. We are criticized because we will not allow large O.K. Bazaars to open up in Langa and in the Western Areas of Johannesburg, which employ 300 workers, and large garages.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>He is simply a person who complies with our requirements. There are many other Bantu shopkeepers who are very rich. That is why we say that we must encourage these people to establish large shops in their own towns. It should not be forgotten that those trading businesses are one of the greatest stimulants for the development of tertiary industries, and therefore such Bantu can render a great service to their own people. But again I say it is not the idea to force them. It has correctly been said that the magnet must lie in the Bantu areas. That is the policy of this party. The magnet should not be only in the White areas, but possibilities must be created in the Bantu areas.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the exemption passes for certain Bantu which should be reintroduced, but we have had experience of that. It was the subject of very serious abuses. Every criminal who wanted an exemption pass in those days simply went to the nearest attorney and paid him &#x00A3;40 for which he got a beautiful certificate saying what a decent man he was, and some of the greatest rogues on the Rand received exemptions. There was a black market on a tremendous scale, but the hon. member wants us to reintroduce it. No, we must be very careful. I want to admit&#x2014;and here I agree with him&#x2014;that in the larger cities they should be allowed a greater measure of freedom of movement. Those are matters to which we should devote attention, and we shall certainly do so, but I want to warn hon. members seriously against the large-scale misuse <span class="col_6859_6860" refersTo="page_0762"/>that was made of the exemption pass. We learnt a very unsavoury lesson there.</p>

<p>Now I want to tell the hon. the Leader there. I am glad he made this speech, because it lifted the curtain somewhat in regard to his policy. A few important principles were revealed. The first was that he is quite prepared to leave the White man in the Western Cape to the mercy of cheap labour, no matter where it comes from. That is a dangerous principle. But, secondly, he is prepared to expose the Coloured man in the Cape to the competition of cheap labour by the Bantu. I want to say that one of the reasons why the living standard of the Coloured in the Cape is not higher is just because of this large-scale influx of Bantu labour, and nobody can deny it. If there is a flood of cheap labour, one&#x2019;s standard of living cannot rise. It is his policy to expose the Coloureds to the competition of the cheaper labour of the Bantu.</p>

<p>But in the third place, his policy lacks an ethical principle, viz. that he is quite prepared to let the Western Cape be used as a magnet to attract the best labour from the Bantu areas, without that labour being used to develop the Bantu areas themselves. To me it has always been unethical to allow the best services of the finest sons and daughters of the Bantu to be attracted to the White areas. One cannot develop those areas with just old people and cripples and women. One should try to retain some of the best brains there. It is in this respect that the policy of the National Party comes so prominently to the fore. We want to see the best of the Bantu young people remaining in their homelands to assist their people and to become the entrepreneurs to develop those areas.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) referred to the great influx of Bantu to the White areas. I want to repeat that this side of the House predicted that this would still take place for years. We have predicted that the years from 1976 to 1980 will be the turning point. Then we will begin to see an increasing return flow. We frankly admitted it. In the light of the development which took place in recent years, that is the natural process. But this process cannot be allowed to continue unrestricted. Hence our efforts to develop the Bantu areas. Then the hon. member said that all the capital formation is just amongst the Whites and the Bantu can amass only a small amount of capital, but is that a reason for allowing this process to continue unrestricted? Have we no duty towards the Bantu at least to make it possible for them to start capital formation in their own areas, and how else can it be done other than by developing those areas and by getting some of their best sons and daughters to undertake that task? The hon. member says there are 40,000 White students at the universities and only about 500 Bantu. That is correct, but I want to remind him that there was a time when there were only about ten Afrikaners at the universities here, but what is the position to-day? A start was made. It is here that our policy confers a benefit on the Bantu. Those Bantu universities which were so bitterly opposed by that side of the House to-day turn out men and women whom we can use to build up their own people. That is the value of those universities. I visited a Bantu doctor at one of the Bantu towns and he told me: &#x201C;To-day for the first time my life has meaning, because I can devote the knowledge and the capital I have acquired to the service of my own Zulu nation.&#x201D; That is why we guide the process in that direction, because one can only develop those areas when those potentialities are created there. It is our task to assist those people to amass capital in the service of their own people.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked why there were so many unemployed, but that matter is somewhat exaggerated. Many cases can be traced where the person applies at the labour bureau for work in the towns, but when one investigates how many cattle he has one finds that he has 300 or 400 head of cattle. Therefore he is not really an unemployed man. It is surprising how many of this type of person there are. Therefore the position is being exaggerated. But I want to give the hon. member the assurance that when there is unemployment we render assistance. There we have splendid cooperation with the Bantu Authorities. We are now making use of them, together with our officials, in creating opportunities for employment in the Transkei. Therefore serious attention is being devoted to this matter and excellent results are being achieved. Only the day before yesterday I received a letter from one of the chiefs in the Northern Transvaal, in which he thanked me very nicely for what we had done there to create employment for the people, as the result of which they could care for their families. The hon. member for Jeppes asked what we have done in regard to birth control among the Bantu. I want to tell him he is on dangerous ground now. If he knows the Bantu, he will not talk about that matter in this way. Unfortunately, or fortunately, the approach of the Bantu to this subject differs completely from that of the White man. Nothing is as welcome among the Bantu as a child If one talks to him about birth control, he is immediately inimical. I saw in Pretoria that one of them went to the beer-hall and told the people to be careful because the White people had put something in the beer which would have the effect that they would not be able to have any more children, and for a whole week no Bantu drank a drop of beer there. I have much sympathy with the view of the hon. member, but it is a difficult problem and it will take a long time yet before we can apply birth control among the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) also pointed out the necessity for industrial development to assist the Bantu in obtaining employment. I agree with him. Hence our border industry, but that is not enough. I am of the opinion that in the Transkei we shall in the near future have to start building up industries. I feel very strongly in <span class="col_6861_6862" refersTo="page_0763"/>that regard and this matter is receiving our attention.</p>

<p>No, by the Bantu. It is obvious that in the beginning it will have to be done under the guidance of our officials, but it will not be done in the way in which hon. members want to do it. They want to allow the Whites to go in there to exploit the Bantu, and that will not be allowed. We will assist the Bantu to develop his areas. The hon. member pointed out that the border development also results in a measure of integration. Quite correct, it is a measure of economic integration, but the important thing it that one does not have integration there in the narrower meaning of the word; through co-operation one assists in the development of the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) referred to the danger to the Eastern Cape if all the Bantu from the Western Cape were sent there. That will not take place. We should remember that here we have Basutos and Zulus and various other races, and all of them will not be sent back there, but it will be done judiciously.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) put a few questions to me. He asked what about the people at Undanzani. I think they are in safe hands. The hon. member will derive no political advantage by trying to incite them. The position is simply this. There we have a good example of how we cooperate in solving these problems. The people there were consulted and the overwhelming majority of them were prepared to sell. The municipality was consulted and they were prepared to sell. There are therefore no difficulties there. Now the position naturally is that all the valuations have to be done by the Land Board, which falls under the Minister of Lands and not under me. I know many of the farmers are dissatisfied with the valuations, but in the past, where there was dissatisfaction, we settled the matter by getting into contact with these people. Some of them are quite satisfied to sell at the prices at which the land was valued. There are some who do not see their way clear to selling, and those matters are being investigated, so that the hon. member need not be concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) put a few questions. She is very fond, just lately, of taking that ugly black brush and continually painting it over the face of South Africa. I wonder how much love she can have for South Africa when she can do that. Would it not be better, if certain things are wrong, to assist to remedy them, and to save South Africa the dishonour of undeservedly being blackened in the eyes of the world? I cannot understand what goes on in the heart of that hon. member which makes it possible for her to vilify her own fatherland in this way. To her there is nothing nicer than to blacken South Africa. That is not nice at all. I am not one of those people who say that everything is going well, but when things go wrong I am always glad to have it brought to my notice by the hon. member so that we can remedy it, and she knows that we have remedied more than one thing already. Now she very facilely says that there are people who are underfed and who suffer from famine. Surely that is not true. [Interjections.] I challenge anyone to show me the people who suffer from famine in that way. We have the Bantu Authorities all over the country, and we have our officials, and my instructions to them are that if there is any case where the people do not get enough to eat they must immediately see to it that they are fed, but they have to work for that food. Even though we only tackle the cleaning up of a land, they have to work and the women can also earn money. The old people and the children receive food gratis, but the others have to work. Why say now that such a state of affairs exists? Last year we heard the stories about Sekukuniland. I went there myself and asked where the place was where all this difficulty arose, and do you know which place is was, Sir? It was the place where the Bantu always had their lands. Then they said they did not know it was old lands, and when they saw the grazing everybody was surprised to see how good it was, but South Africa had to be vilified. No, I want to assure the hon. member that those people are being cared for. She asked about the amount of R800,000 which was not fully spent. That is right; it has not yet been spent fully, but we are continually busy with new schemes to provide for the aged and the needy in their own areas, and in this way we are rendering a social service to the Bantu. A large amount has already been spent. But do not forget that for this work planning is required and it takes quite a while to provide the basic services. One cannot just spend money to-morrow which one has received to-day. Everything first has to be planned in co-operation with the Bantu, and that takes time. This amount was specially set aside to ensure that the aged and the sick and the lame would be properly cared for in hospitals. We entered into agreements with various hospitals to ensure that the cripples would be properly cared for there. Every penny is spent in the interest of the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) made a few general statements and voiced the view that their policy was the correct one and he said that we are proceeding at too fast a pace with these people because they have no sense of responsibility. Well, at this stage we must keep our word of honour which we gave to the Bantu. We cannot always remain the guardians of the Bantu. We must at least give them the opportunity to develop a sense of responsibility, and that is what we are doing. I think I have now replied to the main points raised.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, during this debate we witnessed a peculiar spectacle. One wonders whether one was with Alice in Wonderland. One got the impression that this was the great retreat of the Nationalist Party in regard to their Bantu policy. Listening to the hon. the Minister, I think he realized that it was time he restated the policy of his party. Personal remarks were made here, and we even heard threats that the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) would be here only for a very short time. I and this side of the House are sorry that that remark was made. We on this side will always protect the rights of any individual in this House who was elected democratically. I think it is wrong that a member of this House should be threatened in this way. The Minister referred again to the reservoir of cheap labour we were trying to build up in the Western Cape. The Minister must know that the wages of the Bantu are controlled by the Government, and in the Western Cape we pay probably higher wages than anywhere else in the Republic. To come back to the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape, the policy of removing the Bantu is an ideological one.</p>
