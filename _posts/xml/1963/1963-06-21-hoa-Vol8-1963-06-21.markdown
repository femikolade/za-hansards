<heading>APPOINTMENT OF CABINET COMMITTEE FOR THE ORANGE RIVER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>With the leave of the House, I would like to make the following statement:</p>

<p>When his Vote was under discussion in the Assembly, the Hon. the Prime Minister said, <i>inter alia,</i> regarding the Orange River Development Project, that, while the Department of Water Affairs was fully responsible for the control and construction of the dams and canals, the Government as a whole would accept the responsibility for, and take control of, further and wider planning and development of the project.</p>

<p>I, therefore, now have pleasure in informing the Honourable House that the Government has decided to appoint a standing Cabinet Committee for the Orange River Development Project. The Committee will consist of the Ministers responsible for all those State Departments which are involved in the numerous aspects of the project and in the proper execution and development thereof; namely, the Ministers of Lands, Finance, Transport, Water Affairs and Agricultural Technical Services, Economic Affairs, Agricultural Economics and Marketing, Coloured Affairs and Community Development.</p>

<p>The Cabinet Committee will be responsible for the co-ordination and control of the overall planning of the Orange River Project.</p>

<p>In carrying out this task the Cabinet Committee will be assisted by an Advisory Board under the chairmanship of Dr. D. H. Steyn, who is also chairman of the Economic Advisory Council of the hon. the Prime Minister In addition, the Advisory Board will consist of&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) the heads, or their representatives, of the aforementioned State Departments;</li>

<li>(b) the Provincial Secretaries of the Cape and the Orange Free State, or their representatives;</li>

<li>(c) a representative of the Electricity Supply Commission;</li>

<li>(d) a representative of the Industrial Development Corporation;</li>

<li>(e) a representative of the Natural Resources Development Council;</li>

<li>(f) such individuals, in their personal capacities, as the Cabinet may decide to appoint in view of their experience and ability, of whom one, Dr. H. J. van Eck, has already been nominated.</li>

</ol>

<p>The office of the chairman of the Advisory Board, who is also the Economic Adviser to the Prime Minister, will serve as Secretariat for the Cabinet Committee and its Advisory Board.</p>

<p>The Government is convinced that, by instituting this Cabinet Committee with its Advisory Board, a sound foundation has been laid for the most comprehensive co-ordination of all that is of importance, and for the utilization of the best resources in our country, ensuring efficient planning in advance and orderly development in its numerous facets of this most important project in the Republic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the United Party opposed the introduction of this Bill; we opposed the second reading and we opposed important clauses in the Committee Stage. We shall continue our opposition to this Bill by opposing the third reading. Sir, this Bill is typical of the legislation introduced by the Government over the years affecting the Bantu of this country. Every year we get more and more restrictions applied to them. One wonders how the Minister and his officials can still think of more restrictions after 13 years of restrictions. This particular Bill does not only deal with the urban Bantu, as has been the custom in the past, but it also deals with the rural Bantu. In terms of Clause 1, the foreign Bantu employed in this country are now to be treated as illegal immigrants. We were amazed to hear the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) say that every foreign Bantu in this country was an illegal immigrant. He must know that these foreign Bantu have some document of identity. It seems peculiar to us to say that because he did not get a permit to enter the country and, although he was given an identification document endorsed to the effect that he was working in this country, he was still regarded as an illegal immigrant. Clause 1 places certain restrictions on foreign Bantu and certain obligations on them to get more documents. I do not know how these foreign Bantu can possibly know what is expected of them. As we have pointed out before, these foreign Bantu are not here on holiday; they came here to work. They would not be here had work not been available for them, and had they not been required by the economy of this country. We object to the harsh manner in which they are now being dealt with.</p>

<p>When it comes to our own Bantu in the urban areas, we oppose most strenuously the clause dealing with the housing of domestic servants. We take up the same line which we took up throughout with regard to domestic servants, namely that the local authority should be allowed to decide which domestic servants will be allowed to live in its area of jurisdiction. The local authority is the body best suited to decide that question. If Potchefstroom or Pretoria or Sunnyside want all their domestic servants to live outside the White area, the local authorities can see to it that they do. But why must all the other local authorities be subject to this restriction just because a few local authorities have asked the Minister to introduce such a law? The hon. the Minister was only able to quote, I think, three instances of requests by local authorities for this provision. Yet he is now forcing that law on the whole country. Sir, the local authorities are losing more and more authority.</p>

<p>In terms of Clause 11 the regulations will now be uniform. As was pointed out in the Committee Stage there is some reason why local authorities do not all adopt the regulations which the Department wish them to adopt. The first portion of the clause permits the Minister to publish regulations for general guidance. Why could the clause not end there? Actually I do not think there is any necessity for a clause of this nature because the Minister can in any event advertise the regulations which he wishes municipalities to adopt. But then the clause goes on and (b) makes it obligatory on local authorities to accept those regulations. If the model regulations prepared by the Minister were acceptable to all local authorities they would not hesitate adopting them. As pointed out, Sir, local authorities should be given some discretion. There must be some reason why the local authorities do not all adopt the model regulations as prepared by the East London Municipality. The Minister himself has admitted that he is getting co-operation from different municipalities, that they co-operate in other ways with him, that he is on reasonably good terms with them. He mentioned the Johannesburg Municipality in particular. But he went on to say that the Johannesburg Municipality had not adopted those regulations which he wished them to adopt. He is now forcing them to do so by passing this clause. We say it is quite wrong. In no two municipalities in the country, Sir, are the conditions the same. Conditions vary throughout the country. The municipality itself should therefore be allowed to decide what regulations it wishes to apply. What is worse is this: This Bill goes on and makes it obligatory on municipalities to furnish the Minister with all the resolutions they pass and if the Minister does not like those resolutions he can amend them. As I read the Bill they must submit the resolutions to the Minister even before they have passed them. The municipalities, all these local bodies, are elected. The people serving on these bodies are elected by the people living in that area, and the persons who elected them have entrusted to them the administering of these affairs. Nobody suggests that a local authority should be allowed to flout the laws of the land. The laws passed by this Parliament dictate to municipalities as who should live there, what Bantu should live in their area and that sort of thing. But surely the municipalities can be left to administer those laws themselves. What do we find now? That where local authorities are administering the laws, with more and more Government interference, where the Bantu resent the administration of those laws, the Opposition is blamed&#x2014;as has happened in the Transkei just recently. The local authorities have to carry out the law with regard to endorsing out of people and the Bantu objected, their leaders said: It is not the Government but the Opposition. The local authority is being blamed. The local authority has to carry out the law, but let the local authority itself decide how it is going to carry out the law. Let them carry it out in the most human way possible. Sir, the municipalities, the councils are being put in a most humiliating position of not being able to pass <span class="col_8531-8532" refersTo="page_0514"/>resolutions without submitting them to the Government. When they pass a resolution they have to submit it to the Minister for him to alter it as he thinks fit. I say that is striking at the very basis of our democratic form of government. Sir, the Minister goes further. He will dictate to the municipalities under this Bill what regulations the municipalities will have to abide by. They will have to abide by those regulations whether they like it or not&#x2014;regulations dealing with administration. Then the Minister also says: I will consider any resolution passed by your council and if I do not like it, I will amend it too. You have to send me your resolutions. Thirdly he says: I want to give the Bantu some say in local government, and therefore we agreed to establish urban Bantu councils. A law was passed to that effect. The Bantu councils are now going to be established, but he tells them in advance: &#x201C;If I do not like what they do, I will disestablish them.&#x201D; That is the effect of Clause 26. I think it is a shocking thing! Those Bantu councils also have elected members on them. There cannot be more selected members than elected members. What is the object of electing a council if the people in the area know and the councilors know that should they in any way dispute Government policy or be critical they may be disestablished? How can you have a council acting fairly and honestly if it knows all the time that its very existence depends on it being a lackey of the Government? Because that is all it means. Unless they do what the Government wants them to do, they will be disestablished. Sir, there is no purpose in telling the Bantu that you are going to give them more say in their own affairs, allow them to control their own municipal affairs&#x2014;and a great song is being made about this, not only in this country but also overseas that the Bantu are now being allowed to take control of their own affairs&#x2014;what is the object of telling them all that, and telling the outside world that if at the same time you tell them &#x201C;If you do anything wrong. I will disestablish you at once&#x201D;? When the original law was passed to establish the Bantu councils, this provision was not in it. Why were they not told then, when the Bill was passed, what was in store for these councils? I put it to the hon. Minister that it is only being done because he cannot get the councils established by municipalities unless he does that. The municipalities are not keen on those councils, the Bantu are not keen on those councils. Why are the Bantu not keen on those councils? At the time we warned the hon. Minister that the Bantu would not accept these councils because of the fact that he was having selected members on the councils and that the chiefs were going to be represented on the councils as well. Not only do those councils deal with the running of the urban affairs, the township affairs, but they also establish courts. We warned the hon. Minister then that the Bantu themselves were going to oppose the establishment of these councils because of the other provisions. So now the Minister wants the municipalities to establish the councils. The municipalities are afraid to establish these councils because they do not know what the reactions of the councils are going to be under those circumstances. Therefore the Minister has now laid down that he will disestablish the council if that council does not behave itself.</p>

<p>I say this legislation is typical of the legislation which has been introduced by the Government over the years. At the end of the Session we have this Bill. We know that this is only a stop-gap Bill. I think it is the shortest Bill we have had dealing with Bantu in the 13 years this Government has been in power, but we know that we have got a much bigger Bill waiting for us next year, a Bill which was supposed to be introduced this year. That we will have to deal with next year. In the meantime this is just a stop-gap. We say that this is the wrong type of legislation, it is the wrong way of legislating, and what we should have is one Bill presented to us dealing with all the facets of Bantu life. It is impossible to-day for us to know exactly what the position of the Bantu is. I do not see how any Bantu can possibly know what laws control his movements or his place of residence. For him to try and fathom what his position is even under this Bill is an impossibility.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) adopted <span class="col_8533-8534" refersTo="page_0515"/>quite a moderate tone this morning and I want to adopt a similar attitude. He adopted the attitude that we had to deal here once again with an irritating measure. I want to say here this morning that the main characteristic of the legislation before us is that it is one of the best pieces of legislation that we have ever had for the protection and the benefit of the Bantu in the White areas of South Africa, and I want to mention five points in this Bill which are really intended for the protection and the benefit of the Bantu people in the White areas of South Africa. This is one of the measures which unequivocally recognizes the human dignity of the Bantu people in the White areas.</p>

<p>I want to start with the first point which is contained in the clauses dealing with foreign Bantu in South Africa&#x2014;the treatment that is now being meted out to the foreign Bantu in South Africa. In the first place and in the main this provision is designed, of course, for the benefit of our South African Bantu and no one else because as far as the White man in South Africa is concerned it will make no difference to him which Bantu does the work for him. Indeed, many Whites in South Africa want the labour of foreign Bantu, like the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) who made a moving plea in this regard. We realize that it may be to the advantage of the Whites to have foreign labour in South Africa but we also realize that it will not be in the interests of our South African Bantu. That is why this provision is being incorporated in this legislation. It is one of the provisions which make this measure so urgent because it will enable us to control the Bantu not only in our urban areas but throughout South Africa and gradually to substitute our own Bantu labour for the labour of the foreign Bantu. If this is not a measure for the benefit and the protection of the Bantu in the White areas of South Africa, then I do not know what will be to their advantage.</p>

<p>The previous speaker has objected to the fact that the foreign Bantu will now have to carry additional documents. I think that is entirely wide of the mark. He does not know what he is really talking about because the foreign Bantu is not going to be made to carry extra documents. He is going to receive a passport from his country of origin, just as every person has to have a passport in a foreign country. When a person goes to a foreign country he must have a passport from his country of origin. That will be the only document that the foreign Bantu will have to carry. The foreign Bantu is not going to receive another reference book from us because his means of identification will be the passport that he receives from his own country of origin.</p>

<p>Then, Mr. Speaker, the foreign Bantu will no longer be allowed to enter the country in an uncontrolled fashion. He will only be allowed to enter the country when he has been given permission to come and work here. In other words, we will then be sure that the foreign Bantu does not deprive our own Bantu of work and that he will not compete with our own Bantu for the work available here. That is the intention underlying all the clauses dealing with the foreign Bantu. I want to emphasize once again that these provisions are designed to protect our own Bantu in the White areas.</p>

<p>I come now to the second provision for the protection and the benefit of the Bantu in the White areas and that is the clause referring to domestic servants. Mr. Speaker, I think it has been emphasized far too little in this debate that this provision is designed for the protection and benefit of the Bantu in our White areas in that domestic servants will not be herded together as inferior beings in the backyards of White homes but will be able to live in their own residential areas where they will be able to participate in the social life of the members of their own community; they will be able to live a dignified life there instead of being herded together in backyards for the convenience of the children and grandchildren of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman); they will not simply exist for the convenience of White children and White comfort, but will also be able to live in their own Bantu residential areas together with their own people and be able to enjoy the communal life of the Bantu.</p>

<p>I come to the third provision which will benefit the Bantu and that is that we are now trying to obtain uniformity of action in regard to the Bantu in the White areas. If there is one thing which is confusing, which is upsetting, which completely confuses the Bantu in his behaviour in the White area, it is the fact that he is treated in a certain way in one urban area and that when he enters another urban area he is treated in a different way. He is treated differently in every urban area in which he finds himself. This sort of thing is terribly irritating and confusing and upsetting to him. We are now trying to obtain uniformity so that the steps that are taken in regard to the Bantu will be the same in each urban area, so that the Bantu will not be confused and will know how he is going to be treated. These uniform regulations which we seek to bring about, this uniform action in all the cities and towns, will be to the benefit of the Bantu and nobody else. I want to say this: This Bantu legislation is also to the advantage of the Whites in this regard. It is to the advantage of the Whites in that we need a national policy in regard to the Bantu in South Africa. We should not have the position where every urban authority has its own policy in regard to its treatment of the Bantu. But I want to emphasize that uniformity of action is to the advantage of the Bantu in the White area.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a fourth point to illustrate that this legislation is to the advantage of the Bantu in the White area and that is the break-through of Native law in this legislation. For the first time now recognition is being given to customary Bantu marriage unions in connection with the payment of compensation <span class="col_8535-8536" refersTo="page_0516"/>to the next-of-kin in the event of the Bantu&#x2019;s death in an accident or in the event of his being injured. Mr. Speaker, this point too has not been emphasized very much during the debate on this Bill but I contend that it is one of the great advantages contained in this legislation and I am pleased that it is also regarded by the hon. the Minister as one of the urgent provisions that cannot wait for the later legislation which we know will be introduced next year.</p>

<p>I come now to the last advantage that I want to mention and that is the proclamation of released areas. The proclamation of released areas is also to the advantage of the Bantu. It is also of course to the advantage of the Whites but I am emphasizing its advantage to the Bantu because the hon. member for Transkeian Territories said that we were dealing here with another irritating measure from the point of view of the Bantu. That is why I am pointing out that this is also to the advantage of the Bantu. I could elaborate a great deal on the advantages that it holds for the Whites, but I just want to emphasize that it is to the advantage of the Bantu. Why are these released areas being proclaimed? They are being proclaimed in the first place to eliminate the impossible conditions which the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) and his predecessors as Ministers of Native Affairs created in South Africa under the United Party Government.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is the truth. Fortunately, we have all the files at our disposal. I have had the opportunity of seeing the signature of the hon. member for Green Point on many of those green sheets, I know therefore that that is the position. Those conditions were created under the regime of the hon. member for Green Point when he was Minister of Native Affairs. I mention the one example where he allowed land to be purchased and turned a small rural town into a White spot. He purchased land from Whites all around that town for the Bantu and by so doing isolated that little town and turned it into a White spot. We are now trying to assist those people. We are going to buy them out, and we are going to make that little town a released area. The South African Native Trust is going to buy out the Whites there. This is to the advantage of the Whites but I want to emphasize the fact that it is also to the advantage of the Bantu. In most of the released areas which are now being proclaimed it will be possible for the Department of Bantu Administration and Development to establish certain towns close to the border industries of South Africa. In the course of the discussion on the Vote of Economic Affairs yesterday a great deal was said about border industries. We are now making it possible for towns to be established close to these border industries in South Africa. I want to mention Hammarsdale as an example; further examples are Clermont, the Rustenburg Farms and the land at Brits, all of which will be proclaimed released areas in terms of this legislation. Towns can then be established in these areas close to the border industries so that the Bantu will be able to live in their own areas and work in the White areas in those industries. They will therefore be able to lead a dignified life in their own areas; they will be able to buy their own piece of land and own their own plots, their own homes and enjoy full property rights in those areas. These are all benefits which will accrue to the Bantu under this legislation.</p>

<p>I have mentioned these five points. There are other minor benefits but I merely wanted to mention these five main points to indicate that this measure is to the advantage of the Bantu in the White areas of South Africa. But in spite of this the hon. member for Transkeian Territories made the stupid remark that this was an irritating measure and just another of the terrible measures passed by this Government. What was his purpose in saying this? Before resuming my seat I want to say that I associate myself with this remark of the hon. member for Transkeian Territories to the effect that we should have one law governing the Bantu in the White areas as a whole. Let me tell him that that is our intention. He can look forward to it. He will receive a welcome &#x201C;Christmas box&#x201D; in this connection.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to reply to some of the points made by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). He talked about this Bill largely being to the advantage of the Bantu and for their protection, and he mentioned various points. I am going to deal with some of them. The first one is this question of the foreign Bantu and regulations which are now going to redound to the benefit of the local Africans. Well, to some extent that might be true in that as far as the Government is concerned, restrictions which have always applied to foreign Bantu that come into the urban areas will now be extended to the rural areas. But I am quite sure that the actual labour position in this country is not going to change over-much. My experience in this country has been that where farmers kick up enough row about anything they want, they are likely to get what they want, and if there is a shortage of labour, I believe that rather than go looking around among the unemployed workers of South Africa, farmers will still be granted permits very lavishly for foreign Africans to come into the country. So I do not think in practice this is going to redound very much to the advantage of South African-born Africans. As far as the domestic servant clause is concerned, I have already said a great deal about this during the second-reading debate, and I do not want to repeat any of those points, but I must refute finally the statement made by the hon. member for Heilbron this morning that this is going to <span class="col_8537-8538" refersTo="page_0517"/>give the African domestic servant the right to his own community life. I would like to see that very much indeed if it could be organized in a normal way. But let us start in those occupations which do not in fact carry the extraordinary hours of domestic labour. Let us start with factory workers who after all are the majority of the workers in the large towns of South Africa. Let us start with the commercial workers who are the second largest group. Because these are the people &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member makes the same mistake that other hon. members make in this House. I am not referring to foreign-born Africans. When I talk about family life for the Africans, I mean South African-born citizens. So I am not talking about Nyasaland Africans or Portuguese East Africans. I am talking about Africans born within the borders of the territory that all of us know as the Republic of South Africa, and for those people I certainly want normal domestic life and normal home life.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? How is the hon. member going to reconcile family life with the backyards in the case of the Bantu?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Family life in the backyards cannot be reconciled <i>per se</i> with the family life of factory and commercial workers, but there would be no objection whatever as far as I am concerned to the employment of unmarried women, or widows, as domestic servants and their living on the premises of their employers. I want to ask the hon. member for Heilbron whether he would withdraw this legislation and introduce legislation instead to provide that only unmarried persons or widows would be allowed to reside on those properties as domestic servants, and in the case of married people that only one such resident domestic servant would be allowed? Would the hon. member be prepared to do that? It would meet my objective of having a normal family life for the Africans and also the hon. member&#x2019;s objective of having a normal family life, with the difference that I would still allow domestic servants to live on the premises provided they are unmarried and not leaving their families behind either in the reserves or in the townships. But, as I say, domestic work, any way, is a different type of occupation, and people choose occupations knowing full well what the conditions are. For example, if one happens to be married to a doctor one knows he certainly does not lead a regular life where he has normal hours. He gets called out at all times of the day and night. Anyone who goes in for medicine knows that that is one of the conditions when taking up that occupation. There are people who have occupations which entail their working through the night, to do nightwork. Nurses have most irregular hours. There are people who have to get up very early in the morning because their type of work demands that. Domestic servants happen to have disjointed hours of labour, early mornings and again in the evenings, with hours off during the day. I say, Sir, it is absolutely, I cannot use the word &#x201C;hypocritical&#x201D;, but misleading for the Government to try and pretend that it is introducing this measure in order to increase the privileges of home life for domestic servants. That is not so at all, because hon. members any way are at present making all sorts of arrangements for the housing of thousands of domestic servants in single quarters, in barrack-like quarters in Alexandra Township, which is near the largest employing area of domestic servants in Johannesburg, the northern suburbs. And I must add this, as was pointed out by the hon. member for Musgrave, that there are no regulations to stop African domestic servants from living in locations or townships now if they want to, and therefore if this had been their desire, they would have done so. But they did not do so because of transport costs, loss of time and the fatigue involved in getting to and from their work every day and the additional rentals that would have to be paid and so on. That answers I think the second point raised by the hon. member for Heilbron.</p>

<p>Then he raised the point about the necessity of co-ordinated sets of regulations for the municipalities throughout the country. Now there might be something in this too, because it is quite true that the African is completely bemused by the completely contrary sets of regulations. Indeed, the whole of the urban areas legislation is a puzzle for a trained lawyer, let alone a simple African. To try and understand the regulations that pertain to Africans in South Africa is virtually an impossibility and I am glad to hear that at least a consolidating measure is to be introduced.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Deputy Minister must not get upset. I do not mean that ugly, sinister word &#x201C;liberale&#x201D;. I mean &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; as used throughout the civilized world to mean a broad, widely conceived set of ideas. The <span class="col_8539-8540" refersTo="page_0518"/>point I am trying to make is that, as has been said by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories, conditions vary from township to township, and if the Government had contemplated using regulations such as for instance were adopted by a large metropolitan centre like Johannesburg, which has got anything from 750,000 to 1,000,000 urban Africans to look after, the most sophisticated African people on the whole of the continent of Africa, that would be one thing. But not at all. The only example quoted to us of ideal municipalities running their affairs in the best possible way are municipalities like Heilbron and Potchefstroom, and I must say that it fills me with dismay to think that huge areas, sophisticated, advanced metropolitan areas, like Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, and so on, are now going to be confined to the most restrictive regulations conceived with the idea of Potchefstroom in mind. It is in any case not those large metropolitan centres.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say to the hon. member for Heilbron that this ideal of border industries sounds very fine. It sounds like the idea of decentralization with which nobody has any real objection. He talked about Hammanskraal and the setting up of homes for workers in the border industries in an area such as Hammanskraal. But this, I am afraid, is going to remain for ever just an ideal of the Nationalist Party because nothing is going to change the locational factors and the economic factors which, in fact, determine where entrepreneurs are going to establish their industrial enterprises. All the inducements in the world, such as low rates of interest on capital, depreciation allowances, etc., will not outweigh the natural advantages of areas where there is already an established market with consumer power attached to it, not like these reserves with their poverty-stricken inhabitants where there is no power, no transport &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I should like to know which reserves are flourishing reserves able to support border industries. At any rate, I want to repeat that to my mind this question of border industries-is merely an unattainable ideal.</p>

<p>The Bill, as far as I am concerned, was bad at the beginning and it is bad still at the end. There are a few redeeming features which I mentioned earlier on but these, I am afraid, are greatly outweighed by the bad provisions of the Bill. In the main it follows that pattern of legislation which the Government has introduced since it came to power. This is a pattern with which we unfortunately are becoming only too familiar in South Africa: ever-increasing control from the top. This is, in other words, the very negation of democratic ideas, of the ideas of free enterprise and freedom of the individual. As far as I am concerned, therefore, the basic premise of this Bill is wrong and objectionable. The Government now enters the very homes of our citizens and disturbs relationships which have been going on untouched and quite satisfactorily for many generations. Local authorities now more or less become the puppets of the Central Government. This Bill is clearly aimed at those large municipalities which are not Nationalist Party orientated, municipalities such as Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Pietermaritzburg, Port Elizabeth, etc.</p>

<p>In regard to the urban Bantu councils, these never meant much to me. I opposed the legislation in terms of which they were to be established because I realized that it was not a measure which was going to give real autonomy to the urban Africans. Now the Government is asking for power in this Bill to limit the powers of these urban councils. Neither does this make much difference to me because I did not have any faith in these councils from the word &#x201C;Go&#x201D;. I had no hope originally that these councils were going to mean anything to the urban Bantu. What we should be doing here this morning is to repeal laws, to repeal the restrictive laws of to-day. We should not be introducing further extensions &#x2026;</p>

<p>I too, Sir, should like to reply to one or two of the points made by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). He said, first of all, that this Bill was one of the best pieces of legislation for the benefit of the urban Bantu. I cannot help but be reminded of what Humpty Dumpty said in &#x201C;Alice in Wonderland&#x201D;, i.e. that when he used words, they meant just what he wanted them to mean. We in this country have reached that stage where nobody seems to know what is or is not in his own interests. No group in the country seems to know what is in its interests&#x2014;no race group, no municipality, in fact nobody if one has regard to this Bill. No housekeeper knows what is in her or his interest and no job seeker knows what is in his interest. It is only this Government who knows what is in their interests. The fact of the matter is that this Bill indicates more than any other Bill which relates to the urban Bantu, that this Government has no policy whatever for the urban Bantu&#x2014;certainly not in so far as they are people living in the urban areas.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is very difficult to come down from the clouds when considering a Bill of this nature. However, Sir, I shall obey your ruling. The hon. member for Heilbron said that our attitude to this Bill was denying the &#x201C;gemeenskaplike lewe&#x201D; to the Bantu. When they leave in the mornings at 6 and arrive back at 9 in the evening, it is very difficult to understand just what the hon. member means by &#x201C;gemeenskaplike lewe&#x201D;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Why only 9 o&#x2019;clock in the evenings? Why do you not give them decent hours?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member now suggests that decent hours should be given. Now I realize that hon. members opposite are coming to the point where they want to tell us how long we should allow domestic servants to work. The hon. member must come down out of the clouds to the facts obtaining in South Africa. These facts are such, at any rate as far as Durban is concerned, that neither this Bill nor anything in relation to it will in the foreseeable future alter them. This is the basic problem and yet the hon. member for Heilbron is dreaming up all these phantasies just because he does not want to accept the facts as they are.</p>

<p>This clause relating to domestic servants is a deliberate attempt on the part of the hon. the Minister to change the whole pattern of living in South Africa in this respect. The hon. the Minister of Justice is endeavouring to change our drinking habits. Now this Deputy Minister is trying to change the pattern of living in other respects. This clause does not affect the hon. the Deputy Minister or the hon. the Minister of Finance with a home of seven rooms for seven servants but it affects the ordinary individual, the poorer man of South Africa. It does not affect the rich man and the man who can afford to employ White servants or Indian or Coloured servants. We know that the standard of the wages of the Bantu is much lower than the wages of those groups. And there are people who cannot afford one servant of any other race, let alone two or more.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has not yet indicated to us what criteria are going to be applied in regard to the granting of exemptions under this particular clause. What does the clause mean by saying that these exemptions may be granted? On what is he going to base the granting of such exemptions? Is it to be based on the particular station a person enjoys in life? Is it to be based on his influence or on the number of children he has, or on the fact that he is a Cabinet Minister? On what basis are these exemptions going to be allowed?</p>

<p>Even more remarkable are the reasons which were advanced in justification of this clause. The hon. member for Heilbron talked of community life. There is no concern on the part of the Government for the community life of people living in the urban areas. It was, therefore, not this reason which other hon. members on the other side, including the hon. the Deputy Minister, advanced for it. He encourages the views coming from hon. members behind him, views that this would stop the tsotsis and all other types of things. This is what was advanced by other hon. members opposite in justification for this clause and the hon. the Deputy Minister has not denied it. The fact is that this clause should be considered not only in relation to the contents of this Bill&#x2014;which is all I am allowed to discuss at this stage&#x2014;but also in relation to the original measure from which it was taken. It is only in that context that this Bill can be properly understood. Looked at in this way the contents of this Bill means that these people are not going to be regarded as permanent, although they are so in fact, nor as a community in the area but only as units of labour to be dealt with as you deal with any machine which is a unit of labour.</p>

<p>As far as local authorities are concerned, the hon. the Deputy Minister thought he produced his trump card when he said at the end of his second-reading reply that local authorities themselves admitted that they were agents of the Central Government. For this he produced a document written by the United Municipal Executive I think it was &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes. The hon. member for Houghton has reason to appreciate that. Now, I wonder what the word &#x201C;agent&#x201D; means in this context. Nobody has said that local authorities should be anything but being agents in so far as policy matters are concerned. Nobody has suggested that local authorities have the power to lay down policy. But since when are they the agents for the administration of this or any other law? Since when have local authorities been part of the administrative machinery of any Government Department? That has never been so. The reason why these municipalities have grown up differently is that in the different areas there are different problems with which only a local body can deal. And the only people who can administer this legislation, especially the Urban Areas Act, are the local authorities for the reason that they live with it; for the reason that all the problems attendant upon the administration of that Act <span class="col_8543-8544" refersTo="page_0520"/>are peculiar to a city. Surely the hon. the Deputy Minister knows that that is so. If he does not, he is going to learn this lesson if he is going to apply these standard regulations right throughout the country.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, it is not going to bounce back on the hon. the Deputy Minister or on this Government. It will bounce back on the local communities who are affected by this. Since time immemorial, at least since the White man has been in this country, these local authorities have administered the affairs of their local areas. The Government is based on the existence of those already well-developed institutions.</p>

<p>Perhaps the hon. member for Karas will give the House the benefit of his knowledge of these matters. But what is going to happen under this clause? This clause provides for a model set of standard regulations. But now we are going to find the backroom boys of the hon. the Deputy Minister in Pretoria making regulations to deal with a situation, or with a combination of situations, with an interplay of factors, of which they know nothing. Those regulations are never going to see the light of day. What is the point in our discussing a Bill here? We do so in order to bring to the light of day all the difficulties that are inherent in a situation. We do so in order to show what effects such a measure is going to have and in order to make it possible for the Minister in charge to listen to suggestions. But that is not going to be the procedure as far as the drawing up of these regulations is concerned. On the contrary. They are going to be drawn up by the backroom boys in Pretoria and nobody will ever have a chance of considering them.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister, I admit, makes provision in this legislation for consultation but if it is going to be a matter of Pretoria policy, then all this will fall by the board. What really worries me is not that this is something which might happen, but that the hon. the Deputy Minister has indicated that it is in fact going to happen. He anticipates having to use these clauses relating to local authorities, and very soon for that matter. So when one looks at this clause, one must see it in the light of what the Deputy Minister said about it. He said this clause was urgently necessary. Is it urgently necessary to upset the whole pattern of local authorities and the pattern of the administration of the urban Bantu?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron said that it was a very good thing to have these standard regulations because those Bantu who move from town to town will then know what the position is. I suppose one could, if one wanted to try, suck all sorts of reasons out of one&#x2019;s thumb. But does he also suggest that we should go so far as to standardize all by-laws of local authorities? That is an analogy. Does he suggest that? Does the hon. the Deputy Minister suggest it? Do they suggest that all by-laws should be standardized so that they can be applied to all races in the different cities throughout the country? If that is what they feel should be done, let them say so, so that we can know where we stand.</p>

<p>I want to obey your ruling, Mr. Speaker, and therefore I shall not take it any further. I want to say something about these urban Bantu councils. If they want to set up these bodies, they say they do so on the grounds that to do so would be extending democracy to the urban Bantu. On that they must accept a difference of opinion. If that is in fact their motivation, then there is no point whatsoever in passing legislation of this nature because if those councils do something which the Government does not like, they will be scrapped.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to say that this Bill is typical of the attitude of this Government to the urban Bantu. It is a half-baked measure, as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories pointed out. It is a stop-gap measure and if the Government cannot do better than this in so far as the urban Bantu are concerned, then it bodes ill for South Africa, and it is true that the Government made way for a party which is capable of dealing with the facts as they are.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to deal with Clause 1 of this Bill. I do not propose to go further than that. I want to deal with it particularly in the light of the contention which has again been made by the hon. member for Heilbron in the speech he made a little while back. In this speech he repeated what he said also in his speech during the second-reading debate. This clause deals with those Bantu in the rural areas who will not be allowed after the passing of this legislation to remain in the Republic unless they get a permit issued by the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development or by a person to whom he has delegated such authority. Such a person can, as I understand it, be the Native commissioner of the area concerned. The hon. member for Heilbron has again said in regard to these Bantu that they are illegal immigrants. The other day he said that every one of them was; he made no exception whatsoever.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that not only are they not illegal immigrants but that they are in fact South African citizens. That that is so, I have no doubt in my mind. I asked the hon. the Deputy Minister by way of interjection at one stage why he wanted to deal with them in terms of this clause if they were illegal immigrants. The Deputy Minister did give a reply but that did not answer my question. What he said was that this was an administrative matter. I do not want to misquote him and therefore I should like him to indicate now whether I am correct or not.</p>

Now this clause provides that they may no longer be here after the passing of this legislation. Why are they not dealt with in terms of our immigration laws or in terms of our citizenship laws? Why bring in this clause to say that on the passing of this legislation these Bantu may no longer stay on in the Republic? If they are here illegally, as the hon. member for Heilbron contended, then surely they should be dealt with under our citizenship laws dealing with the legality or otherwise of their position here, or under our immigration laws whereunder they can be ejected.</p>

<p>Why does he not look at the law and find out? You see, Sir, up to the passing of our Citizenship Act in 1949, we were in this regard governed by a different law altogether. In those days we were called &#x201C;Union nationals&#x201D;. British subjects who had resided within the boundaries of South Africa for two years did not in terms of the then existing law acquire naturalization papers.</p>

<p>There we are, Mr. Speaker! Now these Bantu were not British subjects! This just goes to show how right we are in our contention that this Bill is intended to get rid of people who to-day are citizens of the Republic of South Africa. The people who came from Basutoland were British subjects, were they not? Those who came from Southern Rhodesia were British subjects, were they not? Does the hon. member not know that?</p>

<p>I am not talking about Bechuanaland and Swaziland but apparently the hon. member is now admitting that we are correct when we say that those coming from Basutoland and Southern Rhodesia were British subjects. He does not know his brief at all, and yet he is a lawyer and I a poor farmer from the back veld! Yet he has to come here and learn something about the law from me. Does the hon. member deny that the Natives in Basutoland and Southern Rhodesia are British subjects? No, he cannot. The position is beyond any doubt that they were British subjects and so in terms of the law applicable in South Africa prior to 1949 these Bantu acquired the status of Union nationals in the same way as any other person did who was of a different colour.</p>

<p>Read our report.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with the law now and not with the report of the hon. member. The position then was that in so far as the law prior to 1949 was concerned, no discrimination was made against British subjects on the ground of colour. Consequently, the people who came here as Whites and as British subjects and acquired South African citizenship in terms of the then existing law, then became Union nationals. So did those who were not White. It has been argued in some quarters that a particular action was necessary so as to indicate the acceptance of South African nationality, because if they were Whites and were in the country for two years they could go on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. But that was not a formal acceptance of South African nationality. The man who acquired the status of a Union national without coming on the Voters&#x2019; Roll had the privilege of going on the Voters&#x2019; Roll as a result of the acquisition of his new status. The status did not follow upon his being placed on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. His privilege to go on the Voters&#x2019; Roll flowed from that fact that he had acquired a new status, i.e. that of a Union national. An African could not go on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. So what did the Government do? The Government gave them an identification pass which was exactly the same as the identification pass of our own Bantu and it made them pay taxes. In other words, the Government accepted them into the generality of the Bantu.</p>

<p>I say that I am convinced that in so far as the Bantu from Basutoland and from Southern Rhodesia are concerned who came here prior to the passing of the Citizenship Act in 1949 and who acquired Union nationality in terms of the then existing law, in so far as these Bantu are concerned we are now, in terms of this Bill, proposing steps to be able to say to them that they, who are citizens of South Africa, should no longer be in the Republic after this Bill has been signed by the State President. Otherwise they will act contrary to <span class="col_8547-8548" refersTo="page_0522"/>Clause 1 which lays down that they should be out of the country merely because they were born outside the country. Their acquisition of Union nationality and their compliance with the law applicable prior to the passing of the Citizenship Act in 1949 will therefore not protect them against such action. That is the reason for Clause 1. Otherwise, they could have been evicted under our immigration laws if they were here illegally. I think this is a shocking thing. The hon. the Deputy Minister should get up and tell us whether it is the intention under this clause to evict summarily those Natives who have acquired the status of citizens of the Republic of South Africa. If that is not the intention, I do not know what the reason is for the clause. That we can slip in a clause like this to deprive South African citizens&#x2014;I do not know how many of them there are in this category&#x2014;of their citizenship is a matter of such importance that if the hon. the Deputy Minister does not know the answer, he should withdraw the Bill and go into the matter very carefully before coming to this House and ask us to pass a measure of this kind. It is of too much importance to allow this measure, now that his attention has been drawn to its implications, to go forward without protection for our own citizens.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member who has just sat down objects to the third reading. If he had only read the memorandum covering the points that he has just made, he would not have lodged this objection because his objection rests on a completely wrong basis.

<p>If the hon. member will read the memorandum he will see that I am not wrong. I am sure that he does not want to suggest that the memorandum puts the position wrongly. The objection raised by the hon. member is a completely untimely one. Not only is it untimely but the objection raised by the hon. member in regard to what he fears will be the effect of this clause rests on completely wrong grounds. I do think that this is the time to guard against wrong impressions being created as far as the effect of this measure as such is concerned. Take, for example, the question of the city councils which has again been raised here this morning. The role of agent which the city council plays to the Government is in conformity with formulated legislation which we want to standardize more or less throughout South Africa. It is obvious that if the decisions of city councils are to be accepted as the last word on the subject, they will of necessity come into conflict with the law of the land. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) as a lawyer knows that every city council has its own legal adviser which advises it to act in a certain way. In other words, every city council is advised by its own law adviser and if the opinion of the city council is to be the deciding factor, we are going to have chaos throughout South Africa. They will inevitably come into conflict then with the Central Government and that means that it will not be possible to implement the law as it is interpreted by the law advisers to the Central Government. I think that these are a few matters that we ought to rectify at this stage and that is what I have tried to do to the best of my humble ability. The argument raised by the Opposition that the city council should be able to adopt a course which is in conflict with the policy of the Central Government in regard to Bantu affairs is an argument that does not hold water. On the contrary, if we accede to their requests, we will have nothing but chaos throughout South Africa in regard to Bantu affairs.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to deal with one point made by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) with regard to what is stated in the memorandum in regard to Clause 1. The statement to which he referred relates not only to the whole Bill but I think he said more particularly to Clause 1. I am in some difficulty in finding the reason for that statement because on the one hand it does protect&#x2014;to some extent&#x2014;the Bantu of South Africa in regard to employment, but employment in itself is a means of living and there is no great moral achievement in being employed. It is usually a matter of necessity, so I do not know where human dignity comes into the argument that by protecting the South African Bantu, we are achieving the human dignity of the individual. Of course, when you look at the position that has arisen already in regard to the presence of the &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; Native, then one has serious doubt as to whether one can talk of dignity at all, because their point of view and their problems are apparently not to be considered at all! The position, according to the hon. the Deputy Minister, is that there are 836,000 foreign Bantu in South Africa and many of them&#x2014;one does not need to labour the point&#x2014;have been here for many years. Their presence has been condoned, whether legally or otherwise&#x2014;I say legally. I think the argument of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) is irrefutable&#x2014;the presence of a person in a country having been condoned, whether by an act of condonation in the case of the foreign Bantu here, or by the process of naturalization you cannot put him back in the position in which he was originally&#x2014;and that is, an illegal immigrant. It <span class="col_8549-8550" refersTo="page_0523"/>cannot be done, not legally, not morally, and certainly if it is done no one can surely suggest that that is going to establish the dignity of that human being. Sir, quite fortuitously, within the last hour or two, I have received a letter which I intend to discuss with the hon. the Deputy Minister, a letter which illustrated this perfectly, the case of a Bantu, a Basuto, who has been living in Vereeniging for 17 years. He was a night watchman, and he happened to be going home after duty on the morning of the Sharpeville riots. He was unfortunately shot. He has been virtually paralysed since then, and after 17 years, with a wife and five children in Vereeniging, the local Bantu Administration said that he must get out, despite all the protests made there by people on both sides of the political fence, to the local administration. They say in effect that this man is not qualified under Section 12, and that is the law.</p>

<p>Sir, I do come back to this question of human dignity which this Bill establishes, and I assure you, Sir, that far from establishing anybody&#x2019;s human dignity, it merely creates human difficulties.</p>

<p>I want to say this in regard to the advantage which the hon. member says the White people derive from the presence of foreign Bantu. I do not for a moment suggest that the White people of South Africa have deliberately wanted to exploit the foreign Bantu, but if they have employed them and it has been in the interest of the White community&#x2014;their industries and their agriculture&#x2014;there does not seem to be anything particularly wrong with that. I would say that in this legislation as in all other legislation, the White people should also be taken into account, and I do not believe that their point of view has been taken into account at all in regard to Clause 1, save and except that there will be exemptions. This Bill, which is making a law which applies to everybody and then leaving that escape hatch open, that there shall be exemptions, merely establishes or further establishes the position where everything is within the discretion of a Government Department; you may do nothing unless you get an exemption to do it. I think we have already reached the position &#x2026;</p>

<p>I am speaking of Clause 1, Sir. However, I will not pursue that point. I do want to deal with the argument which has been advanced in connection with Clause 6. As you know, the basis of the support of Clause 6 has been that it, again, confers many benefits on the Bantu. Surely if family life is important you would expect paragraph (e) to provide that not more than two Natives employed full-time as <i>bona fide</i> domestic servants shall reside on the premises, because there are cases where a husband and wife have been employed by the same employer for many years. This Bill will make it impossible even for that married, that family life, to be continued. Is that the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s intention, despite his argument that he wants to ensure the family of the Bantu, quite apart from all the obvious difficulties of a person wanting to enjoy family life having to go back to a place to enjoy it, when that person, according to the experience in Johannesburg, will have had to get up at 5 o&#x2019;clock in the morning to be at work at 8 o&#x2019;clock, and will have to leave work at five, which is a reasonable hour, but will come home nearer nine than 8 o&#x2019;clock? What sporting amenities or other amenities is that person going to enjoy, amenities which are provided for the residents of the area? I think it is a fallacious and an unreasonable argument to advance. Then there is the statement in the memorandum which deals with Clause 6&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Bantu not otherwise exempted, who resides in an urban area, may be ordered to take up residence in a Bantu residential area or in a Bantu area or in a released area in that vicinity.</block>

<p>Sir, the word &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D; does not appear in the Bill at all; it only appears in the memorandum. &#x201C;Vicinity&#x201D; is a word which anyone can define arbitrarily according to his own likes. What is &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D;? We have had the argument, for example, from the hon. member for Vereeniging that Lenasia is in the &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D; of Johannesburg. I have demonstrated that from the post office to the centre of Lenasia, by car, it is 19.2 miles. That is not in the &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D; for people who have no motor car, who have to use public transport, or who have to walk or use a bicycle.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, if I am irrelevant, then obviously I cannot deal with either the memorandum or the Bill, but I am dealing with the memorandum which explains this clause in the Bill, and I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Deputy Minister to the fact that the explanation is that the Bantu will only be removed apparently to a place in the &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D;, which may be, according to our experience in Johannesburg, up to 20 miles away. The further statement that when a Bantu residential area or a Bantu area is situated &#x201C;inconveniently&#x201D; near, does not carry the matter any further in explaining paragraph (e). Whose convenience is being considered here? The convenience of the employee? Certainly not, because if it was convenient for the employee to live and work in a certain place, you would leave him to live and work there. It is not the convenience of the White employer, because it has been explained that the White employer must do without the service of the employees in certain circumstances. Therefore, for whose convenience is it? Does the Government itself, <span class="col_8551-8552" refersTo="page_0524"/>in an impersonal way, derive any benefit from this convenience? Sir, like other clauses in the Bill, it cannot be justified merely by the use of words like &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D; and &#x201C;convenience&#x201D;. I want to leave that point there and deal briefly with Clause 9. The point has been made, and I do not intend to labour it, that the position of the local authority will become extremely difficult under this clause, and we can only repeat our urgent request to the Minister to think again about this particular clause. We can ask him to do no more than that because we have advanced every argument that the municipal government, which has grown up in South Africa through the years and in respect of which, in some aspects of local government, there is far greater know-how and experience than there is in the Department of State concerned, should be left to develop in the way it has done, whereby it has done a great deal of good and has created no difficulty for the State whatsoever.</p>

<p>I think the only other clause to which I would like to refer you is Clause 26, which deals with the urban Bantu Councils and the Minister&#x2019;s power to disestablish them.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to say what has already been said. I say that the point was made that the Minister would not seek to apply standard regulations in regard to the administration of the White part of the municipal area. I want to say that once the Minister has established the right of his Department to disestablish an urban Bantu Council, I am not quite so sure that inherently the Government has not taken the power to disestablish a municipal council as well, because it is not a very, very long step. As I pointed out in the second-reading debate, you cannot detach or divorce the administration of Bantu affairs from the administration of a large local authority area to-day. You cannot put them in separate compartments&#x2014;although you attempt to do so&#x2014;because we know that as regards population, as regards labour and as regards all the factors which make a community, you cannot turn a blind eye to the affairs of the Bantu and say &#x201C;now we will deal only with the White aspect&#x201D;. As far as I am concerned, therefore, this opens the door to Government interference with the ordinary rights of a local authority by eventually disestablishing the municipality itself of a particular town when that municipality, according to the Government, does not conform with its policy. Therefore, all in all, despite the praise this Bill has received&#x2014;and I am surprised that this morning only one hon. member on the Government side, in fact, sang its praises&#x2014;despite all the praise which has been lavished on it, there is very little positive good in the Bill, and there is a great deal of positive harm that will result from it.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Strictly speaking I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything now because hon. members opposite have not raised any points at all in this third-reading debate which we have not disposed of during the previous stages of this Bill. But I suppose I will be expected to say a few words. I just want to confirm what the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) said just now. I can supplement the examples that he mentioned with a further few examples. I want to reiterate that this Bill is in fact characterized by positive measures in the interests and in favour of the Bantu. The hon. member mentioned five of them but there are more. You will remember that in my second-reading speech I strongly emphasized&#x2014;and I want to repeat it here&#x2014;that all 12 of the main provisions of this Bill which I dealt with will redound to the benefit of the Bantu, including the provision with regard to domestic servants, which may very well be the most important provision of all.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) said that under this Bill we were treating the foreign Bantu harshly. I deny that. What we are doing here is to take proper control measures in connection with the foreign Bantu. I have an assurance in this connection during the second-reading debate. I do not want to repeat those assurances now except to say that I stand by what I said.</p>

<p>In connection with the regulations, the hon. member for Transkeian Territories said that we would lose the co-operation of the local authorities, that we wanted to eliminate them and so forth. On the contrary, I want to tell hon. members opposite and I want to predict that as far as the local authorities are concerned, we will receive even more co-operation from them as regards the standardization of regulations than we have had up to the present. As hon. members know, there are a large number of local authorities throughout the country. We have known them over the years; we have had dealings with all of them and they also learn from one another. We are, as it were, the central bureau where, by standardizing regulations, all that experience of all the local authorities can be properly co-ordinated in the interests of everyone. I think that the Opposition are doing the local authorities more harm than good by what they have had to say here.</p>

<p>Hon. members of the Opposition have suggested that we are interfering with the autonomy of the local authorities. But hon. members know that the decisions of local authorities cannot clash with the law, and if they do clash because of ignorance on the part of a particular local authority or because of a lack of experience or whatever the reason may be, even if, as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories wants to suggest, they are motivated by malice&#x2014;and I do not accept that local authorities are deliberately malicious&#x2014;I say that if their decisions are in conflict with <span class="col_8553-8554" refersTo="page_0525"/>the law, this sort of provision which we are introducing in this Bill to assist them to take the right decision can only be to the good of Bantu administration and of the Bantu and not to their detriment. In these provisions we are dealing with measures in the interests of Bantu administration. We are not dealing here with measures for the aggrandizement of local authorities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) is not here now and I need not therefore say anything about her speech. I just want to say that I am very sorry that although she saw much good in this Bill and at one stage was prepared to be of assistance with a view to more being done, she eventually withheld her support for reasons of her own.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mithcell) has asked me how the city councils deal with exemptions for a second or third domestic servant to be housed on the premises. In the Bill itself certain indications are given. There is the question of the distance from the residential areas where the Bantu have to live. I also dealt with this in my second-reading speech. I said that local authorities would also have to take other things into consideration such as, for example, the merits of certain employers, their domestic circumstances, the question of sick people in need of care and so forth. All these things will have to be considered. But what does appear strange to me in this connection is that although it is very clearly stated in the Bill that it is the local authorities which will have to issue the licence for a second or third Bantu worker, the hon. member does not trust the local authority in this respect. He accuses us of introducing other provisions here, and, as he says, of refusing to trust the local authorities; he suggests that we want to interfere with their local autonomy; that we want to deal with them just as we please, when we say in this provision that it will be left to the local authority to decide whether the employer may accommodate a second domestic on his premises or not, the hon. member then tells us that the local authorities are not to be trusted to carry out this function! Which one of these two contradictory attitudes of the hon. member am I to accept? Sir, I leave it at that; I just wanted to prove to hon. members opposite how inconsistent they are.</p>

<p>I am afraid the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has a &#x201C;bee in his bonnet&#x201D;; he has a quarrel with the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). I think that they will have to settle it in some other way. I just want to remind the hon. member for South Coast once again of what I said during the second-reading debate and that is that this provision deals with labour control over foreign Bantu entering the country. We are not dealing here with immigration matters. It is very clearly stated that the foreign Bantu who are already here will have to ensure that their documents are endorsed administratively. Foreign Bantu coming into the country will have their documents endorsed to the effect that they are coming here to work, and they will be controlled in the same way in the rural areas in the future as they have been controlled in the urban areas in the past. In the past, that is to say, up to to-day, these Bantu could enter the country in order to work in the rural areas if they said that they wanted to work there. We are now providing that the same control which is exercised in the urban areas will have to be exercised in the rural areas. The mere fact that a foreign Bantu goes to work in the rural areas does not make him a South African subject. I have already stated during the second-reading debate and I want to repeat for the information of the hon. member that in terms of the Immigration Act provision is made for a distinction to be drawn between various classes of British subjects.</p>

<p>Bantu who have had to become South African subjects in the past have had to do so under other laws. They have not done so on a large scale, but that is not relevant here. We are dealing here with the presence of foreign Bantu in South Africa and the question of control over those foreign Bantu. That is perfectly clear. Just before I resume my seat I want to remind hon. members that the permits which foreign Bantu obtained in the past were all valid for six months only. They were all <span class="col_8555-8556" refersTo="page_0526"/>temporary permits. As soon as those permits lapsed, everything else in connection with that Bantu also lapsed.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying just two things: Hon. members of the Opposition always ask for references to things and when one gives them references, such as the names of places and the names of Bantu who agree with one, they poke fun at those places and those names. I deprecate that. Another thing that I want to say is that it has become perfectly clear&#x2014;during this third-reading debate as well&#x2014;that the United Party is retreating completely from its alleged policy of residential apartheid for the Bantu in the White areas.</p>

<heading>EXPROPRIATION ACT APPLICABLE TO S.A. COAL, OIL AND GAS CORPORATION</heading>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House declares that the South African Coal, Oil and Gas Corporation, Limited, is an undertaking to which the Expropriation (Establishment of Undertakings) Act, 1951 (Act No. 39 of 1951), as amended, applies.</block>

<p>Hon. members are probably aware that the Expropriation (Establishment of Undertakings) Act, 1951, provides in Section 2 that the Minister of Economic Affairs, at the written request of a person who has established an undertaking or intends establishing an undertaking which by resolution of both Houses of Parliament is declared to be an undertaking to which that Act is applicable, may allow such person to expropriate land for certain purposes&#x2014;amongst others, for the laying of a pipeline or anything else connected with it. Hon members will also remember that a year or two ago we had a similar motion here in connection with an oil company in Durban which wanted to build a refinery and which also asked to be declared an undertaking to which this Act applied so that it (the company) could have the right to expropriate land to build a pipeline from the harbour to the refinery and a rail connection from the refinery to the railway line. This House agreed to give the oil company that right.</p>

<p>The motion now before the House is that Sasol be declared to be an undertaking to which the relevant Act shall apply so that Sasol will have the right, with the consent of the Minister, to expropriate land for the building of a pipeline under certain conditions. The reason for this request is that Sasol is working out a plan for the manufacture of industrial gas on a large scale. When Sasol starts manufacturing that industrial gas it will be desirable for that gas to be conveyed by means of a pipeline to the South Rand areas&#x2014;that is, the Vaal triangle, Meyerton, Alberton, Germiston, further east up to Springs and north up to Kempton Park. In order to be able to <span class="col_8557-8558" refersTo="page_0527"/>do this work and to be able to lay this pipeline, Sasol will need these expropriation powers. I am not asking now for approval for the large-scale manufacture of gas by Sasol. That is not under discussion here. This scheme has been submitted to the Government. The Government is considering it from all angles and will arrive at a decision shortly. All we want is this: If Sasol proceeds to manufacture gas, we want it to have the right of expropriation for the laying of this pipeline to the South Rand, to the East Rand and also to the North Rand. This pipeline will extend over about 90 miles. Some of the land involved will be farmland, other land will be municipal land and certain other land belongs to mining companies and companies such as Sasol and Foscor themselves.</p>

<p>If Sasol does start manufacturing gas on a large scale, the merits of which we are not discussing at this stage, the idea is too that the distribution of that gas will later on be undertaken by a utility company to be established on more or less the same basis as that on which Escom is established at the moment. Sasol will only do the preparatory work. As soon as this preparatory work has been completed, these rights which are now being given to Sasol will be transferred to the company which is to be established, and legislation in this regard will be submitted to this House next year.</p>

<p>I think that is the only information that I can give hon. members at the moment. I just want to repeat that this is what Sasol plans to do; that this plan has been considered by the Government which has to issue the licence; that this motion has nothing to do with the plan as such, but merely deals with the laying of the pipeline and the right that will be given to Sasol to expropriate land if it becomes necessary to do so for the laying of this pipeline on the Rand.</p>

<p>We on this side of the House will support this motion. I would ask the hon. the Minister a question. He mentioned that an authority would be formed to deal with the sale of the gas throughout the whole Reef area or wherever else it can reach if and when the venture proves successful. Has the Minister anything in mind in regard to Johannesburg? Johannesburg is producing its own gas at the moment but if Sasol gas can finally be produced more cheaply obviously some negotiations will have to take place. Would it be the intention then to put Johannesburg under the control of this new utility company?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are not discussing the merits of the matter, as the hon. the Minister has explained. But here we are being asked to give this company which is really a subsidiary of the I.D.C., special privileges. I am not going to discuss the question whether the new company to be established in Johannesburg is one of which we approve or not; we are not concerned about that. I want to emphasize again as I emphasized yesterday that the time has arrived when we in this House should have accountability to this House by any public enterprise of this kind. Yesterday we voted R21,000,000. We are told: Vote the money and after that you will have no say over it; you will have no say as to how it is to be spent.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister a simple question: Is there any objection to it? The Standing Rules and Orders Committee, as I explained yesterday, are going to say that our Select Committees should be restricted to 15 members. We have one for Public Accounts and one for Railways. Is there any reason why we should not have a Select Committee to report to this House on the expenditure of money by, and the policy of, public utility corporations? I am not saying this in a critical spirit, Sir, but this House should be informed on what is happening; it should have something more than the annual reports. I ask the hon. the Minister, while this new scheme is going through, to give this his very, very serious consideration.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as regards the point raised by the hon. member for Benoni, there is no decision yet. The original idea is to serve the southern Transvaal, the eastern Transvaal and the Witwatersrand. I think there have been negotiations between Johannesburg and Sasol on this matter. I think Sasol is completely open to any request on the part of Johannesburg to provide gas to Johannesburg. But this is not for us to decide, it is for this authority that is to be established eventually to decide after negotiations with Johannesburg. It is possible.</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, in terms of Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1955 approves of the notes exchanged between the Government of the Republic of South Africa and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland on 27 February 1963 in confirmation of the agreement of the Government of the Republic of South Africa to an amendment of the Trade Agreement of 16 May 1960 between the two Governments regarding the Federal content of cigarettes imported into the Republic and admitted under a partial rebate of the duty, and copies of which were laid upon the Table on 27 May 1963.</block>

<p>In terms of the trade agreement of 16 May 1960 between the Republic and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland cigarettes <span class="col_8559-8560" refersTo="page_0528"/>manufactured in the Federation are subject, when imported into the Republic, to most-favoured-nation treatment as far as the import duty is concerned applicable to cigarettes from time to time minus a rebate on such import duty of 105c per 1,000 cigarettes. In paragraph 7 of the agreement goods manufactured in the Federation are defined as goods in respect of which at least 25 per cent of the factory and workshop costs have been paid out in the form of wages or for material produced in the Federation. This definition, namely, that 25 per cent qualifies a product to be taken as a product manufactured in the Federation, means that cigarettes manufactured in the Federation and which contain a considerable percentage of imported tobacco, qualify for favoured tariff treatment in the Republic. As against that it was never the intention of the two Governments that the South African tariff concession on cigarettes manufactured in the Federation should also apply to cigarettes containing a high percentage of imported tobacco. The Federal Government therefore, requested the South African Government last year to agree to it that the agreement be changed so as to provide that the percentage of Federal leaf tobacco which cigarettes manufactured in the Federation must contain in order to qualify for the tariff concessions in the Republic must be that percentage decided upon by the two Governments from time to time. The Government acceded to the request and the two Governments exchanged notes in order to confirm the agreement which they had come to in this connection, and the House is now being asked to approve this exchange of notes.</p>

<p>For the information of hon. members I may just add that flowing from this exchange of notes the two Governments have come to an agreement that until such time as they decide otherwise, only cigarettes containing 100 per cent Federal leaf tobacco and manufactured in the Federation would qualify for the tariff concession.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, in terms of Section 77 of the Customs Act, 1955, approves of the notes exchanged between the Governments of the Republic of South Africa and the United Kingdom on 16 August 1962 in confirmation of the agreement of the Government of the Republic of South Africa to the elimination of the tariff preference which the Republic enjoys in the United Kingdom on certain boxwood logs in terms of the Ottawa Trade Agreement of 20 August, 1932 between the two Governments, copies of which were laid upon the Table on 30 April 1963.</block>

<p>The Ottawa trade agreement of 20 August 1932 between South Africa and the United Kingdom provides that South Africa will enjoy a preferential margin of 10 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> on boxwood and also that it can export this product to the United Kingdom free of customs duty. That agreement is, therefore, a guarantee to South Africa that boxwood imported by Britain from South Africa will be allowed to enter that country free of customs duty whereas similar imports from other non-Commonwealth countries are subject to an import duty of 10 per cent <i>ad valorem.</i> This preferential margin of 10 per cent has already been partly abolished at two stages. That was done in 1960 and 1961 by way of two separate sets of an exchange of notes between the South African and the British Governments in terms of which the South African Government agreed to it that the British Government could gradually decrease its 10 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> customs duty on imports of boxwood from other member countries of the European Free Trade Association and Finland respectively in order to give effect to Britain&#x2019;s obligations as a member state of the European Free Trade Association. These two sets of exchange of notes were approved of by Parliament in the years 1961 and 1962 respectively. In the meantime the British Government has requested the South African Government to see to it that this preferential treatment of boxwood blocks of certain dimensions were whittled down so as to enable the British pulp and paper manufacturers to import all types of wood processed in their factories in block form, of which boxwood formed an insignificant percentage, free of customs duty from all other countries. I may just mention that South Africa has never exported any appreciable quantity of boxwood to Britain. As a matter of fact during the past three years for which official export figures are available, we never exported more than R5,000 worth per annum. According to the Department of Afforestation our boxwood supplies are very limited and there is no possibility of expanding our export trade to any appreciable extent. It is clear, therefore, that the loss of this preferential treatment for all practical purposes will have no adverse effect on South Africa&#x2019;s export trade. The Government felt, therefore, that the local interests would not suffer any appreciable loss if this preferential tariff treatment of wood in block form, as far as Britain was concerned, was abolished and it thus decided to accede to the request of the British Government. The exchange of notes which we are to-day submitting to the House for approval confirms the Government&#x2019;s acquiescence to this request.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House, in terms of Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1955, approves of the most-favoured-nation Trade Agreement between the Governments of the Republic of South Africa and Spain which was signed in Cape Town and came into operation on 8 February 1963 and copies of which were laid upon the Table on 5 April 1963.</block>

<p>So far South African exporters have not done a great deal to exploit the possibilities of the Spanish market for their exports. In spite of that there are fair possibilities for the development of our export trade with that country, particularly in view of the fact that Spain has been experiencing a considerable economic upsurge lately. The Government has for a considerable time been investigating the possibilities of the Spanish market for South African exports and of bringing those possibilities to the notice of the South African exporters. Thus, for example, the South African trade mission which visited certain European countries in 1961 also visited Spain and the trade representative of the Republic in Paris has also been accredited in Madrid with the deliberate object of promoting the sale of South African goods in Spain. The Spanish Government on their part have continually during the past year contended that a trade agreement between Spain and the Republic would be favourable to Spanish exports to South Africa which in turn would enable Spain to export more to South Africa. The Spanish Government pointed out that in view of the fact that Spanish goods were not entitled to mostfavoured-nation tariff treatment in the Republic those goods were subject to the maximum duty under our tariffs which made it impossible for the Spanish exporters to compete successfully with the exporters from other countries who enjoyed most-favoured-nation treatment in the Republic. Although Spain does not levy discriminatory customs duty on South African goods its import control system and other measures relating to imports are of such a nature that it can discriminate against individual countries from which it imports. In order to increase South Africa&#x2019;s exports to Spain it is essential, therefore, for the Government to get an undertaking from the Spanish Government that the latter will not apply these measures in such a way that they will discriminate against South African goods. In view of these considerations, and also the traditional friendship which exists between the two countries in various spheres the Government has acceded to the request of the Spanish Government that a most-favoured-nation trade agreement be concluded between the two countries. The agreement entered between them which is now submitted to this House for its approval, embodies reciprocal assurances in respect of both the tariff treatment the two countries will extend to each other and the treatment they will extend to each other&#x2019;s goods in terms of their non-tariff measures.</p>

<p>In the past South Africa&#x2019;s exports to Spain have not increased at the desired rate. From 1957 to 1959 our exports to that country have annually been less than R2,000,000. In 1960, however, the total value was R3,800,000 and R5,400,000 in 1961 but in 1962 it again dropped to R3,900,000. In terms of the trade agreement between the two countries the exporters from the Republic now have the assurance that their goods will enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment in Spain in respect of both import duty and non-tariff measures. In view of this I hope they will make renewed efforts to penetrate the Spanish market. My Department is prepared to assist them in their efforts as far as possible.</p>

The hon.

I think it would help commerce and industry in general if further information could be given. That may help those who are anxious to extend their trade with Spain, and I hope that the hon.

<p>I can give the hon. member a survey of the items, the commodities of trade between South Africa and Spain. As regards our exports to Spain, the main item consists of metals and ores. For the year 1961 in which our exports to Spain amounted to R5,400,000 approximately, we exported to Spain metals and ores for about R3,500,000. The next item was hides and skins, just over R1,000,000, wool and mohair approximately R700,000. These are the main items of our exports to Spain. I think in respect of all these items and many <span class="col_8563-8564" refersTo="page_0530"/>others we could increase our exports to Spain. From Spain we imported mainly textile goods. I think perhaps Spain could deliver more textile goods to us under this most favoured nation treatment. Then also foodstuffs &#x2026;</p>

<p>Our whole textile industry is still protected. We have our tariff protection against imports from all countries. Spain will get no more favourable treatment than any other country. So I do not think it will affect us in any case. We will only get a greater diversity and we will import from more countries, or rather will import more from Spain perhaps than we did in the past and perhaps we will import less from other countries, but it could not really affect our industry because it is protected. The importation of textile goods from Spain amounted to approximately R600,000, and then foodstuffs, tartaric acid and cork&#x2014;these are the main items we imported from Spain.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. J. VAN WYK</person>:</from>

<p>The longer I remain in this House, the less I understand the mentality and the actions of the Opposition. Last evening we had the experience here that they launched an attack in the first place upon the report of the commission of inquiry into safety in the mines. Unless I misunderstand them, in the second place the hon. member for Germiston (District) attacked the Pneumoconiosis Act of last year. I will be excused for saying that I cannot be blamed if I regard them as politically dense, because we regard this report of the commission of inquiry into safety in the mines as a valuable report. We want to pay tribute to the Minister for already having to a large extent given effect to the recommendations of this report. Those which have not as yet been given effect to are about to be given effect to, or they will be given effect to in the spirit of the recommendations. I think the Opposition really had this object in view, namely to step into the breach for the person who really was responsible for the position which had developed and which led to the inquiry that took place. I now wish to put the matter in very elementary language for the benefit of members. We must view this report in this light, and judge it in this way. Mining is dangerous work. We agree on that. Precautions must constantly be taken to prevent accidents and to safeguard the workers against undue exposure to mineral dust. In the third place the safety measures are the burden and the duty of the mine owners. In the fourth place there must be supervision to ensure that the safety measures are carried out and applied. In this respect we have three groups of interests in this country. They are the mine owners, the employees and the State. They are represented by the Chamber of Mines, by the Trade Unions and by the division of the Government mining engineer. It is very essential that there should be the closest co-operation and mutual confidence between these three bodies. In this regard the Government mining engineer occupies the key position. It is an important post carrying great responsibilities. I should like to summarize the duties of the Government mining engineer as follows: The Government mining engineer is the guardian of the health and safety of all workers in mines and works. It is his responsibility and his duty. But viewed from the angle of the mineworker, the best guarantee against mine accidents and the contracting of an occupational disease is an effective system of supervision and control. The Government mining engineer occupies the exceptional position of being able to call the one to account, and to gain and to retain the confidence of the other. He must call the mine owner to account and can thereby gain the confidence of the mineworker and retain it. All this places upon the shoulders of the Government Mining Engineer a great and responsible task. We agree with that. Inferences drawn from this report show that. Apart from the fact that I have not really found any fault with the technical skill of the division of the Government mining engineer, I am entitled to draw these inferences: namely that the Government mining engineer failed to instil confidence and to command respect. The Government mining engineer failed to be the ideal link between the three interested bodies concerned in the matter. As a result, a sense of suspicion and mistrust arose among the mineworkers. According to my inference, it was quite justified too. We appreciate that at the present time attempts are being made to put right the mistakes of the past seven years. We appreciate the fact that those mistakes have been traced and that they have been disclosed to the country and to the House. For that reason we appreciate the fact that the recommendations made have largely been given effect to. We cannot get away from the fact that we can attribute all our troubles and all our problems of the past seven years and more, as far as mining is concerned, to the sense of mistrust and lack of confidence created by the division of the Government mining engineer. I really expected that a little appreciation would have been shown last night for what has already been done by the acting Government mining engineer. We expected the hon. member <span class="col_8565-8566" refersTo="page_0531"/>for Germiston (District) to mention that the present efficiency of the division in ensuring safety can be attributed to the zeal of the staff, particularly the acting incumbent of the post of the Government mining engineer. We owe him a great debt of thanks and appreciation for what has already been achieved in this respect under his guidance and under his efficient management. But I should like to emphasize this again and say: If this report is analysed, we must attribute all our troubles to the fact that the division of the Government mining engineer failed to instil confidence and to command respect. Proof of this can be found in paragraphs 23 and 24 of this report. In paragraph 23 it is stated very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This commission finds as a fact that the supervision exercised by the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s division over the mining industry is, and has been for a number of years, inadequate for its purpose, and that, but for the vigilance of the industry itself, life and limb in the mines would have been exposed to intolerable danger.</block>

<p>Paragraph 24 goes further and says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission mentions some of the features of the supervision which indicate deterioration.</block>

<p>The division of the Government mining engineer is responsible for this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; widespread loss of confidence by workers in the competence and integrity of the division; increasing loss of prestige by the mining industry; lack of discipline: thorough routine inspections of mines are too infrequently carried out; no systematic inspection of mines; almost complete absence of inspection of mine plans for accuracy: wholly inadequate dust sampling, resulting in some cases in the <i>ex post facto</i> declaration of mines as controlled mines: inadequacy of staff in almost all ranks: lack of leadership from the highest to the lowest ranks in the division, with many signs of suspicion and disloyalty. These, and other, factors all played a part in bringing about the almost complete failure of the division to meet the crisis precipitated by the Coalbrook disaster.</block>

<p>We appreciate, that, Mr. Chairman, and we wish to congratulate the Minister for having already proceeded to give effect to the recommendations contained in this report. If the recommendations are applied, it will obviate all the unpleasantness we have experienced in recent years. It ought to create a spirit of mutual trust and co-operation which will promote the welfare of the worker and the interests of the employer. It will enable the division of the Government mining engineer to raise its office to the position of trust it ought to hold in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Welkom (Mr. H. J. van Wyk) has adopted a completely wrong approach as regards our attitude towards the report. We welcome it. We have never welcomed a report more than we welcome this document because this report officially discloses what we have contended for a long time, namely that there is something radically wrong in &#x201C;the State of Denmark&#x201D; as far as the Department of Mines is concerned. We have maintained from time to time that the responsibility for that state of affairs lies with the previous Ministers of Mines who were strongly influenced by two individuals&#x2014;the then Secretary to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and this inspector who, for purposes of respect, we shall refer to as Mr. X. These two men were dominating the whole Department of Mines, and the Government mining engineer was not master in his own house. Sir, we welcome the new incumbent of this office, Mr. Gibbs. We wish him all good luck and success. He has started with the favourable position that he has not got these two men pointing a finger at him the whole time and threatening him. Ellis is no longer in the position to do any threatening. He is no longer Secretary of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. Inspector X is under suspension. If the Government carries out the recommendations of the second interim report in which they recommend that this man should be dismissed from the service, they will be doing the mining industry a good turn. From that point of view, sir, the Government mining engineer starts off with a very favourable position. We wish him luck. It is absolutely essential in the interests of the mineworkers of this country that there should be peace, stability and confidence in the industry. I should like to make a further plea on behalf of the new incumbent of this office, and ask the hon. the Minister if he is prepared to carry out the recommendations contained in paragraphs 84, 85 and 86 of this report. We find a very interesting position here. The Legislature never ever envisaged that any Minister of Mines should be able to influence any policy decisions of the Government mining engineer. The Legislature always wanted to regard the Government mining engineer in exactly the same position as our Controller and Auditor-General is&#x2014;free from any influence from any Minister. That is why the Legislature provided that the Government mining engineer shall be appointed by the State president. He can only be dismissed by the State President. We submit, sir, that the two previous Ministers of Mines had no right whatsoever in interfering in any of the decisions or policies of the Government mining engineer.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was dealing with the position, as revealed in this report of the Commission of Inquiry, in connection with the relationship between the Government mining engineer and the Minister of Mines. I maintain that it is absolutely <span class="col_8567-8568" refersTo="page_0532"/>clear from the findings of this Commission that in terms of the Gold Law, the Minister of Mines has no right whatsoever to bring the Government mining engineer under his dictation. This is what the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Gold Law leaves no doubt that the Government mining engineer is not subject to the direction of the Minister of Mines.</block>

<p>Then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The organization of the Division must in the opinion of this commission be the unrestricted prerogative of the Government mining engineer, subject only to the supervision of the Governor-General-in-Council. We recommend accordingly.</block>

<p>I was very concerned to note that one of the recommendations which one imagined the Deputy Minister of Mines should have read out yesterday as having been immediately accepted by his Department, was not accepted; and that is this very important recommendation that there cannot, and must not, be any interference by the Minister of Mines in his dealings with the Government mining engineer. I think this was a first-class conception on the part of our Legislature. It was meant to put the Government mining engineer in exactly the same position as the Auditor-General so that no influence whatsoever can be brought to bear on him and so that he can be master of his own home. Sir, talking about being the master in his own home, I mentioned instances yesterday to show the undue and the unnecessary interference by the then Ministers of Mines in the working of the Government mining engineers department. I want to refer to two others; I refer to the fact that the then Minister of Mines was bulldozed&#x2014;and I use the word advisedly&#x2014;by Ellis into appointing an <i>ad hoc</i> committee immediately after the Coalbrook disaster. The Minister was informed that that committee was <i>ultra vires</i> his powers, that it was unconstitutional, but he went ahead and appointed it. On that <i>ad hoc</i> committee he appointed this self-same inspector who had been causing all this trouble in the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s department. It was only when the mining industry, as such, warned the Minister that this committee was <i>ultra vires,</i> that it was disbanded. Sir, what else did the Minister do? Over the head of the Government mining engineer a &#x201C;flying squad&#x201D; of one man was appointed to undertake investigations, and this one man, needless to say, was this self-same inspector. What did this man do? Without justification&#x2014;and I say this advisedly&#x2014;he closed up numerous coal mines, or sections of coal mines and brought chaos and crises in the industry; he caused power stoppages throughout the country. He caused a loss of &#x00A3;250,000 per day in gold production, and when these decisions were taken on appeal to a court of law they were practically all thrown out. I would like the Minister to tell me in how many cases handled by this Inspector X and which were taken on appeal, the court ruled in favour of this inspector. In how many cases was his action vindicated? If the Minister can give me two such cases it will be a lot. I would question the Minister why he has not carried out what use to be a matter of routine procedure in previous years. Neither he nor his predecessor, Mr. de Klerk, nor Dr. van Rhyn, saw fit to make regular routine tours with the Government mining engineer to the various mining inspectorates. When last, if ever, did the present Minister make such a tour with his Government mining engineer? When did the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor do it, and when, if ever, did Dr. van Rhyn do it. How many times in the last six years has the Government mining engineer been allowed to visit his Minister of Mines? I will tell you, Sir. In six years, he saw him three times! The rest of his activities had to be done by correspondence. Is that a satisfactory state of affairs in the interests of the safety of 652,000 mineworkers? That is the number of times that the Government mining engineer saw his Minister, and his Minister came to see him six times in seven years. Is that the way to run a Department? What has been the upshot of all this? The upshot has been that the miners have now got to know what has taken place. And what have they done? Sir, I want to ask the Minister whether quite recently he has not had a resolution sent to him by the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union expressing no confidence in him? Did Minister de Klerk at the same time have a motion of no-confidence in him sent to him by the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union Executive? Were copies of those letters not sent to the Prime Minister? I would like the Minister to tell me whether that is correct or not. I want to know from the Minister why he is not prepared to disclose the second Interim Report. The flimsy excuse which he has given&#x2014;that it refers to three individuals&#x2014;is not good enough. Alternatively, I ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to let the hon. the Leader of the Opposition see that report? Will he be prepared to let the Leader of the Opposition see the evidence that was given <i>in camera</i> by the Government mining engineer, in spite of the protests from the Government engineer. He asked that this evidence be given in public but they refused to let him do it. I want to ask the Minister of Mines whether in either of those two reports any reference is made to the unstable condition of the ground at the West Driefontein Mine, where that terrible disaster took place in December 1962? Were representations made to the Department of Mines that legislation should be introduced in order to prevent the underground water from the West Driefontein Mine and other mines in that area accumulating on the surface of the farmers&#x2019; land? What was done in that regard? I want to refer to a statement which appears in the Annual Report of the Government mining engineer for the year ended 31 December 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sinkholes.&#x2014;In the Carltonville and Westonaria portions of the Inspectorate, sinkholes on the surface continue to give cause <span class="col_8569-8570" refersTo="page_0533"/>for concern &#x2026; Up to the moment they have fortunately not resulted in any casualities. They are often caused by allowing water to flow across, or accumulate on, the surface above dolomitic strata. When encountered this is discouraged or prohibited.</block>

<p>Have representations not been made to the hon. the Minister, either by the mining industry or the previous Government mining engineer, to introduce legislation in order to enable the mines to canalize that water away so as not to have it spread all over the surface and subsequently percolate through and wash away the soft soil below. Was it not on the representations of farmers in that area, that the Minister was not prepared to take action?[Time limit.]</p>

I can only say &#x201C;doubtful prilege&#x201D; after hearing him here this afternoon. Mr. Chairman, I immediately return to the Vote. The hon. member has spoken to the Mines Vote. The hon. member had the audacity to mention the names of people who do not have the opportunity to defend themselves here. This afternoon the hon. member acted in a manner which may be parliamentary, and for that reason you permitted him to do so, but there are other moral standards that count, and the hon. member has not had regard to those. I should like to know where the hon. member got his information from in regard to what he knows about the second interim report. I shall also be glad if he will have the courage to tell us where he got his information from that the Minister refused to act, and the number of occasions upon which the Minister of Mines saw certain people and went on a tour with them. However, he does not have the manliness or the courtesy to tell us where he got his information from, he merely makes disguised accusations. I regard that as most deplorable. [Interjections.]</p>

I have every reason, without apologizing for it, to pay tribute and to express my thanks and my appreciation, not my personal appreciation but that of the mineworkers whom I represent, to the Minister for his timely action in appointing a commission to inquire into safety in our mines. Nothing proves the timely appointment of this commission more than the very contents of this report. The hon. members of the Opposition are not happy about this.

<p>I am very pleased that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) says &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;, because he is really, not theoretically but in practice, the leader of the United Party. If I have followed this debate correctly up to this stage, then those hon. members are using this Vote only for the purpose of making a little puerile political capital out of it. I say that in debates of this nature the safety of the mineworker must be the main consideration and persons must not be protected. If there are persons who jeopardize the safety of the mineworker by their negligence, irrespective of who those persons may be, we cannot retain them in their positions. This whole report testifies to that. The hon. member for Welkom (Mr. H. G. van Wyk) has referred to paragraph 24 of this report. It contains much of importance to me. It shows how in past years, before the Coalbrook disaster occurred, confidence was lost in the department of the mining engineer. I am not talking about a person; I am talking about a principle. It is immaterial to me who that person is. I am not mentioning names here. I hope hon. members will agree with me when I say that if any person who occupies this position does not gain the confidence of the mineworker owing to his actions, steps should be taken against such a person. If that hon. member were a businessman I would ask him whether he would retain the services of a manager if a commission for which he has the greatest respect were to submit such a report on that manager?</p>

<p>I repeat that we are concerned here with the safety of the mineworker. I should like to say something here this afternoon and that is that I regard the mineworker as a very special person, not necessarily because he is a different kind of person from any other person, but because he works under special conditions. He works for two reasons: In the first place, it is his livelihood; he has to work there; he earns his livelihood 6,000-8,000 feet underground. <span class="col_8571-8572" refersTo="page_0534"/>In the second place, he renders a special service to the country. He has to be regarded otherwise than the worker above ground. I hope my friends opposite who also represent mineworkers agree with my proposition.</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. member for Springs last night, this morning, and even after the lunch-hour. His attitude does not reveal concern for the mineworker but only for an individual.</p>

<p>I do not propose to follow either the hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) or the hon. gentleman who spoke previously on that side of the House except to say that both of them seem to me to be more concerned with protecting the Minister than with thinking of the unfortunate mineworkers who work underground and of those whose lives have been lost. They also seem to have failed to appreciate the gravity of the report. Somewhere in the report, I think on page 17, it says that there was panic, a near panic, in the Government Department. Imagine the state of affairs, Sir, if a judicial commission can put into print that a Department of the Government was in a state of near panic. Another thing that this report says is that the onus of responsibility for the care and safety of the mineworkers rests on the shoulders of the Government mining engineer. He cannot be divested of it. But it goes further and it says that because he carries that responsibility he must be given a free hand. It is at that point where the two hon. Ministers who worked with this gentleman during this period completely failed to appreciate how to treat a professional man acting in a professional capacity.</p>

<p>Did you know how to treat a man in 1937?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what is past is past. I am not prepared to go back to 1937. It is true that the white-anting probably began in 1937 but its effects have been carrying on over the past seven or eight or nine years. They have steadily worsened. I saw in the newspaper a few days ago that there were two deaths a day in the mines. That is the average. You will appreciate, Sir, that it is a terrible state of affairs that in a great industry like this we have arrived at a point where there is an average of two deaths per day. And it comes about purely and entirely from the failure of the Minister to appreciate how to treat a professional man, how to allow him to act as a professional man when carrying out professional duties.</p>

<p>There is only one recommendation which is really important in this report and it is one of those which the Government, again failing to appreciate the fact, has failed to implement, and that is the first recommendation of the commission which says: &#x201C;The status of the Government mining engineer should be restored to the pre-1937 level.&#x201D; Secondly, Sir, we have the failure of the Government to appreciate the changing face of the Civil Service, something which is happening all over the world. The days when a well-educated man could enter the Civil Service and by dint of time and by dint of experience could learn to run a Department are gone. These great Departments like Health, Mines, Water Affairs and Veterinary Services where professional men are required need a change in plan. It has been worked out in the Western countries that it is no longer satisfactory, as it was in the early days of the century. Any intelligent man with a little education who joined the Senior Civil Service could be posted to any ministry and could confidently set about acquiring the necessary knowledge of the particular technology involved. Seldom would this take him longer than a year. Thereafter he was well equipped to make decisions advised from time to time by technical experts. The position has changed out of all recognition. Policy must be settled by the Minister but professional men must deal with professional problems. The great characteristic of the professional man is that he carries his own responsibility; he carries his own responsibility for his actions. He must be permitted to do so. We had the good fortune in 1908, in the early part of the century, to have a far-seeing Government in the Transvaal. They made rules for the mining engineer. They appreciated what this Government does not appreciate to-day and what the Ministers do not appreciate. They said in effect: This man must be appointed by the head of the State and only the head of the State can deal with him; <span class="col_8573-8574" refersTo="page_0535"/>he must be given a free hand; if he falls down he is responsible for his own actions. This Minister and the previous Minister, however, interfered with this man. They lowered his status. They did not even allow him to choose his own subordinates or to have a say in the choosing of his own subordinates. Any man who carries the lives of other people in his hand must be allowed to act on his own responsibility; the Minister does not carry those lives in his hands. It is there where this Minister has fallen down and where his predecessor has fallen down. They have shown a complete and crass ignorance of the way in which they should allow responsible people to act responsibly. It is a very curious thing in this Government that the two men who should be looking after the lives of people are both given two portfolios. The same state of affairs exists in the Health Department. Both these Ministers have been given two onerous Departments.</p>

<p>Very well, Sir.

It is time that the whole set-up of the professional Departments of this Government were reorganized. It is a tragedy, not a tragedy from which good may not perhaps come, that this should have happened. This accumulation of tragedies over the years culminating in the Coalbrook disaster has drawn attention to the grave defect in the service organization of this country. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban Central (Dr. Radford) said that the post of the Government mining engineer should be regarded as a wholly professional post, and that there should not be any control or supervision on the part of the Minister. Now let us look at the finding of the commission itself in this connection. In paragraphs 41 and 42 reference is made to the appointment of the Government mining engineer by the State President. It continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">His main duties were laid down by Act of Parliament in the widest terms, which could not be varied by regulation or by Ministerial instruction. He had to perform his duties without reference to the Minister of Mines.</block>

<p>That is what the commission found: He had to perform his duties even without reference to the Minister. The interpretation is that he need not refer to the Minister at all. The hon. member for Durban (Central) says it is correct. But the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) comes along and says they did not refer to each other sufficiently. What do they want now? They do not themselves know what they want. On the one hand the hon. member for Durban (Central) rises and says he must be independent, like a professional man, and then the hon. member for Springs says they did not consult each other sufficiently and he mentions the few occasions on which they saw each other; he is quite wrong there. In paragraph 42 the commission says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The ultimate blame for avoidable accidents, such as that at Coalbrook North, must be ascribed to the Government mining engineer and not to any subordinate, nor to the Minister of Mines.</block>

<p>The commission says that is the position. But when the commission finds in para. 24 that there are many things wrong, among other things that other factors contributed to the almost complete failure of the division to meet the crisis precipitated by the Coalbrook disaster, in other words, if there is a crisis, then the hon. member is not satisfied that the Government mining engineer should have the sole responsibility without reference to the Minister, then the hon. member rises and says &#x201C;there was near panic in the Government Department&#x201D;; not in the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s department where he has sole responsibility, but in the whole Department of State. So, when things are going well, then it is the Government mining engineer, but when things go wrong with the Government mining engineer, then the Government is to blame. That is the conclusion to which the hon. member has come.</p>

<p>The commission found that as regards the safety of the mines he should act without reference to the Minister, without consultation. But what if he does not act? Has the hon. member read the finding in paragraph 11? There the finding is that there had been complaints about gas and that the then Government mining engineer did not comply with the regulations. The commission found that the people for whose safety he was responsible were dissatisfied. They received no satisfaction. What are they to do then? To whom must they go then? Surely it is right that they should go to the Minister. To whom else could they go? Or does the hon. member want them to go to the State President and say: &#x201C;Look, here is a Government mining engineer who does not take action; will you please intervene Must the State President <span class="col_8575-8576" refersTo="page_0536"/>now intervene in administrative matters? Surely he knows that is not the function of the State President. Nor was it the function of the Governor-General.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask a question? The hon. the Minister has referred to paragraph 11. The inspector who was appointed over the head of the existing inspector to institute the inquiry submitted his report. That report was forwarded to the Minister. Was it ever referred to the Government mining engineer or to the trade union concerned?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was. It was submitted to the Government mining engineer. It has been argued that the Government mining engineer should act on his own and I asked where these people should seek satisfaction if they were dissatisfied. In para. 16 the commission refers to the accident at the President Steyn mine. The inquiry was delayed; again there was dissatisfaction. If a man who has that independent power acts in this way, surely it is then the duty of the Minister to intervene? The Government mining engineer acts not only in a professional capacity; he acts here on behalf of the State to look after the safety of the mineworkers. That is his duty. The function the State assumes is to see that the regulations are complied with. The point is this: Certain duties are imposed upon the mine managements. They are the people who are primarily responsible for seeing that those regulations are carried out. It is their duty&#x2014;they must do so. And it is the duty of the inspector to see to it that they do so. But the first duty, primarily, is that of the mine managements and not that of any other body or person.</p>

<p>Much has been said about the post of the Government mining engineer. I shall now proceed to deal with the recommendations of the report. I have shown which recommendations have been accepted, some of them even before the report was brought out, and some subsequently. Here are certain important recommendations as regards the post of the Government mining engineer. One of those recommendations is that the Government mining engineer should also be the Secretary of Mines. Let me say at once that on the face of it there seems to be something in this, but there are cardinal problems involved if effect were to be given to that recommendation. The Government mining engineer&#x2019;s main function is to look after the safety in the mines. Apart from that he, as one of the three senior technical officers who are employed in the whole greater mine complex in so far as the State is concerned, has a number of other functions of a technical nature, but safety in the mines is one of his main functions. If this man were now also to be the Secretary of Mines, he would have to assume numerous other additional functions. This commission&#x2019;s terms of reference did not include an examination of the Department as a whole; they did not check what the other functions were: they did not have such an instruction and they did not investigate it. It was quite outside the scope of their terms of reference.</p>

<p>Let us see what those functions are. There are eight important divisions falling under the Secretary of Mines. There is in the first instance that of the Government mining engineer. There is the division of Geological Survey; there is Metallurgical Research; there are Mining Leases; there is the Atomic Power Board; there is the Medical Bureau and there is the Pneumoconiosis Board; there is also the State Diggings at Alexander Bay. Apart from that the Secretary has a mass of administrative functions affecting the whole Department. So from the very nature of things it is impossible for any person who is the Government mining engineer to assume all these other duties in addition to his own. If he were to assume these functions he would be holding a full-time administrative position to administer this whole big Department, and to act as the liaison with the Minister. So if he were to assume that post also, it is clear that he would not be able to take active steps as Government mining engineer and then those functions would have to be entrusted to an Assistant Government mining engineer. So nothing is achieved. It may well be argued that the Secretary of Mines should be a technical man. But there is nothing to stop him becoming that. There is nothing to stop the Government mining engineer also becoming the Secretary of the Department, and another Government mining engineer then being appointed in his stead. On the contrary, in the past there have been people who could have occupied that position with credit. It may be so in future too. I think it is clear that nothing will be solved by placing these two posts under one man, because then another person must act as the true, active Government mining engineer. He will then have to be the Assistant Government mining engineer or something similar. But quite apart from the Government mining engineer having to be the Secretary also, in terms of this recommendation, it is recommended in fact that Geological Survey also should be placed under his control. So his functions must be extended still further. He will therefore be able to devote still less attention to safety in the mines than at present. I shall go into that further. The fact remains that the Government mining engineer has a particular function, and the Secretary has a particular function, and it is impossible for one person to occupy those two posts simultaneously.</p>

<p>Let me say something now about this matter of the taking over of Geological Survey. That also is one of the recommendations which is not being adopted. This recommendation flows from the finding of the commission in which they say when the Coalbrook disaster occurred there was no consultation with Geological Survey. But the whole matter and the report too were submitted to the person in charge of Geological Survey, and I have all his comments upon it here. He says that one can only render assistance when asked to. do so, which <span class="col_8577-8578" refersTo="page_0537"/>of course is quite correct. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Survey is approached for help, it will do everything in its power to assist. If, however, no request for help is made, it is justified in assuming that its assistance is not required. Its staff position is certainly not such that it can afford to offer services to persons and organizations that do not ask for them.</block>

<p>In the case of the Clydesdale North mine disaster the position was actually that in my absence from office, due to my attendance of a congress, my Deputy on my behalf communicated with the Government mining engineer telephonically to inquire whether the geological survey could be of any assistance, no such approach having been made by the Government mining engineer. His response to our inquiry was one of scepticism. Despite this we decided to initiate an investigation which, as is now generally known, was much more detailed than any by mining geologists.</p>

<p>Then this report itself draws attention to this. In para. 76 of this report, the commission points out that the acting Government mining engineer himself recommended that this should be done, that Geological Survey should be placed under the Government mining engineer. We also have here the evidence of the Government mining engineer in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission recommends that the Geological Survey be placed under the Government mining engineer. As is stated in paragraph 76 the acting Government mining engineer expressed himself in favour of such a change. Actually, when questioned on this in evidence, I agreed that a number of advantages would flow from such a change, but I did not express myself strongly in favour of it. I feel that the commission has over-emphasized certain aspects of this case, such as the services that can be rendered in connection with accident prevention and certain of the items listed in paragraph 72. Very much greater co-operation between the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s Division and the Geological Survey is definitely required and in certain respects the placing of the Survey under the Government mining engineer would have its advantages, but on the other hand, why should the <i>status quo</i> be disturbed if the proposed committee, referred to in paragraph 79, will achieve the desired object?</block>

<p>In this report reference is made to the fact that co-operation has already been achieved between the three technical divisions, that of the Government mining engineer, Geological Survey and the Metallurgical Division. Those are the chief technical officers of the Department. They meet regularly for discussions. And this arrangement complies with the recommendation in question. But I also wish to point out that Geological Survey has a much wider function than this one. Not only do they assist in indicating water, but they make a geological survey of the whole country, and the fact that it is linked up, as recommended, will not have the effect that their assistance will be used more in this connection. On the contrary, a geologist cannot determine rock fractures; he cannot determine the strength of pillars. That is the function of the Government mining engineer and you will find that a man who does not have an advanced knowledge of geology, will never be appointed as Government mining engineer. It is simply impossible to do so. So he himself has geological knowledge which is necessary to determine safety in mines, and wherever necessary, geological assistance may be invoked at any time. Therefore there is no need at all to place Geological Survey under this post.</p>

<p>But there is another recommendation, namely that the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s status should be changed so that he does not fall under the Public Service Regulations. Here I should like once again to refer to the paragraphs I quoted just now, which indicated the position of the Government mining engineer. But the fact is that the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s status did not change to this extent since 1937. He did, it is true, receive a lower salary then. Hon. members opposite perhaps know better why that happened. But you will observe that later on in this report there is a comparative table of the salary of the Government mining engineer and that of the secretary, and it appears from that that in the &#x2019;forties these salaries were similar. Reference has been made to the present salary here, it being indicated in the Estimates that the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s salary is R6,800 and that of the secretary is R8,100. Let me say at once that this is not the true state of affairs. At the end of last year the Public Service Commission recommended that the salaries of heads of Departments be increased to R8,100. That recommendation has been included in the Estimates. Further recommendations were made subsequently, namely that the position of the Government mining engineer and that of, <i>inter alia,</i> the Commissioner for Internal Revenue, should also be increased to the same scale as that of the heads of Departments. In fact the position is that since 1 January, the Government mining engineer as well as the secretary each receive R8,100. So their salaries are exactly the same since the date of the increase. That recommendation came too late to be included in the Estimates, but he is receiving the same salary, and if it cannot be supplemented from savings under some sector of the Vote, supplementary provision will have to be made for it. Therefore there is no difference at the moment in the salary scale. The fact of the matter is that even prior to 1937 the true control of the Department of Mines was vested in the Secretary of Mines and the Government mining engineer never was independent of the Public Service. The fact of the matter is that there are other persons who are also appointed by the State President. The Master of the Supreme Court is appointed in that <span class="col_8579-8580" refersTo="page_0538"/>manner, but that does not detach him and his staff from the Public Service Commission, as is recommended here. On the contrary, I believe that nowhere in the world will you find a position that your Government mining engineer is detached from the Public Service Commission. Does it now mean that if he is detached he may appoint officials at salaries which are completely unconnected with the rest of the Public Service?</p>

<p>I do not quite agree that the position is as is stated there, and I shall tell you why. For instance, there is another provision in the Gold Law to the effect that the Minister may give directions to the Government mining engineer, which is not referred to here. He has never in the past been unconnected with the Public Service. He and his whole staff has always been regarded as being subject to the regulations of the Public Service Commission. I should like to put this question to the hon. member: Do you agree with the further recommendation here that the Government mining engineer should also be the secretary of the Department?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Then I take it that your party agrees that these two posts should be one? Now I should like to ask you this: You want the Government mining engineer to be unconnected with the Public Service. Now you also want him to be secretary of the Department. In what kind of a position are you going to find yourself if the head of the Department were to be unconnected with the Public Service, if he were not under the control of the Minister? In what position are you going to find yourself if he were to be such a professional man as the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) has urged that he should be? What is going to happen then? Surely that is an untenable position. Now, according to this recommendation, the Geological Survey must also be transferred and be unconnected with the Minister or the Department. What about his staff? Must the entire staff of his Department, the entire Geological Survey, be detached? What about the Atomic Power Board, which also falls under it? Must they also be detached from the Public Service? Must this important sector of the economy be detached? No, Mr. Chairman, I regret to say that that recommendation is completely unrealistic, to say the least of it. It never had regard to the office of Secretary of Mines as it is in practice. They did not investigate it; they did not go into it. It was not their function. But this recommendation they are making is a far-reaching one in connection with the entire Departmental structure, and they surely never appreciated that when they made this recommendation.</p>

<p>As regards his pension, he falls under the Public Service completely. So we cannot accept the recommendation in that regard either. As regards his status, there the position is as follows. His salary is equivalent to that of the secretary. So there is no difference. An arrangement has been made that the Government mining engineer shall have direct access to the Minister, and he has had this since that time. He need not always operate through the secretary; and as regards the Minister himself, he may at any time, without consultation with the Secretary of Mines, consult the Government mining engineer direct. That arrangement, which is now the existing arrangement, applies not only in respect of the Government mining engineer, but also for the Geological survey and Metallurgical Research. So, as regards these three technical divisions, and it also applies to the Atomic Power Board, it is an existing arrangement that anyone of the four has the same direct access to the Minister of Mines as the Secretary for Mines has. So in that respect their status is not such that one is subordinate to the other. That is how it is applied in practice. So without bringing about the organizational and functional integration of one under the other, the status of the Government mining engineer as regards his relationship to the Minister, is not subordinate to that of the secretary of the Department.</p>

<p>Will the hon. the Minister also deal with (c) as regards explosives?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, as regards the recommendation that explosives should also fall under the Government mining engineer, that was the position until 1937. The Department of Commerce and Industries was then established and the handling of explosives is one of the things which were entrusted to the newly established Department. If fell under Mines before. Since that time, therefore, Commerce and Industries has been responsible for the handling of this particular Department. As a result of this recommendation, the Public Service Commission has enquired into whether it could more advantageously be placed there. At the moment that position still obtains. Effect has not been given to it, but a change has been made in one respect, and that is as regards the supply of explosives to the mines. That part, the supply and the handling thereof, has been entrusted to the Government mining engineer. So I think that solves the problem in this regard. Whether or not it will ultimately be transferred fully, is not yet settled, because it also deals with the manufacture of explosives, security measures, inspection, handling, and other factors which really have nothing to do with mining as such.</p>

<p>There is another recommendation (4) that the division of the Government mining engineer should be moved to Pretoria. The fact of the matter is, however, that from the functional, strategic and organizational point of <span class="col_8581-8582" refersTo="page_0539"/>view, the division of the Government mining engineer ought really to be on the Rand. That is the very heart of our mining industry. The mining houses are stationed there. The consulting engineers are in Johannesburg, those people who have to deal with the Government mining engineer all day long. But apart from that, it is the headquarters too of the mineworkers&#x2019; organizations. Therefore there are many reasons why the position should remain as it is. If it were transferred to Pretoria, it would have certain disadvantages, but the fact of the matter is that even if it were transferred, it would not bring about greater access to the Minister for the Government mining engineer. As a result of this functional change, without legislation, since the Government mining engineer has direct access to the Minister, he may avail himself of it at any time, and whether he is in Pretoria or in Johannesburg, it will make no difference in this regard. It is a fact that for six months the Minister is in any case not in Pretoria, but in Cape Town. Then the Government mining engineer is in his offices in Pretoria, and the actual activities are in Johannesburg. I think there is much to be said in favour of retaining the <i>status quo.</i> The Government mining engineer has indicated that he is prepared to abide by it if that is decided upon, but after due consideration it was decided to retain the <i>status quo.</i> It has been said here too that the Government mining engineer should be present when the Mines Vote is discussed here in the House of Assembly. That is the present position. He is here and that procedure will also be adopted in future.</p>

<p>I should like to refer here to certain questions put to me by the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog). I think I am stating the position correctly, that he wishes to know: &#x201C;Whether the same inspector who was called in over the head of the Government mining engineer by the Minister, was suspended and was having his case investigated by the Public Service Commission?&#x201D; He also wished to know &#x201C;Why it was several years before this action was taken?&#x201D; Mr. Chairman, the fact of the matter is that this person is an official who made the inquiries at the request of the trade union. That person also was appointed by the Minister at the time after consultation with the Government mining engineer. It was at a stage when there was a lack of confidence. It was at a stage when complete chaos prevailed, as the commission itself found. Here was a person in whom the mineworkers had confidence. He acted on other occasions, and they believed he was a person who was guarding their safety. Unfortunately there were other problems. The mine management complained about that person. Therefore the position arose that as regards safety on the mines, as there was a clash between the approach of the mine management and that of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, a person had to be found to give complete satisfaction, and that was extremely difficult. But he was asked to make that investigation because it was felt that he enjoyed the confidence of the mineworkers themselves. On the other hand, the Mine Managers&#x2019; Association again was dissatisfied with that. However, the mineworkers had confidence in him. Thereafter it appeared that he had certain shortcomings. His patience was somewhat lacking at times. He acted when he found something was not right, but it is alleged that he did so in a manner that is not expected of a Government official. Complaints began to pour in, and in consequence of that he was suspended, pending an inquiry of certain complaints made against him. Those complaints began in recent times, and he was suspended a month ago, pending an investigation. A procedure as laid down in the Public Service Regulations for any inquiry, and it applies to him also. The hon. member said here &#x201C;a certain district inspector was sent to London at the request of the man who was subject to investigation&#x201D;.</p>

<p>That is not correct. This matter has no connection with the transfer of Mr. Myburgh to London. The then incumbent of the position in London was there for years and it was his turn to be eligible for promotion, and he was then appointed assistant Government mining engineer, which is a high position in the Department. As far as our knowledge goes, there was no appeal to the Minister to make this change.</p>

<block name="quote">Quite recently the Trade Union succeeded in persuading the Government to order the removal of the inspector from the post of district inspector.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>The Government mining engineer informs me that that finding was definitely not correct. Thirdly the hon. member said: &#x201C;The Minister vetoed the procedure in fatal accidents involving prosecutions whereby the Government mining engineer investigated the report before it went to court, and thus could check any prosecutions on flimsy evidence. Because of this the Government mining engineer was blamed for instituting needless prosecutions&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the fact of the matter is that the Minister did veto this procedure. In the past the Government mining engineer checked reports on fatal accidents before they went to the Mining Tribunal. I have been informed that that procedure was adopted in order to prevent the case coming before the Tribunal on insufficient evidence. But it is a fact that in inquiries affecting mining officials the procedure is very technical and very comprehensive, and that is why this was the procedure. But objections were raised with the Minister against that procedure because the same procedure had not been adopted in instances where mineworkers themselves had committed an offence. <span class="col_8583-8584" refersTo="page_0540"/>They felt that there had been some discrimination, and in consequence of the representations made to him the Minister ordered that this procedure be discontinued.</p>

<p>The hon. member further asked three important questions, namely, whether it was true that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Ellis demanded the instant dismissal of the Government mining engineer after the Coalbrook disaster, and sent a telegram to the Minister reading: &#x201C;For heaven&#x2019;s sake suspend this man immediately</block>

<p>The next relevant sentence is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When the Minister did not immediately suspend the Government mining engineer, Mr. Ellis threatened to call a strike.</block>

<p>And next&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister presented the Government mining engineer with an ultimatum that he should either resign or he would be dismissed.</block>

<p>The fact of the matter is that this report itself shows that a few years prior to Coalbrook feelings were already beginning to build up against the post and the office of the then Government mining engineer, and he himself came to the conclusion that the crisis then existing was of such a nature that after Coalbrook it could not be coped with. So at the time of the Coalbrook mine disaster there was a tremendously strong feeling against the office of the Government mining engineer. The mineworkers were bitterly dissatisfied, and the outside world sympathized with the mineworkers in this disaster. Therefore it was not unreasonable that this organization of mineworkers, through the medium of Mr. Ellis, demanded certain action. They made certain demands upon the Minister which he had to try to satisfy among other things, the appointment of a commission, and further, that the Government mining engineer should be suspended. The hon. member referred to the telegram, &#x201C;For heaven&#x2019;s sake suspend this man immediately The hon. member wishes to know whether that is so? It is correct. Mr. Ellis did send a telegram, asking that he be suspended immediately. That is correct.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I am satisfied with both. It is right, when a person acts in an important capacity and there are complaints of a serious nature, that an inquiry should be instituted. In this case there were complaints of such a nature that it was surely the duty of the Minister to heed them. He had no right to ignore that request. The fact that a person is suspended does not mean that he will be found guilty. If he is suspended, steps are taken against him under the Public Service Regulations which apply to any public servant, even to the Secretary of a Department, so if action had been taken here pursuant to this request, the same facilities would have been available to the Government mining engineer. He would have been informed of the charge; he would have been given an opportunity to refute the charge, he could have submitted his evidence to a commission, and in the event of a conviction action would have been taken under the Public Service Regulations, either in the form of a reduction of salary or in the form of demotion or as regards pension benefits. So action could have been taken under the Public Service Regulations. That telegram was sent. In view of the state of affairs found by the commission to exist in the mining industry, as summarized in paragraph 24, action was taken and that request emanating at that stage from the mineworkers I do not regard as scandalous at all. But what happened? The Minister did not act in terms of the telegram. The Minister did not suspend him. The Minister informed him: &#x201C;Look, we have received this request. A commission is going to be appointed, a commission of inquiry into the whole matter&#x201D;. The hon. member shakes his head. The person who conveyed that message to him was the Secretary of Mines. It is his information I am now giving you. He put it to him: &#x201C;Here is the request of the mineworkers; there are the Public Service Regulations. What must be done? I have to take notice of it, and if you are satisfied that you are completely innocent you may remain in your post subject to suspension and the finding of that commission On the other hand he had good cause to say he was resigning. He was already older than 55 years. He could therefore have resigned from the Public Service, had he wished to. He was then told that he could consider the matter. And, possibly after himself consulting other people, he intimated the next day that he preferred to resign with a pension. He addressed a letter to the Minister in which he confirmed this, and as a result there were negotiations with the Public Service Commission and he received, as regards his pension, the maximum benefits which he would have received had he served until the end of his period of office. So in the circumstances he was dealt with as kindly as possible. It was not maintained that there were irregularities. The Minister himself helped him to get the maximum benefits possible under those circumstances.</p>

<p>I think that then disposes of all the main points in connection with this matter.</p>

<p>Questions have also been put here in regard to appeals, appeals by companies against the closing of mines recommended by an inspector. Four such appeals have been upheld. The appeal against the closing of Coalbrook North did not succeed. The appeal in connection with Coalbrook South succeeded partially. The appeal in regard to two sections of mines at Witbank succeeded, and then there was a successful appeal in respect of Koringfontein mines.</p>

<p><span class="col_8585-8586" refersTo="page_0541"/>May I deal with only one more question. I have been asked why this report did not appear sooner, in view of the fact that it had already been signed on 20 December 1960. The fact of the matter is that this report appeared towards the end of December 1960. In 1961 it was submitted to the then Minister, and at the beginning of 1962 the chairman of the commission wrote to the Minister asking what he intended to do in regard to the publication of the report. The Minister then pointed out to him that this was an interim report and asked when the final report could be expected. Thereupon the chairman told the Minister that this interim report could be regarded as final. These replies were received only in September, and immediate steps were then taken to have the report translated, to submit it to the State President, and to have it printed. Thereafter it was Tabled in this House. Originally it was considered that this was merely an interim report and that another, final report was to follow and that it was quite possible, therefore, that the final report might amend the interim report in certain respects. Therefore the Minister wished to delay the publication of the interim report until such time as the final reports were available.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is, however, that the majority of the recommendations contained therein have been implemented. The commission in fact issued the report for the very reason that it contained some important recommendations of an urgent nature. As I have indicated already, two-thirds of those recommendations have already been adopted. So at an early stage already effect was given to the recommendations. Whether or not the report had been published, it made no difference at all to the implementation of those recommendations. As regards the legislation that is required to give effect to some of the recommendations, that legislation is ready. At one stage there was even talk of introducing it this Session, but once again the Minister considered it would be better to wait until the final report was available. In any event, this legislation is now ready, and we hope to put it before the House early next Session.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs wished to know why the evidence submitted to the commission cannot be made available. Hon. members will see from paragraph 7 of the commission&#x2019;s report that the commission itself did not regard it as feasible to do so. The commission states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The nature of some of the matters that had to be thoroughly dealt with in evidence compelled the commission, much against its will, to hold all its sessions on this part of its work behind closed doors and to treat the record of the evidence as confidential. The end, we feel, has justified the means, in that witnesses spoke more freely than they would probably have done in public.</block>

<p>In the circumstances the Minister decided to adhere to this statement, and not to publish the evidence.</p>

<p>Although I do not propose following upon the arguments of the hon. the Deputy Minister, I should like to say that his explanation for not having brought forward this most important report earlier does not convince this House at all. As we all know, this is a matter of the greatest importance&#x2014;not only to the members of this House but also to the whole country. It was a matter which should have been brought to the attention of this House, and to the attention of the people outside, as soon as it was placed in the hands of the Minister. The trouble of the Department of Mines has been that it has had a series of three Ministers within a period of five years. This Department has been treated by the Government as a Cinderella. Consequently, there could not have been any continuity between one Minister and another. When Dr. van Rhyn left, he had no conception at all of what his successor was going to do. The present Minister took over from the hon. Senator de Klerk. What has been the result? The result has been that within five years we have had two Acts in regard to pneumoconiosis. The first one was described by Dr. van Rhyn as a model one. He claimed that it could not be improved upon and that it was drawn up by the best possible people. But it proved to be a total failure. What did the hon. Senator de Klerk do about this? Did he do anything? The present Minister at least made an attempt to take those steps which this side of the House asked him to take. But under what circumstances did the Bill come before this House last year? Virtually at the end of the session. It was placed before us for discussion on the eve of the Minister&#x2019;s departure for overseas. When I asked him to accept amendments, what did he say? He said it was difficult to accept amendments because he had to leave for overseas.</p>

<p>I only have ten minutes at my disposal and I am not going to take that up by reading from Hansard. Let me, however, refer hon. members to Columns 6771, 6772 and 6794. Let them read what the Minister said there. The hon. the Minister will admit that he said it was inconvenient for him to accept amendments because then the whole Bill would have to be reprinted and for that there was no time. I do not want any member on that side of the House to tell us that it was an agreed measure as far as this side of the House is concerned. We voted against some of the provisions of the Bill. The hon. member for Krugersdorp said that we accepted the recommendations. We did nothing of the kind. He cannot get away with that. He does not even remember what happened as recently as last year. Only one year and he has already forgotten.</p>

<p>To me it is obvious that the whole Department is in trouble. It cannot carry out its functions properly. There seems to me to be total disorganization and total lack of cohesion <span class="col_8587-8588" refersTo="page_0542"/>between the Minister, the Deputy Minister and the Department. I can well imagine what difficulties the Department has to deal with when it is controlled by one Minister after another. What is the position to-day in this respect? We have two Ministers dealing with one measure. We have the Deputy Minister taking over the work of the Minister of Mines. Why should that be? Obviously there is too much work to do. The Deputy Minister says that there are eight Departments to look after. Sir, if we want the Department of Mines to work efficiently, there must only be one Minister in control of it. That Minister must not hand over any of his work in that field to either the Deputy Minister or to any other person. He has got to do it himself. The position the Government mining engineer is being placed in to-day is most invidious. We have to accept that there is a difference between liaison and co-operation, and interference. What we want is cooperation and liaison between the Department and the Government mining engineer and not interference with his work. That is all we are asking for. If that can be done, you will have an efficient service. But the way things are going, we find that the person most adversely affected is the mineworker. Not only is his life endangered by accidents but also by pneumoconiosis. He therefore is subject to a double danger. Day after day we hear of the deaths which are taking place. The Chamber of Mines has to have a hospital to deal with the accidents that occur every day. Some mines, it is true, have an accident free record but that is thanks to no one else than the officials of those particular mines.</p>

<p>The Minister has now to make up his mind to do a bit of reorganization. In this connection I need not go further than what is stated in this interim report. It is damning and it is our job to get down to repairing the damage which has been done over the past ten to 15 years. At that I want to leave the matter, and go over to one or two other matters which we cannot avoid discussing. This concerns the Pneumoconiosis Act as it is at the moment.</p>

<p>I want particularly to deal with the pneumoconiosis and the sufferer who contracts tuberculosis. I do not like the Minister&#x2019;s grading and I do not like the way in which the Minister has shelved his responsibilities towards the tuberculosis sufferer. As the Act reads now, it means that even though a miner contracts tuberculosis following upon pneumoconiosis or not, if he is cured of the tuberculosis he is no longer the burden of the State. I want the Minister to realize one fact in this connection, and that is that this man would not have contracted tuberculosis if he did not have pneumoconiosis. It is my feeling that those people working on the mines contract tuberculosis because of the already damaged lung which causes that lung to be far more easily contaminated than previously.</p>

<p>The impression he created here last night was that he protested to high Heaven against the whole Act. But one could not help feeling that it was nothing but feigned indignation. Last night he relied on the fact that they had heard at that time that it was an agreed measure, and for that reason they supported the measure. So they are now hiding behind that excuse. One cannot do otherwise but to accuse them of negligence in not ascertaining whether or not that was the truth. When the hon. member was carrying on like that, I thought I was making a mistake in thinking they had supported the measure. I then referred to the Hansard debates, and found that they did in fact accept the principle of the Bill at the second reading, and that they voted for the third reading also. So they supported the measure. They not only supported it, but sometimes they became quite enthusiastic about it. The hon. member had this to say about it (Hansard of 1962, Col. 6621)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But we appreciate the particular problems which exist at present and we believe that this is a good step forward and accordingly we do not wish to be unduly difficult about the matter.</block>

<p>In Col. 6622 he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would like to say that this is a grand day for this side of the House. We have been pleading for some years now for the institution of an appeal board or a board of review of some kind.</block>

<p><span class="col_8589-8590" refersTo="page_0543"/>The hon. member for Rosettenville this afternoon also took up a strong attitude against this measure. Now I find he had the following to say. Ironically enough, the following words occur in that speech (Col. 6629)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think Hansard is one of the most dangerous documents that we have here from the point of view of those hon. members.</block>

<p>Yes, Hansard is dangerous indeed and the hon. member for Germiston (District) also surely realizes it now to his regret. However, the hon. member for Rosettenville will also by and by realize that to his regret, because he had the following to say in regard to the measure in question&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir, I do, however, want to take this opportunity now of saying that I have no words to express adequately the admiration that I have for those people behind the scenes who have done so much in the past six years in preparing this measure.</block>

<p>That is the measure they have condemned so much this evening. It is clear also from this quotation that the hon. member did not wish to allow any credit to go to the hon. the Minister. No, he then gave all the credit to the people who worked behind the scenes. However, later on he tried to put this matter right. In Column 6631 the following words of his are recorded&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say that those people who take an interest in the men who extract this wealth from the bowels of the earth must be given every opportunity to continue the great work that they are doing, and I sincerely hope that our present Minister of Mines will remain Minister of Mines for as long as his party remains in power.</block>

<p>Actually this measure which was passed last year, was a revolutionary measure. As regards the determination of the damage inflicted upon the health of the mineworker by pneumoconiosis, there was a switch-over from the old unscientific basis of certification, namely the ability to do manual labour, to the new, modern and scientific basis of impairment of the cardio-respiratory function, that is to say, heart-lung impairment, as we call it in ordinary language. However, the Minister intimated that this was not the end. He said it was a new order, but at the same time he said that this was not the end of progress in that respect. That measure was only the beginning, he said. The Minister also undertook to take this House into his confidence after the lapse of some time and to tell us how the implementation of the new Act is progressing. In that regard, I think that time has perhaps now arrived. We should be grateful if the Minister would tell us how things are progressing. Can he tell us what he has heard from the mine workers themselves on this matter, that is to say, whether or not there is satisfaction among them. I convened a meeting on this matter in my own constituency, and the impression I gained there is that apparently there is general satisfaction. However, there were certain misgivings. One of the matters raised&#x2014;and here I must agree with the hon. member for Rosettenville&#x2014;is the matter raised by the hon. member, namely that the mineworkers are dissatisfied because tuberculosis is no longer regarded as an occupational disease. They say it may be that tuberculosis is not a direct occupational disease. However, indirectly it is an occupational disease. In any event, that is their reasoning. They say their lungs are weakened by the dusty and bad conditions under which they are working. Accordingly their lungs no longer have the same degree of resistance as the lungs of people living in the open air. So they are more susceptible to tuberculosis. They want tuberculosis to be regarded in this light and to be accepted as an occupational disease in that sense. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>For many years now we on this side of the House have been advancing the case of the marginal mines by emphasizing their importance to the country. In this connection I want to go back to 1956 to illustrate how we have constantly endeavoured to get the Government to move in this matter, and at the same time to show what effect a constant change of Ministers has on policy when a particular Department is being regarded as a Cinderella. In the years 1956 and 1957 we were told by the then Minister of Mines that the question of marginal mines was under very close scrutiny, and that he had arranged for a conference to be held in regard to the matter&#x2014;often referred to as the round table conference. In 1958 this report was out and we pressed the Minister once more. This time it was a new Minister. He then referred to this report, and said that he intended seeing the Cabinet and asking it for support in connection with a proposition that certain railway charges be met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In 1959 we still had the same Minister. He was again pressed closely on the matter, but all we could then get out of him was that he was going into the matter very closely. In 1961 we still had the same Minister. He told us in that year that he could not recommend help through the Railways. He said that a difference in railway rates could not be made to benefit only one section of the community. He claimed that a pneumoconiosis adjustment would help these mines, but forgot to mention that this was due purely to an actuarial adjustment in the fund which had been contributed to by the mines in question.</p>

<p>You see that we have been pressing this matter every year. Every year we pointed out the dangers and the importance of the matter to the country. At any rate, in 1961 <span class="col_8591-8592" refersTo="page_0544"/>the Minister told us that he could not get the support of the Minister of Railways because the Minister of Transport said he could not assist at the expense of his own Department only. The Minister of Transport has my fullest sympathies in that.</p>

<p>In 1958, however, another Minister told us that he was going to the Cabinet to see whether special assistance could not be given from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Then in 1962 we got a new Minister of Mines. He in turn said that the existence of a marginal mine was of great importance from the point of view of the community established round about that mine in so far as their employment was concerned. Furthermore, there was the question of the loss of currency, currency which that mine could otherwise earn. At last we got someone who exhibited a bit of intelligence in his approach to the problem of marginal mines, a problem which was getting greater and greater every day. That then brought a ray of light. [Quorum.] I did not notice that a quorum was not present as I was concentrating on what I was saying. I must submit that it is a most extraordinary state of affairs that on a Vote like this there should be only nine Nationalist members present, only one of whom is connected with the Reef and the mining industry. And we are dealing with a Vote which affects the prosperity and the lives of every one on the Reef.</p>

<p>At any rate, I was saying that a ray of light shone through last year. After all the years of vain struggle we at last heard some intelligent expression from the Minister concerned. Then in 1963 the hon. the Minister of Finance announced that he was appointing a Cabinet Committee to investigate this question of assistance to these marginal mines.</p>

<p>So we see that the whole history of this matter is a story of neglect and delay. The problem could not be appreciated. During seven years that was the position. It is not that we did not press it. On the contrary. Year after year we came with facts and figures to show how it would affect the country economically and how it would affect the people living in those areas. To prove, or rather, to reprove the importance of these mines to local communities, I should like to give some figures in connection with employment in an important town on the Reef. Of all the workers in that town 5,600 (i.e., 38 per cent) work on the mines; 3,200 (20 per cent) in industry; 6,000 (42 per cent) are otherwise employed. It is obvious that industry and the &#x201C;otherwise employed&#x201D; are largely dependent upon the mines in that area. The prolongation of the life of these marginal mines is inextricably interwoven with the industrial expansion which is so necessary, particularly in those particular areas.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, I should like to ask the Minister to tell us, when he replies, how far this Cabinet Committee has got. He should continue to press for their recommendations and findings as soon as possible. It is not necessary for them to call any witnesses. All the evidence which could possibly be required is already available. But we have been battling for years, and it is quite pleasant to feel that at last we may get somewhere. I want to repeat: This Government should realize the importance of the mines to this country. They are of sufficient importance to warrant being run by a Minister. It is not a job which should be divided between two men, but it should be one portfolio under one Minister. It is a very big job. It is not a job to be split between two men; it is a job for one man; it should be one portfolio.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to read out an extract from a speech of Mr. Anderson, deputy chairman of Rand Mines at their annual meeting held on the 24th May, 1963. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Many mines on the Witwatersrand which are still making an important contribution to the country&#x2019;s economy will have to close down prematurely unless prompt and positive action is taken by the Government to assist the marginal producers in their fight against rising costs.</block>

<block name="quote">He added that the situation had reached a critical stage and it was imperative to stress the need for urgent action. Mr. Anderson cited the case of City Deep and Crown Mines. These two mines, he said, last year produced R15m. worth of gold, and paid out R8.5m. in wages and other cash benefits used R4.4m. worth of stores and paid R1.7m. for electricity and air. They both have large quantities of low-grade ore fully developed and there are also indications of considerable quantities of ore at mineable depths down dip from existing workings. However, because of the persistent rise in working costs against a fixed price of gold these two mines are facing premature closure. It is largely in the hope of an increase in the price of gold that mines which are at present working at marginal profits or even at a loss are encouraged to continue operations since in that event they would be assured of a new lease of life, with consequent benefits to shareholders. But losses on production at City Deep and Crown Mines are now reaching such a scale that it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify a continuation of this policy, said Mr. Anderson. Last year in producing R15m. worth of new gold the two mines incurred a loss on mining operations of R260,000 and had to spend R500,000 on equipment.</block>

<p>That quite obviously is a position which cannot continue for long. The shareholders have some rights and the country has a very, very great interest in the production of gold itself.</p>

<p>This report of Mr. Anderson&#x2019;s speech shows again the gravity of the problem. I know that conflicting interests will have to be reconciled but they must be reconciled. There will be great difficulty in this country if something is not done in regard to these mines at a very early date, and I hope the Minister is going to <span class="col_8593-8594" refersTo="page_0545"/>tell us that within the next week or two we will have his final report as to how these mines are going to be helped.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) raised the matter of the marginal mines here, and I agree with him that it is a very important matter, and about which the Government has from time to time stated here and outside that it is very perturbed, and that it is looking for ways and means of extending the lives of those mines. I should like to tell the hon. member that the Government has, during the last few months particularly, made a very careful study of this problem to try to find a way out of our difficulties in this regard. The hon. member will agree with me that there are actually only two methods one could apply to lessen the burdens of those mines. The one is by obtaining a higher price for their product, and the other is to reduce their costs of production. We hope that we shall be able later on to secure a higher price for gold on the world market, but not all of these marginal mines can wait until that time. The question has now arisen whether a method cannot be found whereby the State could assist these mines by means of a subsidy by purchasing their gold at a higher price. That matter has also been investigated, and the Government eventually abandoned that idea, for the following reasons: In the first place the International Monetary Fund is opposed to such a scheme of buying gold at a higher price; the second is that the mines themselves are opposed to a subsidy, the mines do not like it, and the third reason is this: We found that even if we were to subsidize the gold production of the 20 or so marginal mines by a fairly big amount, very little extra gold would be produced and that the lives of the mines almost generally will be extended for one or two years only. Those studies have been worked out properly for every mine and for all the mines together. For that reason the Government has discarded the idea of a subsidy to assist the marginal mines. But there is another method, and that is to reduce the costs of production. That also is something about which the Government can do very little. The mines themselves have done much in recent times to reduce their costs of production. However, there is one aspect where the Government may now be able to find an opportunity to reduce the costs of production, and that is in regard to the water aspect. The hon. member is shaking his head.</p>

<p>One of the greatest difficulties those mines on the East Rand and the Central Rand to-day have to cope with is the problem of water. When a certain mine closes, the problem is that its water after a certain time overflows to the neighbouring mine, and there is a chain reaction; later on more and more mines are affected and will have to close down owing to the increased cost involved in pumping the extra water flowing from the closed mines. The Government has decided that it is going to start with this aspect in giving assistance, and so I should like to announce to-day that the Government has decided that for the financial year 1 July 1963 to 30 June 1964 it will allot to the Central Rand and the nearby East Rand group of mines an amount of not more than R1,000,000 per annum to meet the cost of pumping out the water threatening them from the neighbouring closed mines, on the understanding that (1) only current expenses&#x2014;no capital expenditure&#x2014;are taken into consideration; (2) the Government Mining Engineer will control the expenditure and approve it and (3) only mines threatened with closure within five years of every annual allotment of aid will be considered; and (4) the Government does not commit itself for any period of time, but will review the position annually on the early submission of estimates, and in many cases if and when there is an increase in the price of gold. That is the first form of aid we are offering. We do not know what the exact amount will be, but the Government Mining Engineer estimates that the amount will vary, until the year 1980, between R630,000 to R1.8 million. We have decided to make available for the first year an amount of at least R1,000,000 on the conditions I have mentioned here to assist the marginal mines. I hope the hon. member will accept that as proof of the good faith and of the desire of the Government to assist the marginal mines. We realize that it will not provide all the assistance required, and solve all the problems, and we are now busy making a further investigation, on the basis of data we have just received, of further methods that may offer a solution to the problems of these mines.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) I shall not go too deeply into the things he said here, but I gained the impression that the hon. member did not really know what he was talking about. The hon. member made a charge here which I regard as an accusation against myself, namely that there is no liaison between the Ministerial office and the office of the Government Mining Engineer; there has been too much interference on the part of the Minister. I do not know whether the hon. member may have been referring to the past, but if he is referring to the present, then I say he does not know what he is talking about and that he has no proof for his allegation. I may tell the hon. member that at the present time there is the most cordial co-operation between my office and the office of the Government Mining Engineer and other divisions of this Department, and that there is no question at all of any interference by the Minister&#x2019;s office in the technical activities of the Government Mining Engineer. I think the hon. member did not know what he was talking about. He cannot produce any proof for his allegation.</p>

<p>He may <span class="col_8595-8596" refersTo="page_0546"/>have been referring to the past, but he did not say so. The hon. member also made another mistake; I forgive him for making this mistake because I know that the Pneumoconiosis Act is not very easy to understand. He alleged that if you have pneumoconiosis as well as tuberculosis and if you are cured of the tuberculosis, you are no longer cared for by the State. That is not so. So the whole argument he built up on the basis of this allegation has no substance. Once you have had pneumoconiosis with tuberculosis, you receive the maximum pension and you retain that maximum pension.</p>

<p>Now I should like to come to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). The hon. member directed certain remarks to me last night which I cannot allow to pass and which I regard as extremely unkind if not unfair and unjust on the part of a member of the status of the hon. member for Germiston (District). He made an allegation here to the effect that last year, when I introduced the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Bill here. I misled the House, that I said things that were untrue, that I misrepresented the facts, and that they therefore voted for the measure. Mr. Chairman, those are very serious charges the hon. member has made. I reject it. The hon. member will forgive me if I deal with it further. He alleged here that I said &#x201C;that it was an agreed measure&#x201D; and that he subsequently found that this was not so. The hon. members of the Opposition must not try to back out now. They must not try to hide behind a big fig leaf by saying that I said last year that it was an agreed measure, and because of that they supported it, and that they have now found out that it was not an agreed measure and that they may therefore now back out. They supported that measure last year, here and in the Other Place, not because I said it was an agreed measure. They supported it because of their own convictions and because as the hon. members for Rosettenville and Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) said, it was really their Act; that it incorporated ideas they had propagated in this House for a long time. The hon. member for Germiston (District) will agree with me that they themselves could have ascertained, as the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) has said, whether it was an agreed measure or not. They had the opportunity to do so. They had access to the Chambers of Mines and the mineworkers&#x2019; trade unions and if they did not inquire whether it was an agreed measure they neglected their duty. But what is an agreed measure? It is not a measure the provisions of which are welcomed 100 per cent by the various parties; it is a measure on which people may have differed tremendously at the outset, but eventually after negotiations they mutually agree on those specific points.

<p>We have listened to attacks on the Department here this afternoon, attacks which in my opinion were completely uncalled for and completely unfounded, with great volubility but without any proof being adduced. I do not propose to go into this matter any further. I should however like to react to one small point, namely to what the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has said. Among other things, he alleged here that a person does not contract tuberculosis unless he has already contracted pneumoconiosis.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I specially asked the hon. member to repeat it. Of course that statement is not correct. I should like to say a word or two on the other statement made by the hon. member and which the hon. the Minister has already corrected, and that is that if a person has pneumoconiosis and then contracts tuberculosis. he no longer receives a pension once he has been cured of tuberculosis. That also, as the hon. the Minister has just told us, is not true either.</p>

<p>While we are discussing these cases of tuberculosis, I should like to know from the hon. the Minister whether something special cannot be done for people suffering from tuberculosis. I admit that in my constituency this problem occurs among only a very small group of people, but they are faced with the problem that if they contract tuberculosis, a monthly amount is paid to them over a period of 12 or 18 months while they are undergoing treatment. When the person is cured, he is glad and very pleased but he finds that he cannot return to his employment. Now, medically that is correct; once a man has had tuberculosis, and he has been cured, he ought not to work in a dusty atmosphere again, but it is nevertheless a fact that it does not lessen this man&#x2019;s problem. He finds then, usually in his middle-age, that he is unemployed and has a family to support. What makes his position more difficult is the fact that he has had no training in any other direction; he must confine himself to mining work only. It becomes impossible for him to find suitable alternative employment. Under those circumstances he then finds that he is without a livelihood. I say that the position of that person is completely different from the position of any other employee. If any other employee is cured of tuberculosis, he may return to his original employment, but here the difference is that the man cannot return. I should like this matter to be considered and attempts should be made to find what can be done for this person. His problem is twofold. If he is not cured and he is declared permanently unfit he is not entitled to a pension; he cannot demand an allowance then. It is true that his case can be met to some extent, but he is then at the mercy of the goodwill of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Board. The Board may meet him in accordance to his financial circumstances, but he cannot claim a pension as of right. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to consider this matter. It is true that it is alleged that tuberculosis is not an occupational disease. We shall accept that, but on the other hand we must not forget that mining, as is stated in this report of the commission <span class="col_8597-8598" refersTo="page_0547"/>of inquiry regarding safety in the mines, is inherently dangerous to both life and health. It is unnatural employment which gives rise to unnatural conditions. All of us know that in spite of everything that is said, the circumstances under which the mineworkers have to work promote the contraction and the development of tuberculosis. I say that if it were not for the particularly thorough supervision exercised the percentage of tuberculosis would have been much greater, and therefore I should like the hon. the Minister to give special attention to this matter, and to see whether it is not possible, in spite of all the theories, to meet these people who really are in need, even if there are not many of them.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister referred to the statement of mine yesterday that I had understood from him that this was an agreed measure. I certainly understood that last year. We found on returning to our constituencies that there was great feeling about the matter which the hon. the Minister knows about and that is the question of the lump-sum payment. The hon. the Minister was not here when the Committee Stage of this Bill was taken. I can tell the hon. the Minister that we were told there&#x2014;and the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) will remember it&#x2014;that no amendments could be accepted because this was a completely agreed measure. I certainly had no intention of reflecting on the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s <i>bona fides,</i> and I hope we can regard that particular issue as closed. Sir, I do hope that the hon. the Minister is going to tell us why this report, which is of such very great public interest, has not been made known earlier. I believe it would have been in the interests of the country if it had been made known at a very much earlier stage. I can still see no good reason&#x2014;and there has certainly been no explanation to the Committee&#x2014;as to why the report was not Tabled timeously as I believe these reports should be.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. member for Welkom (Mr. H. J. van Wyk) accepted my word that I had not criticized or condemned the pneumoconiosis law last year. I think everybody agreed that that law was a considerable advance, but I do not think anybody will say that there are not gaps which we still hope will be filled. There are experimental provisions being made at the present time, as hon. members will know. I think we should all have regard in this matter to the interests of the miners who, as I said yesterday, have played a very important part indeed in the building up of this country doing tremendously dangerous work. We ought all to be prepared to do whatever we can to assist those people where in rendering that service to this country&#x2014;and I say in all seriousness &#x201C;to this country&#x201D;&#x2014;they find that their health has been impaired.

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) will forgive me if I do not follow him because there is something to which I should like to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention urgently. Last year I had occasion to bring to his notice certain unsatisfactory conditions prevailing at that time, and right up to the present day, on the blue asbestos mines in the North-West Cape and the Northern Cape. It is a comparatively new industry, and nobody will blame the Department for conditions there not being just as satisfactory as they are e.g. on the gold mines. On the contrary, I have referred to certain improvements which were made there. Among other things, in underground works we to-day at least have air purification and there are regular clinical and radiographic examinations of the workers, both when they are employed for the first time and periodically thereafter. Conditions of service have also been generally improved. Housing and sanitation in general are still very unsatisfactory but even in that respect steps are being taken to improve the position. But what upsets and disturbs me most of all is the fact that asbestosis and its kindred disease mesitalium, as the doctors call it, but which we shall now call pleural cancer, occurs fairly widely among people outside the industry, people who reside in the vicinity of mines and pulverizers and mills, and who never have direct contact with the industry as such. Last year I quoted certain figures here; I do not want to repeat them, but I should like to point out that I have already shown by those statistics that pleural cancer occurs on a fairly widespread scale. The figure for Prieska and Koegas along the Orange River alone for the past five years was 13, of whom only 4 ever were in direct contact with asbestos. This phenomenon that a form of pneumoconiosis can also be contracted by people living in the vicinity of a mine is something new in mining in South Africa. I do not know of such cases in connection with the gold mines or other mines, and for that reason I should like to know from the Minister whether any research has been conducted in connection with this matter, and if so, what steps are being taken for the safety of people in the vicinity of the mines. Last year I suggested certain things. We asked the hon. the Minister whether effect could not be given to those suggestions. The one is the disposal of asbestos waste. At most of the mines there are great dumps exposed to the atmosphere and which of course are blown about by the wind. We know for instance that asbestos dust is so fine that it may remain in suspension in the atmosphere for a very long time, and in that way it is spread over a great area in the vicinity of those mines. Then I should like to know whether it is not possible to remove pulverizers and mills from the densely populated areas, among others Prieska and Koegas. Then I should also like to see somebody&#x2014;I do not know whether it <span class="col_8599-8600" refersTo="page_0548"/>should be Mines or Health&#x2014;make a proper inquiry into the degree to which people in the vicinity already suffering from asbestosis in the first instance, and then subsequently from the kindred pleural cancer. I asked whether it was not possible for a sub-bureau of the Pneumoconiosis Bureau or as it is called now, the Medical Bureau for Mineworkers, to be established at one of their places to make this inquiry, so that all the people in the area may be radiographically examined, and furthermore that the Department of Mines should establish a central hospital at some place for the treatment of these people, and particularly also to examine the possibility of diagnosing the disease at an early stage, and whether there is any treatment at all for it. The position is that as regards the workers themselves they have to accept the risk they run in any industry, and all they can ask from the Department of Mines is that the Department shall take the necessary steps to protect them against infection and if they contract the disease, and possibly die from it subsequently, that there should be proper provision for them or their dependants in the form of compensation. But people outside the industry are not eligible for the compensation the workers may claim. I should like to point out further that it is in the interests of the industry itself too. Last year, in 1962, 220,000 tons were produced and we sold it for R22,000,000, mostly overseas. In other words, this industry is a great earner of foreign currency also, and for that reason it is in the interests of the industry also, that we should popularize it as much as we possibly can. I shall be pleased if the Minister in his reply will tell me whether anything has been done in this regard.</p>

<p>In the short time at my disposal I cannot reply fully to the hon. member&#x2019;s questions and those of the hon. member for Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer), but I promise to furnish them with written replies. I may say briefly to the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) that we are about to launch a great research programme in this field. The Department of Mines, the pneumoconiosis research unit, the C.S.I.R. and the asbestos producers have drawn up a big programme of research which will extend over quite a few years in respect of the problems of asbestosis and mesitalium. We are now considering that research programme and I hope that we shall shortly be able to begin on a large scale. On the other questions we shall send the hon. member written replies later on.</p>

<p>I should like to return to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). It appears to me that the hon. member does not appreciate the position fully as yet. He said last night that I said last year that it is an agreed measure and that they subsequently ascertained that it was not true. In other words, I had told the House an untruth. Now I should like to repeat to the hon. member what I said last year, namely that it is an agreed measure. It is not proper to allege that I told an untruth here. I should like to tell the hon. member this&#x2014;and let it be recorded&#x2014;two parties were involved in this, namely the Chamber of Mines and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Trade Union. After much discussion with the Chamber of Mines, they informed the Department in writing that they accepted the legislation in its entirety. The basis of the financial part, as regards levies, is virtually the proposal of the Chamber of Mines. The Department had other suggestions, but those proposals which form the basis of the levy are the proposals of the Chamber of Mines which accepted this Act as a whole. The Chamber of Mines did, in fact, make one reservation on the medical basis of certification. I stated clearly in this House on one or two occasions that the Chambers of Mines had a reservation in that regard, and I undertook that after the Act had been in operation for a while, and after we had seen how it works, I would be prepared to appoint a commission of enquiry or to have the matter investigated in one way or another. That is what I said. I still adhere to that, and I hope the hon. member accepts what I said.</p>

<p>My Department negotiated with the mineworkers for months and months. The mineworkers eventually accepted the Act. They came to me here in Cape Town and made certain great demands. I said that those demands were not acceptable because it would involve tremendous financial implications. They then said they were prepared to accept the Act if we made certain small amendments. We made those amendments, and they were then prepared to accept the Act. Therefore I repeat that the Act was accepted as an agreed measure. Everybody was not 100 per cent satisfied, but it is an agreed measure, and it was introduced as such. I hope the hon. member will now accept that.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said &#x201C;it is a half-baked measure&#x201D;. A half-baked measure! Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Boksburg has referred to the fact that one of the hon. members praised the Department. Six years work went into this Act. For at least three years the Department studied this Act assiduously. They obtained information from overseas; they negotiated with groups and private people. They did so in an attempt to draft an Act which would be one of the most progressive Acts in the world. The hon. member is a very reasonable person; so I do not know how he can say that it is a half-baked measure.</p>

<p>If I understood the hon. member correctly, he suggested that there is great dissatisfaction among the mineworkers about this Act. Mr. Chairman, there was a measure of dissatisfaction at the beginning of this year. A certain doctor came from overseas with certain medical theories. We caused those medical theories to be investigated by a panel of eminent experts and those theories were rejected. The dissatisfaction that existed is dying away rapidly. Today there is hardly any at all. The bureau is making enquiries and the people assure me that they are meeting only with gratitude and <span class="col_8601-8602" refersTo="page_0549"/>praise and satisfaction from all who come to the bureau. At the beginning there were some difficulties in the administration of the Act, and there will always be people who are dissatisfied. But I can assure the hon. member that not a single pneumoconiosis Act has operated so smoothly as this one is operating at the moment. The hon. member has no hope of gaining advantage for his party by attacking this Act.</p>

<p>Reference has been made here to motions of no confidence in the Government, to motions of no confidence in the Act, in the Department of Mines, etc. I merely wish to read what the mineworkers themselves say in an edition of 29 March&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At a very early stage already Mr. Ellis, as well as other people, said they were convinced that the new Act had great merit. There are weaknesses in the Act, it is true, but as a whole the Act is better than its predecessor. It has been accepted.</block>

<p>Then I should like to quote to hon. members who tried to create lack of confidence among the mineworkers in the Government, what the mineworkers say in their official organ. They say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Mineworkers&#x2019; Union has never had a more sympathetic Government in power than the present one. Let those who differ please refresh their memories. Cast your minds back a little. Do you recall the strikes? Do you remember? But we would rather remain silent.</block>

<p>I think we shall now remain silent also, Mr. Chairman. I think we shall end this debate on a high note if we merely repeat these words: &#x201C;The Mineworkers&#x2019; Union has never had a more sympathetic Government in power than the present one.&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I think the discussion on the Defence Vote this afternoon is probably about as important a matter as we have had for a long time. In the three months that have elapsed since the introduction of the Budget there have been such tremendous changes in affairs, each of which in some form or other affect Defence, that the whole of the Defence policy needs a very careful reappreciation even in comparison with the situation which existed on 20 March when the Budget was presented.</p>

<p>Under existing arrangements time is of necessity limited for a discussion of this type this afternoon. It certainly does not permit us in any way to deal with Defence as effectively and as comprehensively as it should be. We intend, therefore, to utilize the time available to us to discuss certain aspects of Defence and we shall deal with other Defence matters which are important later on in this Session on the appropriate occasion which will then occur.</p>

<p>Earlier this Session, partly in view of this sort of situation and partly in view of the tremendous importance of Defence to the country to-day, we placed certain proposals to the Government suggesting some improvements and changes in Parliamentary procedure as far as Defence matters were concerned. Changes which would not only provide more adequate time but which would also permit a much freer and more extensive discussion of Defence including the exchange of Defence information which could not normally be done in the course of an open debate of this nature. We suggested, <i>inter alia,</i> the issue of a Defence White Paper and the setting up of a Parliamentary Defence Committee. We gave certain examples of the principle we were thinking of to be adapted to our own needs. I should like the hon. the Minister, in his reply, to tell us whether it has been possible to do anything at all in that connection and, if so, how far he has got in the examination of our suggestion and whether the Government or the Minister has reached any decision aiming at the introduction of some such system. I would urge the Minister not to be put off by the magnitude of a similar system in some of the major countries. They naturally base theirs on the magnitude of their own defence requirements. Our aim is the application of a similar principle but on a very much smaller scale.</p>

<p>I want to discuss some of the implications, as they affect Defence, of the Government&#x2019;s Bantu policy inside South Africa itself. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister in his reply to tell us what the Government&#x2019;s defence policy is in regard to the changed internal position of the Republic which is developing as a result of the Bantustan policy. It has been repeatedly stated that the Bantustan states which the Government intends to create will eventually develop into sovereign independent states. The first positive action in that direction has been taken since the Defence Budget was put before the House. The first step in that direction has been taken in the form of the Transkei Constitution Bill which was passed earlier this Session. It must be accepted that as a result of that Government policy, the speed at which these independent states will become fully independent will no longer be under the control of the Government itself but that that control will largely devolve on the Bantustans themselves. We have evidence of that already. No argument can be adduced to alter the fact that this new Transkeian territory will punch a dangerous hole right in one of the most important sections of our national defence perimeter of the Republic as a whole. I think we have to accept that that will be so. The danger will naturally increase as the independent state of the various Bantustan territories develops. It is quite clear that in view of that feature alone, leaving out all the other external pressures, there has to be a complete reappraisal of the Republic&#x2019;s defence policy in regard, not only to those areas, but to the use of those areas as a base from which aggression, subversive activity or generally <span class="col_8603-8604" refersTo="page_0550"/>matters which can affect the security of the Republic, can be directed against us. It is an accepted fact that in order to be successful saboteurs have to have a base either within or in close fighting distance from the territory in which they are going to operate. Again, the evidence we have had up to now is that the potential for such a base exists in the Bantustan territory to be established. The country and the Minister have to face the unpleasant fact that the Republic&#x2019;s security is being undermined by the pursuance of this particular policy. We must accept that the security value of the defence we have built up is being completely offset and nullified by this ideological colour legislation of which we have had a mass during this Session alone. I want to ask the hon. the Minister specifically, with regard to these questions, what the Republic&#x2019;s defence policy is in relation to the Bantustans they are creating? I am not referring to the day-to-day policy which flows rather from unforeseen happenings, but the national policy, the long-term policy, in the light of the ultimate full independence of these territories. Are we to have non-offensive alliance or non-aggression pacts with these states as they become more and more independent? Will there be any control over the type and quantity of armaments that their Governments can acquire or from whom they can acquire them? Will there be any control over the technical or other special assistance they can obtain from any external power or any barriers against any liaison they could build up with communistic states, which would be detrimental to the security of the Republic? Will South Africa train their defence forces as they develop, because develop they will. They will have to develop their own defence force. We have had that lesson right down through Africa so we cannot be blind to it ourselves. I do not want anyone to get up and tell me I am talking politics. I am talking about matters which are fundamental to the long-term security of this country. It is from that basis that I want to approach this matter. Will we in South Africa have anything to do with the training of the defence forces of those Bantustans? And, if so, from what source will the requisite instructors and the equipment be forthcoming? We are already experiencing difficulties in the expanded training system in our own defence force. What control will the Republic exercise over their coastal areas and the seaboard and their territorial waters which are now being extended to about 12 miles?</p>

<p>One of the most important features of control affecting our own security is the control over their coastal areas, their seaboard and their territorial waters.

<p>I do not propose to reply to the questions of the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) although I should like to say a word or two about them. In the first place I am glad he says he does not make this speech for political purposes, because I wish to appeal to the Opposition not to exploit for political purposes the problems in regard to Defence. It will be a tragic day if we do that. For that reason I am glad that the hon. member said he was not trying to make political capital by means of his speech.</p>

<p>I should like to say in the first place, Mr. Chairman, that the Transkei is not going to become an independent country within one year. It will take a number of years before it becomes an absolutely independent country, if they wish to be that.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>My common-sense tells me that. My common-sense tells me that the Transkei is not going to be a sovereign independent State in the full sense of the word very soon. But secondly I wish to say that I think the Transkei is going to be dependent on the Republic of South Africa for a very long time. I think it will be to the advantage of the Transkei and of the Republic that we should maintain the closest mutual co-operation. It will be to our advantage in regard to any problem regarding the defence of the Transkei. Now I should like to say this on the other hand: Every country in the world has certain neighbours. Every country in the world prepares itself for self-defence. Whatever you do, you have to have regard to your neighbours. South Africa&#x2019;s neighbours are Mo&#x00E7;ambique, the Federation and Angola. We do not know what the future holds in store for those countries; we do not even know what their immediate future is. We could also be threatened by those countries. Now I should like to mention something else. We have on our borders Bechuanaland, Swaziland and Basutoland. All of them are aspiring to independence. I have never yet heard hon. members say that this may involve dangers to us. In other words, I am saying that in the same way as we to-day have as neighbours Swaziland, Bechuanaland and Basutoland, in the same way as we have as our neighbour Rhodesia which apparently is to become Black, and we do not know what the future holds in store for Angola and Mo&#x00E7;ambique&#x2014;in the same way we shall have the Transkei as our neighbour. I think it is completely wrong to say that the Transkei constitutes a great danger to us. a danger we cannot possibly meet. That argument can only be used to scare the public of South Africa. I do not think hon. members will say that we should absorb all our neighbours because they constitute a danger to us. If a country regards its neighbours as a danger to it, then it means there is only one alternative open to it, and that is to absorb all its neighbours until it has absorbed the whole world. Any country in the world will always have neighbours. For that reason I think that we should not just <span class="col_8605-8606" refersTo="page_0551"/>assume that if we were to have another neighbour it must necessarily constitute a danger to us. That is the reply I should like to give hon. members opposite in all modesty.</p>

<p>In the time left to me, Mr. Chairman, I should like to convey to the Minister a few words of thanks for having maintained throughout that we in South Africa, in spite of the fact that in the Western countries things are happening which are not always pleasant to us, must side with the West and that in spite of everything he tells the West that we stand by them. I think that is the correct point of view. We are a Western country; we have a Western way of life and under all circumstances and in any danger we must stand by the West. I am deeply convinced that the Western nations will begin to appreciate to an increasing extent the strategic value of a stable Government and of a stable economy and of a stable country like South Africa. While all kinds of governments are emerging in Africa, governments upon which the West cannot fully rely, I think the West will eventually realize that at the southern tip of Africa there is a country, economically strong, which is of tremendous strategic value, very much greater strategic value in any future warfare than it had in the two last wars.</p>

<p>A war against whom?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>A war between the East and the West or between Russia and the West. In such a war South Africa is going to be of much greater strategic value because we are much more industrialized than we were in the past. As conditions develop in South Africa the West will realize that this stable country can be of great strategic value to them. As we are a country which wants to protect our Western way of life, it is the correct attitude to adopt, namely that we will under all circumstances stand by the West. For that reason I am glad the Minister is adopting this attitude. I say not only the industrial potential of South Africa, but also the sea route around South Africa is going to be of much greater value than in the past in a future war in which America may be involved&#x2014;particularly because America will be the main country concerned. I should like to mention only one fact, and that is that in Africa South Africa will be the furthermost point from the arena of the immediate war. A war between Russia and Europe and America must be decided in Europe and a war between China and the West must be decided in Asia. Therefore I say, Mr. Chairman. South Africa is the furthermost point in Africa from the battle arena in Europe or in Asia, and it is going to be of the greatest importance to the West. I think the Minister is adopting the correct attitude by saying all day long that, in spite of all the things the Western nations are doing to us, and are saying (for instance, that they will not supply us with weapons (at least the Labour Party in England says this)), we will stand by the Western nations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I am not going to follow on what the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Van der Walt) has said&#x2014;I hope he will forgive me&#x2014;except to express the fervent hope that some of his rosy dreams will indeed come true. But I believe the time is past that South Africa can depend on these rosy dreams of assistance from other quarters, much as I hope that would eventuate. The countries who are most likely to threaten us are not Russia or China alone; there are territories to the north of us and I think they are the most likely ones we shall have to deal with at the moment. Here we are and we have to stand on our own feet. Have we not learnt a lesson from what has happened in Swaziland? The same sort of thing can happen in the territories that we are now making independent. There in Swaziland we learnt a double lesson. Great Britain had to depend upon the friendship of South Africa in order to get her troops and supplies through to Swaziland, and just as unrest has been stirred up there so it can be stirred up amongst our own people. You see, Mr. Profumo and his red-headed girl-friend have put a stop to all prospects of our getting further assistance from Great Britain because of the change of Government which now seems inevitable. Let us discount that for the moment and deal with realities.</p>

<p>There is one last question I want to put to the hon. the Minister. Is the strategic planning and, the equipment of our Defence Force, which have been prepared with one eventuality in view, being revised and realigned to meet the important changes which have been brought about through the creation of these independent Bantustans? The whole position is so fraught with danger that we cannot afford to sit and wait for something to happen and then do our planning. The whole defence organization must take a long-term view of what they are planning for. It takes five or six years to get some of the essential equipment landed in this country. At the time the equipment is ordered the plan for which it is required has to be known and appreciated. But the factors bearing on that plan have changed to such an extent that we cannot wait. The time for a clarification on the Republic&#x2019;s defence policy is now. The Government is responsible for the necessity of changing that policy. It is therefore necessary for them to visualize what dangers they are planning against if certain eventualities occur. As I said just now we have enough evidence of what is likely to occur. You see, Mr. Chairman, this is no longer a matter of territorial defence. This is a matter, which viewed cold-bloodedly, can ultimately mean the survival or the destruction of this Republic of ours. You cannot gamble with that. That is why we should like to learn from the Minister, as far as he is able to give it, what the Government&#x2019;s policy is in meeting this new situation as it might well arise. We are seeing it approaching us and you cannot leave such things to chance. You cannot let them wait and improvise emergency action when the first signs of trouble start to appear; it is too late then. It has got to be dealt with now in the <span class="col_8607-8608" refersTo="page_0552"/>planning stage. The crisis is on the way to us now, and we want to know the answer now. We are supporting the Government, we have consistently supported the Government throughout the years in regard to its defence commitments. We have backed them, we have done everything to try and help them to make a success of it. But we also have a duty to do to the Republic and we now demand that these defence preparations must be realistic. They have got to face what can happen in the light of the changes that the Government themselves are bringing about inside the borders of our country. It is not only the outside danger, it is the inside one that we have also got to deal with. When you have security inside your country, you can face the enemy outside in a much happier frame of mind. And we on this side are not satisfied, we have said so repeatedly, that the situation internally is so fully appreciated by the Government as for them to realize what potential for danger to this country may well develop from this Bantustan creation of their own.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat will forgive me if I do not react immediately to what he said, but there is a good deal in what he said which I wholeheartedly agree, and I hope to return to that. I should like to express my appreciation to the hon. the Minister, who in the circumstances of the present time must have one of the most difficult Departments in South Africa to administer. As regards the people of South Africa it is certainly regarded also as one of the most important because our internal security; the whole existence of our country is affected by his portfolio. That is why we must support him and that is why I endorse what the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) has said, that we should forget entirely about trying to make political capital out of a debate of this nature. It does not behove us in South Africa to-day at all.</p>

<p>Now there are a few matters I should like to have a reply to if possible. But if the Minister cannot reply to me, for strategical reasons, I shall not take it amiss of him. The first point I should like to make is this, that there are several of our Commandos which are struggling to get their numbers up to the requisite strength. In our towns and everywhere there are young men who are just loitering around and who know nothing about defence matters at all, who apparently have never handled a gun; they cannot shoot and they do not belong to a Commando; and they do not realize what is going on in the country and what is happening around us, and they have no idea of the threats facing South Africa. The hon. the Minister told us during a recent debate that he hoped to have 140,000 men in uniform next year. We appreciate it that he has progressed so far already. I wish also to express my appreciation for the statements made by the hon. the Minister in connection with our aviation and air defences, and for what I know has already been achieved in this sphere, as well as the serious attempts to protect and defend our shores properly in time of trouble. But in this regard I associate myself with the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). If possible we should like to know to what extent we are ready, should there be any trouble. Because it would be foolish of this House not to realize and appreciate that if trouble should come, the African States will exploit it to the very best of their ability, and that they will exploit the internal circumstances with our great non-White population, where they will most certainly try to organize a fifth column, and where we shall then most likely have to fight on two fronts. These are important things we are considering here, and therefore I do not expect the hon. the Minister to come and tell me what has been done already, but if we could only have the assurance that the planning has already been set afoot to safeguard South Africa if these things were to happen, and that every man, and if need be every woman too, is prepared and that they will have the weapons to fight with, it will largely set our minds at rest. Let me say at once that I do not regard myself as too old to go and fight if my country should be in danger. But I cannot go into battle with an old shotgun and an old Webley revolver. Has our country the supplies? Do we have the arms, do we have the ammunition, the weapons? If we could have some information in that regard, so that we know that plans have been completed as to what action will be taken and what may be expected, then I think that I at least will sleep much more peacefully. But the fact is that, like other persons, I am worried.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>Thank you very much. If I know the weapons are there, and if I am sure the people will know how to use these arms, I shall be much more content. But at the moment that is not the case yet. I am perturbed about those young people who are lying around in our cities, bank clerks and other clerks who know nothing about weapons. When we think of the threats being made against us in South Africa at present, we must realize that something may happen shortly, or it may be in the distant future, or it may be never, but we must be prepared for it. There is another matter which I regard as of the utmost importance to South Africa. When we look at States to the North of us, we find that Egypt has succeeded, and Israel has succeeded, in attracting to their countries some of the greatest scientists in respect of defence matters; virtually to buy them. I am thinking of Messerschmidt of Germany, who is manufacturing arms for Egypt at present; we know that to-day they have the potential arms to wipe out their arch-enemy Israel. On the other hand we know also that much German aid is being invoked by Western Germany for the defence and protection <span class="col_8609-8610" refersTo="page_0553"/>of Israel should the Arab states launch an attack. Now this is my question: I think it should also be possible for South Africa to buy scientific brains, scientific ability. If it is a matter of money, South Africa must find that money, and I do not think anybody will object to that. Why cannot we have an arms factory established in South Africa, if necessary with foreign assistance?</p>

As I see it, we do not have at our disposal the requisite aircraft which could also be manufactured in our country, although our nation will have to make sacrifices to do so. We shall have to pay for it, but nevertheless I think it will be possible to buy that &#x201C;knowhow&#x201D; in overseas countries. In other words, we shall have to buy the man to come and settle here, and if it is necessary for South Africa&#x2019;s safety and continued existence, I just cannot see how we can back out of it. I believe if the hon. the Minister were to come to this House with such a case, we will be only too ready to give him the green light. I sincerely urge that that idea should take root with the hon. the Minister and with his advisers. I should like to say a word or two about what the hon. the Minister recently said in regard to our coastal defences; when he said that if it was necessary for South Africa to acquire submarines, South Africa would acquire them. That is a most important statement. I do not know where we shall be able to get them, and I personally am concerned about that. If the hon. the Minister could reassure us, then I will, as he has said, sleep more soundly, but if our men are called up, even if it is for only three weeks in a year, and I do not think we should have regard to the age factor, then we must make provision for it. Those who can walk should learn to handle weapons. We must not exempt a man of 50 or 60. Much older men have fought in wars in this country in former years. If a man can walk he must learn to handle a gun. I think it is very necessary for our internal defence. because if our troops have to guard our borders or have to guard our coast line, who will then look after our internal defence? That is where the older men could play their role. Hence this plea of mine. Having regard to the threats against us, having regard to what is appearing in the newspapers of the world every day, and having regard to the pleas of the Africa States at U.N.O., that no further weapons of any kind should be supplied to South Africa. I do not think there can be any doubt at all that we must realize that we have been forced into a corner and that we shall be called upon ourselves to ward off those dangers in this country.

<p>I hope that the hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) will not take it amiss if I do not follow up what he said. I just want to say that I agree wholeheartedly with his statement&#x2014;that it is a great pity that there are so many of our young people, and also older people, who do not make use of the opportunity which they have to join the Commandos and to receive training in the use of our latest small-arms and so forth. This is to the detriment of South Africa. If the hon. the Minister can do anything to improve this position, I am sure he will do so.</p>

<p>In these difficult times in which we are living in South Africa it is only natural of course that we should all be very interested indeed in the Defence policy of the Government. As the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) has said, we on this side of the House have always tried to help where we can to make our Defence Force as strong as possible, and we shall continue to do so.</p>

<p>I personally am rather concerned at the threats which are being made against us daily by the Africa States. Not that I think they can do us any harm at the moment, but one can almost say that those threats have passed the cold war stage. We are not engaged in a shooting war as yet but it has passed the cold war stage. The Africa States decided a few weeks ago at Addis Ababa to set up a fund in order to finance an offensive against South Africa. The first shots in that offensive have not yet been fired but we have already passed the cold war stage. The fact that worries one more is that these people are receiving material as well as moral support from nations who ought to support us, who ought to stand with us. It is in this fact that I see the great danger that threatens us to-day. It is a great pity that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has not succeeded in getting some of these people on our side. But I do not want to elaborate in this regard. The fact that he has failed, however, makes the responsibility and the task of the hon. the Minister of Defence so much greater. A far greater responsibility rests upon his shoulders to-day because we find that South Africa virtually stands alone, and we hope that the hon. the Minister will be able to do something to win back the goodwill of some of those people who have always stood by us faithfully&#x2014;to get them on our side once again.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has also done his best.</p>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that he has done his best, but unfortunately, he has failed. I do not think there can be any doubt that our Defence Force is organized to-day and that we are able to maintain internal security under difficult circumstances. I go so far as to say that I am quite sure that our Defence Force will be able to stand up to our enemies in Africa and keep them out of South Africa. But unfortunately our position is deteriorating. A fact which gives us great cause for concern and which has also been mentioned by the hon. member for Pretoria (District) is that <span class="col_8611-8612" refersTo="page_0554"/>the people who have always stood by us and who would want to stand by us are now openly saying that they will no longer supply us with arms. I am thinking of Mr. Wilson and his statements and of the reports that we have seen in the Press from America to the effect that America is also beginning to doubt whether she should sell aircraft to us. We also read in the Press that countries like Italy are refusing to sell pistols and revolvers to us. This is a very serious state of affairs because although we are manufacturing many of our small-arms, ammunition and shells here in South Africa, there are large numbers of weapons of war that we need and that we cannot manufacture ourselves. I think, for example, of the large aircraft which have been mentioned in this House, aircraft like the &#x201C;Buccanneer&#x201D;. South Africa is not able to manufacture these aircraft at this stage nor will she be able to do so for the next few years. We are not even able to manufacture training aircraft, which are comparatively easy to manufacture. It is no small matter to establish a factory for the manufacture of training aircraft. We are still dependent upon foreign factories for these items and I hope that the hon. the Minister in his capacity as Minister of Defence will be able to make an arrangement with those who are able to supply us with this material so that we can be sure that these items will be delivered when they are needed.</p>

<p>It is often said that we will stand by the West and that we will be of great strategic importance to the West. That is quite true, but we must remember that South Africa can only be of strategic importance to the West as long as South Africa stands, as long as our cities, our harbours, our industries and our communications function normally. If these are disrupted, we will no longer be of any strategic importance to anyone. Because of the position in which it finds itself to-day, the Congo is of no strategic importance to any country because chaos reigns there. We must remember that in wartime our industries and communications have to carry a burden which is far greater than they have to carry in peacetime, and if they are destroyed or come to a standstill we will lose our strategic importance. The point that I want to make is that I feel that the hon. the Minister of Defence should try somehow to make countries of the West understand that South Africa will stand by them but that if South Africa falls into the hands of a Black Government, she will lose her strategic importance to the West because then everything will be destroyed.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned that we are able to manufacture the light weapons that we need for our internal security and to ward off attacks that may come from the African States, but there are other obligations which I think should be placed on record. I have stated previously in this House&#x2014;and I think this is vitally necessary&#x2014;that it is not sufficient for our Government to say that we will stand by the West. We must have a proper understanding. It must be understood that while our support of the West imposes certain obligations upon is, it also imposes certain obligations upon our allies to assist us. They will then be compelled to supply us with the arms that we will need to help them when the time comes. Our difficulties will then disappear to a large extent. I want to suggest that it may be possible for us to take the lead in regard to a South Atlantic Treaty Organization. Cannot we arrange a treaty of this nature? We will then at least have the assurance that as far as our struggle against Communism is concerned, as far as the East is concerned, we will have the support and assistance of those of our Western allies to whom we can look for help.</p>

<p>I want to some back to the point raised by the hon. member for Simonstown and that is that we would like to be given more information. We do not want to use this information to the detriment of the Government or the Defence Force, but we are voting colossal sums for defence to-day and although we have the fullest confidence in the Minister and his staff that they will use that money to the best advantage I do think that a committee should be brought into being&#x2014;as suggested by the hon. member for Simonstown&#x2014;which will at least be fully acquainted with the policy of the Government, with the difficulties that the Government has to contend with and with the obligations that we have to meet.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased that the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) who opened this debate showed great circumspection in what he said. He confined himself to asking questions. But there is one question that I cannot understand because the Government has repeatedly announced&#x2014;and it has been accepted by everyone&#x2014;that the Government is responsible for the defence of the Republic of South Africa. We have the three Services making up our armed forces, three directions in which we can develop as far as the defence of our country is concerned. We have a Navy (the sea arm), we have our Air Force (the air arm), we have our Permanent Force (the land arm). Hon. members have asked whether we are prepared for possible eventualities. The hon. the Minister has told us time and time again that South Africa is as prepared to-day as never before. He has also told us what we can put into the field if we are called upon to do so. We are now asked whether the Government is prepared, and certain possible dangers have been suggested to us. Do hon. members opposite really imagine that the Government has not considered those possibilities? Last year the Government asked for R120,000,000 for the defence of the country and this year it is asking for R157,000,000 for the same purpose. Why do hon. members think the Government asks for those amounts of money? Is it not to prepare ourselves? I do not want to mention figures here and I would be the last person to ask that the world should be told just how prepared we are. I do not <span class="col_8613-8614" refersTo="page_0555"/>want the outside world or our possible enemies to be warned what to expect. The Government has repeatedly stated through the medium of the hon. the Minister that our country is prepared for eventualities. Do hon. members not believe the Government? Do they not accept the word of the hon. the Minister? Sir, it is the duty of the Opposition not only to obtain information if they are afraid that the Government is not prepared, but it is also their duty to make suggestions. What do they want to know? Is there anything in connection with our Navy and our Air Force that they want to know and in regard to which they think improvements can be effected? That may perhaps be so but on the other hand they must also consider the financial aspect; they must ask the Government whether the funds are available. Or else they must say to the Government: &#x201C;We are not satisfied to spend only R157,000,000 a year on defence; we want to suggest that the Government should consider doubling that amount.&#x201D; Sir, if the Government does double this amount it will be able to strengthen our Navy, our Air Force and our Permanent Force to a much greater extent. But it is impossible to do so if the funds are not available. I want to ask whether a country like ours can really afford to spend more money on defence. Year after year, when the hon. the Minister has asked for increased amounts, the Government has been prepared to make those amounts available. Not a single member has refused to vote those amounts. But we find that suspicion is sown, not only here in this House, but in the outside world and the hon. the Minister is asked whether he is prepared in the event of an attack. The hon. the Minister has stated repeatedly that our country is more prepared to-day than ever before. I want to ask hon. members whether they can mention any period in our South African history in which there has been such intensive training of our armed forces as there is at the present time? This has never happened before. The hon. the Minister has told us how many men can be put under arms. Do hon. members want him to increase the number? We are now told that there are many citizens who have not yet joined the Commandos. But the hon. the Minister, with the information at his disposal, has fixed a quota which he considers necessary for the purpose of our internal defence. If he has the men available, he will have to obtain more money if he wants to train more men in the Commandos. The Commandos are no longer what they were in the old days. The Commandos are also being trained to-day. Every officer is trained. The Commandos have a greater striking power to-day than ever before in the history of the Republic of South Africa. What do hon. members want? Cannot they put forward suggestions? Do they want our naval forces to be doubled?</p>

<p>Well. I can understand it but in that case they must say that the public should be taxed accordingly. Otherwise it cannot be done. They may perhaps be able to set up new branches, but do hon. members imagine that the Government and the hon. the Minister have not yet given their attention to this matter? Just think of what has been done during the period in which this Minister has been Minister of Defence. Just think of the number of men who have been trained. Fourteen thousand young men are being trained this year. Mention a period in our history when all this has been done in peacetime. One may perhaps be able to step it up during war-time, but I want hon. members opposite to tell me when it has ever happened in peacetime that 14,000 young men have received intensive training over a period of nine months in the use of the most modem weapons available to us? It is easy for hon. members opposite to talk, of course, when they do not have to bear the responsibility. That is very easy. But let them suggest something practicable that is not being done at the moment. What is more, the hon. the Minister stated recently that he was looking forward to the day when it would be possible to train every able-bodied man in South Africa. This is not something that can be done in a day or in a month. But the question is: Do hon. members opposite want the hon. the Minister to take those steps? If he does take them I am convinced that the Opposition will be the first to say that he is paralysing our industries because he is depriving them of all their manpower. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Before I resumed my seat just now, I was saying that we were spending large sums of money on defence but that this in itself was not a guarantee that the money was being spent wisely. I do not say for one moment, as I was accused of doing by the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker), that that is the case here. My point is that we want more information in this connection. There was a time in our history&#x2014;and not so long ago either&#x2014;when we also spent large sums of money on defence. I am thinking here of the time when the United Party was in power and when Mr. Pirow was Minister of Defence. Large sums of money were also spent then, but what was our position when war broke out?</p>

<speech by="#bronkhorst">

<from>*Brig. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BRONKHORST</person>:</from>

<p>The circumstances were the same. I say that it would be to the advantage of the hon. the Minister, the Department and the country if we had some sort of committee in this House which could give its attention to the question of supplying information relating to defence matters.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, all of us are disturbed at what is happening to the north of us. At this stage we are not afraid that those people will be able to equip an expeditionary force to come and attack us. There are many reasons for that but the most important is that they are far removed from us and it will therefore be difficult for them to attack us. Apart from <span class="col_8615-8616" refersTo="page_0556"/>that we still have buffer states between them and ourselves at the moment, buffer states like Angola, Southern Rhodesia and Mocambique. I want to put a question to the hon. the Minister which he may perhaps not be able to answer across the floor of this House. In any case it is a question which the hon. the Minister and the Cabinet will have to consider seriously. My question is this: What are we doing to assist these buffer states to maintain their position? I am thinking here of Mocambique; I am thinking of Southern Rhodesia and of Angola. Are we going to allow our enemies to walk into those countries? Once they are there, they will be virtually on our doorstep. If that does happen our position will be so much worse. I do think that this is a matter to which the Cabinet should certainly give its attention and in respect of which it will have to find a solution. The States in Africa to the north of us are saying openly to-day that they will assist one another to attack South Africa. They are saying openly that they have established a fund for this purpose at Addis Ababa. They make no secret of it.</p>

<p>The question is whether our Government should not adopt a positive attitude in regard to our friends here in Africa, those just to the north of us. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has already said that we are going to stand by these people. I have no fault to find with that statement. On the contrary, I think it is the right thing to do because it will be in our own interests. If our enemies reach our borders we will experience precisely what was experienced in Algeria; we will then have precisely what we had in Korea when the communists and the volunteers took positions across the Yalu River and caused tremendous damage to the south of the river without our aircraft even being able to go across to help. We will have the same position here once our enemies are just beyond our borders. They will be able to carry on guerrilla warfare across our border. If we try to attack them, they will simply withdraw across the border. That is why it is so important to us that these buffer states should not be overrun. We must prevent that.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of the matter. We already know of the difficulties that exist in the Protectorates. As we all know, the Protectorates are still under British rule. We must expect the position to become even worse once the Protectorates are given their independence.</p>

<p>Since that will be the position as far as the Protectorates are concerned, there is all the more reason why we should safeguard our northern frontiers.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to associate myself with the question that was put to the Government by the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) who asked what the Government had in mind for the defence of the Republic when the so-called Bantustans received their independence. I know that the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Van der Walt) said that this would not happen within the next two or three years. But the defence aspect of this matter requires a great deal of advance planning. Plans must be made now so that when that day comes we will be prepared.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I feel that I can agree with every word that the hon. member for North East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) said at the start of his speech except for his statement that the hon. the Minister should give more information to the United Party and the country. From speeches made by hon. members opposite we have been able to deduce that they too are concerned about the defence of our country, and if they approach the hon. the Minister with the idea of obtaining more information, I am sure he will not refuse to give it to them. But I want to point out that information that has thus far been withheld has been withheld for only one reason and that is with a view to the safety of South Africa. There is no other reason why information should be withheld. There are no other secret reasons why this should be done. All the information that can be supplied, bearing in mind the interests of the Republic, is supplied. Where information is withheld, it is withheld with a view to the safety of the State.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the speech made here this afternoon by the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay). I think I can say that we are all pleased that we have once again had the assurance from that hon. member that the United Party supports the defence policy of the Government. It was evident that the hon. member for Simonstown felt rather perturbed. When the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. Van der Walt) said that South Africa might be of a strategic importance in a war between East and West or in a war against communist countries, the hon. member for Simonstown immediately stated that there was no threat from that quarter. He said that the hon. member for Pretoria (West) was not being realistic in his approach to the matter. He said that the real threat to us was from North Africa. I am not the type of person who wants to start an argument at about 6 o&#x2019;clock on a Friday afternoon, and so I shall not do so, but I just want to say that we are very pleased that the United Party has also come to that conclusion. I cannot help thinking back two years ago when we were rediculed because we said that we should spend more on defence for that very reason. It was said then that the money that we were spending on defence was being spent with a view to internal security and that there was no threat from the Africa states.</p>

<p>However, we are making progress because the United Party has also realized now that we do face a danger from that quarter. If they want to co-operate on that basis, we will welcome it. But this co-operation holds other dangers. Certain hon. members opposite appealed to the hon. the Minister this afternoon to try to convince the Western nations that it was essential <span class="col_8617-8618" refersTo="page_0557"/>that a White Government should remain in power here in South Africa. Those were the words used by the hon. member for North East Rand. That is correct, and we welcome that statement. But at the same time I want to ask whether in attacking our policy they are not creating the impression in the minds of the Africa States, amongst others, that there is a possibility of overthrowing this White Government? Do we not run the risk as a result of what they say, namely, that it is due to the policy of this Government that we find ourselves in danger, that these people may conclude that if a change of Government can be brought about here it will be possible to oust the White Government in South Africa?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>When they say that, we must remember that they have an alternative policy, a policy which carries no assurance that a White Government will remain in office here. The hon. member for Simonstown asked, and the hon. member for North East Rand repeated the question, what the effect would be on our defence when the Transkei eventually received its independence. This question has been replied to repeatedly. Even though the Transkei will be given self-government the responsibility for its defence will still rest with this Government.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member now contends that that is not what the hon. the Minister said. The fact is that this Minister and the hon. the Prime Minister have said so repeatedly. They have stated repeatedly that defence matters will remain in our hands until such time as the Transkei shows that it is able to exercise sovereign independence. Even then it would be stupid on our part to give them control of defence matters without ensuring that we have their friendship. When one listens to hon. members opposite one can only conclude that we face dangers from the African States and that they are so dangerous that we must ensure that when they reach our northern frontier we are there to meet them. At the same time, the hon. member said that by that time the Transkei would have been able to conclude agreements with hostile African States and would be able to serve as a springboard for attacks on South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown asked this question repeatedly. What about the defence of our coastline; what about agreements that the Transkei can conclude with other African States? The hon. member for North East Rand need not look so innocent. He asked the same question in the same vein.</p>

<p>I said at the start that I wanted to support certain statements made by the hon. member. He spoke about countries which ought to stand with us but which are threatening us at the moment. I take it that the hon. member was not surprised when he learnt of the decision taken at Addis Ababa, but I am sure that he was as surprised as I was when he heard the comments of Mr. Adlai Stevenson. I take it that the hon. member was equally surprised at the remarks of Harold Wilson when he explained what the attitude of the Labour Party would be towards South Africa if that Party came into power. I agree with the hon. member for North East Rand that we should not do anything to drive these people further away from us. But at the same time I want to say that if these people demand that we should give up a policy that we cannot give up, we will have to do without their assistance and carry on alone. For this we need a united front in the Republic and a united front particularly in this House.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to take up one point which was raised by the hon. member for North East Rand and that is the point relating to the acquisition of equipment for our forces. I want to deal with this aspect from another angle. I should like to question the hon. the Minister in regard to the general policy which he follows in connection with the development of our forces. It is not sufficient to say that we are training a citizen by putting a rifle into his hands, training him how to use it and then saying that we have a trained force. The training of our forces must be directed at a specific purpose. This must surely be based on the appreciation of the situation by the Minister&#x2019;s General Staff. Let me say in more specific terms what I am thinking of. When the Special Defence Equipment Account was established it had as a basis a specific direction of training based in turn on certain obligations which we had accepted in respect of playing our part along with the West. In other words, that Account was established for the purpose of acquiring armour for the setting up of an armoured division for use by the West in any place outside South Africa. At that time we had commitments in regard to the Middle East and we were told that this equipment was being acquired to develop an armoured division for use beyond the borders of the Republic.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize this, namely that where we acquire arms, these arms must be for forces who are being trained in a particular direction and for a particular purpose. Now, there can only be two objects in connection with the training of our forces. Firstly, there is the internal aspect, i.e. the object of defending our country against an aggressor from within Africa. We have heard talk of aggression on the part of the African States against our country. This then is the one object for which our <span class="col_8619-8620" refersTo="page_0558"/>forces can be trained. But there is also another object. The Minister told us last session that he believed it was essential for the West to make a joint effort to make every individual State as strong as possible. That implies that we would be prepared to use our forces in support of the West in the event of any international war which may break out, say between East and West. My argument boils down to this that arms are being acquired to enable us to train our forces with one of these two objects in view.</p>

<p>I raise this because we have been told diplomatically by very important States at international gatherings that they are no longer going to supply South Africa with arms. Here I have one country in particular in mind and that is the United States. As a matter of fact, the United States has given an undertaking in this regard on an international forum by Mr. Plimpton, their Ambassador to the United Nations. This is important to us because when the Special Defence Equipment Account was established we entered into an agreement with the Government of the United States in that we became a party to the Mutual Defence Assistance Act of the Government of the United States. In confirmation we exchanged notes with that Government. At any rate, we accepted certain obligations in regard to the object for which those arms will be used, i.e. the object of preserving world peace. At this point I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether we are still acquiring equipment from the Government of the United States under that Mutual Defence Assistance Act. I have the relevant agreement here, clause five of which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government of the Union of South Africa understands that prior to the transfer of any item or the rendering of any service under this Act, the United States Government retains the right to terminate this transaction.</block>

<p>It is pertinent therefore that we should ask particularly in the light of the public statements which have been made before the United Nations and which have appeared world wide in the Press. What the position now is in this regard as it is relevant to the development of our forces. This agreement certainly places obligations on the Government of the Republic and certainly also on the Government of the United States.</p>

<p>The Minister has stated that we are developing our forces in order to play our part with the Western nations for the preservation of peace. Consequently, I take it that this is one of the objects for which we are developing a larger force.</p>

<p>You are quite correct.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Now, if that is so, where then does the emphasis fall in regard to the development of our forces and the acquisition of arms and equipment? If the States of Africa attempt any military action in whatever way against South Africa they will, in terms of this agreement to which some of them are also party, become aggressor states and as such can be charged before the Security Council. As I have said, some of these states are also party to this agreement which states quite clearly if one of the signatories becomes an aggressor state it can lose all the advantages under that agreement, including the right to acquire military equipment.</p>

<p>So we are faced with the question: What is the policy of the Government in regard to the building up of our defence forces? Is the object merely to build up a defensive force from the point of view of defending ourselves against aggression or are we building up our forces in order to play our part with the rest of the Western world for the preservation of peace?</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<p>South Africa is the only Western country which is not associated with any country, except under the Simonstown agreement with Britain, in a pact such as NATO, SEATO and others. We are the only nation which is not associated with the Western nations in an overall pattern of defence strategy. The only pact we have is to defend the southern seas with the United Kingdom. This, however, is in terms of a private agreement between ourselves and the United Kingdom only. Apart from that we play no part with any group of Western nations for the preservation of peace in the world.</p>

<p>It is clear that we must have some indication from the hon. the Minister. The Minister must come out into the open and tell us whether we are developing our defence forces merely on the fear of aggression from within Africa, in other words, purely defensive, or are we developing our forces for participating with the Western nations if they are so required. I hope the Minister will clarify these issues.</p>

<p>I now want to come to the point which was raised by the hon. member for Kimberley (North). I am glad that the hon. member for Pretoria (District) disagreed with that hon. member. Let us hope that the hon. member for Pretoria (District) has convinced the hon the Minister of what we from this side have tried for a long time to convince him in respect of the training of the Commandos. If that is so, then we have complete unanimity on both sides of the House and, consequently, the Minister need no longer be afraid to go ahead with an active programme for the training of the Commandos into an effective force.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank hon. members who have taken part in this debate so far for their objective approach. World affairs and our own affairs make it essential that we take an interest in matters of defence in these days but it is as essential that these matters should be discussed in an objective way.</p>

<p>The main pattern of the debate, as it was set by the Opposition, was one which really had nothing much to do with the internal management of our defence activities, but really what our defence plans are in view of the political situation internally and externally. The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) put a series of questions to me. Most of them arise, as I see it, from the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s inherent fear that Bantustans will create new or additional military threats. I cannot blame the hon. member for his anxiety. We are all filled with anxiety these days. But, Sir, in matters of defence one must be prepared to take calculated risks to gain victory. Our Government&#x2019;s Bantu policy has been discussed over and over again and I am not prepared to enter into that field again, but I must answer the hon. gentleman&#x2019;s main question which was really the basis of his speech, and that is what the Government&#x2019;s defence policy was in regard to the development of independent Bantu states. I take it that in talking about independent Bantu states he has in mind our own Bantu homelands which we are leading to full independence. Sir, defence plans can only be made after evaluating a particular threat. First of all I do not accept the fact that all Black sovereign independent states will of necessity be hostile. I see the day coming in Africa when Black and White states will have to stand together to fight a new encroaching imperialism, and for that reason I cannot accept that all independent Black states are of necessity hostile states. But coming back to our own developing free Bantu homelands, I want to state most emphatically that I have no special defence plan to control these states when once they get to the stage of sovereign independence, first of all, because as I have already said, I do not accept that these states will of necessity be hostile. Let us accept for a moment, for the sake of argument, that the presumption of the hon. member that they will be hostile states is correct, then surely our general defence build-up to keep us going on this vast continent can be adjusted in a comparatively short time to cope with this new task. Why therefore should we prepare long beforehand for such an eventual task? Sir, it is up to us, in the military field as well, to build up a more friendly co-existence in Africa, and we cannot possibly do it with present-day African demands but eventually we will have to make a break-through. That is essential. We can only hope to begin by gaining the goodwill of one or at least a few of the free African states, and it is my considered opinion, although I know that it may be belittled, that we have no better opportunity to gain this initial goodwill than we have with our own Bantu states which we lead to independence and financial stability&#x2014;states with which we confer daily, states which for many years to come will be dependent on the military protection which we can give them to <span class="col_8623-8624" refersTo="page_0560"/>maintain order internally, states which daily will have the opportunity of experiencing our goodwill towards them. Our help in the way of medical science, our help in the way of veterinary science, our help in the way of agricultural science, will continually be experienced by them. In fact in all aspects of life they will be closely associated with us and will enjoy our help. For those reasons we have no better opportunity to gain the goodwill of free African states than we have with our own Bantu states which we lead to independence. These states will of necessity give us the best opportunity to make a break-through. I know that these arguments may be belittled but they are facts. If we argue that friendly co-existence with these states which we lead to independence is impossible then we accept the fact that friendly co-existence with African states as such is basically impossible. If this is impossible, then it can only be impossible because the Black man refuses to co-operate in any manner whatsoever with the White man in Africa, and in that case it will be impossible for a White-controlled state in Africa to continue in the future. I believe that we must be militarily prepared at all times, but I honestly believe that our free Bantu homelands will still prove to be one of the main pillars on which we will eventually build up African goodwill on this vast continent of ours.</p>

<p>*I do not think that our chances of creating this goodwill will be very good if we accept the advice of the hon. member for Simonstown to make military preparations at this stage to keep those people in order once they receive their sovereign freedom. We must accept the psychological truth that trust engenders trust, and if at this stage accept as a fact, as the hon. member suggested, that our entire military build-up is going to be neutralized by this great danger that we are creating, then I do not think we can expect those people to trust us. The second question which the hon. member put to me was whether we would have anything to do with the training of the armed forces of those states in the future. I cannot reply to that now. My reply is that everything will depend on the circumstances prevailing at that stage. It is impossible to give a reply in this connection so far in advance.</p>

<p>His third question was whether in the future we would Table a White Paper in connection with the Defence Budget. If hon. members really believe that such White Paper will be of value, I shall see to it that a White Paper of this nature is tabled in the future.</p>

<p>A further question which the hon. member for Simonstown put to me was whether I had done anything in connection with the suggestion put forward here that we should appoint a Defence Council. The hon. member then advised me not to allow myself to be deterred by the complications of that sort of arrangement in the bigger states. I told the hon. member a short while ago that we were making a study as to how this was being done in America, but up to the present moment I have found no solution. If we did issue a White Paper and if advantage was taken of my offer that if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition nominated certain members I would then give them far more information than it would be possible to give to the House as a whole, then I know that those members would be hampered to some extent but that would also apply to the members who made up such a Defence Council. But I am making a study of this matter. I am unable to make any promises in this connection at this stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (District) (Mr. Schoonbee) showed an intelligent interest in the question of our defence. I think I should reply to some of the points raised in his speech. He said firstly that the Commandos were having trouble as far as manpower was concerned. The fact remains that our Commandos represent the voluntary leg of our armed forces but even as far as our Commandos are concerned, great changes have also been brought about recently. Let us first ask ourselves what is the task of the Commandos. The prescribed task of the Commandos is to assist in maintaining internal order in their own area. We have now established in the Commandos the sentinel platoons which form a well-trained nucleus in those Commandos and consisting of men who are well equipped. Furthermore, we have mapped all the important places in each Commando area, proper maps have been made of these areas and as far as the strength of the Commandos is concerned, that is determined by the importance of the places which they would have to protect in their own areas. Furthermore, considerably more financial assistance is being given to the Commandos this year. Officers will now be able to obtain secretarial assistance. We are also going to give them office accommodation. Two years ago we placed members of the Commandos under military discipline once they were called up. The Commando organization has made rapid progress in recent times therefore.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (District) also said that there were still large numbers of young men who were not yet receiving training and that they should all be trained. I have already explained in this House that we are doing as much as we possibly can to train more and more people, but we cannot train everyone at once. Mr. Menzies, who recently made a speech on defence in his Parliament because his Minister of Defence was ill, said this, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Army cannot be strengthened in terms of training very suddenly.</block>

<p>It is not only impossible there; it is also physically impossible here. The one great danger that we have to avoid is to have armed and undisciplined or poorly disciplined men. We cannot agree to that and we cannot encourage it. We must give proper training to the men to whom we give military training, and we must discipline them properly. We are continually expanding. Next year we <span class="col_8625-8626" refersTo="page_0561"/>shall be training about 20,000 young men&#x2014;16,000 ballotees, 1,800 in the gymnasia and 1,800 who will be assigned to the Commandos and will also be given a reasonable amount of training. There we already have 19,600 and in addition to that the young men who join the Permanent Force. Next year we will train considerably more than 20,000 of our young men. We are making rapid progress therefore.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked that we should buy scientific brainpower. I too am fully aware of the necessity for having scientific brainpower and so is the State, and that is why we now have a committee which is investigating the question of the training, etc., of scientists. We ourselves, on the military side, are continually in contact with the best brainpower in the world. We send missions overseas and overseas missions visit us.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to put this question to the hon. member. When did he hear that Egypt possessed rockets? Did he hear it when this was still being foreshadowed, or after it had become an accomplished fact?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schoonbee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SCHOONBEE</person>:</from>

<p>May I whisper the reply to you just now?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is all I want to say in that regard. The hon. member also said that we needed rockets. I agree with him; of course we need rockets. We need them now and we will need them all the more in the future because certain types of weapons will become completely obsolete within a few years&#x2019; time. We will have to replace them with rockets of various kinds. This is being done throughout the world and we will also need them here. It is precisely for that reason that this House approved of a fairly large sum of money last year for military research, and that is why this House is approving of an even larger amount this year. South Africa will not be able to afford to continue to buy this expensive military equipment without buying the best. We will simply have to do research so that we can also manufacture these items in our own country. We are aware of the necessity for this. I want to say no more in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) said that he was worried about the threats from the African States. I am also worried about them but when I issued a warning in regard to that threat in 1961 and asked for increased expenditure for defence, I was ridiculed throughout the whole of South Africa not only by hon. members of the Opposition but by practically the whole of the English-medium Press except for the military columnist of the <i>Argus</i> who strongly supported me. I am not going to make any accusations; I was also a member of an Opposition party and I know that these methods are resorted to. I just want to say that we must not become unnecessarily anxious or worried about these Africa threats. In the first place, if these people want to attack us soon, they will have to build up tremendously long lines to reach us, and the hon. member for North-East Rand knows what that will mean. In the second place, it is still going to take a long time before they can attack or before they would dare to make such an attack; then I just want to say that by that time South Africa will be considerably stronger than she is now. I am not going to express an opinion on the political implications of a direct threat to a fellow-member of UNO.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked us to enter into a military agreement in regard to communist aggression, but to my mind communist military aggression at this stage is not as real a danger as communist political aggression. In our country the greatest danger at this moment is communist political infiltration. Communist military aggression must of necessity come from overseas and we have the Simonstown Agreement. But I do not want us to rely exclusively on military agreements. We know of military agreements which have not been honoured, not in the distant past but in the recent past. What is of more importance to my mind is the fact that we as Western states are of mutual value to each other. It does not matter so much what we have. If a man&#x2019;s assistance is valuable to me I stand by him in time of trouble although I have no treaty with him. What is of primary importance to my mind is the fact that as Western states we are of mutual value to each other. Thus America, as the largest Western state, is of very great value to us, to the Republic, because we will have to stand or fall with the West. Similarly France and other Western states are also of tremendous value to us; the United Kingdom is of very great value to us not only because of the inherent military power of the United Kingdom but also as a result of the fact that the United Kingdom has many important strategic bases at its disposal, more than any other Western country. It is true that at the moment the United Kingdom is relinquishing those strategic bases, but that is the very reason why we are becoming more and more valuable to the West. It was said a little while ago in the British Parliament that the southern tip of Africa is of tremendous strategic value nowadays. The same thing was said in America. Our task, since we have to survive with the West, is to build up this southern tip of Africa which is of so much strategic value to the West in such a way that in the military sphere we will be of real value to the West.</p>

<p>The hon. member for North-East Rand also asked me to supply more information. I have already replied to this question in replying to the hon. member for Simonstown. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) says that there can only be two directions to be followed in defence planning&#x2014;internal defence and preparation for a collective effort. I want to give a definition of the expression &#x201C;internal defence&#x201D; before I argue with him because it appears to me that there is some confusion in this connection. Did the hon. member use the words &#x201C;internal defence&#x201D; in <span class="col_8627-8628" refersTo="page_0562"/>the sense of defence against any aggressor who attacks us within our own borders? My contention is that our armed forces have three main tasks. I am not going to mention them in order of importance because the force of circumstances may change their importance from time to time. The first task that I want to mention is to assist the police to maintain internal order. That is a task which rests upon the shoulders of every armed force in every country in the world. We had another striking example of this in America recently when the armed forces had to be used to integrate a few Negro students at a White university. We have also facilitated the task of the armed forces by passing legislation this Session to enable the armed forces to provide that assistance. The second task of the armed forces is to defend the country when we are attacked. Mr. Chairman, we are preparing ourselves as much as possible in that regard. I have already discussed manpower training. We have purchased many weapons for that purpose and we are manufacturing many locally. Our stockpiling of ammunition has been virtually completed. We have done great work in this regard. I just want to say, Mr. Chairman, that during the past year the men of our armed forces have worked millions of hours&#x2019; overtime to do this great job of work. Do you know what remuneration they received for this work? Nothing but the satisfaction that they performed a necessary task well and the thanks, I presume, of the nation. But they cannot live on thanks alone and we will have to see what we can do.</p>

<p>Furthermore, one of the most important tasks for internal defence purposes is the organization of our combat headquarters. Every organized section of the armed forces has to be planned in advance for a predetermined main task. The planning of our combat headquarters&#x2019; organization has virtually been finished. The promotions which have been made during the past week have virtually put the finishing touches to it. In connection with our preparedness to carry out a common task, various matters have to be considered. The first essential task is the building up of mutual confidence. Without the building up of mutual confidence a joint task can never be tackled. I maintain this morning that South Africa is doing everything possible to build up that confidence. I just want to show what this Government has done. We participated in the Korean War and we entered into a treaty in regard to the Middle East defence line. When that agreement was dissolved South Africa was already prepared for the part which she had to play. We negotiated with the United Kingdom after our withdrawal from the Commonwealth, and the Simonstown Agreement was again accepted on a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis. The United Kingdom was very helpful in regard to the new Agreement, an Agreement from which we have derived definite military advantages and an Agreement which gives the United Kingdom the use of Simonstown, which is to their advantage, as well as other advantages. The United Kingdom did ask us never to ask them to sell small-arms and ammunition to us. They were very clear on that point. My reply to them, of course, was: &#x201C;No, we do not buy that type of stuff; we sell it ourselves,&#x201D; which is true. We have also given very definite benefits to the United Kingdom. After those discussions we gave the United Kingdom very definite benefits because we thought that as a Western state they needed them. We are therefore doing everything in our power to build up that mutual confidence. We have also given America definite benefits in this country, benefits which are of great value to them and which because they are of great value to them are of great value to us as a Western country which must either stand or fall with them. In order to fulfil this joint task we need certain weapons. We needed certain ships for our sea defences and we were given an undertaking under the Simonstown Agreement that we would be supplied with those ships. But while those ships were still being built, the technique of submarine hunting changed to such an extent that the whole construction of the ships had to be changed. Then we suddenly needed helicopters. We already have French helicopters in South Africa. But when we needed helicopters for our ships&#x2014;items which were not specifically mentioned in the Simonstown Agreement&#x2014;South Africa kept to the letter and the spirit of that Agreement. We did not canvas other countries to see whether we could save 7s. 6d. per helicopter by buying in those countries. We bought those helicopters from Britain because we share this sea defence with them and we felt that it would be better if we both used the same military equipment. There was no objection to that either. But we also discovered that if we wanted to strengthen our sea defences, we had to obtain maritime strike aircraft. We again decided to buy the British aircraft because we felt that if we were jointly responsible for sea defences we would have to act jointly and that it would suit the West and ourselves to use the same maritime strike aircraft as those used by the United Kingdom. Once again there was no objection at all to selling those aircraft to us. The contract has been signed; they are assembling those aircraft and the work has already progressed quite far. Mr. Wilson has now said, of course, that if his party comes into power he will not deliver those aircraft. That is a matter for the future that I do not want to discuss now. But I just want to say that even though Mr. Wilson has said that if his party comes into power in the future he will not carry out the provisions of an honourable contract, South Africa will in the meantime continue to abide by the terms of that honourable agreement. We will continue to build up confidence between ourselves and the other Western states.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I sometimes find myself in great difficulty. Last week I had to take a decision in connection with the purchase of items that we needed for our defence forces. The contract was a large one. I did not know what to do. But then I decided that Mr. Wilson <span class="col_8629-8630" refersTo="page_0563"/>was not in power in Great Britain. The Conservative Party is in power, a party which up to the present has co-operated with us in a very fair way. Once again, therefore, I gave this contract for the supply of vehicles to Britain. South Africa will abide by the terms of that honourable agreement.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I think we owe the hon. the Minister a word of gratitude for the manner in which he has dealt with the questions put to him and the replies which he has given to those members who raised questions on both sides of the House. I want to say at the outset that in regard to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s general picture of the three tasks which the Defence Force must face we are all agreed on that, namely, internal order, defence against aggression and participation in international conflict with allies. I would have preferred the Minister to have gone further in regard to the second of those tasks and that is one to which I should like to return, namely, the question of guerrilla warfare as it is likely to affect South Africa. Whilst dealing with that point may I also refer to the appointments which the Minister mentioned and which were made last week. I want to say what a pleasure it is to know that those positions have been filled by soldiers with practical experience. For too long we have seen appointments of people without experience made to high positions by the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor. I think it gives great confidence to any ex-soldier to know that the people who are going to be at the head of combat troops are going to be people with decorations won in the service of their country. I am not interested in their politics; I do not know what their politics are. But they are soldiers who have served their country. If th Minister continues along that road he will build up confidence in the forces, confidence both from the new recruits who will look to their leaders as men who have served their country and know the meaning of service, and confidence from those who are no longer in the forces but who look with pride to our Army and our Air Force and our Navy. I say that we are very pleased to see that position pertaining.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said at the end of his speech that he had again placed a contract with Great Britain for supplies. I think everyone will welcome that decision as well. I do not think we should allow ourselves to be frightened by what one might call political mouthings at mass rallies. W are dealing with a country with a responsible Government and I am very pleased to see that the Minister has not been deterred from the responsible course of action by the wild claims made by the Leader of the Opposition in England. One can only hope that when the time comes that confidence will be justified. That was the correct step to take in view of our agreements with Great Britain.</p>

<p>I want to come back to what the hon. the Minister said at the beginning of his reply. The hon. the Minister referred to the question which the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) asked and said that he had no special plans to deal with the new situation which would arise in South Africa because of the development of independent states. Then he went on to deal with the question of an attack on South Africa and the length of the lines of communication which such an attack by African states would necessitate. He said the very length of those lines of communication would create difficulties which would give us time to readjust ourselves. But that was the very point which the hon. member for Simonstown was making that whilst, at the moment, those who were threatening South Africa from the north would have long lines of communication our borders were shrinking. Our borders are shrinking with event after event taking place on this continent. Those lines of communication are slowly contracting. The danger points to South Africa are coming closer to our physical border because as long as we have states between ourselves and those who threaten us, and they are friendly states, that extends our borders to the borders of those friendly states. But as friendly states achieve independence and become hostile states so the borders draw nearer and nearer to South Africa. I am sorry that the Minister made no reference whatsoever to the threats, for instance, against Angola and Mozambique which, I think, he will recognize are vital to the overall defence picture of our country. Now, in addition to those narrowing borders we are now finding within our own country potential&#x2014;and I say purely potential bases&#x2014;bases which will reduce those lines of communication to virtually nothing at all. In regard to the threat against Mozambique and Angola I believe South Africa should have a policy both from the defence point of view and the political point of view. I think the Minister owes the House a statement in regard to his attitude to those threats and the <span class="col_8631-8632" refersTo="page_0564"/>position in which we stand in regard to Portugal if attacks should break out against those states. I appreciate very fully the Minister&#x2019;s hopes in regard to friendly relationships but we cannot afford to take a &#x201C;Chamberlain&#x201D; approach. We cannot afford to say we hope that things will be right. It will be too late to say, when the time comes, we should not have hoped; we should have been prepared. We cannot afford to pay the price of unpreparedness. As the Minister knows we have had warnings. Here I have a pamphlet of the A.N.C. in which they talk openly of revolution and of destroying the Army, the instruments of White power, as they call it. They say these instruments are the Army, the Railways, the Mines and the Docks, etc. Here are clear-cut specific threats not just idly made but made by an existing organization which the Minister of Justice takes very seriously indeed and which we in the Opposition take seriously and I am sure the Minister of Defence takes seriously.</p>

<p>He said he believed we could adjust ourselves if and when the time came, but that he had no special plans. But a situation has already been created this year where we have linked Basutoland with the sea through a Bantu state with its own Parliament. That sea-link between Basutoland and the coast is now a fact; it is not something for the future. This Parliament in its wisdom or, as some may think, in its unwisdom, has taken that step. It has handed over, for instance, the control of law and order to the Parliament of the Transkei. Intelligence is one of the vital factors in any Army; intelligence comes to the Army to-day from its own sources and also from the police. We are not talking about something for the future now, Mr. Chairman. As soon as the Transkeian Parliament functions their Minister of Justice takes over the control of law and order in that territory &#x2026;</p>

Once you lose a source of intelligence like that it must be replaced; there must be plans. You cannot just idly say: We hope we are going to be friendly. Then we have people like the A.N.C. putting out warnings to which we cannot close our eyes. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to reply to the hon. member who has just spoken, except to say that it is a pity that we should base our arguments in this debate on fears which at this stage are obviously prematurely aired and based on the wrong premises. The hon. member ought to know that the Schedule to the Act specifically provides that the police in the Transkei will remain under the control of the Minister of Justice of the Republic except to the extent that he hands over his control. The hon. the Minister has told us that nothing of that kind is envisaged.</p>

<p>But I think at this stage our defence planning must be based on the assumption that in our lifetime we are going to become involved in a military struggle which will require every grain or our national energy. I think that approach is justified without our trying to determine the danger and speculating from which direction it will come. In pursuance of this I want to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister. In the first place I would like to be reassured in connection with the following: What progress is being made with the classification of our manpower who will do their compulsory military service in industry, commerce or administration in relation to the men who will do their compulsory military service under arms? The men who will do their compulsory military service in industry, commerce and administration are the men whom we cannot afford to place under arms. This affects the ballotees to some small extent; it is difficult to classify these young men at this stage; but it does affect our Active Citizen Force Reserve to a large extent&#x2014;the men between the ages of 20 and 35 who have been trained but who in the meantime have been absorbed by various key industries. Is there some national system by means of which we can determine which men we can use militarily and which men will have to fulfil other functions?</p>

<p>I would also like to know from the hon. the Minister when we will be able to call up every single able-bodied man. I know that he is loath to give any date but we have little time left. He has indicated that by next year we will be calling up 60 per cent of our able-bodied men. I want to ask: What about our younger untrained men? There is a very large reserve of untrained men below the age of 35. A large number of them are excluded because they <span class="col_8633-8634" refersTo="page_0565"/>occupy key positions, but there are large numbers of them who do not occupy key positions and who are as yet untrained. Up to the present I admit that we have not made sufficient progress in our planning to be able to absorb fully the available supply. But is that our aim, and when do we hope to realize it?</p>

<p>In conclusion, are we also planning to utilize the older men who are available for military service, and when do we propose to do so? I want to put a few questions to the hon. the Minister in connection with material. The first is this: Have we already made or are we making an administrative survey of equipment which is available in the civilian sector and which can be of assistance to us in the military sphere? I am thinking of our large reserve of motor vehicles, tractors, construction machinery, means of communication and the large variety of apparatus and equipment that we have in the civilian sector. We do not always think about it, Mr. Chairman, but we have more vehicles in South Africa than we would ever need to transport all the men we have, and I want to know whether we have some system whereby we will be able to lay our hands on those vehicles at a moment&#x2019;s notice when the time comes? That is the first question that I want to ask in regard to material.</p>

<p>In the second place, as far as material is concerned, have we already planned a scheme for the utilization of our industrial potential in time of military need? I do not know whether this is the task of the Department of Defence or of the Department of Economic Affairs, but I know that we have a tremendous industrial potential in the engineering industry, the electronic industry and in numbers of industries which can work wonders as far as production is concerned in time of need. Whose work is it in South Africa to ascertain what our potential is and how that potential can be utilized for military purposes when the need arises? Is the Department working on it and has a system been worked out?</p>

<p>The last aspect that I want to raise in connection with material is the question of research into the manufacture of modern weapons about which the hon. the Minister has already told us, but I also want to raise the question of research into the large-scale storage of materials and here I am thinking particularly of fuel. Are we working to a programme; are we making experiments? What do we know and how far have we progressed? I do not want the hon. the Minister to tell us what has already been done but I would like to know whether this has been agreed to in principle and whether any progress has been made.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying a few words about the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reference to a White Paper. I think this is a good idea but I want immediately to oppose the idea that a White Paper should be made available to the whole House. I believe that such a White Paper can only be of importance if it contains information of such a nature that it can only be made available to members whom the hon. the Minister has selected from his side of the House for this purpose and to hon. members selected by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition from his side of the House. As an ordinary member of this House, I should be sorry if we were all supplied with such a White Paper.</p>

<p>In asking these questions I have not done so in a spirit of criticism or because of lack of confidence but I believe that we must be prepared to fight to the best of our ability during our lifetime and we want the assurance that the Department is engaged upon a variety of matters, which are actually administrative matters, which will be necessary to enable us to make the best use of the resources at our disposal.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to touch upon the topic raised by the hon. member for Kempton Park, and I shall do so. But before I come to that, I want to point out to hon. members opposite that this side of the House has steadily supported the expenditure on defence&#x2014;when it was R44,000,000 in 1961, and equally last year and this year when it has risen to R160,000,000 per year. That has been our attitude, and that very much is the approach which is made from this side of the House. And we are very glad to see that the hon. Minister, both in dealing with us and in dealing with other aspects of defence, makes it easier for one to maintain that attitude.</p>

<p>But I do not think that because that is the approach one makes, we can simply fall into the attitude of the hon. member for Kimberley (District) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) who said that we should simply say whether we should spend more on defence or less on defence, or whether we should have more men in the Army or more men in the Air Force. I think it is most essential, particularly in view of the speech of the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) that we should examine very carefully not only those sort of technical aspects of defence, but the whole basis on which this country is proceeding into the time which the hon. member for Kempton Park visualizes&#x2014;because he has said here that he believes that in our lifetime every single ounce of our energy will be required to defend ourselves. If that is a proper assumption to make, and I think there is a lot of evidence to suggest that it may be, then I think we must go much further than simply &#x201C;more or less&#x201D;; we must go into the whole question of the foundations upon which we are building our defence. In this regard I suggest most earnestly to hon. members opposite that we must examine the whole foundation or our defence, which, to my mind, is closely linked with our non-European policy. I say very definitely that defence and the defendability of South Africa is now a prime consideration in our non-European Affairs. And I say with full conviction that the approach of the Government with their non-European policy is a shifting sand upon which to base our defence. How can one approach the sort of task that the hon. member for Kempton Park has in mind when one is <span class="col_8635-8636" refersTo="page_0566"/>taking decisions and affecting one&#x2019;s strategic position to the extent that we are, and do that with equanimity?</p>

<p>What are some of those dangers which we are facing? The hon. Minister himself in a recent statement said, as reported in the <i>Argus</i> of 19 June&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We can defend ourselves against the Blacks all right. No, what is in question is a full-scale naval attack from the direction of the Indian Ocean. You never know.</block>

<p>That is the sort of thing that the hon. Minister of Defence has in mind and that is the sort of thing that the hon. member for Kempton Park probably has in mind. When that is the position according to the hon. Minister, and when that external danger is pointed out to us, and when we have from nobody less than the hon. Minister of Justice that so far as the internal danger is concerned we are faced with a possible Algerian type of revolution, what are we planning in this connection? In his last speech on his Vote here in the House, the hon. Minister of Justice quoted from a pamphlet of the A.N.C. in which they make their attitude clear that this is their method of achieving their aims in South Africa. We know from Mr. Duncan that this is also the aim of the P.A.C. In other words, the clear aim is to have external aggression assisted by internal trouble here, and thereby to bring us to their point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when that is so, one must consider, I suggest, postponing any aspect of breaking up your defensive position, as they are planning to do under the guidance of this Government. We should take note of those threats and we should rather strengthen our position. I would like to read to hon. gentlemen what a learned historian feels about the Realpolitik in a situation of this kind. I say without any hesitation, and I believe it could carry conviction with hon. members opposite, that on no account when we are facing threats of this kind, can one proceed with a policy of the kind that the Government is suggesting to us for Non-European Affairs. I suggest that it is the height of madness, and I will now proceed to try and underline those points.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, let me say at once that it has been held to be absolutely essential to have the very strongest base. Professor C. W. de Kiewiet, the noted historian and president of the University of Rochester, U.S.A., in July 1960, was in Durban and gave certain lectures. These were some of the things that he said, which I suggest bear most strongly upon our present position&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">World opinion limits South Africa&#x2019;s opportunities to take whatever strong steps may be necessary to strengthen her position and widen the margin of safety. Now I wish to be very bold, perhaps even rash. I want to dabble in some Realpolitik.</block>

<block name="quote">What are the conditions, however theoretical, that would correct the weakening strategic position of the Union?</block>

<p>Then lower on he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Realpolitik, according to Webster&#x2019;s Dictionary is &#x201C;cynically, reliance upon armed strength for gaining one&#x2019;s ends in national or international affairs&#x201D;. In a confrontation with Black Africa the policy of apartheid must rule out any important use of the domestic African or Indian population.</block>

<p>And then lower down, and this is the important point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Realpolitik, the elimination of enclaves and the rationalization of frontiers would be considered inevitable.</block>

<p>Then he goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The virtual annexation of South West Africa may have been bad international relations or dubious international law. But it was sound Realpolitik. So would be the annexation of Bechuanaland, Basutoland or Swaziland.</block>

<p>I am not, nor was he, advocating those steps; but the point I wish to make is that where a man with a sense of history, and a friend of South Africa, approaches our questions of defence and says that in terms of Realpolitik this is the approach to make, surely it is self-evident that the very last thing one would think of doing in a threatened situation, such as this, would be to cut out parts of our country. Moreover in the light of those threats from the East the very fact then, one would think of doing would be to bring it about that these people should no longer owe any loyalty to South Africa, and to be fostering their loyalty to these other new countries that are being created. So that in the very event of internal trouble, aided by external aggression</p>

<p>Where do you see signs of that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am merely building on the speech of the hon. member for Kempton Park and I am referring to the words of the hon. Minister&#x2019;s a few days ago. What I say is that if there ever was any merit in the non-European policy of the present Government, under the threats of the kind that we have been told of to-day again by the hon. Minister and by the hon. member for Kempton Park, this is the moment when they should be completely shifted into the background, because the hon. Minister said to-day that his warnings of danger had been scoffed at by this side and how true they were. I suggest with absolute frankness that there was very little scoffing, because in fact we supported the Vote of the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>But I come back to the point and I would like to get it from the hon. Minister whether he, doubtless with the advice of his army chiefs, has brought home to the Government <span class="col_8637-8638" refersTo="page_0567"/>the dangers of this policy at this time&#x2014;particularly this policy of separate development and the implications thereof. I would like to know whether our defence chiefs are content that we should so weaken our defences at a time like this, when rather in the view of this noted historian we should be thinking if anything rather to press out our boundaries in order to ensure our defence. So I ask the hon. Minister to give us the assurance that these matters were brought before the Government when this step was being resorted to in January this year, and whether in fact our service chiefs are happy that we should attempt to meet the challenge which the hon. member for Kempton Park speaks about on the basis of this weakened South African base, and, as I say, without even seeking to retain the loyalty of so many of our peoples here in this country.</p>

<p>This is not the only evidence that we are on an unwise course. I would like to remind the hon. Minister of what the previous Minister of Defence, Minister Erasmus said in regard to this question. I have here two reports from the Press, one dated 6 May 1954 (the <i>Cape Times</i>) in which he said that it was absolutely essential for our defence that we should incorporate the Protectorates. Now apparently that has been overruled, and not only do we not need to do that, but we are giving away areas bigger than the Protectorates, areas of vital importance. Indeed the hon. Minister spoke about this threat coming from the Indian Ocean, and there is precisely where we are about to open a wide gap in our defences. It is absolutely fantastic nonsense to this side of the House and we really want most earnest assurances, and we do approach this matter, completely as South Africans who are concerned for the fate of our country.

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has considered our defence policy from the point of view of the establishment of separate, self-governing Bantu states, and the danger which he sees is that through fragmentation of the Republic of South Africa&#x2014;I may as well put the word into his mouth&#x2014;we are going to create a base for what he fears may become guerrilla warfare in South Africa. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) expressed the same fear. My reply to that is that the hon. member does not want self-governing Bantu states to be established because he fears that our defence position will be weakened. Hon. members have apparently not heeded what we have been telling over the years and that is that it is far more dangerous to integrate politically because then we would be left with nothing. It is not only we who say that. History has taught us that lesson right up to the present moment, up to 1963, and hon. members know that that is so.</p>

<p>No, capitulation in easy stages, gradual capitulation, with one concession here and another there&#x2014;a gradual acceptance of your downfall. But I think that the hon. member for Durban (Point) must answer the question which I put to him: Does he think that guerrilla warfare is possible in South Africa? Has the hon. member not made a study of the prerequisites for guerrilla warfare? After all, the protagonists or planners of guerrilla warfare do not have a fertile reed bed in this country for exploitation. It is not like Korea or Laos where the people are primitive and starving and are only too willing to accept anything, knowing that it will be better than what they have at present. Guerrilla warfare in South Africa is out of the question because one must first consolidate one position before one can take the next step, and that cannot be done in South Africa. Our topography does not lend itself to it. The relationship between White and non-White in South Africa does not lend itself to this type of warfare. Our standard of living in South Africa does not lend itself to this type of operation. The hon. member who links up the establishment of the Bantustans&#x2014;to use their term&#x2014;with a base for a possible future guerrilla operation is completely wrong in his approach to this matter. We on this side cannot allow our strategy to be dictated to us by people who have such false notions. No, Mr. Chairman, I want to say that we are threatened from only four quarters. The first is the threat from the African states which we have discussed over and over again. The second is the possible threat that may arise if a Pan-Africanist attack on our neighbouring states such as Mo&#x00E7;ambique and Angola should succeed. This would create a real problem for us. The third is the possibility of an attack upon us if these Black African states, driven to it by their own helplessness and their own weakness, tried some manoeuvre against us through the medium of UNO and the fourth threat may come if we have a world war. We must consider our position in South Africa in the light of these four threats, because that will determine the enemy that we have to face and what our strategy will have to be in this regard. We must therefore evaluate our own position in the light of these four possibilities and in doing so, we can say&#x2014;unfortunately my time is very short&#x2014;that the first fact which we cannot get away from is that our borders are shrinking. The hon. member for Durban (Point) mentioned this fact and I agree with him. The second is that for political reasons and international considerations we cannot be sure that we will get assistance from any state in the event of three of these threats materializing. I exclude a global war because in that <span class="col_8639-8640" refersTo="page_0568"/>event everyone would need our assistance. The third point in connection with our appreciation of the position is that our own geographical borders and distances in South Africa are particularly long. Fourthly, we have only a limited manpower. We shall therefore have to develop our own approach to the defence of the country in the light of our evaluation of our own position. I want to say&#x2014;and we must accept this fact&#x2014;that we are entering an era in which we will have to resign ourselves to ever-increasing defence expenditure. We must accept that fact. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. S. M. Steyn) was quite correct in saying that during our lifetime we will have to prepare ourselves for any of these four eventualities that I have just mentioned. We will have to take into account the new conditions. I want to say that I believe that never before in our history have the people of South Africa been so prepared to pay for the defence of their country as they are at this time. We must therefore prepare ourselves for any manoeuvre, operation or eventuality connected with any of these four threats that I have mentioned. We will therefore have to adapt our weapons according to our appreciation of our own military position in the light of these threats. I want to say&#x2014;without wishing to thank the hon. the Minister in the usual way&#x2014;that if I see the position correctly I think that the hon. the Minister and his military Chiefs of Staff have drawn a true picture of our position in South Africa, our military position, and that both as regards weapons and as regards organization, particularly our latest re-organization, they are making South Africa as prepared as possible to meet any of these four threats which may materialize from the Black states from our neighbouring states through the medium of UNO, or because of a world war. In the short time at my disposal I want to say to the hon. the Minister: Carry on, a wonderful pattern is unfolding and the more one investigates these matters, the more one realizes that this pattern that is unfolding testifies to a through appreciation of our military position and the needs that spring from that appreciation. The position is still far from satisfactory. We are still in our infancy but excluding a world war we will in the course of time be able to overcome any threat from the sea and we will also be able to overcome our defence difficulties which arise from the geographical nature of our country. But we need new weapons for this, weapons that will save manpower, weapons that will have striking power and weapons that will be able to overcome any irresponsible manoeuvre. We will also have to have an organization which will guarantee the mobility that we need and a programme which will have to make provision for the local manufacture of weapons which we are unable to purchase because we will not be able to go on buying weapons indefinitely.

<p>Sir, that is what I gathered from the Minister&#x2019;s speech. But I want to say that when you are dealing with defence plans, all factors affecting defence have to be considered, and the major factor in our case of course is a Fifth Column should trouble arise. Fifth Columns can be in any campaign of any sort the factor on which the fate of the campaign rests. I was going to tie that up with the new states, not as a matter of policy, but purely militarily. but I will now have to deal more in detail with this question of a Fifth Column which is of the greatest importance and which creates a military nightmare for the men in command. You see, Sir, the urbanized Native is being told that he does not belong to this country, he belongs to a homeland. He has no roots in the country in which he is living, no loyalty to that country. You will remember <span class="col_8641-8642" refersTo="page_0569"/>the words of the poet, Mr. Chairman, &#x201C;Breathes there the man, with soul so dead, who never to himself hath said, this is my own, my native land&#x201D;! You see, these men who are likely to be the Fifth Column are not men with dead souls. They behave as other men, seeking security for themselves and their wives and families. If they were a happy, contented people, there could be no question of them being twisted to the ends to which we all hope they will not be twisted. But the policies of this Government in regard to the Bantu have quite definitely told them that they belong to independent states.</p>

If I mention Government policy, Mr. Chairman, I ask you not to take it as criticism, I am merely stating the facts as to why this Fifth Column can be dangerous.</p>

<p>Sir, I am trying hard not to say it. I have tried to establish my case that militarily there is a Fifth Column, wherever it comes from, and whatever the reason for it is. and having made my point I will carry on with something else.</p>

<p>Where there is a military situation it must be appreciated and various factors must be considered, the courses open to the enemy, and the courses open to yourself, everything has to be considered and weighed. The question of a Fifth Column is one of the main factors to be considered. A Fifth Column will consist of the millions of urbanized Natives who are not happy, and the question is what these people will do eventually except to appeal to their friends of the same colour, just as the Algerians appealed to the Tunisians, and possibly with the same tragic results. In Algeria 800,000 out of 1,000,000 Frenchmen had to run. Where are we going to run? I do not see that 3,500,000 people can be run into the sea, so you have to consider the question of a possible Fifth Column. I must say that various things that have arisen have made the defence of this country impossible. These new states can eventually be nothing but hostile.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) is a man who wants to save White civilization by holding a bomb in each hand, but it is high time he showed a little wisdom also. He knows that our whole race policy is aimed at eventual racial peace. It is precisely because this Government takes into account the primary need of the Black man in Africa that we have this policy of Bantu homelands. That is why I think that as a Christian guardian it is entirely wrong for him to suggest that the Black man in the Transkei, who will eventually be emancipated, is our potential enemy. Is it not the policy of the Christian White guardian to emancipate those people in such a way that we will eventually enjoy their friendship? I think the speech of the hon. member could almost be called a crime. Their attitude is one of wishful thinking and it is high time the Opposition grew up. We must not play games in these dying hours of the Session. The hon. member is playing with political dynamite by telling the world that the Transkei which will eventually be emancipated is our potential enemy. The Transkei is going to become our neighbouring state and if we do not have friendly relations with that state, what chance do we have of surviving? It is precisely because we intend to act wisely that trouble will not arise within the country. I say that eventually the Black states that we emancipate will become our greatest allies. If we do not have the right perspective, our days will be numbered. But we need not look for trouble half-way. That hon. member is frightening himself so much that the United Party will never come into power.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the Defence Vote is one of the most important Votes we have to deal with. Unfortunately it comes at the end of a long Session. To-day we listened to the hon. the Minister giving us answers to the various questions. We have also listened to hon. members here and to the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and have noticed right throughout the Session the lack of information from the Government as to how far they have got with the negotiation of military alliances. We know we have the Simonstown Agreement and we hope that we have the goodwill of the West. It was said by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) that in the case of hostilities we would assist the West. The Minister of Defence said that he hoped there would be a break-through of friendship with the African states. I think he is quite correct, he realizes as a sensible person that in order for us to exist in this southernmost tip of Africa there has to be greater liaison and understanding between ourselves and those African states, and that notwithstanding what they say about us we must hold out the hand of friendship to those states. We know what happened after the last war. So that the continent of Europe including former hostile states would not become communist, the U.S.A. implemented the Marshall Aid Plan and to-day Europe is prosperous, and I think that should also be our attitude. I do not think it would be right if we were not prepared for eventualities. Nobody knows where a global war will break out, not even the Chiefs of Staff of the major states, but we have to be prepared for any eventuality. Our major task is to cope with the internal risk, due to policies over which we have no control. I do not want to deal with Bantustans and the Government&#x2019;s policy, but there is that risk. The position is that in organizing our defence it will not be for a year or two. I think it will be for a long time. I think our whole defence plan has to be such that with our small population it will have to be organized so that it does not disorganize the economy of the country. Every year some 16,000 youths will be called up for training. I should like to ask the Minister what he is doing to give these youngsters a measure of vocational guidance? Has he vocational guidance officers in the Defence Department? We had them at the end of the last war. Has he educational officers posted to the various units so that these boys will not fall by the way, the flower of our youth? Has the Minister any plan so that these boys, once they have finished their basic training, are not wasted in the Army but are posted to such areas so that they can carry on their educational training? There are thousands of boys going into the Army who would normally have gone to the university, or into commerce or into a trade. I wonder whether the Minister cannot assist by having these youths, when once their basic training is over, posted to areas where they can continue their education.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it was during the last war. Towards the end of the war we had vocational guidance officers and we prepared our men to come back into economic life. The Minister must realize that this will not last a year or two, but that it will go on for a very long time. With the conditions in the world to-day, every country mobilizes its army for the prevention of war. We are not an aggressor nation, but we have to be ready for eventualities. With our small White population we cannot afford to have the economy of the country upset. So the plans of the Defence Department must be tied up closely with labour and education, and we must have the youth of the country ready to take their place in our economy once they are released. As I said, the Minister&#x2019;s statement about a possible break-through and extending the hand of friendship is a good thing. The longer we can keep talking, the longer the shooting war will be postponed. Those of us who have experienced war, realize the tremendous waste of life, and therefore the longer we can keep talking the better, and that should be our plan. We should never lose contact with anybody. We could even talk for the next ten years, but we must be prepared to fight, but we should not get into a position where we have to shoot because that gets you nowhere.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the Minister&#x2019;s Budget. The Minister is buying a lot of equipment and spending a lot of money. It is always easy to spend someone else&#x2019;s money, but I want to ask the Minister what his plans are in these purchases? I do not mean to say anything derogatory to the Defence Department, but I have always found that a soldier is a very bad buyer. In the last war we had a set-up whereby the Minister of Defence was advised by civilians as to the best purchases. It also happens in the U.S.A. where Mr. Macnamara often has to put his Army Chiefs in their place and decide on what has to be purchased. There are considerable purchases of clothing and motor vehicles. We know in the last war we had many armoured vehicles which were made here and which became white elephants because they were quite useless. I would like the Minister to tell us what he has in mind in regard to getting civilian advice as to the best way of purchasing equipment. Commercial men have that experience, and the army does not have it. The army man might see an aircraft or a vehicle which he thinks is very desirable and he wants to test it, but in nine cases out of ten you find <span class="col_8645-8646" refersTo="page_0571"/>that they have purchased useless vehicles. I think we have to face up to the fact that war is wasteful. Everything we buy for the army is non-productive and can be written off because it has no commercial value. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I do not want to reply to what the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) has had to say. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he believes, as I do, in the necessity of having good road and rail connections in time of war for the conveyance of foodstuffs, medical supplies, military equipment and soldiers. The reason why I ask this question is because I am aware of the fact that hon. members in this Committee on both sides of the House have said and people outside have told me that in a future war roads and rail communications will not play such an important role but that aircraft will be used as the main means of transport. I want to ask the hon. the Minister what the attitude of his Department is in this regard.</p>

<p>If we lose control over the Mo&#x00E7;ambique Channel, that is to say, that section of the ocean between Madagascar and the southeast coast of Africa, we will have to rely on a few small harbours on the south-west coast of Africa. That is all that will be left to us and the only real harbour that we will have on the south-west coast will be Walvis Bay. If we lose control over the Mo&#x00E7;ambique Channel we will not only lose our harbours but we will also lose the warm water route of our Western allies to the southern democracies of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand. I do not know whether hon. members realize what the position will be if we and our allies lose the Mo&#x00E7;ambique Channel and what the position will be as far as imports are concerned. That might quite easily happen. Walvis Bay will then become the most important import harbour of the Republic. I say&#x2014;and I want to know whether the hon. the Minister agrees&#x2014;that it is in the interests of our safety that we should have good rail and road communications between Walvis Bay and the other four provinces of the Republic.</p>

<p>As far as roads are concerned we have a very good road to-day that can be used for military purposes; a road which runs from Cape Town via Vioolsdrift right up into the northern parts of South West Africa. We have another road which can be used from the northern part of the country, a road with a bridge at Onseepkans. We also have another main road via Ariamsvlei. But what is still lacking is a short-cut. It has been said by three Prime Ministers in this country that anyone who interferes with South West Africa will be interfering with the Republic, and if we are in earnest then we need another road as well as another railway line. We need a road running straight from South West Africa past the Gemsbok Reserve to the eastern coast and we need a railway connection between Karasburg and Bitterfontein. I just want to say this. All our Prime Ministers since I have come to Parliament have made this statement in regard to South West Africa, and if they were in earnest I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he approves of the proposition that we must have the necessary road and rail connections before we become involved in a hot war.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Like the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), I should like to say that I appreciate the general pattern of the Minister&#x2019;s reply. It is not a question of the policy of Bantustans that affects us. It is the fact that independent Bantustans have been accepted as Government policy. When one talks of hostility coming from them we are not thinking of hostility from the people of the Bantustans, but that they will be defenceless and helpless except to the extent that they are defended by us, and they will therefore be subject to all the external pressures and the appeals, all the things that go with the building up of a sabotage centre inside their territory. We saw what happened in Swaziland last week. As the result of external influence, of people going into Swaziland, in some cases even from the Republic, and fomenting trouble there, it has been necessary for Britain to move troops in there. That is the fear we have, that before the Native states are in a position to look after themselves, we have to be their guardians and we want to know what plans are being made for that&#x2014;important safeguard to the Republic&#x2019;s security. Being the guardian of a state of that nature is very different from being the guardian of an integral part of the Republic. The Minister says he has no plans actually made for it, but he will take calculated risks. But when you take a calculated risk, you still have to evaluate that risk beforehand and in your overall Defence plan you must leave a loophole whereby you can switch over to meet that calculated risk if it arises. Are those plans being made? Has the risk been calculated, and is the appropriate pattern being built up in our defence to-day to provide for it should the calculation unfortunately prove to be a correct one and the risk arise? We have had so many examples of what happens with these new states, like in Algeria, where if people had been allowed to settle down on their own they would probably have been perfectly willing to go on under the pattern set for them by France, but they were not permitted to do that. External pressure was brought to bear, just as it will be brought to bear on the inexperienced people in these states, and therefore we have to be prepared for it.</p>

<p>When the Minister spoke about the long line of communication between probable aggressors and ourselves, those are things we are not at present considering. We do not believe that long lines of communication will be necessary at this stage and for a long time to come. The pattern of aggression has been so built up over the world during the last ten years that it is common to all the places where there has been aggression, in the East and in India even in Portuguese Goa. You find that trouble starts inside the territory because <span class="col_8647-8648" refersTo="page_0572"/>the seeds of trouble have been planted there and those subversive elements will disrupt our lines of communication and it makes it practically impossible for the army to operate. That is the type of aggression we have to deal with, a type of guerrilla warfare combined with the fomentation of internal unrest. Those are the points we are asking the Minister about. It is not merely a calculated risk. It is practically a certainty, judging from what has happened in other places. We want to know whether those plans to cope with this aspect have been made in advance.</p>

<p>I do not propose to deal with all the points raised by the hon. the Minister in his reply. At the commencement of my previous address I pointed out that the limited time available in this debate precluded us from dealing with these things as thoroughly as we would have liked to, but we will do so on a later occasion which will offer itself before the end of this Session. So I do not propose to continue on those lines now. The Simonstown Agreement has been mentioned. It is of great value and I am fully in accord with the line taken by the hon. the Minister, but there are matters arising from that agreement which I propose to deal with at a later stage.</p>

<p>I want to touch on two other matters arising from the Estimates themselves. One is in connection with the return of the trainees to private life. We are increasingly calling up tens of thousands of young men, many of whom have not started their professional careers yet and we cannot just throw these thousands of young men back on the labour market at the end of their training period without making adequate provision for their absorption. We can no longer look upon this as an ordinary peacetime procedure. It may be on a smaller scale but it is still a most important responsibility. In your wartime demobilization most of the people who have completed their service period either have jobs to go back to or at least have a profession to follow. In this type of training we are now carrying out, however, the youngsters have not got that background to help them. We can no longer leave it to chance as to how they get absorbed back into the labour market. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether plans are being prepared for the absorption of our thousands of young trainees back into private life, plans to assist them, after the break which defence training has necessitated in their lives, to help them to get back to their ordinary civilian work without too much hardship on the boys themselves. I would like the hon. the Minister to deal with that, and then the other matter which I want to deal with very briefly is this: In the Estimates before us and in the general planning that one sees in defence, one is struck with the fact that again we cannot assume that at the moment we are dealing with defence matters on the normal peacetime basis. Numbers have gone far beyond that stage; the general set-up is quite beyond it. Whether we are engaged in a cold war or any other type of war, we have these many thousands of young fellows on the threshold of life being brought together in the masses of young men scattered all over the country. That is necessary under the system under which we are working. It strikes one on going through these Estimates and also from one&#x2019;s experience and contact with the various training centres that not enough urgency is being shown in regard to the provision of recreational and social facilities for the young men when they are in these massed formations. You get several thousand young fellows massed together in one area, and of necessity the defence areas in which they are collected are very often isolated from places where ordinary, normal recreation can be provided. It is imperative that their spare time should be catered for. I assume that the hon. the Minister has accepted the position of foster father to these defence trainees who have been called up, and, like a father, whether he likes it or not, he has now accepted certain very onerous responsibilities. He knows as I know and as we all know as men, that the easiest road to temptation is always in front of the young man who has nothing to occupy his spare time. There is spare time and there must be spare time even with the arduous training that these young men have to undergo. I know that at the moment there are schemes for providing sports, recreational and other facilities, where the high spirits and the energies of these young people can be usefully absorbed in their spare time, but these schemes are not big enough and they are not moving fast enough. We cannot apply peacetime speed and peacetime organization or expenditure to the provision of these facilities. Just as in wartime it had to be made a number one priority, so now in the interests of our youth of the country, if we are going to use them for defence, then defence must be prepared and the country must be prepared to pay for giving these young men a fair deal by rapidly providing the necessary recreational and social facilities under the physical conditions which they have to face and live under whilst under training.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>When my time expired just now I was saying that we must arrange our defence matters in the light of our appreciation of our own position. I think that is a fair attitude to adopt and I also think it is also the most sensible attitude that we can adopt. Once we have evaluated our own position, as far as it is humanly possible to do so and as far as it is possible for our military experts to ascertain the position, we will have to manufacture or acquire our military equipment on the basis of that evaluation. In this appreciation of our own position there are a few things which will inevitably come to the fore. I want to say immediately that as far as a global war is concerned, it will be of such magnitude that in order to be able to meet the requirements that will flow from such a war, we will have to be in a position to provide as much striking power as possible to assist our friends who will be involved in the war. But, excluding a world war, the acquisition of arms for our <span class="col_8649-8650" refersTo="page_0573"/>own defence purposes will have to be priority number one. That is important because that is what this House votes the money for&#x2014;to obtain weapons. These weapons must fit in with our appreciation of our own position as we see it. In the light of this fact therefore we will have to prepare ourselves to obtain those weapons, or even to manufacture them in order to be able to meet to the best of our ability any threat from the sea though the medium of conventional weapons. We will have to manufacture or obtain weapons to defend our cities. We have large complexes in this country which have to be defended. I have in mind the Cape Town complex and its environs; I have in mind the Durban-Pietermaritzburg complex; I think of the Johannesburg-Pretoria-Vereeniging complex. These are vital parts of the Republic which are open to attack and they are areas which can be severely damaged from a long distance away. I think of our limited manpower and I say that the weapons that we obtain or manufacture ourselves will also have to supplement our limited manpower. Bearing in mind all these things I say that we will have to accept the fact that we will have to pay more for our defence in the future; that we will have to continue to be prepared to make available more money for defence. We will have to make preparations to establish a permanent weapon-manufacturing industry in South Africa which will be able to meet our ever-increasing and changing needs as far as the manufacture of new weapons is concerned. Such a weapon-manufacturing industry will not only benefit our own defence but it will also have a salutary influence in other spheres of our State structure. We must simply accept the fact that we will have to meet ever-increasing defence expenditure and we can only build up a permanent weapon-manufacturing industry in South Africa and maintain it if we concentrate on research because it is the scientists, the technologists, who stand and will stand in the forefront of our defence in the future. I read the other day that the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) had said that we would have to buy this brainpower. I said the same thing here last year or at the beginning of this year. I cannot sufficiently emphasize the fact that we must keep ourselves in the maximum state of preparedness in the defence sphere. In order to ensure that we are always prepared for any eventuality, we will need the assistance of the scientist, the technologist, the trained man who has a knowledge of these things. I cannot help feeling sometimes that people do not realize that this is a matter which must receive priority. We must find these people abroad or we must send our own people abroad to gain the necessary knowledge there and then return to our country, and we must be prepared to pay for that knowledge. We cannot obtain that specialized and scientific knowledge that is so vitally necessary for this tremendous task that we have to undertake unless we are prepared to pay for it and we cannot measure that payment in terms of the earnings of the man in the street.</p>

<p>I should like to conclude the remarks I was making in regard to what the Minister himself has described as the calculated risks, militarily speaking, of the new states which are being created in South Africa. One point which has arisen in the debate since then is that all the members on the Government side, including the Chief Whip who has dealt with this matter, have had only one answer and that answer is, &#x201C;we hope or we believe that these states will be friendly states and that therefore there is no military necessity for preparation&#x201D;. Naturally we all hope that everyone with whom we have to live in juxtaposition is going to be friendly. That is a natural hope but we cannot live on hope in this world; you have to live on realities, and the reality is that in Addis Ababa threats have been made against this country. Training schools have been set up to train our own citizens in sabotage, and threats have been made both of aggression from outside and of guerrilla warfare from within, which we have to face. Sir, I must say in passing that for many of us it is a bitter thought that this conference should have been held in Addis Ababa, the place which our South African troops freed from a conqueror, a country in which our South African blood was shed in order to give them freedom. The gratitude that we get is that that country now takes the lead against South Africa. I would like to say that I think every South African who went through those days, who went through Abyssinia, who did something towards the freeing of their country, feels bitterly disappointed to-day at their reaction.</p>

<p>Sir, the Minister and the Government has said that these Bantustans are going to be friendly. But the Minister has to give us a little more than hope. In these new states we face a new sort of terrain. If you look at a map of South Africa and see <span class="col_8651-8652" refersTo="page_0574"/>where these Bantustans are going to be, you see that their borders are going to include some of the most difficult terrain in our country. It is going to include areas which are going to need highly mobile forces able to deal with the most difficult sort of country. Above all we are going to face a completely new concept in regard to these Bantustans. You have to deal with threats from outside in the relationship of your country to another country, but Bantustans introduce for the first time the added element of your own civilian population. In other words, it will be adding the problem of our own South African civilians living in these territories whom we shall have to take into account and not merely the guarding of a border.</p>

<p>My hon. friend keeps throwing up the argument &#x201C;What about the protectorates&#x201D;? We are not dealing with old history, we are dealing with the additional problems. We made the point, Sir, that this Government was creating additional problems over and above those we had already. We have had a problem; we have always had a border between South Africa and other countries. In the last war we stretched that border; we went beyond that border to meet the fighting away from ourselves&#x2014;as far as we could. We have always had that border. The point now is that the Government has created new borders, additional borders, tens of thousands of miles of rough country which our defence mechanism has got to take into its thinking. A year or so ago the hon. the Minister, for instance, spoke about border posts; he said he was creating border posts in the northern Transvaal; not border posts along the Limpopo only but border posts along the border between so-called White South Africa and Bantu areas. We heard no more about that but about two years ago it was mooted that these outposts were going to be established. It indicates that that thinking was there. Now that the reality of the problem is starting to become clearer we hear no more about those border posts.</p>

<p>I think I shall leave the point there because we have stated our case on that clearly. I want to add one other point linking up with what the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) said, namely, the question of specialists in our Army. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he has considered, instead of taking youngsters who are going to university into training and postponing their university education for a year thereby, they should not be trained at university in specialist units. In other words, whether you should not create of your universities where you have your trained brains, your professors and lecturers, your post-graduate students and your new students, a nucleus for specialist units in engineering, chemistry, signalling and other technical and specialized branches of the service. So that <i>pari passu</i> with their normal education they will be engaged in military training. Rather this than taking those youngsters, putting them on the parade ground and giving them a little technical training which really does not get them very far except if they are lucky enough to get into one of the specialist units, why not consider creating real specialist units at those places where the brain power is available. It is something which I believe we must think about rather than waste our manpower.</p>

<p>One last unrelated point I wish to make is the question of these young trainees who live in single quarters on mines and so on. They have their rifles for which they are responsible but they have no facilities for protecting them. They have to lock them up in a wardrobe. They go underground or they go off to work for the whole day but there are no facilities for the proper protection of those arms. This is also a matter which I believe requires some consideration.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I have been asked to be brief. I want to start with the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) who spoke just after my previous speech. I cannot reply to all the points that he raised but I just want to say that the hon. member and other hon. members who spoke after him said in quite a friendly way: &#x201C;We cannot just idly say that we hope things will come right,&#x201D; in other words, that we cannot simply hope that these new Bantu states will be favourably disposed towards us. But, Mr. Chairman, I never said that. I must object to that statement. That is a completely wrong interpretation of what I said. I did not say it. What I said was that we had no prearranged plan to keep those Bantu states under control when they eventually become independent. What I said was that our general expansion in the defence sphere would enable us to meet that new danger if it arises. I said this most emphatically, so it is not a question of &#x201C;hoping&#x201D;. The hon. member also spoke about guerrilla warfare. Of course we are preparing ourselves for guerrilla warfare; we have annual manoeuvres in guerrilla warfare. The danger has been outlined here of enemies who may cross our borders, attack us, and then withdraw. That is probably the best known of all dangers. We are preparing ourselves for that in various ways. I want to mention just one example. It would be no easy task for a paratroop unit to launch an offensive in this country and then withdraw. That withdrawal would not be so easy. Our defence forces are becoming more and more mobile and it would not be easy for paratroop units, therefore, to strike and to withdraw again. I do not say that it will not happen; it may possibly still happen, but we are daily preparing ourselves to cope with such a situation.</p>

<p>The hon. member also said: &#x201C;We have heard no more about the border posts.&#x201D; I do not know that I ever said that we would set up border posts. What I did say was that we <span class="col_8653-8654" refersTo="page_0575"/>would station full-time units at strategic points throughout the country. We do not have to do it at some future date; it has already been done. We already have large and strong sections of our full-time units at various strategic points. I cannot give the figure at the moment but I think that the figure is about 7,000 or more. These are not things, therefore, which still have to be done; they have already been done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) put quite a number of questions to me. He asked how we were progressing with the allocation of our manpower in the various branches of our national activities. I just want to say that there is still a great deal of work to be done in studying the situation. But the appointment of a statutory manpower board is one of the things that will help us to make a better study of the situation. The hon. member also asked when we would be able to have a 100 per cent call-up. I cannot tell him that in advance. I replied to this point this morning. We are making rapid progress. In connection with material, the hon. member asked whether we were making a survey of what was available in our country. Of course we are making a survey in this regard, but I want to point this out to the hon. member: He said that we had more vehicles in this country than we could use in time of mobilization. He is not quite correct. There are certain vehicles of a technical nature that we cannot commandeer; we do not have them. I can also tell him that if we have to fight in a desert area where we need four-wheel drive vehicles, we do not have many in this country to commandeer. If we have to meet an attack from outside, we must accept that our enemies will not be equipped with two-wheel drive vehicles, and we would then have to oppose them, if we commandeer vehicles on a large scale, with two-wheel drive vehicles. It is not an easy matter to commandeer vehicles. The hon. member also asked me how far we had progressed with research in connection with the large-scale storage of fuel. I do not think we have made much progress in this regard. We are storing fuel to the extent that it is possible for us to do so, but no research has been necessary in this regard. If the hon. member wants to know whether special research is being done, let me tell him that it is not being done by the Army, although it may perhaps be done in other quarters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) spoke about a Fifth Column. Of course every Minister of Defence in any part of the world is aware of the possibility of Fifth Columnists. We are well aware of that danger. It all depends on the possible danger of the Fifth Columnists how we shall handle them. If it is just a bagatelle there will not be unnecessary punishment. But if it is a Fifth Column, where we are fighting for our very existence, we shall deal with them most severely because we cannot allow ourselves to be ruined by a Fifth Column when we are fighting for our very lives. But I am not prepared to accept that all those envisaged by the hon. member are Fifth Columnists.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) asked me whether we were giving the youngsters vocational guidance. As an ex-Administrator I am fully aware of the necessity for vocational guidance as far as education is concerned. But I do not know whether we are giving them vocational guidance today. We are certainly giving them vocational guidance as far as their future military careers are concerned but in connection with other matters, I do not know. In any case, I do not know whether we are capable of doing that; we are not expert in all directions.</p>

<p>They demobilized men who were in the Army for many years, men who entered the Army practically as grown-up men but that was a totally different position. We now receive these youngsters and we really give them a pre-university year which is not the same thing at all. I would not like my military people to meddle with the advice those youngsters already received while at school. The hon. member also asked me what was the best way of buying. No, Sir, I do not know. But surely the best way of buying is not to be advised by interested people. I think the best way of buying has been evolved through the years by successive Governments and that is the way in which we are doing things at the present moment.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Karas (Mr. von Moltke) must not blame me if I do not reply to his question. I can only tell him that roads are always necessary for defence.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown again referred to my expression of &#x201C;calculated risk&#x201D;. I think I have now answered that fully. He also asked a question about trainees returning to private life. No, Sir, we cannot possibly accept responsibility for them in respect of occupations for them after their training. It is only natural that we help them. Last year we helped quite a number to get into the universities, but we cannot accept responsibility for their way of life after training. Here again it is not the same thing as demobilization after the last war. The hon. member spoke about a very practical problem and that is the creation of more recreational facilities for these youngsters. I am worried about it, but this year we have doubled the amount for that purpose and I do hope that we will be able to provide those facilities much faster than we did in the past. We have a very big job in this build-up to provide camps, buildings, etc., but I can give the hon. member the assurance that we are well aware of the necessity of these recreational facilities.</p>

<p>This is a new Vote which arises from the gazetted appointment of a Minister of Tourism, and I think it is perhaps appropriate that certain questions be put to the hon. Minister in regard to the development of this Department of Tourism. Our obvious difficulty is that we cannot discuss the policy of the Minister because he has not had an opportunity yet of applying a policy, and secondly, the House and the country do not know the Minister&#x2019;s intentions in regard to the development of this Department. We hope that he will take the opportunity to-day of giving us some outline of what he considers should be the lines of development of this Department. There is one significant aspect. I noticed that in the gazetted appointment of the hon. Minister reference is made to the coordination of existing Departments, or methods of developing tourism in South Africa, and that seems to indicate that apart from what ideas the hon. Minister may have in considering the development of his own Department, he obviously will have jurisdiction over the South African Tourist Corporation which up to now has fallen under the Minister of Transport. The time for this debate is very limited and I want to put one point crisply to the hon. Minister. It is clear that the majority of tourists coming to South Africa have come from other African territories, in Africa itself. The bulk of our tourists have not come from countries overseas, from Europe, America and other countries in the world. With the developments in Africa, I would like to ask the Minister if he considers that there is likely to be a shortfall of that traffic, and particularly what steps will he take for the development of tourism as such as an industry in regard to attracting people from other overseas countries to visit South Africa?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member quite rightly says that he cannot expect a major statement of policy from me at this stage. But what I would like to say to hon. members is that the functions of the new Department, I think, will give a line to the directions in which this Department must operate. Firstly, there is the promotion of overseas tourists to South Africa, and also the promotion of inland tourism in South Africa. So the Department applies itself both to overseas tourism, the Rhodesian tourists, and tourists from the adjoining territories, and also to the tourist in South Africa, a holiday-vacationer, or whatever you want to call them. The Department also has to consider his interests. Then there is the need to make South Africa attractive to tourists. The idea is that the whole tourist industry should be propagated by this Department. The hon. member for Turffontein mentioned the fact that there might be a drop in the number of visitors from adjoining territories to South Africa. That may or may not be the case. Undoubtedly in the past the tourists from adjoining territories have to a large extent made up the number of tourists which have come to South Africa, a matter of over 200,000 people during the last year.</p>

<p>As far as the objectives of this Department are concerned, the Department will be here to try and increase the number of tourists from overseas, from Britain, from Germany, from Europe, from the United States. We will do what we can to increase these numbers. The Department will also do all it can to endeavour to see that the numbers from adjoining territories do not decrease, if that is possible.

We are trying to co-ordinate the work of the various publicity bodies. One of our stated functions is to co-ordinate the existing facilities that are offered by various bodies at the present moment, such as the South African Railways, the S.A.

In that respect the emphasis will be on improved facilities, additional facilities, and in general the development of tourism. We shall act as the co-ordinating body.

<answer by="#minister_of_finance" to="#van_den_heever">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<p>Last Tuesday the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) put certain questions to me in connection with the purchase of South African shares abroad. I have now received a report from the Reserve Bank on these transactions. This report confirms the statement which I made in the House on Tuesday.</p>

<p>As I said in that statement, the relative transactions took place under the so-called &#x201C;permit scheme&#x201D;. Under this scheme only the broker concerned is notified by his bank that a permit has been granted. The purchases are made by the relative broker himself if he has overseas connections; if not, then they are made through another broker who has such connections.</p>

<p>If transactions under the permit scheme are to have the desired effect of obtaining our shares at reasonable prices overseas and thus supplying the local market, then it is essential that publicity regarding these transactions must be avoided as far as possible. The Exchange Control circular which deals with the working of the permit scheme, and which is made available only to authorized exchange dealers and to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange Committee, consequently lays stress on the need for avoiding publicity both here and abroad in respect of the fact that shares are being bought under this scheme. For this reason no announcements have been made to the general public regarding the details of the scheme or changes therein.</p>

<p>It was initially not envisaged that permits would be issued to brokers for the purchase of shares abroad for their own account for sale on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, but at a later stage the interpretation of the existing arrangements was apparently broadened and an application from a broker for a permit for a transaction of this nature was approved by the Reserve Bank. The bank did not require the broker concerned to treat the matter as confidential, and it was not in fact the bank&#x2019;s intention that transactions of this nature should be confined to any particular broker or group of brokers. The broker who obtained the permit, however, apparently interpreted the reference in the aforementioned circular to the avoidance of publicity as implying complete secrecy even towards his fellow-brokers, and he consequently did not inform the Stock Exchange Committee. Further <span class="col_8659-8660" refersTo="page_0578"/>permits for transactions of this nature were thereafter issued, but the bank unfortunately lost sight of the fact that the great majority of the permits for such transactions were issued to one particular broker. This would probably not have occurred if the bank had informed the Stock Exchange Committee of the concession, which would have enabled other brokers to apply for similar permits.</p>

<p>The applicant for the permits was broker J. D. Anderson and the person on whose behalf the permits were requested was another broker, R. Lurie. To the best of my knowledge no profits were made which did not normally arise from similar share transactions, but in view of the fact that other brokers were not aware of the concession, the brokers concerned obviously obtained greater turnovers from which larger earnings were received. On account of the constant fluctuation in share prices, however, it is not possible to name even an approximate amount in this connection.</p>

<p>The Reserve Bank has informed me of its regret that it did not inform the Stock Exchange Committee of the aforementioned interpretation of the permit scheme after the first permit under the new interpretation had been issued. The issue of permits for transactions of this nature has for the present been discontinued.</p>

<p>Arising out of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply, will he tell us why, when the extension of the regulations had been agreed to, notification of the extension was not sent to the Committee of the Stock Exchange in order that the Committee could inform its members, and if it were confidential, that the Committee should be asked to maintain the confidence of the Reserve Bank, as has happened in the past. The Stock Exchange Committee have on previous occasions been taken into the confidence of the Reserve Bank or of the Minister.

<p>The hon. member will see that nobody was informed. There was an application for a permit; that application was granted under an extended interpretation and it did not go further than that.

I am afraid I cannot carry it further than that. It is unfortunate that this has happened. This was merely a widening of the interpretation of the regulations; it was not a question of new regulations being issued, but when the application was made there was a widening of the interpretation of the existing regulation and the applicant who happened to be the first, got away with it. He did not tell anybody else about it, and it is regrettable that the Reserve Bank, when they did broaden the interpretation, did not inform the Committee of the Stock Exchange. They have expressed their regret for having failed to do so.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This is the usual Bill to give effect to certain proposals contained in the main Budget and the Railway Budget and in which various other matters which affect the Consolidated Revenue Fund are dealt with. The various provisions are explained in the White Paper and it is therefore not my intention to deal with the Bill clause for clause. I want to confine myself to a few supplementary remarks with regard to certain clauses.</p>

<p>Clause 4 merely rectifies a technical error made by the Transvaal Provincial Administration. After the provincial auditor had drawn attention to the fact that the way in which the particular service was being provided was <i>ultra vires,</i> the province followed the correct procedure by paying subsidies to the institutions concerned to enable them to make their own arrangements for regular visits to the inmates of old-age homes by a general practitioner. As in the case of the original arrangements, the praiseworthy main objects are still being achieved, that is, to eliminate the inconvenience caused to the aged through visits to the Pretoria Hospital, and to provide the medical treatment that they need on the most convenient and most economical basis. I may perhaps add that each of the institutions concerned has a sick bay in which old people who would otherwise have to be admitted to hospital can be given the necessary nursing and medical treatment.</p>

<p>Clauses 9 and 10 simply deal with interprovincial bridges situated on national roads or connecting such roads. As far as other interprovincial bridges are concerned, the Department of Public Works will, as it has done hitherto, accept responsibility in this connection, having regard to the provisions of Section <span class="col_8661-8662" refersTo="page_0579"/>84 of the Constitution in terms of which provinces are not given the power to pass ordinances in connection with bridges connecting two provinces.</p>

<p>As far as Clause 15 is concerned, it may be mentioned that negotiations with the Cape Province regarding the financial adjustments arising from the transfer of Coloured education have already reached an advanced stage and all that now remains is to determine the precise figures within the framework of the agreement that has been reached. It is intended to enter into similar negotiations with the other provinces as soon as it is practicable to do so.</p>

<p>Clause 16 provides for an increase in the fixed borrowing powers of the State President.</p>

<p>In terms of Sections 2 and 3 of the General Loans Act, 1961, the State President may in any financial year borrow R30,000,000 more than the amount by which the approved loan expenditure exceeds the amount which stands to the credit of the Loan Account or which accrues to that Account.</p>

<p>Originally this latitude was intended to make reasonable allowance for unforeseen increased receipts on Loan Account, and to give the Treasury the opportunity to take advantage of favourable opportunities to enter into loans in anticipation of actual requirements. As a result of the considerable increase in the State Budget over the years, together with the greater uncertainty and the changed character of foreign markets for capital, it was found necessary in 1951 to increase the original amount of R6,000,000 to R30,000,000. Since that time there has been a further considerable increase in our national Budget. The total expenditure on Loan Account, for example, has risen from R130,000,000 to R300.000.000. In addition to that other important factors have also come into the picture in the meanwhile. In the first place with a view to bringing about savings in interest charges and from the point of view of the sound management of public debt, it is considered necessary that the State should have more freedom to enter into loans when rates of interest are favourable in order to meet expenditure which will arise in a future financial year. Secondly it is necessary from time to time in the interests of financial stability, to make available more Government stocks to the money and capital markets in order to cope with conditions of excess liquidity and unsound fluctuations in rates of interest.</p>

<p>All these considerations make it extremely desirable that the fixed borrowing powers of the State President should be further increased to the extent proposed here.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>As the Minister has indicated this is really the annual conglomerate of financial matters which require legislative sanction to regulate and facilitate Government administration. The hon. the Minister has enlarged on some of the matters and the White Paper which has been tabled gives a clear picture in regard to the need of this legislation. There will therefore be no opposition to the measure from this side of the House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister did not mention Clause 6 which gives powers to the Staalwerkers Ko&#x00F6;peratiewe Spaarbank Beperk to become incorporated as a company instead of as a Co-operative Society, but there is a precedent for that as explained in the White Paper in the case where Volkskas Kodperatiewe Beperk also desired to become incorporated as a company. But I think the hon. the Minister might have elaborated a little more on the provisions of Section 16 because those provisions do affect parliamentary control over the Government&#x2019;s actions in respect of the Loan Account. As the House knows, Government spending on Loan Account is strictly limited to the amount appropriated in the Appropriation Act for a year and for that reason the law specifically places limitations on borrowing powers&#x2014;I say very necessary limitations&#x2014;so that the borrowing shall be sufficient only (1) to meet actual expenditure sanctioned by Parliament and (2) to raise money necessary for the redemption of maturing loans during a year. As the Minister has indicated there has in addition been this third aspect in which a limited amount of excess borrowing power has been granted to the State. Prior to 1951 it was only R6,000,000. In 1951, as the Minister has indicated, it was increased to R30,000,000, and the suggestion now is that it should go up to R60,000,000. Sir, I appreciate the points which the hon. the Minister has made, but never to my knowledge&#x2014;and I should be surprised if it has ever happened&#x2014;has the borrowing power during one year been exhausted. In fact the evidence indicates that in most years&#x2014;in fact every year&#x2014;the borrowing powers are not exhausted but that there has been an unexercised borrowing power which has been left over. I would just quote two years by way of example: For the year ending March 1961 the unexercised portion of the borrowing powers amounted to over R110,000,000; for the next year ending in March 1962 the unexercised borrowing power for the year amounted almost R27,000,000. It seems therefore that the hon. the Minister should have been a little more explicit as to why it is necessary at this stage to increase this additional borrowing power. If during any year there has been a stage in which the Government has not been able to function because of limitations, that would have been a good argument, I think. In respect of last year when criticism was offered from this side of the House that a larger credit balance in the Loan Account was being carried forward than was needed by the Government, the hon. the Minister justified it by saying, not that it was necessary to meet appropriated expenditure but merely to draw off some of the excess liquidity which was being built up in the banks. That seems to be the main purpose of this provision because I understood the hon. the Minister to mention this new factor, namely to extend these provisions <span class="col_8663-8664" refersTo="page_0580"/>to bring about, as he said, financial stability. But I ask if this is the appropriate way to do that, because we are now embarking on a new principle in so far as borrowing powers are concerned and I hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will be a little more explicit as to why this should be regarded as the appropriate method for bringing about such stability. If the Minister was right last year, he already has an adequacy of borrowing powers. The figures for the last year are not available to me but I have given the figures for two years to indicate that there is a substantial unexercised borrowing power every year which the Minister could use. As I have said, there will be no opposition to the second reading of the Bill, but I hope the Minister will deal with this a little more specifically.</p>

<p>I have given the House the reasons as to why we want a greater latitude as far as borrowing powers are concerned. The first reason is that we want to be able to take advantage of it when the opportunity occurs, to reduce the interest charge against Public Debt. When the rates of interest are low and we are able to borrow, as we have done this year, then we want to be able to take advantage of that opportunity. This year we have already redeemed loans which will only mature next year. We took advantage of this not only because of the lower interest rates prevailing at the present time, but also because next year we have an extraordinarily heavy programme of repayments. This year was a comparatively light year and we wanted to spread the burden over the two years. The other reason is that we want to make use of this power to give the capital market and the money market an opportunity of getting the necessary money for their legitimate purposes. If we did not do so it might mean that there would be an undue hardening of interest rates. If there is a shortage of money to meet their ordinary purposes, then we want to be able to take advantage of this Bill to ensure that they are able to raise the necessary money. I think the hon. member is not quite right. My information is that the borrowing powers were not adequate in 1963. If we had had greater latitude the State would have been able to borrow more with advantages all round, as I have already indicated. I want to point out too that the ratio between our new borrowing powers and the total amount of our Revenue and Loan Budget, remains more or less unchanged, but the Loan Budget has grown tremendously in the last ten years and as far as I can see there is no indication that it will stop growing. We want to ensure that at least for the following decade we will be able to do what we think is necessary for the financial stability of this country, and that is why we consider it necessary to increase the State&#x2019;s borrowing powers. It was for that reason that the amount was increased fivefold in 1951. We are only asking for it to be doubled now. I think there is every justification for doing so, because both the Revenue Budget and the Loan Budget have been more than doubled in the last 13 years. I think it is very necessary in order to maintain our financial stability of which we are very proud in this country to allow sufficient money to meet the normal requirements of the money and the capital market. That is why it is necessary to have this extra latitude.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>It will be observed that the usual Customs and Excise Amendment Bills have on this occasion been combined into a single Bill. The reason for this is that the provision to pave the way for the designation of the head of the Department to be altered from &#x201C;Commissioner&#x201D; to &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D; relates to both the principal Acts. A second consideration is that there are no provisions in the Bill which do not relate to proposals dealt with by the House in Committee of Ways and Means. The only exception is the inclusion in the Bill, for approval by Parliament, of the Government Notices which have been published as a result of the recommendations of the Board of Trade and Industries. In the circumstances it has not been considered necessary to introduce separate Bills to give effect to the resolution adopted in Committee of Ways and Means. I have placed at the disposal of hon. members on the other side very voluminous explanatory notes and it will not be necessary for me to go into the details of the Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we have to thank the hon. the Minister for the explanatory notes. We will support this Bill which in effect makes provision for the changes in duty which we have already agreed to in Committee of Ways and Means and for giving effect to the recommendations of the Board of Trade and Industries. For the rest the Bill deals with certain Government notices which have been published and certain requirements under G.A.T.T. If there are any details to be discussed they can be discussed in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p><span class="col_8665-8666" refersTo="page_0581"/>There is one clause, however, to which I want to refer and that is Clause 2 which changes Section 91 of the existing Act, and particularly the proviso to Clause 2. This is an interesting proviso because it has the effect, by the magic wand of the Minister, put into words in this particular Bill, of changing a second-hand motor-car into a new motor-car. Up to now a motor-car has been considered to be a new vehicle if it has been run for a period of less than a month. Now, although a motor vehicle has been run for up to six months it will be regarded as a new vehicle in terms of this Act. I wonder perhaps if the hon. the Minister would care to go into Parliament Street and say the magic words over my second-hand car so that it too can become a new car. There is no doubt that the vehicle when it arrives here can be a second-hand car as we all understand that term. I know it is said that people go overseas, buy a new car, drive it for a thousand or two thousand miles and then bring it back into the country when it is in effect a new car. There are many other people, however, who will buy a car overseas, drive it for four or five months, covering 15,000 or 20,000 miles and yet in terms of this proviso that car will be regarded as a new vehicle when it arrives here. Up to now when one bought a car overseas one was allowed a depreciation of 12&#x00BD; per cent for duty purposes. To-day that falls by the wayside and unless the car has been driven for six months, duty will have to be paid as if it were a new car. Sir, I have here a calculation by the Department of Customs in regard to the purchase of a new car, and let me say at once that it is not my new car. I have never bought a new car overseas, so I have no personal interest in this matter. The approximate price of the car overseas was R1,888, and the duty under the existing circumstances is R747. One would have thought that the hon. the Minister of Finance would have been reasonably satisfied with R747 on a car costing R1,888, but apparently he is not. He now wants to charge an additional 25 per cent on a car costing less than R1,600 in respect of the difference, which will give him approximately another R57. We do not think that that is at all necessary; we do not think it is warranted and we do not see the reason for it. It is true that it may be said that a South African buying a car overseas has in fact taken possession of the car and whether he drives it overseas or in this country, it was a new car when he bought it. There are many cases where people buy things overseas. Fortunately up to now&#x2014;we express a certain fear for the future&#x2014;these things have been regarded as second-hand if they have been used before they are brought into the country.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another issue involved here and that is the retrospective effect of this legislation. This legislation is to become effective immediately. There are people who have bought cars overseas which are on the water already; they have been shipped. These people will now incur this new duty. There are people who have taken delivery of cars overseas and who are driving them on the Continent turning them into second-hand cars. Once again those cars will become new when they arrive here, and those people will have to pay the extra duty. Then there are people who have made arrangements for the purchase of cars who have paid for them and who have not yet had delivery and who will also be called upon to pay this excess duty. Sir, it is sometimes thought that the people who buy cars overseas are all very wealthy people. That is far from being the case. There are many hundreds of people who go overseas who have saved up for many years to go overseas; they buy their car overseas because it enables them to travel cheaply overseas. We have heard in this House from all sides that what we need are ambassadors overseas; these are all ambassadors, these South Africans who go overseas, and yet here we come along with a petty increase in duty of R57, which seems to be nothing but an annoyance to the person who goes overseas and buys a vehicle. I really do hope that even at this late hour the hon. the Minister will give some consideration to the Bill before us. (a) To the necessity of this increase, and (b) to the necessity of giving some protection to these people who I say, fall into three categories, those whose cars are on the water already, those whose cars have been delivered and paid for and who are driving them and those who have bought and paid for them but who have not taken delivery and who bought them in the belief that the duty was a certain amount. I know that there is the problem that once you announce a duty you have to have what I understand is called in professional circles a &#x201C;duty point&#x201D;, Well, perhaps we have to move away sometimes from these historical definitions. It seems to me it is a hardship for people suddenly to find that they are going to face this new duty.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">A. I. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to mention an example to illustrate the argument of the hon. member who has just sat down. Nowadays many of our students go overseas, as hon. members know, and they find that it is necessary for them to have a car there. They buy a car and they stay there for a period of a year or even longer. I know of hon. members here in Parliament whose children have gone overseas to study. Under these circumstances where the use of a car there is really necessary for the work that these people are doing, I feel that it would be unjust to tax that car as a new car when it is brought back to this country. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister gave consideration to this question when the Bill was framed and the fact that it is often necessary to buy a car overseas not merely for the purpose of enjoyment, but to assist one in one&#x2019;s work? It is in the interests of South Africa that our students should go overseas to widen their knowledge and I wonder whether in such cases these particular people cannot be assisted.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to say a few words in support of the case so ably stated <span class="col_8667-8668" refersTo="page_0582"/>by the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) and supported by the hon. member for Hercules (Dr. A. I. Malan). Sir, I speak as one who not only sees this from the public point of view, but also from the personal point of view. I happen to be involved in exactly this situation. I think what has been said here should be amplified by this information; that anybody who buys a car of a particular make from the local franchise holder or the local assembler or dealer as the case may be, buys it after some negotiation and inquiries, not just haphazardly&#x2014;except in the case of a few millionaires, possibly. The ordinary person like myself finds out what is involved. The present procedure is that such a person having discussed the matter with the dealer, who would give him the price of the car at a certain place, will then go to his Automobile Association or Rondalia or any of the touring or motoring clubs and get an estimate within a few cents of all the costs involved, such as the duty and even the freight, and even the clearing charges. If he wants to be quite sure about the position, he goes to the Customs official concerned and he will get a form, such as I have here, showing to a cent what the duty is on the tyres, etc. There is a rubber stamp on it &#x201C;Customs/Doeane&#x201D;. It all bears the hallmark of authenticity and officialdom. Only after all that has been done does the innocent purchaser pay for the car, as he is obliged to do. In my own case, for example, I was asked to pay in March. I had no choice about the matter. I subsequently paid. But then, Sir, when the deal has been done on a certain clear understanding which have been supported by information from an official source, to mulct the people who are already involved in this position, is somewhat unfair&#x2014;I think the hon. Minister will agree&#x2014;and cannot to a great extent enrich the Treasury. Therefore if such a provision is necessary&#x2014;I am not prepared to discuss the necessity for it; I think it is unnecessary in general terms, but the Minister knows better than I&#x2014;it should be made effective as from, say, 1 January 1964 so that anybody who then enters into such an agreement will know where he stands in the matter. I think that is the case which has been put by the hon. members who have spoken before me. Without enlarging upon it, I think it will be very difficult for the hon. the Minister to deny the justice of these representations. He may turn them down, but I do not think he can do so fairly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is not so very difficult for me to deny the justice of the representations that have been made to me. As a matter of fact, I have gone very carefully into this matter. It seems to me that the arrangement which has existed for some time is a grossly unfair arrangement. It favours certain people and not others. The second proviso to this clause is new and it means that if a South African resident purchases a car outside the Republic and uses it there for less than six months&#x2014;it may be for a week&#x2014;the car will be treated as new when imported and no reduction of the value will be made in respect of such use. If it is over six months, of course, due allowance is made. At the moment the Department allows a reduction of 12&#x00BD; per cent of the value in respect of the use up to six months. I want to show how the present arrangement is unfair. The position is that the South African resident who is granted an import permit to purchase a car overseas to the detriment of the local motor industry, enjoys an advantage over the local purchaser in that he is exempt from a portion of the duty. The person who buys in South Africa has to pay that additional duty. Not only is he saved the expense of renting a car when he is travelling overseas, but he also escapes paying the full duty when he comes back with his car. It is clear from the customs duty on motor cars that the more expensive the car the greater is the duty on the value in relation to the duty on the weight. This means that the concession in respect of the more expensive car is relatively higher than in respect of the cheaper cars. I want to give hon. members an example of that. Before 1958 the cheaper cars, that is cars up to R1,200 f.o.b., did not enjoy this concession at all, because up to 1958 they were dutiable on weight only. When a rebate of excise duty in respect of local components was granted to the motor industry, it was decided not to increase the customs duty. The continuation of such concessions as these I have mentioned which serve as encouragement to import motor cars on their wheels is, however, inconsistent with the steps which the Government is taking in connection with the establishment of a motor industry in South Africa. It is also necessary to mention, Sir, that although there may be many <i>bona fide</i> cases, this concession has in the past been abused. I need only mention one case where a gentleman who stated that he had used his car for several months overseas and when it arrived here, he did not know how to start it. In these circumstances it has been decided to withdraw the concession. The new procedure will be effective from the date of promulgation of the Act in respect of all cars imported from that date. This is in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act and there is no justification for any exceptions because this was a concession to which such persons were not really entitled. In any event a deferment of the effective date would merely be an invitation for a rush to import cars under these very favourable circumstances before such date. It is accordingly not possible to consider any request for a postponement of the effective date.</p>

<p>Hon. members may think this is a tremendous sacrifice on the part of the poor man who has bought a car already, as mentioned by the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel). But the amount he will now have to pay is not such a big amount. Take the small car first, the car of a f.o.b. value of R500. In that case the difference is only R12. That is not the selling price here, that is the f.o.b. value. In the case of the car of a f.o.b. <span class="col_8669-8670" refersTo="page_0583"/>value of R700 the sacrifice will be R17. When you come to the medium small class, i.e. from, say, R800, the amount is R20; R1,200 it is R30; R1,300 it is R40; R1,600 f.o.b. it is R50. When you come to the luxury cars, those with a f.o.b. value of R3,000 and more the difference is only R75. That is all. I think it is adjusting a position which has in the past weighed rather unfairly on the man who bought his car in South Africa, on the people who sold it here and on the people who assembled that car here. So I am afraid this is a concession that is being taken away, but I think it is a concession which should strictly not have been granted in the first instance. I have no qualms of conscience whatsoever about taking this concession away.</p>

<p>This opportunity of dealing with what the hon. the Minister said during the second reading cannot go without being used&#x2014;in my opinion, Sir. Say, for instance, a man buys a car on these terms that we discussed at the second reading, and he uses it for less than six months, maybe for a week, according to the Minister. He then gets 12&#x00BD; per cent rebate on the price of the car for the purposes of calculating the duty. Conversely, this person may have used the car for five months and three weeks. The hon. the Minister knows that very few people who go overseas can stay away from South Africa six months. They do not get a big enough allowance, as the hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) says quite rightly, and even if they could get such an allowance, their means will not permit them to holiday in Europe or in America for six months.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite incorrect. I am not suggesting that he should merely be allowed to acquire a car and immediately bring it in at a discount on duty. The present basis is fair because the minimum period, so far. has been two months. You have to keen the car out of the country, you must use it. for two months. That takes care of a normal overseas visit by ordinary people, but not six months. Clearly the Minister is now making it impossible to acquire a car on these terms. I must deal with the point the Minister made about it not being fair to the local industry. I think he said it was to the detriment of the local industry. If that were so, then I wonder how the hon the Minister can explain away the fact that the local industry assists the buyer of a car in these circumstances. I am such a buyer. There is nothing underhand, as has been suggested, no attempt to circumvent the South African industry. The South African assembler of a particular make of car will arrange for a visitor overseas&#x2014;not the Minister&#x2014;he does not need the facility&#x2014;to take delivery of the car at the place where it is manufactured. So it is not a question of the hon. the Minister, protesting his altruism, protecting the South African assembler.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Now I come to the fiscus. The hon. the Minister took great pains to say that if you bought a car of this or that value, the difference was only R15 or if you bought this or that car, the difference was only R20&#x2014;and that on a car of R1,600 f.o.b. value it was only R75. He said it was &#x201C;a small sacrifice&#x201D;. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister, with great diffidence and deference, that if this is such a small sacrifice, surely the one who should be prepared to make it must be the one who can best afford to make it&#x2014;and that is the hon. the Minister of Finance! Why expect it of the ordinary student, of the ordinary visitor who, as the hon. member for Parktown has said, may have spent a life-time saving for that trip, who needs a car over there, and arranges with the dealer here to take delivery of a car there? He buys it at a certain price level, and now the Minister says he is going to take a further R15 or R50, whatever it may be. out of that man&#x2019;s packet. If it is such a small sacrifice, I seriously suggest to the hon. the Minister that he, and the fiscus and the Treasury, should be prepared to make such a small sacrifice in order to show goodwill towards the ordinary person, who is also the taxpayer.</p>

<p>Finally, the hon. Minister gave us an example of how people have tried to escape the full duty, where they should have paid the full duty. He gave the example of a gentleman who said he had used the car overseas for several months, but who, on the car&#x2019;s arrival in South Africa, did not know even how to start the car! That only proves that that particular gentleman was a liar, perhaps, but that does not prove that everybody who buys a car overseas is a liar.</p>

<p>In fairness to the position there is one aspect which the hon. member has not dealt with. This means that the person who can afford to go overseas has an advantage over his poorer brother who cannot afford to do so. He gets 12&#x00BD; per cent reduction on his duty as opposed to the man who has to stay here and pay the full duty. Then there is the man who says he is not going to support the local assembly industry, he is going to import his car on wheels.

<p>This is a very short Bill which has only two material clauses. The purpose of this Bill is to prevent people listening in to the radio illegally by compelling listeners to take out licences when they buy a radio set. I think everyone in this House will admit that our broadcasting service is an excellent one. It is only possible to provide such a service by spending vast sums of money. We do not only broadcast warmed-up programmes from overseas as is done by many stations in Africa. Our programmes are drawn up for the people of South Africa and they are adapted to our tastes and requirements. Our own artists and writers take part in these programmes. We have our own orchestras. We have our own programmes. I wonder what other part of Africa provides the same service as that provided by the S.A.B.C.?</p>

<p>That hon. member still has a lot to learn. It costs a listener 1&#x00BD; to listen to his radio for a whole day while a newspaper which he may possibly read for 15 to 20 minutes costs him 3c. If it is a Sunday newspaper he has to pay 5c for it. It means that he can listen to the radio from morning till night throughout the whole week for 10&#x00BD;c. I want to ask hon. members who always criticize the S.A.B.C. to such an extent&#x2014;although I believe that that criticism is merely superficial&#x2014;whether there is any other service in South Africa that can be obtained at this very low cost?</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that there are a large number of people in South Africa who always want to enjoy certain facilities at the cost of others. They think that they can listen in to the radio from morning till night, throughout the year, without paying a cent for it. In terms of our present Act, a dealer who sells a radio set has to send the invoice to the Post Office because it is the Post Office that collects the licence fees. Over the past 12 months more than 366,000 radio sets have been sold. We must accept the fact that a number of the people who have purchased radio sets already have licences. For the sake of argument let us say that two-thirds are already licensed listeners&#x2014;which I do not believe&#x2014;and that only one-third are not licensed. This means that over a period of 12 months we have had 120,000 listeners who have not paid a cent. It is very difficult to trace all these radio pirates. It was comparatively easy before. Then the sets were large. To-day, there are small sets, transistorized sets that one can put into one&#x2019;s pocket<span class="col_8673-8674" refersTo="page_0585"/>or into one&#x2019;s drawer. The result is that it is difficult to trace these sets to-day. Our tracing staff consists of 71 inspectors and 10 Bantu assistants. But notwithstanding this fact we have about 100,000 illegal listeners annually. The number of persons who purchased radio sets last year was 366,000 of whom at least one-third were not licensed, and of those 120,000 we were only able to trace 22,000. The trade profits thereby because the trade makes a profit on every set that it sells. The body that loses however is the S.A.B.C. This position is further aggravated to-day because the Bantu are purchasing radio sets on a steadily increasing scale. I think that I have mentioned before that it is estimated that more than half of the radios sold on the Rand to-day are sold to Bantu. As you know, it is an extremely difficult task to enter a Bantu location to do tracing work there and it is also often a dangerous task. And so it is also becoming much more difficult to trace these illegal listeners. We have experienced this state of affairs in South Africa before&#x2014;prior to 1928&#x2014;and as a result of the position that arose then, which was very much the same as the position that we have to-day, Act No. 23 of 1928 was passed in which it was provided by the then Government that before a person could sell a radio set, the buyer had to produce a licence, and before a radio repairer could repair a radio set, he had to make sure that the owner of that set was in possession of a licence. At the same time, the system was introduced whereby the seller had to send an invoice in respect of every set he sold to the Post Office, so that the Post Office was then able to trace the unlicensed owners of radios. In 1952 this House deemed fit to go out of its way to benefit the trade and it abolished the provision whereby a person buying a radio set had first to produce a licence although the invoice system was retained. Because of this invoice system we know to-day precisely how many sets are sold in South Africa, but we find that the licence fees for the sets sold are not always paid. All that we want to do by means of this Bill is to rectify that position and to revert to the system which existed before 1952&#x2014;to make it compulsory once again for a person to be in possession of a licence before he can buy a radio set and for a person to be in possession of a licence before he can have his radio set repaired. This is a very small amendment but I think it is a most justified amendment and I am convinced that the hon. members opposite will welcome it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill is to me another clear indication that the Government does not know its own mind. The Government comes here with an amendment to the Radio Act of 1952. The Radio Act of 1952 came in place of the original Act of 1928. The Act of 1928 had the provision that a radio dealer had to ascertain the number of a listener&#x2019;s licence before he could sell a radio to him and that a repairer had to make sure that the person whose radio he was repairing had a listener&#x2019;s licence. But that was found to be impracticable. It did not work. This Government itself came with a Bill in 1952 to remove that provision. Now a bare 11 years later they come with a Bill to reinstate the provision. It is quite clear that the Government does not know its own mind in a matter such as this.</p>

<p>To me this Bill is just another instance of where the Government has failed to do its ordinary duty and now is calling on citizens outside to assist it in maintaining the law. The law is clear. Every citizen in possession of a radio must have a radio licence. The duty to enforce that is clear, too. It is the Government&#x2019;s duty, it is the duty of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, with more than 70 inspectors to implement the Act, and it is the duty of the Department of Justice to assist in enforcing it. But it is obvious that the Government have again, as in so many other instances, failed where they had to apply a particular law, and now the Government asks for these new powers, which will not only put an additional burden on the Government itself, but also an additional burden on the public outside and on the radio dealers and the radio repairmen, who already have to fill in so many forms.</p>

<p>It is clear from what the hon. Minister said that there has been some breakdown in the system of checking the radio licences. I put a question to the hon. Minister on 18 June, a few days ago, and I asked him what his present estimate was of the number of unlicensed radio sets in the Republic, and he replied that a reliable estimate could not be furnished, but that he thought that the number of unlicensed radio listeners might well run into many thousands. Now, firstly, it is clear from that reply that the Minister is asking us to do something for a reason in regard to which he is still in doubt himself. He does not seem to have real genuine evidence as to how many listeners have not paid their licences. He says it is difficult to estimate, but it may run into many thousands. But I will concede this, that it is quite possible that many owners of radios have not paid their listener&#x2019;s licence and that probably there has been some breakdown in the system.</p>

<p>I do believe, however, that under the existing Act, if properly applied, the matter can be cleared up. After all, quite a lot of money is spent every year on a large number of inspectors. The hon. Minister told me a couple of days ago in reply to a question what the position was. I asked him how many officials in his Department were charged with the duty of investigating whether the owners of radio sets were in possession of valid listener&#x2019;s licences. He replied that altogether 71 inspectors of uniformed staff and 10 senior Bantu assistants are employed full time on radio licence inspection. I am quite sure that the salaries, the wages and the expenses, the office rentals and so forth, the transport costs of these 71 inspectors will run into close on R200,000 a year. So there is in the Department <span class="col_8675-8676" refersTo="page_0586"/> of Posts and Telegraphs a section costing close on R250,000 investigating those owners of radio sets who have not taken out licences. Surely with such a costly apparatus more could have been done in the past, and it should not have been necessary to have to come to Parliament and in fact admit that the system has broken down.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister did indicate that a large number of cases were submitted to the courts during recent years. In 1958-9, approximately 7,800 cases were submitted to the courts and in 1962-3 the number had more than doubled to 18,441. I should like to know from the hon. Minister if this is an indication of the increase in the efficiency of the inspectorate, and, if so, why it is then necessary to come with this particular Bill. I believe that this provision is going to cause a great deal of inconvenience to radio dealers and radio repairers. After all. commerce and industry are burdened and overburdened to-day with a mass of forms, which they have to fill in in duplicate, in triplicate and in quadruplicate. Time is wasted on these matters, inconvenience is caused, additional books have to be kept, and general costs, including the cost-of-living. are increased by red-tape measures such as these.</p>

<p>I realize that in the past radio dealers had to fill in a form in triplicate when a new set was bought. Now, however, they will be compelled to ascertain whether the person buying the new set is in possession of a licence. That can cause difficulties. Will it be necessary, for instance, for the intending buyer of a new radio set to come along to the radio dealer and show the licence to the radio dealer? Or will it be sufficient if he only comes along and gives the number of his particular licence? What procedure is envisaged under the regulations which are to be drawn up in the future? It will be a great inconvenience, particularly to repairmen. Now, Sir, when a radio breaks down it can be a sort of emergency. An owner of a radio may want to hear the market reports, or the Stock Exchange reports, or the weather reports, and he may feel that it is essential that his radio be repaired immediately as a matter of emergency. One can well imagine that a radio repairman will be very loath when it comes to the repair of a radio, particularly where there is an emergency, to demand the presentation of a radio licence. It may well be that he says, &#x201C;Oh, let me have the number in a day or two&#x2019;s time,&#x201D; or, &#x201C;Show it to me at my shop in a week&#x2019;s time.&#x201D; Actually, in that case, this radio repairman, as I read the law, will probably be breaking this particular law. What can he do under those circumstances? Is he to tell this person: I can&#x2019;t repair your radio, you must first find that licence of yours, wherever you have mislaid it, before I can touch your particular radio and mend it? Or must he in fact break the law, not purposely, but still break it in the letter if not in the spirit, in order to repair this particular radio set?</p>

<p>I believe that it is not going to work in practice. There are going to be many, many practical difficulties in enforcing this particular provision. Let me mention one to the hon. Minister. As he knows, a person is permitted to own and to possess several radios under one licence. He can, for instance, have a gram radio which is a permanent fixture in his home, and at the same time have, say, the portable transistor radios. It could then happen that he lends one of these transistor radios to a member of his family, perhaps a minor in his family, his son going on holiday. That transistor radio breaks down 1,000 miles away from home. That son wants to have that radio repaired. He dare not go to a radio repair shop because he has not got a radio licence with him. The radio licence is at home with his parents. That can easily happen. Unless the radios are kept under the same roof all the time it can lead to great difficulties if one of the radios which is not at the home at the moment suddenly breaks down. Or a radio in a car breaks down far from home. Will it be sufficient only to tell the radio repairman what the number of the licence is? I do not think that will be sufficient according to this Bill. This Bill says specifically that &#x201C;no holder of a radio repairer&#x2019;s licence shall effect any repairs to any radio apparatus unless the person on whose behalf such repairs are effected is in possession of a valid listener&#x2019;s licence.&#x201D; I doubt whether it would be sufficient merely to say, &#x201C;I have written down the number of the radio licence, here it is, please repair my radio&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Anyway, I do not believe that Clauses 12 and 13 in this amending Bill will in any way solve the problem. We had two similar sections in the old Radio Act, also Sections 12 and 13, and those sections were, according to a reply given by the hon. Minister in this House, effective as regards only 50 per cent of the cases of delinquency. In other words, even changing those Sections 12 and 13 would not improve the position as regards more than 50 per cent of the cases. I believe that many of the other cases are discovered, say, in deceased estates, in raids on locations, or by some other method where the Police happen to find that a radio is in possession of a certain person who has not got a licence. Those are cases in which Clauses 12 and 13 will not apply. They have only applied in the past in the case of about 50 per cent of the convictions that were actually obtained or were brought to the courts under the old system. I doubt very much whether this particular Bill will in any way bring to an end what the hon. Minister has been pleased to call &#x201C;illegal listening&#x201D;. I believe that the old Act as we had it was sufficient. I do not want to quote from the Hansard of 1952. but I am sure that the arguments that the hon. Minister, or his predecessor, used then for not having this provision in the Bill would still apply to-day, and I should like to hear from the hon. Minister why those arguments which <span class="col_8677-8678" refersTo="page_0587"/>were used in 1952 do not equally well apply to-day.</p>

<p>The Minister says that it is difficult to-day to inspect whether a person has paid his radio licence after he has bought a new radio. But under the old Act it was also necessary for the radio dealer to add the name and address of the buyer of the radio to the particular form which he had to fill in in triplicate, one of which he had to send to the authorities. The name and address was available on that particular form to the Government authorities, the same as it will be available to-day. In other words, the inspection will be just as difficult in future, particularly when there has to be a renewal of a licence. Therefore, I conclude by saying that I do not believe that this Bill is a necessary one under the circumstances. I believe that the existing machinery can be used to better effect, and I believe that the Government was right in introducing the Radio Act in 1952 and that it is wrong to go back now on its own policy of 11 years ago.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I can see the difficulty the Broadcasting Corporation is experiencing. The cost of a licence is now so high that there is a temptation to evade payment. It is true of all taxation, that when taxation is increased to such extent that people have difficulty in paying and find it a hardship, they try to avoid payment, and there is evasion. Now quite obviously there is evasion here. But I don&#x2019;t quite see why it is necessary to introduce this Bill at all. The 1952 Act says quite clearly under the same Sections 12 and 13, that it is necessary for a dealer and a repairer to furnish information similar to this information. It is quite impossible I feel to-day to cover all sales and all repairs to radio apparatus. It is an impossibility. Now that there are for sale these small transistor sets, the whole thing has got quite out of control. I don&#x2019;t wish to discuss the Broadcasting Corporation in general, as the hon. Minister did, but I think the Corporation will have to consider having a system to finance broadcasting without a licence, or with a very small cost for a licence. I think that will have to come. The income will have to be derived from more advertising on the C-programme, and perhaps a subsidy from the Government, because the Government is using the radio for propaganda to-day.</p>

<p>When we look at this amendment that is proposed, there are the two clauses, the one dealing with the radio dealer&#x2019;s licence. He may not sell any radio apparatus. Now how does one define any &#x201C;radio apparatus&#x201D;? Does the hon. Minister mean a &#x201C;radio set&#x201D;, what we used to call in the old days a &#x201C;wireless set&#x201D;? Does he mean a set or does he mean the element of a set? If that is so, and you have a transistor, what about the dry batteries? Are the &#x201C;dry batteries&#x201D; radio apparatus? These dry batteries you can buy for 8c and 10c in practically any shop in town? Are those people to have radio trading licences now? As a matter of fact, in transistor sets all that is needed is to have dry batteries to supply power. I can&#x2019;t see how this can be interpreted.</p>

<p>When we come to the question of the radio repairer, if you are going to say, as is said in this Bill, that no radio repairer may carry out repairs without filling in all these forms and notifying the Postmaster-General, what is going to happen? What happens when you find the cost of repairing a car is too expensive? You go to a mechanic who is not on duty. You say: &#x201C;Well, young Smith is just around the corner here and I am going to ask him to have a look at the carburettor.&#x201D; Young Smith who works in a garage comes home in the evening and says: &#x201C;Yes, I will have a look at it.&#x201D; He repairs it and you give him 50c. What is going to happen if a radio set breaks down? It is quite a simple thing to fix a radio set. I have fixed numerous radio sets. It is quite a simple thing when you know the theory behind it.</p>

<p>No, I did it free of charge. But you will get unofficial repairing by people who are not radio repairers and therefore need not put in a return, because officially they are not charging. I think that this amendment is unnecessary. It is an amendment to a law which cannot be carried out, and the essential thing in creating a new law is to make sure that it will not be broken easily, that people will respect the law and understand what it means. I think this will not create respect for the law. Therefore I would suggest to the hon. Minister as a first step to get the cost of licences reduced. I think it might even increase the revenue.</p>

<speech by="#knobel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">KNOBEL</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, I differ completely from the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) as far as his last statement is concerned. He said that the amendment in Clause 13 (1) will assist in tracing those people who have not paid for their licences. I just want to point out that this Bill has in mind in the first place that all those buying new radio sets must have licences for those sets. Now the hon. member says that radio apparatus can also include light bulb. That is something that I cannot understand. The hon. member was a teacher but I do not think that he is correct in saying this. When one speaks of radio apparatus, one speaks of a radio set. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that everyone buying a new radio set will take out a licence before taking possession of the radio. It may be possible that all the old radio sets will be replaced by new ones in ten years&#x2019; time. In this way one will eventually have the position where licences will have been taken out for all new radios. But in the meantime, there are thousands of old radio sets being sold and a large number of these sets are not licensed. This is the only way in which to trace these people. If an old radio set is out of order and is taken to a licensed radio repair shop, these cases will then be brought to <span class="col_8679-8680" refersTo="page_0588"/>light. I agree with the hon. member for Kensington that if one takes one&#x2019;s radio set to be repaired by Jantjie in some backyard or other, the Postmaster-General will not be able to trace such a case, but such cases are exceptions to the rule. A person who has paid a reasonably high price for his radio set will not take that radio set to Jantjie or to the hon. member for Kensington. He will not dare to. He may find that the whole set has been ruined. That is why it is not fair of the hon. member to make such a statement. This sort of thing will only happen very seldom. I fully support this Bill. When we consider that the South African Broadcasting Corporation is providing us with a very important and good service and that it has virtually only two sources of income&#x2014;from radio licences and from its commercial service&#x2014;and when we consider the tremendous programme of expansion that it has on hand, when we consider that when the F.M. system has been finally introduced throughout the country within the next ten years or so it will have cost the Corporation about R37,000.000, we realize that they need every penny of the money obtained from radio licences. If we look at the annual report for 1962 we find that in 1962 an amount of slightly more than R4,000,000 was collected in respect of licences, and the Broadcasting Corporation cannot afford to lose these licence fees. This Bill is absolutely necessary. When we consider the B.B.C., for example, we find that not only do they have licence fees in regard to their internal services as a source of income, but that they also receive a Government loan which last year amounted to about &#x00A3;7,000,000 to assist them to render that service. The hon. member for Orange Grove has raised almost impossible cases of persons going away on holiday and having trouble with their radios while they are away. Well then, I say &#x201C;it is just too bad&#x201D;, but the Broadcasting Corporation cannot afford to leave loopholes to be made use of by people who want to be dishonest and who want to avoid paying for a licence in this way. When we look at the fees that the South African Broadcasting Corporation charges for its licences in comparison with the fees charged in other countries, we find that they are extremely fair. When we consider the tremendous area that is served by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, then I say that the statement that has already been made here that we have the highest fees in the world is simply not true. Our Broadcasting Corporation is rendering a service which I do not think is rendered by any other country in the world. We must consider that the Broadcasting Corporation only earns R9.03 per square mile in South Africa for the service that it is rendering and when we consider that a country like West Germany earns an amount of R288.85 per square mile, then we realize that there is no art in West Germany&#x2019;s being able to make do with a cheaper tariff. Even then their tariff is not that much cheaper than ours. They pay R4.10 for a licence while our licence costs R5.50. and that is for three radios or more that are served in the high frequency areas.</p>

<p>That is why I want to conclude by wholeheartedly supporting the hon. the Minister and I think that every hon. member on this side will agree with me that we support this Bill. I just want to ask the Opposition&#x2014;and particularly the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) who is always very critical of the Broadcasting Corporation, how they can expect the S.A.B.C. to render good services when it cannot collect the licence fees that are its due. I want to ask the hon. member for Orange Grove whether he is going to vote against this Bill. I do not think that he will. I think that he is merely trying to find an argument on which to differ from the hon. the Minister, as he always does.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel), as usual, has got hold of the wrong end of the stick. This side of the House has no objection whatever to licence fees being collected and it has no sympathy for the person who does not pay his licence fees. Our objection to the measure is that the Minister, having failed through the proper channels to do his job, now has to go to the commercial channels and ask them to do his job for him because he has made a mess of it. The Bill actually says: I as the Minister have failed to collect the fees for licences and I must now ask the trade to help me.</p>

<p>But firstly I want to deal with the argument of the hon. member for Bethlehem. He questioned the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) when the latter spoke of apparatus, and the hon. member for Bethlehem said, &#x201C;I think apparatus means a wireless set, or wireless apparatus.&#x201D; That is typical of the hon. member. He has not read the Bill or the original Act. &#x201C;Apparatus&#x201D; is defined. It says that &#x201C;radio apparatus&#x201D; means any radio receiving or transmitting set which is capable of receiving or transmitting by radio any sound, image or signal, and includes any article which the Minister from time to time declares by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> to be radio apparatus for the purposes of this Act. In the amendment of 1962 it adds to this and says &#x201C;except any article which the Minister from time to time by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> declares not to be radio apparatus for purposes of the Act. But this hon. member, this expert on radio affairs, questioned the definition of radio apparatus when really apparatus means anything the Minister says it is or is not. Now the hon. member will realize that in fact it is just too bad. He does not care for the person who suffers inconvenience, because he needs a new battery or valve and does not have his licence handy..</p>

<p>But I want to come back to the detail of this Bill, the first clause of which provides that any supplier of a radio shall ensure that a licence has been taken out. As justification for this clause, the Minister compared the cost of a newspaper at three cents with the cost of listening to the radio. I want to ask him whether <span class="col_8681-8682" refersTo="page_0589"/>on the S.A.B.C. you can take your choice of political policy as you can in a newspaper? When you buy a newspaper you can pick what you want. You can buy the <i>Transvaler</i> or the <i>Burger</i> if you want those sort of lies, or you can buy one of the other papers if you want the truth. You have a choice, but I want to ask the Minister whether there is a choice of political news when you are listening to the S.A.B.C.? No, we are bound to listen to whatever propaganda is pumped into us, and therefore only this Parliament has the right to determine whether in order to have S.A.B.C. propaganda pumped into you, you should have the radio trade of South Africa acting as the agents for the Minister.</p>

<p>Will the hon. member read to me in the 1928 Act what the definition of &#x201C;apparatus&#x201D; is?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I read from the 1952 Act. which is the consolidation of the 1928 Act, as amended, and this is the law as it stands now. I am not interested in what was radio apparatus in 1928; I am interested in what is radio apparatus now, and I quoted that to the hon. member because that is what this Bill is going to apply to. This Bill will not apply to the old crystal set of 1928, but to the complicated set of 1963. The Minister explained the difficulties he had with the 71 inspectors and 10 Bantu inspectors, and he admitted that they had failed to deal with the question of unlicensed listeners, and yet the law as it stands now lays down that whenever a radio is sold the seller shall send a copy of the invoice to the Postmaster-General, who is therefore aware of every radio sold in South Africa. What the Minister is in fact admitting is that he has not got the machinery to follow up the information he already has. He is told of the sale in terms of Clause 12 of the existing Act, and the Minister&#x2019;s Department is so inefficient that although they know who has licences and what their names and addresses are and on what date they bought the sets, he cannot keep up to date with that. So now he says that instead of his inspectors doing the work, he will make the dealer see that the licence is taken out first.</p>

<p>Now I will tell the Minister why his inspectors cannot do the job, and I wrote to him about it and did not even get a reply. It is because his inspectors spend their time pestering people who have already paid their licences, instead of dealing with those who have not. I had four or five inquiries the year before last about not having paid my licence, until in desperation I wrote to the Minister and said I had already made my contribution to Nationalist Party propaganda through the S.A.B.C. and I objected to being bullied into paying a second time, and what happened? The inspector could not find the licence I had taken out here because he had apparently never heard of the little post office called the Volksraad. Because I paid my licence here, an inspector went to my home, he came to my office, he wrote me two cards and phoned three times, continuing this inquisition after he had been notified of the number and date of the licence. I wrote to the Minister and told him about that, but the next year exactly the same thing happened. They sent me a card and telephoned my office and a man came round to see why I had not paid my licence, which had been paid in the normal course and on time. If the inspectors are going to spend their time chasing people who have paid their licences, no wonder they cannot find those who have not paid. It just shows that the Minister has got his Department into an absolute mess and the only way he can get out of it is to ask us to act as policemen, and I object to that for two reasons. Firstly I object to making commerce and industry inspectors for the Government, and secondly I object to the Government trying to escape from its own mess by trying to use Parliament as an instrument to help the S.A.B.C.. That same S.A.B.C., when we want information about it, says it has nothing to do with Parliament. Then we are told that it is an independent corporation, but when it wants help they come to Parliament and ask us to pass a little law saying that the dealer should collect the licences on behalf of the S.A.B.C. because they and the Post Office cannot do it. This complete change in the whole set-up is in order to trace about 22,000 unlicensed listeners a year, but all the hundreds of thousands of licensed listeners have to be pestered and annoyed for the sake of those few whom the Minister cannot trace. Every time I want to get my wireless repaired if I am sitting in Cape Town with a portable radio I have to write to Durban and get the licence, and by that time it is probably the end of the Session, and all the hon. member for Bethlehem says is that it is too bad. Not that I listen to any of the propaganda that comes over, but sometimes there is a decent programme. And that applies to every holidaymaker in South Africa who takes a wireless with him. If we take a wireless with us, it is illegal to repair it unless the licence is produced. And what about those who have sons, as I have, who pull radios to bits for the fun of it, and you never know how many sets you have working at the moment? At the moment I think I have one, but there are bits and pieces lying all over the house. Everyone who knows boys will know that their rooms are a mess of radio parts. [Interjection.] If those members opposite had the intelligence to understand how a radio works, they would understand what I am talking about, but I cannot really blame them. Every time a kid wants to buy a valve he has to produce the licence. We on this side object to the inconvenience to the public and to the licensed dealers being turned into free spies for the Minister, and we object to the trade being asked to do the job of the Post Office. Finally we object to this measure being slipped through as an innocent little Bill in the dying days of the Session. The Minister will not get away with this sort of thing so easily.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member heartily for his amusing speech here <span class="col_8683-8684" refersTo="page_0590"/>towards the end of the Session. The hon. member was probably instructed to talk on this matter and he made the fuss that he usually makes, and now I suppose I shall have to reply to him. The fact that the radio inspectors are after his blood so much is probably because they know him as we know him. Secondly, the hon. member made a mistake in saying that that inspector was not aware of a small post office called the House of Assembly Post Office. Well, there is such a post office. The official name of this post office is the Parliamentary Building Post Office. The hon. member probably misled the inspector in that regard. The hon. member has told us that he has a large number of sets.</p>

<p>I think that we have to deal here with a Bill to promote efficiency. Let us approach the matter from a practical point of view and not in such a theoretical way; we should not generalize all the exceptions to such an extent that they appear to be the rule. The position is that it is already provided by law that when a person buys a new radio the Postmaster-General must be informed. What is so wrong in the fact&#x2014;because that administrative work must be done&#x2014;that one additional form must be filled in giving the radio licence number, a copy of which is sent to the Postmaster-General, so that by taking this one step the Postmaster-General will immediately be able to see that that radio has been licensed? That is all that is provided for in this clause. The Opposition object to it, but they have no objection to the fact that the taxpayers&#x2019; money should be wasted by having to pay a whole horde of inspectors to investigate all the addresses that are given to them. No, it is a question of efficiency and it is not such a burden on the public or on the dealers, because the dealer has in any case to fill in a form. He will now have to fill in one additional form, and this will save the State a tremendous amount of money and trouble. I think that the Opposition are wasting time, because they cannot have any real objections to this Bill. Their opposition is merely for show; there is no substance in it. Is it so exceptional that the forms have to be filled in? How many cases do we not have where the dealer is expected to complete forms before he sells anything to the public? Take firearms. Before a dealer can sell a firearm he must obtain the licence from a magistrate and record it in his book. Before a man can sell a secondhand car to a member of the public, he has first of all to issue a roadworthy certificate as well as a third party insurance form. Even the collection of taxes is now being undertaken for the State by the employer, and the Opposition supports this, even though it does give the employer a great deal of additional administrative work. But they object to this one extra form that the dealer has to complete. No, I think that the matter is clear and I need not discuss it any further.</p>

<p>But there is another argument. Because of the different kinds of radio sets that are available to-day, such as the small transistor sets that one can put in one&#x2019;s coat pocket, it is an impossible task for the inspectors to trace radios in order to ascertain whether they are licensed. The Bill provides for an effective way in which to control the position but now it is being opposed. I think that the Opposition are devoid of all objectivity. They simply want to oppose the hon. the Minister and they want to make political capital out of it. This is a necessary Bill which has efficiency in mind and there is nothing wrong with it at all.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>We in this House always tie ourselves up with red tape and make more and more regulations which make it more and more difficult for people outside. The people are becoming punch-drunk. Here we have a Bill which says that you must first have a licence before you can buy a radio or have it repaired. The hon. member for Randfontein referred to roadworthy certificates for motor cars, but that is to promote road safety, something which is very necessary, and the same applies to third party insurance. Actually, this Bill should be called the Assistance in the Collection of Moneys Bill, and this sort of thing should not be thrust upon the commercial people in South Africa. Can you imagine an auctioneer selling 100 radios and calling for bids but saying that he cannot accept the bid unless the man has his licence? What happens then? Does the auction stand still while the bidder goes out to buy some licences? That is just how ridiculous this Bill is. You will probably see no more auctions of radios. Then you come to the repairer. Hon. members tried to make out that this is not serious, but a duty is being thrust upon the repair man. If he does not look at your licence he becomes a criminal, and why should we make a lot of people criminals? What will be the result of this Bill? The amount of revenue the Minister collects will never pay for the additional inspectors he will need. If you cannot enforce this law, why have it? It is a ridiculous thing. It is just one more thing thrust on the long-suffering public. People on holiday will not be able to have their radios repaired because they do not have their licences with them. The radio repair man naturally cannot be allowed to repair a set, so what will you have? You will have the substitution of licences. Anybody&#x2019;s licence will be used and the Minister has no way of checking that. A licence has to be produced when a radio is purchased, but there will still have to be inspectors to check up the renewals of the licences, so no time or money is saved. There will have to be dozens of inspectors to carry out the law, and I hope that this House will throw out the Bill.</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member who has just sat down how wrong he is. If he had read the Bill well he would have seen that it provides that &#x201C;No holder of a radio dealer&#x2019;s licence shall sell or in any manner whatsoever supply &#x2026;&#x201D;. The Bill emphasizes the question of sale and supply. This means that if the <span class="col_8685-8686" refersTo="page_0591"/>dealer wants to sell a set, he can do so, but the sale is not finalized until delivery has been taken. All that the buyer then does is to go to the post office to take out a licence and by the time the radio set is delivered to his home, he can produce the licence. Precisely the same happens at a sale. It is presumed that the buyer has complied with the laws of the country. The law presumes that he has a licence; that is the basis of our system. There is no difficulty.</p>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister? Sub-section (1) of the new Section 12 inserted by Clause 1 is quite clear. It provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No holder of a radio dealer&#x2019;s licence shall sell, give or in any manner whatsoever supply any radio apparatus to any person who is not in possession of a valid listener&#x2019;s licence.</block>

<p>Supposing a set is sold by public auction to a person who has no licence, what will be the position then?</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>The word &#x201C;supply&#x201D; is the word that determines the eventual meaning of the subsection. &#x201C;Sell&#x201D; does not only mean that one tells a buyer that he can have what is being sold; one also has to give or supply the article. The supplying is part of the sale. The seller cannot simply say: &#x201C;I will give it to you for a certain amount of money&#x201D;. Part of the transaction is the supplying of that article. The supplying is the essence of the transaction and the supplying can be postponed until such time as the licence is produced. There is therefore no difficulty in that regard, and so that problem falls away completely.</p>

<p>The hon. member also has another difficulty; he says that there will be &#x201C;substitution&#x201D;. That is quite right, but can the hon. member mention to me any sphere of activity in which there are not certain people who are trying to get away with something? Some people are always trying to defraud others. I admit there is the possibility of fraud but we will now be able to compel most of the people who try to shirk their duty, to pay, and that is the important point. As I have already said, the people who do not pay are not few in number. I think that it was the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) who said that the amount involved was only about R20,000. The hon. member lost sight of the figure I gave him. I told him that last year 366,000 radio sets were sold but that only 22.000 radio pirates were traced. The amount involved therefore is very large indeed. I told him that I admitted that some of the people who bought radio sets did perhaps already have licences, but there are still a very large number of people who have no licences. We admit that there will be cases where fraud will still be committed, but by means of this provision we will be able to compel a very large number of these people to take out a licence.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) experienced some difficulty with the term &#x201C;radio apparatus&#x201D;, but unfortunately, as he himself admitted, the hon. member did not read the Bill too well. If he had read it well he would have seen that &#x201C;radio apparatus&#x201D; is defined in Section 1 of the Act. It is clearly provided that radio apparatus is any set by means of which one can receive a signal, by means of which one can hear something, and comprising such component parts as may be provided by the Minister. In other words, the Minister is not going to declare a little screw or a piece of wire to be a radio part. He will say that those articles that are used specifically for a radio cannot be supplied. In other words, the problem in this regard will not be as serious as the hon. member for Kensington imagines.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) told me that the system had worked badly and that this Act was introduced in 1952, because the system was working badly. He said that I would have read what hon. members had had to say during the debate at the time, but the hon. member tripped himself up there because nothing was said about this section during that debate. In actual fact, this system did work well, but in 1952 when the Act was amended, the new development in radio was not anticipated&#x2014;that one would eventually have transistor sets, sets which could be operated without electricity. In other words, one is able to-day to buy very small sets that are easily hidden away and that no one can trace. If hon. members investigate the number of licences issued, they will see that over the past year there has been a very small increase in the number of new listeners. There has been an increase of only 14,000 although 366,000 sets have been sold. This fact can only be ascribed to the new development in radio&#x2014;that one is able to buy these small sets that are easily hidden away.</p>

<p>I think that other hon. members on this side have dealt effectively with the rest of the problems that have been raised here. I do not think that there are any other points remaining to which I need reply.</p>

<p>As the long title indicates the aim of this Bill is to transfer an amount if R220,000 from the Local Loans Fund established by Act No. 19 of 1926, to the University of the Orange Free State. This amount will then be used as capital for the establishment of a Donation Fund to be called the Orange Free State Study Bursaries Fund.</p>

<p>The history of this amount of R220,000 is briefly as follows: In 1909 the Government of the then Orange River Colony set aside an amount of R220,000 for the establishment of a Local Loans Fund. This fund was established by Act No. 34 of 1909 of that Colony. In terms of the provisions of section <i>five</i> of the aforementioned Act, the interest occurring to the capital investment must be used as follows: (a) Interest on R100,000 to be used for the payment of annuities to persons wounded during the Anglo-Boer War and to the widows and orphans of persons who died in that war; and (b) interest on R120,000 plus any interest on the aforementioned amount of R100,000 which is not needed for the war pensioners, to be used for the granting of study bursaries to deserving pupils who are the children of inhabitants of the Orange River Colony (now the Orange Free State). A further condition connected with these study bursaries is that the bulk of these study bursaries must be allocated to people wanting to study at the Grey University College (now the University of the Orange Free State) or who study elsewhere with the object of acquiring agricultural knowledge or are studying to qualify as school teachers. At this point I just want to mention that the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) was good enough to consult me in connection with an amendment that may perhaps be moved to Clause 4 (2) (b). I am prepared at the Committee Stage to move an amendment to Clause 4 (2) (b) to include teachers in science and technology. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) has become known in this House as a staunch supporter of the training of teachers in science and technology, and it will be a pleasure for me to move this amendment at her request so that it can be brought more pertinently to the attention of the people administering the Fund and allocating the bursaries that special thought must be given to this aspect of the matter. I am <span class="col_8689-8690" refersTo="page_0593"/>prepared to move an amendment to this effect at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>In 1926 the total capital amount involved R220,000, was transferred to the Local Loans Fund which was established by Act No. 19 of 1926. It is this amount that the Bill now envisages transferring to the proposed Orange Free State Study Bursaries Fund under the control of the University of the Orange Free State.</p>

<p>The amount of R100,000, the interest on which must in the first instance be used for pensions for wounded war veterans, will however remain with the Public Debt Commissioners until there are no longer any persons who are entitled to annuities from this source. At present there are still 33 persons receiving benefits from this Fund. Their annuities amount to more than R6,000 while the capital produces about R4,600 in interest. Their ages range from 75 to 85, with an average age of 80 years. It seems as though people in the Free State live to a ripe old age! The balance of the annuities is of course paid from State revenue in the normal way as in the case of other kinds of war pensions. It will be some years yet before the Free State Study Bursaries Fund will derive any benefit from surplus interest or will receive the capital amount of R100,000.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, it is general practice for universities to have control over their bursary funds. The money that Parliament votes every year as loans to universities for the purpose of building up Study Bursary Funds is also controlled and invested by the universities themselves.</p>

<p>The effect of this Bill will be that the University of the Orange Free State will initially have an amount of R120,000 available to it but will eventually receive the full amount of R220,000 which it will then be able to invest in the best interests of the Study Bursaries Fund. For example, where the university at the moment is paying up to 5&#x00BE; per cent on its own capital loans, this money can be invested in its own buildings. In this way the Study Bursaries Fund will be able to earn interest of more than 5&#x00BD; per cent while an average of 4.6 per cent is derived at the moment from the amount invested with the Public Debt Commissioners.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I thank the hon. the Minister for his clear exposition of this piece of legislation before us. As the hon. the Minister said, this measure was passed because of the Anglo-Boer War and what happened thereafter. After the war many thousands of our people found themselves in a critical financial position, not only people who fought on the side of the Boers, but also those who fought on the other side. Many of their children were fatherless and/or motherless. There were many widows and orphans and I think that it was a good thing that the legislation of 1909 made provision for those people, and in the first instance, for those who were wounded during the Anglo-Boer War. I am pleased to hear that there are still 33 of them living and drawing benefits under this Fund. The hon. the Minister said that the average age of these war veterans was 80 years. It will therefore be some time before that portion of the Fund can be made available to the University. But it is a good thing that those people are being looked after, particularly the widows and orphans.</p>

<p>While I am on the subject, I wonder whether the hon. the Minister is able to tell us how many wounded war veterans or orphans or widows have received benefits from the Fund since 1909 and what the total amount is that has been paid out to them.</p>

<p>The legislation that was passed at the time also had the education of young people in mind. Many of them took an active part in the war at that time; many of our young boys of 14, 15 and 16 participated in the Anglo-Boer War and were therefore deprived of educational facilities. This Fund was also made available to them. The fact that is interesting to my mind is that such a practical method was used to rehabilitate our people. The Act provided that the greater part of the Fund should be spent on those pursuing agricultural studies or those wanting to become teachers. I am pleased that those principles are being maintained in this Bill. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can tell us how many children of people who participated in the war in the Orange Free State and how many children of the inhabitants of the Orange Free State have derived benefits from this Fund up to the present; in other words, how many of them have received and are receiving assistance under this Fund. It will be interesting to know how many people have been and are being assisted in this way and the amount that is being spent in that connection.</p>

<p>I want to refer the hon. the Minister to Clause 4 (1) which provides that the children of the inhabitants of the Orange Free State can study at the University of the Orange Free State or at any other university or at the Glen Agricultural College. I can understand this. But I want to ask the hon. the Minister what the reason is for extending these provisions to Potchefstroom. I have no objection to it but what I want to ask him, in pursuance of this fact, is why Cedara was omitted? I do not think that Cedara is connected with the University of Natal and that is why I am asking this question. It is for this reason that I do not mention Elsenburg because Elsenburg forms part of the University of Stellenbosch. If the hon. the Minister would accept an amendment in this regard, I would like to move at the Committee Stage that the words &#x201C;or Cedara&#x201D; be inserted after the word &#x201C;Potchefstroom&#x201D; in clause 4 (3) (c) (ii).</p>

<p>Yes, Grootfontein is also one that can be included. These are the <span class="col_8691-8692" refersTo="page_0594"/>two institutions that are not connected with universities.</p>

<p>I want also to refer the hon. the Minister to clause (4) 2. He was good enough to accept the suggestion of the hon. member for Johannesburg-North (Mrs. Weiss) in connection with the extension of the training of teachers, both male and female, in order to include the sciences. Mr. Speaker, the original Act uses the expression &#x201C;merendeel&#x201D; (mostly), while the word &#x201C;hoofsaaklik&#x201D; (mainly) used in this Bill. I wonder whether we cannot extend this even further. Or let me put the question in this way: Will the University Council be able to extend these two courses which are mentioned in the Act to cover further courses? Let me quote it so that it will appear on record&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such bursaries shall be allotted by the Council mainly to students pursuing their studies with the object of acquiring agricultural knowledge and students studying to qualify as school teachers.</block>

<p>Will the council be able in terms of this Clause to extend that training to cover other courses besides agricultural and teachers courses?</p>

<p>I have one final question: The hon. the Minister did of course correctly point out that the control over the Fund will now pass into the hands of the University Council. Up to the present, the control over this Fund has been vested in the Public Debt Commissioners but up to 1910 the Fund was controlled by a council established under the Land and Agricultural Loan Fund Act, No. 33 of 1909. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the Council that was established under the Land and Agricultural Loan Fund by Act No. 33 of 1909, lapsed on the formation of Union or whether it continued to exist until 1926 when the later Act was passed?</p>

<p>I want to content myself with these few questions and remarks and I want to say that this side of the House will support this legislation. We want to express the hope that many more pupils and students will be able to derive benefit from this Fund.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>It would be presumptuous on my part to attempt to criticize this Bill in any way. All I can do is to pay tribute to the memory of the men who established a fund of this kind. What a remarkable thing it is that as far back as 1909 these men were many years ahead of their time in establishing a fund for ex-servicemen and their dependants. I congratulate the Minister on having the opportunity to introduce the Bill. I cannot suggest any amendment. All I can say is that if the people of the Orange Free State want this then I am quite satisfied. If they have expressed their desire through their Provincial Council or through their members in this House then I am perfectly satisfied. This is a Free State Bill; it is their concern and I would give them the fullest support in what they wish to do.</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>May I say that it is a pleasure to be able to commend this Orange Free State Study Bursaries Bill. The principle laid down in the Act of 1926 which was preceded by the Act of 1909 to which the Minister has referred is not affected; the <i>status quo</i> is maintained and the Bill can be welcomed by this side of the House. I would also at the same time like to express appreciation of the Minister&#x2019;s gesture in accepting the principle of my proposed extension of Clause 4 (1) (b). I feel this will extend the scope of the University Council to pay attention to prospective schoolteachers who will specialize in teaching the sciences and technology. Surely here is the opportunity to encourage the study of these subjects through the University of the Orange Free State. This year Dr. H. J. van Eck said at the University of Potchefstroom that despite the growth of the University there was still a shortage of scientists in South Africa. As the hon. the Minister has said earlier this afternoon during his second reading speech a further sum of R100,000 will gradually become available to be used by the University for more study bursaries. I feel as much as possible of these funds should be made available to encourage school teachers to train in the subjects of science and technology. I am sure that in enabling these school teachers to qualify in these subjects in order to train the youth of the country we would have the support of the instigators of the original Local Loan Fund Bursaries Act of the Orange River Colony. I feel this does not interfere in any way with the principle of the old Act but that this new Bill extends the principle.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister very carefully to consider the suggestions put forward by the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) to extend the agricultural colleges to include Cedara. I feel that if the other agricultural colleges are included in Clause 4 Cedara also has the right to be included here. There is a further question that I should like to ask the Minister concerning the Fund. I notice first of all that the exact amount of these funds in the old Orange River Colonies Act have been transferred to this new Bill&#x2014;no appreciation and no depreciation. Is it not considered that that is necessary in any way? My further question to the hon. the Minister is whether he is able to give the House any further information regarding bursaries. The hon. member for Hillbrow has already asked how many of the wounded or the widows or the orphans were helped through this Fund which was instigated in 1909. I should like to extend that, Sir, if I may and ask the hon. the Minister whether he knows how much was utilized for bursaries for agriculture and for school teachers; how many were successful and how many of these fortunate students came back to teach in the Orange Free State. I feel that this Bill is a measure to be supported by this side of the House.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation for the support that this fine measure <span class="col_8693-8694" refersTo="page_0595"/>has received. I also want to reiterate the fact that one is pleased that they had the courage in those difficult years after the Anglo-Boer War to collect money and that they realized that there was a need for this sort of thing. I want to thank hon. members heartily for their participation in this debate. A few questions have been asked that are rather difficult for me to answer. The question of the number of bursaries and the amount of money that has been paid out, as well as the amount of money that has been paid out to widows, orphans and wounded war veterans, is a matter that falls under my colleague sitting next to me. In any case, it is a very interesting question, particularly as far as the bursaries are concerned. In 1926, when the money was made available, it was all transferred to the University Council. They actually allocate the bursaries and we shall have to obtain the correct information from them. As the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) said, it is a Free State Fund and if the Free Staters want it that way, then we must give it to them. It is true that they have been agitating for more control over the Fund for some years now. The question put to me is an interesting one. I should like to obtain this information from them so that we can see how much money has been paid out.</p>

<p>They are completely satisfied with it. The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) also asked me whether we could not extend these provisions to include Cedara and Grootfontein. Originally, the idea was that the money should only be used for students studying at Glen. When the Department of Agricultural Technical Services heard that we wanted to deal with these bursary matters as provided for in this Bill, they had a great deal to say about these bursary allocations. We must remember that as far as farming methods are concerned it is best for the children of the Free State to go to Glen and Potchefstroom. Cedara and Grootfontein and Elsenburg and all the other experimental farms concentrate upon another type of agriculture. But this Bill does not at all prevent Free State children studying at Cedara. The actual intention was&#x2014;and we have kept as closely as possible to the intentions of the original founders of the Fund&#x2014;that the Fund should be used to assist Free State children. The Potchefstroom Agricultural College was only included later because it made provision for certain subjects for which Glen did not make provision. Actually, Glen and Potchefstroom form one for the purpose of the Free State. That is the only reason. I do not think that it would be right to include the other agricultural colleges at this stage.</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill amends the Public Health Act, No. 36 of 1919. In the first place it authorizes the framing of regulations to make immunization compulsory. We all realize that it is not always practicable to introduce compulsory immunization on a national scale. It is impracticable because it requires a great deal of administration and there are other reasons as well. I think it is an accepted fact that before one can make immunization against any disease compulsory, one must be convinced that it is a serious disease, that one&#x2019;s vaccine is effective and that that obligation can be effectively carried out. It may therefore be desirable in certain specific cases, as for example in the case of smallpox. It may also become necessary in restricted areas. It may also become necessary <span class="col_8695-8696" refersTo="page_0596"/> only in respect of certain groups of persons, such as the children of immigrants for example. Polio is one of those special cases, and, strangely enough, polio falls within this category to-day as a result of the great success achieved by our campaign of two years ago. Our medical experts estimated at the time that if we could succeed in immunizing 80 per cent of the population of South Africa, spread evenly throughout South Africa, the result would actually be that the whole population would automatically become immunized because persons immunized against the living virus would within a short while infect everyone else and thus immunize them. Our experts told us that if this could be achieved the polio virus would virtually disappear from South Africa. This campaign was very successful. We cannot however, close our eyes to the fact that there were a few spots in South Africa where the people, mostly Bantu, did not co-operate with us in that campaign. They opposed the campaign because of superstition and certain tales which had been spread. We can say therefore that we have cleared South Africa of the wild polio virus except in a few spots. But we must also remember that the territories around South Africa are not free of the wild polio virus&#x2014;the Protectorates and the other territories to the north of us. Since there is a continual interchange of population between this country and those territories, it means that people who may possibly be carriers of the polio virus are always entering South Africa. It is very necessary therefore for us to immunize all those persons who in the meantime have become susceptible to polio&#x2014;for example children born since the immunization and all immigrants to this country. Our medical experts are of the opinion that the immunized persons in a community actually serve as a cushion between those who are carriers of the polio virus but who have been immunized and those who have not been immunized. If, however, there are large numbers of people who have not been immunized, the possibility of an epidemic is much greater.</p>

<p>Parents in South Africa have become very confident over the past few years. Adults were immunized during the campaign two years ago, but the young children born since that campaign have not yet been immunized. In other words, the adults can be perfectly confident as far as they themselves are concerned but the children are in danger. Our important duty now is to prevent these children from becoming the victims of polio. We also run the further risk that as a child becomes older, before he comes into contact with polio and is immunized, the chances of serious damage to him are correspondingly greater. It is a fact that small children suffer less serious after-effects than adults. It is therefore all the more necessary that we should not procrastinate in having all the children in South Africa immunized. Immunization is voluntary to-day and that means that before one can immunize a child one must obtain permission from its parents. We know from experience how difficult it is to obtain the permission of some parents, not because they are unwilling to give their permission, but simply because they are slow to act and because they do not think there is any great danger. We now want to make immunization compulsory so that the legal obligation will rest upon parents to ensure that their children are immunized. Our medical advisers deem it highly desirable that we should have the power to make immunization against polio compulsory. It may become necessary for us also to make it compulsory in respect of other diseases at some stage in the future. We have a tremendous problem as far as tuberculosis is concerned. We know that as far as tuberculosis is concerned, 80 per cent immunity can be obtained by using B.C.G. We do not at all exclude the possibility of eventually having a vaccine which will give us complete immunization. It may then perhaps be necessary for us to make use of the opportunity to protect the entire country from this terrible disease. It may be that we may have an epidemic in some part of the country in regard to which immediate action will have to be taken and where immunization will have to be made compulsory.</p>

<p>Section 36 (f) of the present Act gives the Minister the power to make regulations in regard to infectious diseases. Let me read the English text because the other version is in Dutch&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The measures to be taken for preventing the spread of or eradicating cholera, typhoid fever, plague, acute poliomyelitis, tuberculosis or any infectious disease requiring to be dealt with in a special manner.</block>

<p>It is quite possible that we already have this power in terms of the present provision, but there is a difference of opinion in regard to its interpretation. For that reason we feel that it is necessary to make this small amendment.</p>

<p>The second amendment makes provision for vaccine to be supplied free of charge to local authorities. The Government has done so up to the present even though it has not been authorized to do so in terms of the original Act. We therefore want to bring the law into conformity with present-day practice. Clause 3 amends Section 92 of the principal Act. Section 92 of the Act provides that every child must be inoculated against smallpox. The parents then have to submit a doctor&#x2019;s certificate to the Department of Health. One of the following certificates has to be submitted, a certificate that the child has been successfully inoculated, that he is immune, that he is unable to be inoculated or that he has already had smallpox. The Department keeps a register of these certificates. Those certificates are only useful to the Department inasmuch as they enable the Department to supply parents with a copy of a certificate when such an application is made. During the past two years there have been only three applications for copies. If it is borne in mind that we have nine officials who are engaged full-time in the sorting and so forth of all the certificates submitted and that the salary <span class="col_8697-8698" refersTo="page_0597"/>of one official is in the vicinity of R1,500, which is a very low estimate indeed, it will be appreciated that each of those three certificates costs us R9,000. Hon. members will also realize how unnecessary this system is which we have inherited from the past.</p>

<p>The amendments in Clauses 4, 5 and 6 are merely consequential. Section 138 is also amended by Clause 7 of this Bill. Section 138 lays down the procedure that has to be followed by the Government in promulgating regulations. The procedure is as follows: When a regulation affecting a large local authority has to be promulgated that local authority has to be given three months&#x2019; notice to promulgate a similar regulation. If it has not done so within three months, the State may promulgate such a regulation. The Government is given the power to make regulations in the case of small local authorities but then it has to give those smaller authorities three months&#x2019; notice of its intention to do so and ask them for their comments. The Act makes provision for exceptions under important circumstances when it becomes necessary for the Government to promulgate regulations immediately. We simply want to extend that right to include compulsory immunization. The last amendment is an amendment to Section 153 of the Act. Originally the area around Kimberley, as far as Warrenton and Ritchie, fell under the Kimberley Health Board. In 1919 that Health Board implemented all the provisions dealing with health matters except for two&#x2014;the usual sanitary powers and powers in connection with food, the hygienic handling of food. In the course of time that large area of the Kimberley Health Board was divided into four different areas, the Kimberley Municipality, the Warrenton Municipality, the Ritchie Town Council and the remaining portion. The Kimberley Divisional Council was responsible for sanitation and for the hygienic handling of food for the whole area, except for Kimberley City. But the finances of the Kimberley Divisional Council were in such a critical state that they were not able to carry out their functions properly. In 1959 we amended the present Act to transfer the duties in respect of sanitation and food in the Warrenton area to the Warrenton Municipality and those in the Ritchie area to the Ritchie Municipality. Our intention was to transfer the rest, except for Kimberley City, to the Kimberley Health Board. The Bill was drawn up for this purpose but unfortunately a small mistake was made and it appeared that the aforementioned powers were not transferred to the Kimberley Health Board. All that this Bill now seeks to do is to rectify that small mistake.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>We will support this Bill, but it seems a pity that in this country, in this enlightened age, it should still be necessary for legislation to be brought into this House to force people to become immunized against any disease at all. I would have thought that we should have had in the past very efficient educational plans whereby people could be educated and told why immunization is necessary. The safety of not only themselves but also of their offspring should have been emphasized. I feel that this Bill here should be implemented, even at this stage, by educational methods. I think schools should, in their courses in biology and hygiene, go as far as possible to educate people in favour of immunization. The Red Cross and Noodhulpliga services should give attention to this matter as well.</p>

<p>Most of us know that when it comes to refusal for immunization, it usually stems from fear of complications, or because of some religious group&#x2019;s attitude towards medical treatment, and so forth, but I think even in those groups education should play a very important part, and these people should be told how necessary it is for the whole community to be protected against not only the diseases that are listed, in particular polio and diphtheria, but also other diseases. There are other diseases for which I am sure vaccines will soon be found which will help not only to cure the disease, but also to prevent diseases, and in particular I think the time is not far distant that we will be able to immunize people against venereal diseases. The time has come for us to look further afield than the emergency diseases, those which cause epidemics, like polio, smallpox and so on. Now a word or two about the matter that the hon. Minister brought up in relation to immigrants. It has been my feeling for a long time, Sir, that those people coming to our country should not only be vaccinated against smallpox and yellow-fever. I think the time has come that they should produce certifications to the authorities that they and their children had been immunized against polio. I think that is very, very important. We in this country know how rare it is to see a case of yellow-fever in South Africa. If it is necessary for an immigrant, for a traveller to be immunized against yellow-fever because he flies over a fever belt then immunization against poliomyelitis should certainly be made compulsory. If we in South Africa are going to be compelled to be immunized against, poliomyelitis, then the immigrants should bring forth sufficient evidence that they and their children have also been immunized. You might have a difficulty because some of the countries to-day are still not getting sufficient vaccine to immunize their people. I think the Immigration Department that has various offices in the various countries should make sure that facilities are provided for the immigrants to get the vaccine. The question of cost of vaccine to local authorities should not be included in this Act. I don&#x2019;t see any necessity for a law to have to be provided so that the cost of vaccines to local authorities is laid down. I do not know whether I am making myself clear, but when the Minister decides that vaccine has got to be provided to the local authorities for any particular disease, not only those listed in the Act, the Treasury forthwith should make the money available for that, and it should not be a matter of the law of the land, it should be a purely <span class="col_8699-8700" refersTo="page_0598"/>voluntary method of getting money for these emergency periods that we go through.</p>

<p>There is one other point. I want to say to the hon. Minister in regard to immunizing localized groups of people that I do not think it is a satisfactory method of doing things. It can help for an immediate or sudden attack in one particular area in respect of a particular disease, but I think that it should be the object of the Minister to immunize all people in South Africa against all those diseases which we can immunize people against. In particular I was wondering whether it would not be a good idea to start an intensive campaign to immunize the whole of the population against tuberculosis, Blacks as well as Whites, the Coloureds as well as the Asiatics. We know that with all the efforts that the Government is using, with all the money that it is spending on tuberculosis, with all the assistance it is getting from voluntary organizations, the number of cases are rapidly increasing. I think the time has come for the Department of Health to seriously consider whether or not, under this Bill if you have got the other powers to do these things, it would not be possible to immunize the whole population. It is going to take a long time to do it, but I think a start should be made as soon as possible so that we, at least those who want to be immunized against tuberculosis, shall be able to get the vaccine.</p>

<p>There are other matters which I think the hon. Minister ought to point out to the public. One is that the fear of accidents following immunization is grossly exaggerated. Very rarely do we find accidents occurring after immunization. The fear of complications should not be a factor which we should allow people to carry in their minds as a reason for refusing immunization. These are the things that I think we on this side want to bring to the notice of the Minister. There are perhaps one or two small matters which we will bring up in the Committee Stage. But we support this Bill and we hope that the public will realize that it is a Bill that is brought in for their own good.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot let this clause pass unnoticed, particularly because I think the hon. the Minister has, unwittingly, I am sure, misled the House as to its true effect. The Minister confined most of his remarks in his second-reading speech to polio. It is true that polio is fraught with very little danger to a person who is given the vaccine. But there were accidents to begin with. But the powers the hon. Minister is taking by this clause go a great deal further. The clause gives him a free hand, and I am afraid I am a little in disagreement with the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher). There have been accidents with nearly all these immunizations and it is only right that this House should appreciate that fact and should understand that there is a possibility. Lastly, in regard to polio, I say that there I am pleased indeed to think that the hon. Minister is carrying on with this, because here again the presence of live viruses in our midst can undoubtedly cause a terrible epidemic unless he does persist, and indefinitely at that, with his immunization. Lastly I ask him where he is going to get vaccines. It is a simple matter for him to provide vaccines for smallpox and it is equally not very difficult for him to provide vaccine for polio, because there are facilities for the manufacture, although I do not believe that the Polio Foundation could really meet the demand if there were serious outbreaks. But what about the others? Where is he going to get them in a hurry? There are limited facilities in our country for manufacturing vaccines in this country and if we are faced with difficulties of import, and it could happen because not many countries carry large stocks of these substances, because the articles don&#x2019;t keep well, where is the Minister going to get them? Will he not consider under Government auspices providing better facilities for the manufacture of vaccines on a large scale? That is one of the greatest problems that I think his Department should face, and they must face it soon.</p>

<p>Tenth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Pension Laws Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill is the usual omnibus Pensions Bill which is introduced almost every year.</p>

<p>Hon. members have been supplied with a memorandum on the Bill. All the proposals contained in the Bill are embodied in the memorandum and I trust that hon. members, especially those who are particularly interested in pension matters, have perused it carefully. It is not my intention therefore to explain the provisions of the Bill at length. But there are a few matters to which I would like to refer briefly. The first is in connection with concessions to social pensioners.</p>

<p>One of the aims of the Bill is to give effect to the concessions announced by the hon. the Minister of Finance in his Budget Speech in regard to social pensioners, and also to give effect to one of the concessions which I mentioned <span class="col_8701-8702" refersTo="page_0599"/>during the course of the discussion on the Vote of my Department.</p>

<p>Provision is made in Clauses 25, 28, 30 and 32 for the payment of a special allowance to certain social pensioners and grantees who can be regarded as being the less-privileged amongst those pensioners&#x2014;those who have no assets and whose incomes are very small. It has long been felt that something should be done to alleviate the lot of these poorest among the poor because they have only their pensions with which to meet all their needs while others have their own homes or possess other assets or have regular incomes from some source or other.</p>

<p>It has therefore been decided in the case of a White social pensioner or grantee who has no assets and whose incidental income does not exceed R60 per annum, to pay such person a special allowance of R30 per annum. In such cases the maximum amount payable to, for example, a White old-age pensioner will now amount to R324 per annum.</p>

<p>The Clause also makes provision for the payment of proportional special allowances in the case of Coloureds, Indians and Bantu.</p>

<p>As hon. members will remember, during the discussion of the Vote of my Department I announced that we were introducing a simplified system in regard to the administration of the Acts governing social pensions and allowances.</p>

<p>One of the matters to be dealt with in this connection is the collection of overpayments. As the Act reads at present, all cases in which the financial circumstances of the pensioner or grantee improve must be reviewed and the pension or allowance must then be reduced or withdrawn with effect from the 1st of the month following upon the month in which the improvement has taken place. Overpayments resulting from these improved financial circumstances have to be repaid by the persons concerned or, if they are still receiving pensions or allowances, must be deducted from such pensions or allowances.</p>

<p>In many of these cases there is only a slight improvement in the circumstances of the person concerned and he does not give us timeous notice of such improvement. When the facts are brought to light at a later stage, such cases have to be reviewed with retrospective effect. The problems connected with this matter are becoming more and more difficult and in a large number of cases the recovery of such overpayments leads to hardship for the pensioners and grantees concerned, and the expenses involved in the recovery of such overpayments are high.</p>

<p>After careful consideration of the matter it has therefore been decided that in the future such overpayments will only be recovered when, in the opinion of the Department (a) a deliberate fraud has been committed&#x2014;that is to say, when untrue statements have been made by the persons concerned; (b) persons who draw pensions or allowances by way of a power of attorney on behalf of beneficiaries can be held responsible; and (c) an error has been made by the Department.</p>

<p>It has also been decided that when it is deemed necessary to cancel a pension or an allowance with retrospective effect or to reduce such pension or allowance, the cancellation or reduction thereof will take effect from the beginning of the month following upon the month in which the change in the circumstances took place but that the retrospective calculation shall not be for longer than three years; furthermore, that any such retrospective calculation shall be based on the stage at which the calculation is made.</p>

<p>In those cases where it is not found necessary to cancel or reduce the pension or allowance with retrospective effect the cancellation or reduction will take effect from the beginning of the month following the month in which notice of the changed circumstances is received, and Clauses 26 and 31 of the Bill make the necessary provision in this regard.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to Clause 34. When the Government Employees&#x2019; Provident Fund was set up in 1936 by the Government Service Pensions Act, 1936, it was decided that persons employed on State unemployment relief work could not become members of that Fund. Subsidized employees, that is to say, employees employed by State Departments under a labour scheme subsidized by the Department of Labour, were also all excluded from membership of the Fund. The last-mentioned employees consist of persons who because of some disability or other are not able to compete in the open labour market.</p>

<p>That followed from these earlier decisions in regard to subsidized employees that when a Government employee who was a member of the Provident Fund was transferred to a subsidized post, his membership of the Fund has terminated. It became apparent during 1951 that certain labourers in the employ of the Department of Forestry, who were members of the Fund, had been transferred over a number of years to subsidized works in that Department, but that the Department had continued to collect contributions from them. As a result of representations made on behalf of this group of subsidized labourers, the policy that a Government employee should cease to be a member of the Fund on being transferred to a subsidized labour scheme, was reviewed, and it was decided that members of the Provident Fund who were transferred to subsidized works should be permitted to remain members of the Fund.</p>

<p>It has also been decided that subject to parliamentary approval, subsidized employees whose membership of the Fund has already been terminated, shall be permitted with effect from a current date to contribute again to the Fund, and, if they so elect, from the date of which their contributions ceased. Clause 34 makes the necessary provision in this regard.</p>

<p>Although members of the Permanent Force or the South African Police are entitled to <span class="col_8703-8704" refersTo="page_0600"/>compensation in terms of the provisions of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, 1941, when they are injured in the course of the performance of their duty, they are not entitled to any compensation if they are injured or disabled while their services are used in wartime or during a state of emergency in defence of the Republic.</p>

<p>It has accordingly been decided to apply the provisions of the War Pensions Act, 1942 to them while they perform duty in defence of the Republic, that is to say, while they perform military service during wartime or in connection with the fulfillment of the obligations of the Republic arising from any agreement between the Republic and any other country.</p>

<p>The application of the provisions of the War Pensions Act to such members means that not only will they be entitled to compensation in respect of disabilities due to their war service, but also in respect of disabilities aggravated by such service. If they die as a result of such disability, their widows or other dependants will receive the compensation for which the Act makes provision. Clause 36 makes provision in this regard.</p>

<p>This Bill also deals with amendments to the Government Service Pensions Act. In the nature of things the amendments are either of technical or administrative nature. These amendments are being made after consultation with the Public Service Commission and the Treasury, and meet with their approval. But there are a few matters to which I want to refer briefly. In the first place there are the amendments contained in Clause 10 in terms of which higher retirement ages are being introduced for members of the Permanent Force. Full details of the changes which are being made have already been announced by the hon. the Minister of Defence in a Press statement. Details are also contained in the memorandum. In terms of sub-section (2) of the new Section 35 it will be noticed that as far as the serving members of the Force are concerned, the new retirement ages will come into operation progressively. In this connection I just want to mention that whilst the Government is aware of the fact that having regard to present conditions and the fact that people are now able to work for a longer period, South Africa cannot waste her manpower by adhering to the principle of early retirement ages, it does not want to hamper promotion possibilities. The pattern that was created by the raising of the pensionable ages in the Public Service in 1955, namely, to increase pensionable ages by stages, is now also being followed in the case of the Permanent Force. This, together with the fact that the Force is being expanded, will have the effect of giving fair promotion opportunities to everyone within a reasonable space of time. In regard to those persons whose promotions were somewhat delayed, they will benefit in that their pensionable service will be increased in so far as they fall within the higher age groups for retirement purposes.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize that serving members of the Permanent Force will retain the right to retire on pension when they reach the age at which they have the right to retire in terms of the regulation which is in force at the moment. Such members will also have the right, if they give the prescribed period of notice, to retire on pension at any stage after they have reached the afore-mentioned age but before reaching the new pensionable age. In this connection I want to refer to sub-section (3) of the new Section 35 inserted by Clause 10.</p>

<p>The raising of the retirement ages will have the effect that members of the Force will be entitled to increased pensions when they retire in view of the fact that they will have longer periods of pensionable service. According to the actuary, the raising of the retirement age will certainly redound to the benefit of the South African Permanent Force Pension Fund.</p>

<p>In terms of the amendment contained in Clause 2, the pension of a member of a new fund, that is to say, one of three new pension funds established by the Government Service Pensions Act, 1955, will in future be calculated on the whole period of his pensionable service. At the moment, a fraction of a month is not counted for this purpose. The amendment will have the effect that members will receive slightly higher pensions.</p>

<p>Clauses 6, 11 (b) and 15 make provision for the payment of increased benefits, in certain cases, to members of the new fund who are retired on grounds of ill-health caused by circumstances over which they have no control. I may mention that in terms of the provisions of Section 62 of the Act a pension can be paid to a member who is retired for this reason if he has rendered not less than 20 years&#x2019; satisfactory pensionable service. This pension is payable instead of the benefits for which the above mentioned Clause make provision. Accordingly, as in the past, the improved benefits will only be payable if at that stage the member has less than 20 years&#x2019; satisfactory pensionable service and a pension in terms of the provisions of Section 62 of the Act is not paid to him.</p>

<p>Clauses 7 and 16 make provision for the simplification of the method of calculating gratuities which are payable to the dependants of members of the Public Service Pension Fund and the South Africa Police and Prisons Service Pension Fund. The amounts of the gratuities calculated in terms of the new provision will be precisely the same as those calculated in terms of the existing provisions. The amendments contained in these Clauses are therefore of a purely formal nature and do not affect the rights of members or their dependants in this respect.</p>

<p>As hon. members will have realized, these provisions are chiefly as follows. In the first place, they give legislative sanction to the benefits which have already been announced in the Budget Speech in regard to social pensioners. Secondly, they contained provisions in regard to benefits that have already been announced publicly in regard to the retirement age of <span class="col_8705-8706" refersTo="page_0601"/>members of the Permanent Force. Thirdly, they extend the application of the provisions of the War Pensions Act of 1942 to members of the Permanent Force and the Police in wartime as well as in peacetime; and fourthly, amendments are being made to the Government Service Pensions Act to eliminate administrative difficulties and to obtain clearer definitions without in any way affecting the amounts involved. This Bill further prescribes the provisions to be made in the Government Service Pensions Act in regard to Coloured teachers who are transferred from the provinces&#x2014;the provision in regard to retirement ages. The rest of the Clauses are mainly consequential. It is a privilege for me to introduce this Bill and I hope that the House will pass it with the improvements that it contains because of the effect that its provisions will have on our pensioners.</p>

<p>I cannot let this occasion pass without making my protest, as I did before, at the late arrival of this Bill. It is a complicated Bill, three-quarters of which is administrative and which I am sure must have been known to the Department six months ago, but it is introduced at this late stage and we have hardly had time to go through the Bill, nor have we had an opportunity of hearing protests from outside bodies who are affected by the Bill. I understand that the Department administers the pensions of about 125,000 people, almost all of whom are in one way or another affected by this Bill, and yet we on this side are expected to scrutinize the Bill carefully, not to find any chink in it, but just to do our plain duty and check what is being done. We were faced with this Bill only two or three days ago. I feel that it is not fair to the pensioners whom we are trying, just as much as the Department, to help and to look after. It is time that this was changed so that simple administrative procedures can be arrived at during an earlier stage of the Session.</p>

<p>In other respects we agree with this Bill and intend to support it. As far as we had an opportunity to scrutinize it. we believe that it is a good Bill. I think much of its liberalization is due to the fact that there are now machines which can do the calculations, so that unfortunate pensioners cannot be deprived of their pensions for some 29 days in the month because that complicated the calculations. However, that is by the way. Another very important principle that all of us on this side of the House are delighted to see in the Bill is Clause 9, which allows people to join a pension fund in the Government service if they join it after the age of 45. That is the first time that this country has publicly appreciated that men past 40 can still do good work. It is therefore much to be welcomed and it is an example set by the Government which I hope will be followed by commerce and industry and by all employers. It will help to solve the problems of the man over 40 who is looking for work. This is a most important and very welcome amendment.</p>

<p>In Clause 10 (2) (c) (i) there is provision made which we feel we will have to discuss and possibly amend in the Committee Stage. We want to change the age from 57 years to 58 years. The men affected by this Clause, compared with their colleagues, get only two years of extra time and we think they should receive three years, like the others. But this will be discussed more fully in the Committee Stage. However, I wanted to warn the Minister that this amendment will be moved. On the whole, as I say, this Bill is welcomed. I cannot say that it could not be better because we have not had time to study it. This same old story comes up every year. Here we are faced with a long Bill affecting a large number of humble people, most of them voiceless and unrepresented, and we are unable to carry out our work in a conscientious manner, because otherwise the Bill will be held up and perhaps a greater injustice will be done to these pensioners.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. I have a suggestion to make to the Minister, referring specially in general terms to Clauses 6, 7, 11, 15 and 34. The Minister has told us that we are concerned here chiefly with administrative matters. I think the time has come for us to simplify the administration when we are dealing with State pensions for the Permanent Force, the Police, the Prisons Department and other public servants. We should not have a pension fund for them. There should be no fund into which people pay in 4 per cent and the Government pays in 4 per cent, and then the fund administered according to certain rules. The hon. the Minister should consider a system whereby a man is told: If you serve for 20 years, this will be your pension.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>From the Consolidated Revenue Fund. There is no pension fund for Members of Parliament, and in many countries of the world they do not have this complicated system. I am not going to weary the House with detailed criticism, but I want to make that suggestion to the Minister, that he should appoint a commission, in consultation with the Public Service Commission, to investigate the whole system of pensions. Why should a soldier have to go about with records of his service showing how much he paid into the pension fund? That should be unnecessary. He should be told that after 20 years&#x2019; service he will get his pension. Funds might get bankrupt. That is all I have to say. I think I may be just on the brink of over-stepping the rules, Sir. and therefore I will leave it at that.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation of the reception accorded this Bill, a Bill that makes provision for benefits, eliminates difficulties and improves the position of our pensioners. I have already stated clearly the nature and the scope of this legislation. We will of course have an opportunity <span class="col_8707-8708" refersTo="page_0602"/>at the Committee Stage to discuss the particular clauses themselves. I just want to reply briefly to what the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) said. The hon. member says that this Bill has been introduced at a very late stage of the Session. I want to say quite frankly that I would have liked it to have been introduced sooner. The hon. member says that three-quarters of what is contained in the Bill has been known to the Department for some time, but I want to tell the hon. member that the difficulty is that one cannot introduce three-quarters of an omnibus Bill because one will then be forced to introduce two omnibus Bills. We have to wait until we can introduce it as a whole, and that makes the position difficult. The hon. member will understand that there are certain amendments which flow from the concessions and improvements announced in the Budget speech. Those amendments are known not only to the officials of the Department at an early stage, but they are also known to the public as soon as the Budget is discussed. But from the nature of things one has to hold back legislation of this nature because we also have to have negotiations with other Departments which have to discuss with us the amendments affecting them, and certain amendments flow from those discussions, amendments which have also to be included. That process of discussion takes some time. That is also one of the reasons why the Bill has been delayed to this extent. But I want to give the hon. member the assurance that in future I shall ask all the Departments to submit any amendments that they want to make as soon as possible so that we can introduce this measure at an earlier stage in the Session.</p>

<p>As far as the remarks of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) are concerned, I want to say that we are already introducing a simplified system. I do not know whether the hon. member was here when I made my second-reading speech. I made a statement about a simplified system that was welcomed on all sides of the House. We are making new arrangements to simplify the burdensome machinery of the Department of Pensions, This will be to the advantage of the people with whom we have to deal. I also said that we were applying a simplified system. By means of this simplified system we hope to eliminate many of the difficulties which up to the present have bogged down the machinery of the Department. He suggested &#x2026;</p>
