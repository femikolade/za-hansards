<question by="#henwood" to="#minister_or_economic_affairs">

<num>*I.</num>

<from>Capt. HENWOOD</from>

<p>asked the Minister or Economic Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any instances of orders placed in the Philippines by South African firms being refused because of the Philippine Government&#x2019;s ban on exports to the Republic of South Africa have come to his notice; if so,</li>

<li>(2) whether he has taken any steps (a) to investigate this matter, (b) to counteract such action and (c) to improve trade relations with the Philippines; if so. what steps; and</li>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_education" to="#henwood">

<from>The MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</from>

<p>(for the Minister of Economic Affairs):</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) No; except by way of Press report.</li>

<li>(2) and (3) In view of the fact that neither the particular businessman whose views are stated in the newspaper report to which I have referred nor any of the industries mentioned therein has deemed it necessary to inform me or my Department of the position, I must draw the conclusion that his views of the importance of this matter are either grossly exaggerated or have no substance.</li>

</ol>

<p>I repeat what I stated before in this House that the Government is not prepared to negotiate with any foreign Government or party responsible for boycott movements against the Republic, in an attempt to pursuade them to abandon such activities, and short of this I wish to reiterate that my Department is more than willing to consider any reasonable requests from South African importers or exporters for assistance in locating or developing import or export outlets.</p>

<p>I do not consider that any further amplification of the Government&#x2019;s attitude on this matter can be in the public interest or can serve any useful purpose.</p>

Later a complaint was lodged with the Attorney-General and further investigations are being conducted by the South African Police into the alleged assault.</p>

<heading>Question:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) What steps has his Department taken to combat the spread of bilharzia;</li>

<li>(2) whether facilities for the free treatment of (a) White, (b) Coloured, (c) Asiatic and (d) Bantu persons suffering from this disease are provided by his Department; and</li>

<li>(3) whether he intends to make bilharzia a notifiable disease; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#fisher">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li><p>(1) Notwithstanding extensive research in the field of bilharzia control no proved method of protecting the individual against the disease has been developed except by means of steps designed to break the cycle between the human being and the snail host. For this purpose steps must be taken to prevent the pollution of rivers and other sources of water supply with bilharzia parasites and in this connection health education is required.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that bilharzia control is consistently carried out by all responsible bodies the Department of Health established a National Committee consisting of representatives of various interested Government Departments, provincial administrations and the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research to act as the co-ordinating and advisory body. Further, the following steps are being taken:</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) the attention of the public is constantly being drawn to the necessary measures for preventing the contamination of water supplies;</li>

<li>(ii) the Department of Health acting in consultation with other Government Departments takes steps towards planning the most effective measures <span class="col_5789_5790" refersTo="page_0227"/>of controlling the disease, for example on irrigation schemes where contamination often occurs;</li>

<li>(iii) the field personnel of the Department carries out routine investigations and surveys in areas where the disease occurs with a view to determining the incidence and the local conditions;</li>

<li>(iv) in addition the C.S.I.R. undertakes research projects on behalf of the Department. At Nelspruit research is being done in connection with bilharzia snails and parasites. In certain areas on the North Coast of Natal surveys are carried out in order to ascertain the incidence of the disease while a unit of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research&#x2019;s bilharzia research section at Potchefstroom is investigating the distribution and ecology of freshwater snails.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) Yes, district surgeons and departmental health centres render free treatment to indigents of all races suffering from bilharzia.</li>

<li>(3) No, because the areas where bilharzia occurs are already known and the notification of individual cases is not considered necessary in the combating of the disease.</li>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are being asked to give final approval today to one of the most important pieces of legislation that has ever been before this House. I believe it is important because it will not only affect the lives and future economic and political development of a large section of the Bantu community, a section as large as the entire White population of the Republic at present, but also because of the pattern which it is laying down and which in due course will affect the lives of four times as many Bantu, close on 12,000,000 Bantu, in the Republic. Despite that, it is before us to-day in its final form without there ever having been proper consultation with any really representative institution of even that part of <span class="col_5791_5792" refersTo="page_0228"/>the Bantu people who will be most intimately affected by it. I say this advisedly because the Territorial Authority which is to be abolished and superseded by this Bill was in no sense representative of the many millions of Bantu permanently resident in our urban areas who are going to be affected by the provisions of this Bill, and also because even an official Government publication boasted that that Territorial Authority would be able to do its work unhindered by pressure of popular opinion because its members for the most part did not owe their position to election by the people. Therefore I say there has been no proper consultation even with any instrument adequately representative of the people immediately to be affected by this Bill. The fundamental provisions of the Bill provide for the implementation of the first stage of a policy which differs so widely from that of this side of the House that we have not thought it possible to improve it by amendments except for one amendment to make clear the position of the Republican Government, and the amendment which I propose to move to-day and that is that this Bill be read this day six months. Sir, we feel that no amendments could bring the provisions of this Bill into line with our policy because the whole underlying principle is unacceptable to us and in our opinion the Bill holds within it the seeds of disaster for this country. That is not a matter which can be canvassed at this stage: the principle of the Bill has been accepted and the rule is that I can deal only with the contents of the Bill. When one deals with the contents of this Bill, one finds that there are three main objections to it in principle. I think the first is that even a superficial study of the Bill makes it clear that no matter what the stated intentions in the preamble or the limited objectives outlined by the Minister, this is merely interim legislation. It is merely interim legislation forming but one, even it is a major, rung on a ladder descending into a darkness which is not yet penetrable by us at this stage. Secondly, inherent in this Bill are the seeds of friction between the Republic and the self-governing areas which it purports to envisage, seeds of friction which can easily lead to their germination and budding into real hostility between the Republic and the embryo emergent states. Even the provisions for resolving conflicts between the Republic and the to-be-formed Transkeian Government are unhealty or non-existent in this Bill. I think the third main reason is that this Bill itself is an incomplete piece of work which reflects the conflict in the minds of the members of the Government themselves. They know that it sets them on a certain road; they have a shrewd idea what the end of that road is going to be. They do not want the end of that road to be too easily discernible from a study of the provisions of this Bill, and in the result they have failed in both their objectives.</p>

<p>Let us look at the three groups of objections which I have outlined and let us deal with them in turn. I think throughout the discussions on this Bill attention has been directed to provisions unnecessary for the implementation for the principle of the Bill, provisions unnecessary to carry out the main principle of this Bill which must have and will have a separatist tendency and a separatist influence upon the people to whom they apply. It is not necessary for the granting of self-government, for the creation of a self-governing area, to provide for a separate flag for that area. That is merely an intention; it is merely there in order to advance separatist tendencies, to encourage those people to develop ideas of a nationality and a state of their own. It is not necessary in order to implement this Bill to provide for a separate anthem for these people, as is laid down in this Bill. It is quite clear what the objective is. It is a separatist objective. The objective is to create amongst these people the idea that they are a separate nation and that they are developing a separate state. The oath which they take as members of this Legislative Assembly in the Transkei provides for no oath of allegiance to the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>My hon. friend over there says that our laws provide that.

Why does that oath differ from the oath in our Provincial Council and even from the oath applied to the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa? It is to promote separatism, because that is the underlying principle in the Bill, the one that is not stated in so many words either in the preamble or in any clause.</p>

<p>Sir, I am so glad my hon. friend has fallen for that; from his remarks during the Committee Stage I thought he would! Where does the preamble make any provision for sovereign independence which is the ultimate and concealed objective of this Bill, which is the reason why these provisions are in the Bill? Why is there provision for a separate citizenship? You do not have to make provisions of that kind in a province; you do not even have to have it in South West Africa. Why is there provision for a separate citizenship? Sir, it is to create a feeling amongst these people that they are on the road to sovereign independence.</p>

<p>Sir, there are other clauses in this Bill which are separatist in tendency. This legislation provides that the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei can legislate on certain matters repugnant to laws of the Republican Parliament. It gives them power outside their own area to legislate extra-territorially for their citizens. Has any province got that power?</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Nor must we forget, as was admitted by the Minister himself, that this is a dynamic constitution, a constitution which is intended to grow in the sense that more and more powers can and will be conferred upon the Legislative Assembly by the State President with the approval of and by resolution of this House and the Other Place, save, of course, in respect of certain matters laid down under Clause 39. I accept that there is that limitation, but it is quite clear that this is not a Bill intended to promote a common loyalty or a common allegiance in the Republic amongst all those living within its boundaries. This is legislation designed to promote a separate allegiance to embryo states envisaged in the preamble and the ultimate dismemberment of the Republic. Sir, I know that subsequent legislation will be necessary before the ultimate objective is achieved. You cannot grant sovereign independence under this legislation. I do not want to be misunderstood in that regard, but I know that that ultimate step will follow as sure as night follows day once this legislation is accepted and enforced unless the Government is halted in its descent to what I believe to be disaster.</p>

<p>Sir, that is the first main objection to this Bill that its provisions are separatist in intention. We come then to those provisions in the Bill which have caused me to raise the second main objection, namely that inherent in this Bill are the seeds of friction between the Republic and this self-governing area and any other self-governing area based on the provisions of this Bill. Sir, perhaps I should go further and say that the provisions of this Bill provide not only opportunities but the machinery for conflict between the Government to be established in the Transkei and the Republic. Can you imagine anything more likely to cause conflict than Clause 2 of this Bill which, while defining in general terms the areas over which the Transkei Government is to have authority, is qualified by Clause 3 which makes it clear not only that these boundaries are not final but that it is expected that they will be altered in the future by the State President with the approval of this House and of the Other Place and of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei? Sir, nothing in our history has caused more trouble than boundary questions between Bantu and European, and yet here we are accepting a Bill in which those boundaries are not finalized, and already there have been demands from leading spokesmen for the addition of further districts and already there seem to be misunderstandings as to what has been promised by spokesmen of this Government in the past and the indications which are given in the Bill at the present time. But one thing is absolutely certain and that is that these demands will grow; the areas in respect of which they are made will grow, and they hold the seeds of trouble for the future between the Republic and the Transkei itself.</p>

<p>Under this Bill there is also going to be trouble about finance. In terms of Clause 52 (1) (d) a sum of money is to be appropriated annually from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Republic for the due performance of the services and duties assigned to the Government of the Transkei. How big is that sum going to be? Who is going to decide it? Obviously it is going to be decided by the Parliament of the Republic, but will it be commensurate with the needs of the territory as determined by their own Legislative Assembly? And when those needs are extravagent, or when even in the view of the Legislative Assembly they are necessary, however unreasonable they may be, and the funds are not made available by the Republic, will friction not arise? Will there not be recriminations? Are they not going to say to their people. &#x201C;we would like to do these things for you but we cannot get the money from the Republic&#x201D;? Will they not tell their people that the Government of the Transkei is unable to act in the best interests of its people because the Government of the Republic will not make the necessary funds available to it?</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Sir. Clause 52 (1) (d) provides for the voting of a sum of money each year. Who determines that sum? It is not stated in the Bill. I have difficulty in proving that it is a bad clause without trying to apply that clause to a condition which can and must arise. I appreciate your ruling, Sir.</p>

<p>We have a further trouble. We find in Clause 40 that the State President of the Republic has to assent to all legislation which is passed by the Transkeian Legislative Assembly. It is provided in the clause that if he refuses his assent the matter has to be referred back to the Legislative Assembly; it has to lie there for seven days with any further advice which he may give, but the Bill does not say what <span class="col_5795_5796" refersTo="page_0230"/>happens if they pass it again and he refuses his assent again. Sir, can you have a provision more likely to cause conflict? I do not have to talk about matters outside the Bill to make it clear to you, Sir, and eveyone in this House, that there is a provision which is going to cause conflict between the President of the Republic representing the Republic and that Legislative Assembly. It is a bad provision; it must be; it is a bad Bill. It is reminiscent of the conflicts that you had in Great Britain between the Stuart Kings and their Parliament and one knows what troubles and difficulties that caused. Sir, the hon. the Minister smiles. He knows that at least one king lost his head over those difficulties. I hope no president will lose his head as a result of this, either figuratively or literally. Let me give another example. In terms of Clause 20 the Legislative Assembly may petition the State President for the dismissal of the Transkeian Cabinet. When he receives that petition he is going to be advised by the Cabinet of the Republic. Supposing he refuses to dismiss them, is there not going to be conflict between the State President and the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei which has lost confidence in that Cabinet and is that not going to lead to ill-feeling between the Transkei and the Government of the Republic?</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says that I am just raising hares. Can he tell me how you are going to resolve that difficulty? There is no provision for it in this Bill. It is perfectly clear that the job has not been properly done. Opportunities for conflict are left which should have been resolved if this piece of legislation had been properly sorted out.</p>

<p>I am sure there are many other examples of a technical nature which I could give, but I think they all pale into insignificance when compared with a major provision which could undoubtedly cause conflict and that is the provision that a large number of Bantu permanently resident in the Republic are going to be given political rights for the election of members of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei. That is provided in this Bill. They have no interest in the Transkei. Many of them do not know it at all, but Transkeian political parties are going to compete with each other for their support and they can only compete with each other for their support by promising to do their best to improve their position while they are living in the Republic, and once again the result is going to be conflict between the Government of the Republic and the Government of the Transkei. When I say that this is bad legislation I say it because inevitably these clauses must result in conflict. Already we have had an ominous rumble in this respect, and what bad feelings are not going to be engendered! Under this legislation the Government of the Republic retains control over matters concerning the Unemployment Insurance Act, the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act and the Industrial Conciliation Act, but no control is kept over the formation of trade unions by Bantu in the Transkei. That power is now apparently abrogated. When it is abrogated, what is the effect going to be on border industries when those trade unions are created in the Transkei as they surely will be, and when we realize that we are dependent upon them for the vast mass of our labour force? I think that even without attempting to be exhaustive I have advanced sufficient reasons for this Bill to be voted down at the third reading.</p>

<p>But there is another group of provisions which would also justify its rejection because they reveal how incomplete a piece of work this Bill is and they reflect the conflict in the minds of members of the Government in respect of this matter. Sir, where in the world is there a constitution which provides that if a provision of the constitution itself or any other law is found to be ambiguous or to give rise to administrative difficulty, or is in conflict with any other law, the State President may by proclamation determine &#x201C;the extent to which and the manner in which such other laws shall apply in the Transkei, and in any manner which he may think it necessary to remove the ambiguity, the conflict or the difficulty&#x201D;, to quote the wording of the clause itself. Sir, is that not a tacit admission that the job is only half-done, that it is foreseen that there will be conflicts, difficulties and ambiguities and that the buck is being passed to the State President to finish off what the Minister and his Department have left half-done, to clear up the mess that they have created?</p>

<p>Nowhere in this Bill is specific provision made for the 600-odd White traders living in the Transkei in the Native areas. They are not dealt with as individual people. The Bill makes no provision for them, but it does do something; it hands them over in certain respects to the mercies of the Transkeian Government. There is no provision for compensation. Similarly. what is the position in respect of the Coloured people in the Transkei? In certain respects they too will fall under the Transkeian Government once this Bill is carried out. Sir, I know that I cannot discuss what is left out of the Bill; I can only discuss what is in the Bill, and what is in the Bill is that provision is made for these people to be subject, as are all others, to the laws of the Transkeian Government in certain respects, and already there have been indications as to how they are going to be treated. I need say no more. I think here we have another example of the incompleteness of the Bill. Let me say something else. Sir. Throughout this Bill there is a remarkable approach to the White people of the Transkei in White areas. It provides them with their own courts. It does not affect their political rights in the Republic, but it leaves no doubt in anyone&#x2019;s mind that it regards the continued presence of the White communities in the White areas of the Transkei as being of only a temporary nature. When you <span class="col_5797_5798" refersTo="page_0231"/>look at the provisions of the Bill, they seem to be regarded only as a necessary evil to be tolerated for the time being. That is why you have Clause 60. Clause 60 provides for the extinction by means of a sort of creeping paralysis of those communities where it lays down that land within any municipal, village management board or local board or municipal area may be zoned for occupation or ownership by Bantu persons and that areas so reserved may thereafter from time to time be extended by proclamation in the <i>Gazette.</i> Nowhere is there a provision for the opposite sort of development, i.e. the zoning of Black areas for White occupation, but I do see a provision for the removal of restrictions on the occupation of land in these areas, which will remove any protection which the Europeans have at the present time for safeguarding their rights. What a mess there is going to be when a village or a municipal area is progressively divided up in this way! What is going to happen about the public buildings and the municipal debts and loans? Sir, it leaves no doubt that in the Government&#x2019;s view these White communities are expendable. How horrid, Sir, are the remarks of the hon. the Prime Minister now in this context about the White man in Africa when he replied to the &#x201C;winds of change&#x201D; speech by Mr. Macmillan!</p>

<p>There is another provision which is going to lead to difficulty. Clause 39 (d) controls the use in the Reserves of the Republican police. Items 6 and 7 of the Schedule provide for their use in the Transkei. But both the Transkeian Government and the Republican Government are responsible for law and order. In times of peace there will probably be no conflict. What happens in emergencies? Where is provision made to resolve this? I know that the Republican police in the Transkei are under the control of the Minister of Justice in the Transkei only to the extent that they are handed over by the Minister in charge of the South African police. Both the Transkeian Government and the Republican Government are responsible for the maintenance of law and order and the Transkeian Government will have their own police. What is going to happen then? Clause 39 provides that there are certain powers which the Transkeian Government cannot have. It limits those powers. It seeks to limit them because while in these earlier clauses, Clauses 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, I think provision is made for a flag, an anthem, citizenship and matters of that kind, here it tries to prevent the development of independence; it tries to prevent the development of further incidents of independence, and it excludes them under Clause 39 from grants by the State President, with the approval of both Houses of Parliament. Clause 39 can apparently only be altered by a legislative enactment of the Parliament of the Republic. But, Sir, is that going to be effective in preventing this area being recognized as a non-self-governing area by the United Nations Organization? And are we really going to be able to control the movements of people under this provision? The Transkeian Government has the control of entry of Transkeian citizens into the Transkei, but who has control of their exit? Does it still fall under the Republican Government? And if they have gone back and the Transkeian Government wants to let them in and the Republican Government does not, where do we stand? Then in the Schedule there is provision in Item 14 for the taking over by the Transkeian Government of certain of the social responsibilities which at present are the responsibility of the Republican Government; there is provision for the taking over of the social responsibilities with a provision that there shall be paid to the Transkeian Government a sum of money to be determined under Clause 52, a sum to be approved by the Minister of Finance of the Republic after consultation with the Controller and Auditor-General and corresponding to the expenditure by the Government of the Republic in respect of any matter the administration of which is in accordance with this Act transferred to the Government of the Transkei during the financial year preceding the date of the transfer itself. Sir, where is the provision for expansion? No provision is made in this clause; it is limiting it here. Very largely up to now the Republican Government has controlled the economic development in the Transkei. One of the big problems with which every metropolitan power has been faced is to bring peace and to bring health and to bring economic advancement to the people. Here, Sir, we hand that over very largely, and we hand it over without the means of financing inside the Transkei, but we control legislation which has regard to how factories are to be licensed and the provisions of the Factories Act in that area. In other words, to an extent here too we are abrogating our responsibilities, with no assistance to enable that economic difficulty to be overcome.</p>

<p>I believe that the passing of this Bill does not mean the end of South Africa as we know it, but I believe that if the Government is permitted to continue on this course it is going to become known in history as the beginning of the end. I can only hope that, for the sake of the country, the discussions on this Bill during its passing through Parliament and its implementation when it becomes law will help to open the eyes of the nation and will cause the people to see the disaster into which we are being led.</p>

I have no doubt, Sir, it will cause them to look for alternative solutions to this problem of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised three objections to this Bill at this third-reading stage. His first objection was that it promoted the idea of separatism. The second was that it sowed the seeds of disunity in South Africa and the third was that this legislation was incomplete. In connection with the first objection let me say that he was quite right; it is the purpose of this Bill to give form to a policy of separate development. We are not flinching from that for one moment; that is its true purpose. Since the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said that there can be self-government without the need for separate development, we want to tell him that that sort of self-government is merely a hollow shell in the view of this side of the House because the purpose of self-government is separate development.</p>

<p>He also spoke about the disunity that may arise. I am not at all perturbed about that. These are possibilities that one can argue about, but the hon. member is simply raising bogies. I do not even want to deal with them because during the Committee Stage we debated each clause with the Opposition and we pointed out to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition the error of his ways.</p>

<p>I come now to his third objection&#x2014;that this is an incomplete piece of legislation. Mr. Chairman, from the nature of things we are laying the foundation for a new development. From the nature of things it must still be incomplete at this stage. We are only in the initial stages and since we are dealing with an initial stage in this development this measure must necessarily be rather incomplete. But as development takes place all these shortcomings will be rectified. I do not want to discuss the speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition any longer. I have a few other matters that I want to raise.</p>

<p>I just want to say that I am very sorry that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not appreciate the more important meaning of this legislation. Instead of doing that he ferreted out certain minor provisions contained in the various clauses. He completely overlooked the main idea of the creation of a new political set-up. In terms of this measure a new political set-up is being created in South Africa. Something new in constitutional law is being created in the Republic of South Africa. This measure introduces ideas and legal concepts which are completely new. I want to emphasize a few of these new ideas and legal concepts which are being introduced into our constitutional law.</p>

<p>Firstly, the most important point is that for the first time we are introducing into our constitutional law the idea of a self-governing territory. This idea of a self-governing territory is not a geographical concept because a geographical area known as the Transkei has already been known in our country for more than a century. Nothing is being added to it and nothing is being taken away from it. In contrast with this geographical concept, Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasize the new constitutional concept of a self-governing territory that is being created in this measure. Nowhere in our existing constitutional law, that is to say, either in our Republican Constitution particularly or in our political development in the past, has there been a constitutional concept such as a &#x201C;self-governing territory&#x201D;. The distinctive characteristic of this constitutional concept lies in the fact that it is part of a larger whole and is governed separately from the rest of that larger whole. It will still be an integral part of the Government of South Africa but it will be governed separately. There are other examples in the constitutional history of South Africa which are apparently analogous but they only appear to be analogous. The old Cape Colony gained self-government in 1852 but it was never an integral part of Great Britain. It was never governed as an integral part of Great Britain and subject to its laws. Similarly the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, after the granting of self-government in 1950, were never an integral part of Great Britain as a state. They did fall under the sovereignty and under the domination of Great Britain but they were never governed as part of Great Britain. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is inclined to put on a par, the Transkei as a self-governing territory with the self-governing British colonies in South Africa. The Transkei cannot be put on a par with them. The legal concept &#x201C;territory&#x201D; implies that the territory still remains an integral part of the Republic but under a system of government which differs from the system of government for the rest of the Republic.</p>

<p>The idea that South Africa is supposedly being fragmented in this new constitutional set-up, Mr. Chairman, is actually so much nonsense. Constitutionally the Transkei is still part of South Africa and there is no question at all of secession under international law. That is also my reply to those who have misgivings in connection with Article 73 of the United Nations Charter that the Transkei will now be regarded as a non-self-governing territory. I do not deny that constitutionally separation between the Transkei and the rest of the Republic is possible at some future date but what I emphasize is that this measure does not make provision for it, nor will I deny that the possibility of constitutional secession in the future is facilitated by this measure, because <span class="col_5801_5802" refersTo="page_0233"/>that is the intention of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development, because we do not claim more for ourselves than we are prepared to give the Bantu. All that I want to emphasize is that this measure does not make provision for that now. Hence the introduction of this new constitutional concept of a self-governing territory. This new constitutional concept of a self-governing territory has a second very important aspect&#x2014;that of self-government. Indeed, the main purpose of this whole Bill is to determine the content and the scope of this concept of self-management or self-government. It is to be regretted that while some members of the Opposition try to belittle the granting of self-government to the Transkei and read far less into the measure than it contains, other members of the same Opposition argue that the granting of self-government for the Transkei envisages complete sovereignty and read far more into this measure than it contains. It simply depends upon whom they are trying to impress. When the Opposition seek to impress the outside world, they read practically nothing into this measure; then they say that this self-government is only a bluff; that it is &#x201C;something to fob them off with&#x201D;; then self-government is a trivial thing, something that is meaningless. But when the Opposition want to impress the White voters of South Africa then this same self-government is exaggerated to mean something important and dangerous; it will allegedly become a completely independent State at the southern tip of Africa which is going to conspire with the Afro-Asian countries against South Africa. Neither of these two viewpoints is correct. This measure does give self-government to the Bantu but it is self-government within the four corners of this measure itself. It is neither complete independent sovereignty on the one hand nor complete subjugation on the other hand. In this connection I want to emphasize that the Transkei is not a province. In terms of the meaning that it has in our existing constitutional law, a province is an area which does not exist separately at all from the rest of South Africa as far as any form of government is concerned. It has no form of self-government at all. A province has certain powers that it exercises in terms of the Constitution but it can only exercise those powers as far as the Central Parliament allows it to exercise them. If it passes any ordinance which is in conflict with the wishes of Parliament then that ordinance is null and void. In contrast to this, when the Transkei exercises the powers given to it by this legislation, it exercises those rights in respect of the Transkei as though it were this Parliament exercising those rights. As far as those particular powers are concerned the Transkei is supreme. Those laws cannot be tested by any of the laws of South Africa to see whether they are <i>ultra vires.</i> They can only be tested in court by the constitution that we are discussing here. The Transkei will not be able to pass legislation dealing with the matters over which it has control if those laws are in conflict with the laws of this Parliament. To that extent it can be said that the Transkei is receiving some measure of sovereignty and that to some extent therefore a measure of sovereignty devolves upon the Transkei. Those who believe that the concept of sovereignty is indivisible will of course not subscribe to this view but I want to point out that the modern constitutional concept is that sovereignty is divisible, as in the case of federal states, and as is the case as far as our own Constitution is concerned, where Parliament, as usually constituted, is sovereign in regard to certain matters and where in regard to other matters Parliament is only sovereign at a Joint Sitting. Sovereignty is divisible. A measure of sovereignty is being given to the Transkei in that certain powers are being given to the Transkei but that measure of sovereignty only stems from the sovereignty of this Parliament. I must point out that there is a sort of residual sovereignty which always rests with this Parliament because this Parliament can repeal and amend the Constitution of the Transkei. That power remains the supreme power of this Parliament.</p>

<p>If this Parliament is not satisfied with the laws of the Transkei, it can repeal this legislation that we are now discussing and it can then repeal those laws. I want to emphasize that this idea of sovereignty is a dangerous thing to play with at this stage and is dangerous to discuss. When one talks about sovereignty one must accept the fact that sovereignty is divisible; that sovereignty is being given to the Transkei in connection with certain matters and that in regard to other matters it still rests with us.</p>

<p>There is also another constitutional concept that is being introduced here and that is the concept of citizenship. I want to emphasize that the citizenship concept is a constitutional concept in contrast to an international law concept. Just as there is a citizenship in respect of a city council or a provincial council or a governing body in terms of which the citizen enjoys certain civic rights and certain civil duties are imposed upon him, so a citizenship is being created in respect of the new governing body of the Transkei in terms of which the citizens of the Transkei will have certain civic rights and duties in respect of that Territory. That is what we call &#x201C;citizenship&#x201D;, It is a constitutional concept in contrast to &#x201C;nationality&#x201D; which is an international law concept. Because the Transkei has not yet become an international entity, there can be no question of a nationality or citizenship of the Transkei in the external sense in contrast to citizenship in the internal sense. I want to emphasize that this citizenship is not a dual citizenship. Once again, I want to stress the idea of the divisibility of the concept of citizenship. Citizenship has two facets, the one an internal concept where the citizen has certain rights and duties within the state, like the franchise or the payment of taxes. The other facet is the external facet where he is given protection abroad, in other states, as a <span class="col_5803_5804" refersTo="page_0234"/>citizen of this state. The citizen can of course prejudice his external citizenship of his state in the outside world because he owes the duties of citizenship to his state in the external sense too. We Whites will no longer share the internal facet of citizenship with the Xhosa. They will have their own internal citizenship but they will still share the external citizenship with us. It is not a question of dual citizenship; they will only share citizenship with us in the sense of external citizenship but all civic rights which are internal rights will be rights that they will no longer share with us. Neither is this citizenship an inferior citizenship. I want to emphasize this because the internal citizenship of the Xhosa gives them all the rights, all the freedom and all the duties in the Transkei that the White man has in the White area. The Xhosa does not become a second-rate citizen. That is important to remember. This gives the lie once and for all to the reprehensible contention on the part of the Opposition that the Bantu will be a second-rate citizen and that we want to make him a second-rate citizen. In the Transkei he is just as much a free citizen as the White man is in the White areas. Just as little as the White man will be a citizen of the Transkei so little will the Xhosa be a citizen of the White Republic. I hope therefore that this will put an end once and for all to the sordid accusation that separate development creates second-rate citizens.</p>

<p>I also want to say something about the Whites in the Transkei in this connection&#x2014;I mean the Whites who do not live in the White spot towns but who are under the jurisdiction of the Transkeian Territorial Authority. Just as the Xhosa is protected as a worker in the White area, so will the economic rights of the Whites be protected in the Transkei. The existing legislation which will be just as valid after the passing of this measure, makes provision for that. It is true that the Transkei will be able to change those laws but no country wants to break down its economic assets, so why should the Transkei want to do so? Just as little as the Bantu can claim political rights in the White area just so little will the White man be able to do so in the Transkei. As far as his internal citizenship is concerned, the Xhosa is a foreigner in the White area. In the same way, as far as his internal citizenship is concerned, the White man will be a foreigner in the Transkei. That is the long and the short of this measure.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a final political concept contained in this measure and that is the democracy that is ingrained in the customs and practices of the Xhosa and which have been adapted to the Western concept of democracy. This is also something new on the continent of Africa and in this I believe lies the safety and the stability of the form of government of the Transkei, in contrast to the contention of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that it will be unstable and that it will give rise to hostility. A fact that makes this concept really interesting and something new is that the democratic tribal system is being adapted to and coupled with the democratic system of representation of the West. I think it is fitting to emphasize the fact that the tribal system of the Bantu is not tyrannical, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tried to suggest to us this morning. The chief says and does nothing without the advice and approval of his advisers and the advisers in their turn do nothing drastic without a gathering of the tribe. I recently read the book &#x201C;Germania of Tacitus&#x201D; again and there I find that the Dux of the old Germanic leadership-in-council was supported by a national assembly. What makes this interesting, Mr. Speaker, is that the English incorporated that idea into their constitutional system. &#x201C;The Knights of the Shires&#x201D; were summoned to the first Parliament. Together with them were summoned the representatives of the &#x201C;cities&#x201D;. This institution that we are creating in the Transkei to-day has the same pattern; the traditional leaders of the people, &#x201C;The Knights of the Shires,&#x201D; are being summoned to Parliament along with the representatives of the people. It is a pity that the Opposition speak so sneeringly of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei because of the fact that the chiefs will serve with the representatives. The constitutional history of Britain and the West shows that it makes for stability to build upon something that is characteristic of that nation. It is a significant fact that in France, in Germany and in other countries where the Romans forced their system on those nations, there was instability for several centuries. But in Great Britain where they did not force their system upon the nation but where the tribe in the area was used as the foundation on which to build, a stable government was formed, and that is precisely what we want to do with this legislation. I predict that what is being established in this legislation will lead to a thoroughly stable form of government and will also be a further example of true democracy to the rest of Africa just as the British system has become an example of democracy to the modern world.</p>

<p>The Transkeian Constitution establishes self-government in accordance with the policy of separate development. As is provided in the preamble, it makes provision for the gradual development of self-governing Bantu National Units in the traditional Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>Everyone will therefore be struck by the fact that this legislation has two characteristics. Firstly it builds up and gives shape to what is characteristic of the Xhosa and, secondly, it grafts on to their system what is best in Western civilization. A prototype is being created here for other National Units in South Africa. I want to express the hope and confidence that this constitution will not only be the pride of the Xhosa nation but will also be a source of inspiration to the other National Units of South Africa. In conclusion I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation. I know with what <span class="col_5805_5806" refersTo="page_0235"/>tireless zeal, with what personal sacrifice, with what enthusiasm and with what idealism he has been imbued in this task. He encouraged and inspired us, his fellow-workers, in a similar way by his actions in this regard. It will always remain a monument to him in the history of his country and he will be praised by the Xhosa for many years to come as their father and as their national founder. Our hearty congratulations to Minister Daan Nel.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am afraid the speech of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has only helped to increase the confusion which has existed hitherto as to the Government&#x2019;s real aim, and the overall impression made by his speech is that with all this talk about divisible sovereignty he is clearly moving in the direction of race federation. I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that all of us in South Africa will have to arrive at that point eventually.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that I propose to adhere to the rules which are applicable to a third-reading debate. In the course of the second-reading debate, a few personal charges were made against me and I hope you will allow me to reply to them briefly and succinctly. The hon. the Minister who is in charge of the Bill accused me of uttering an untruth when I stated that this Bill was intimately concerned with the large-scale removal of Bantu from the Western Cape. He adopted the attitude that I had not only uttered an untruth but that I should have known that I was sinning against the facts. It seems to me that the hon. the Minister did not follow me clearly because what I did was no more than to quote from a well-considered statement by the hon. Minister of Finance, a statement which the Minister of Finance made on 31 October 1962, in the course of a New Year message to the Cape members of his party. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A start has been made with the implementation of the five-year plan for the Bantu homelands. At the same time it is an essential sub-division of the plan to entice the Bantu out of the Western Cape.</block>

<p>Note well, Mr. Speaker, that the development of the Bantu areas is not a part but an &#x201C;essential sub-division&#x201D; of the plan to eliminate the Bantu from the Western Cape. This was a considered and written statement by the Minister of Finance, and I had every right to accept the hon. the Minister of Finance as an honest exponent of the Government&#x2019;s policy. If anybody sinned against the facts in this respect, therefore, it was not I but the second most important man in the Cabinet, and I hope that in future the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration, if he wishes to attack anybody, will launch his attack upon the right person. And perhaps it will be a fine thing if the idea occurs to him to apologize to me.</p>

<p>The second charge which has been made against me is that in respect of this Bill I have adopted an attitude which is in conflict with the basic attitude which I have always adopted in respect of the development of the Bantu areas. Nothing is further from the truth. The fact of the matter is simply that in the National Party there was always a group of members who were loosely described as the Sabra group. I was a member of that group. The views of this group were most accurately reflected in the Tomlinson Report, and the group diligently applied itself to the task of bringing about the large-scale economic, social and constitutional development of the Bantu areas as satisfactory homes for the Bantu living there at present and for the Bantu who would like to go there. But it goes without saying that that development had to take place along definite lines and form part of a definite plan, and I can testify here that I adopted the attitude throughout, without ever deviating from it, that if these areas were to attract the Bantu, if they were really to become viable units, then we should allow the large-scale introduction of private capital and skill in those areas, in the interests of the Bantu themselves, so as to promote this development. I adopted the attitude throughout that we should recognize the fact that outside of these areas there is an established class of Bantu, particularly in our urban areas, and that the development of the Bantu areas should not be used as an excuse for denying privileges to those who are not settled in the Bantu area. Furthermore, I consistently adopted the attitude that as long as this Parliament had actual control over the destinies of citizens who were Bantu those Bantu, in the interest of all of us, should be given some form of representation in this Parliament so as to be able to give effective expression here to their feelings and their wants. In other words, I consistently regarded the development of the Bantu areas not as a process of dismemberment but as a federalization process, and I was by no means the only person in the National Party who held these views and who advocated this.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I can quote numerous speeches over a long period of years from which it is clear that this federalization process was the underlying idea of what I advocated, and possibly the hon. member and the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. S. F. Steyn) will be interested in what I moved a few years ago in this House, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The implementation of what was suggested by the Tomlinson Commission, and an imaginative, large-scale and rapid economic and political development of the Bantu areas&#x2026; with the object of creating full opportunities and rights there for the majority of the Bantu in South Africa, with the ultimate object of a confederation of South African States. (Hansard 1961, Vol 107.)</block>

<p><span class="col_5807_5808" refersTo="page_0236"/>I can furnish abundant proof that I viewed the development of the Bantu areas not as a process of dismemberment but as a federalization process. And I say frankly that it is dishonest on the part of any member to quote from Hansard only portions of speeches in which I advocated the political development of the Bantu areas and then to close the book whenever he comes to those portions in which I dealt with the framework in which the development of the Bantu areas was to take place. I just want to deal with one aspect of the Bill before us as far as its form and its contents are concerned. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated the case of this side fully and clearly, and I want to confine myself therefore to one aspect. As I see the position, the key to the contents of this whole Bill is to be found in the first line of the preamble which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas the policy of separate development envisages the gradual development of self-governing Bantu National Units in the traditional Bantu homelands, be it therefore enacted&#x2026;</block>

<p>The key to the whole Bill lies in this first line. Mr. Speaker, we know that in this country and overseas Government speakers, particularly the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he appears before UNO, consistently use the expression &#x201C;separate development&#x201D; as being synonymous with &#x201C;apartheid&#x201D;. What is actually stated here therefore is, &#x201C;whereas the policy of apartheid envisages &#x2026; be it, therefore enacted&#x2026;&#x201D; This Bill therefore is not just an outcome of the policy of apartheid but it is linked up inseparably with the dogma of compulsory apartheid. That is why so many of the provisions of this Bill are diametrically opposed to what normally happens elsewhere in respect of any other area or state to which a higher political status is given. Provision is made in this Bill for a chequered &#x201C;citizenship&#x201D;, We have a pattern here of White spots and of Black spots, and of Black spots and White spots, to such an extent that because of this dogma of apartheid we cannot even designate a capital for this new young state.</p>

<p>No wonder the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) now comes along with the new argument again that the Transkei must not be regarded as a geographic political conception. What is envisaged in this Bill is not co-operation on the part of the Whites and the Coloureds in the development of this young state; it does not envisage the co-operation of people who grew up there, people who gave economic growth and life to this area; what is envisaged is that they will gradually but definitely be driven out of this area. All the responsible leaders in the Transkei adopt the attitude that it is imperative that the White man should continue to remain in the Transkei. But the dogma set out in the preamble means that they will have to clear out of this area.</p>

<p>Certainly. Judged by its contents this Bill is not a constitutional measure but an ideological measure, and I must say to the hon. Minister in all honesty that I feel that by linking up the development of these areas by law with the dogma of apartheid he is not only making a psychological mistake but also a fundamental mistake. It is a psychological mistake because, whatever we may think of the policy of apartheid, in the civilized world and amongst the vast majority of people in South Africa it has become something repugnant which will never be accepted because it is based on the accident of colour. I say that it is a fundamental mistake because it is going to lead to an endless series of problems which will cause the Transkei to become a headache and an embarrassment rather than a pleasure. I say to the hon. the Minister that if he had developed this area economically and socially and constitutionally for its own sake and on the basis of its historical growth, and if he had then given the Transkei a political personality within South Africa as an area in which the Bantu will be in the majority but without derogating from the interests and the co-operation of the rest of the population living there, then he would have rendered a service to South Africa and he would have been able to get the support and the goodwill of all the population groups in this country. For all we know he might have got the support of the Opposition, because the Opposition has consistently stated, as it stated clearly again in its election manifesto at the recent election, &#x201C;We believe in the large-scale and rapid economic, social and constitutional development of the Bantu areas,&#x201D; but naturally within the federal framework for which this party stands. But the basis which is being created here to-day does not take into account the facts of the South African situation.</p>

<p>This Bill liberally bestows all those things which may give a semblance of power. It liberally bestows &#x201C;self-government&#x201D;, a &#x201C;Cabinet&#x201D;, a &#x201C;Prime Minister&#x201D;, a &#x201C;flag&#x201D;, a &#x201C;national anthem and citizenship&#x201D;, which are all things which give a semblance of power. But when it comes to things which confer real power, the Bill is parsimonious. Such a situation, I believe, must necessarily give rise to political frustration and conflict. We know what happens when one gives a person the impression that he has a certain amount of power and then finds out later on, when he wants to use that power, that in many respects he has nothing but a fine-sounding title without real power. In this case the position will be no different. Take the fact, for example, that <span class="col_5809_5810" refersTo="page_0237"/>this &#x201C;self-governing state&#x201D; will be dependent for its means very largely on the mercy of this Parliament. As surely as we are sitting here, we are going to find that whenever political leaders in the Transkei are unable to solve any local problem they will blame this White Parliament for an unwillingness to provide the necessary funds. No better scapegoat can be provided for the party politician than the Government is creating here, because it is creating a Cabinet here and a state with all the frills of sovereignty, but underneath all these symbols it leaves a complete economic vacuum.</p>

<p>It is for all these reasons that the Whites in this country are hesitant to accept this Bill, to say the least of it, and I do not have the slightest doubt that those Bantu who do support it, do so because within the political framework which exists to-day they have no other choice. I am sorry that the Government has linked up this Bill and the development of the Transkei with a petty policy such as apartheid, because apartheid &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the reason why I said that a speech such as that should be suitably framed was because it was the first time in the history of this House that at the third-reading stage an hon. member made a speech equal to what is to be found in the current issue of <i>Besem,</i> which I hope hon. members have read. I have never heard as fine a piece of student humour along the same lines as the articles appearing in the present issue of <i>Besem</i> as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave us to-day in regard to this Bill&#x2014;full of humour, full of fun but as far away from reality, as far away from the Bill as it could possibly be. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is a farmer and I hope that he will permit me to say that I will address him in that vein because then he and his colleagues will better understand the line of reasoning that he has always taken, particularly in regard to this Bill and the effects of this Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will not permit me to say why that speech should be framed but there is another speech that should be framed although for completely different reasons&#x2014;for its substance &#x2014;and that was the speech for the hon. member for Heilbron. Where the one hon. member put his case concisely, the other did just the opposite. Any person who wants to know the detailed effects of this Bill will find it in the speech of the hon. member for Heilbron. If he does so he will find a clear and concise answer to the many questions asked by hon. members opposite and also to those asked by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). Those two speeches should be suitably framed for that reason and because the speech of the hon. member for Heilbron replied concisely to all the questions that have been asked during the course of the debate.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The point that the hon. member for Heilbron did not raise in the way that I want to raise it was that we will now have a pattern which will prevent any country in the world accusing South Africa of applying any form of racial discrimination in South Africa resulting in the humiliation of any of the races resident in South Africa. That is why I want to point out&#x2014;and this also flowed from the speech of the hon. member for Heilbron&#x2014;that we are now showing the world for the first time that not one single right that the White man enjoys in his area is being taken away from the Xhosas in their area. For the first time the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development has succeeded in piloting legislation through the House which makes it clear that the recriminations that have heaped so much hostility and so much suspicion on our heads, undeserved hostility, will not be removed for good because there is not one right that all of us here enjoy in the White area which the Xhosa will not have in the Xhosa homeland. And because this is such an important milestone I think that our deliberations at this stage of the Bill should receive a fair measure of support and we ask hon. members to discuss this legislation in such a way that the world will be shown very clearly what it intends doing. This can only be done if at this stage we have the opportunity of explaining its proper meaning and effect. That is why I ask hon. members to discuss this legislation in this way.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition once again raised his three important objections and, Mr. Chairman, I hope that you will permit me to discuss them briefly. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that this was only &#x201C;interim&#x201D; legislation. But I do not believe that it is interim legislation. I think that it is really the start of everything. It is just as obvious that legislation will have to follow at a later stage when other problems arise and that our own Constitution will have to be amended from time to time. But this does not detract at all from the fact that it is a Constitution on which we can and will build properly for the future. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s second objection was that in this Bill lie &#x201C;the seeds of friction&#x201D;. It is here precisely that we differ from him because we are laying the foundation here by means of which we will eliminate all points of friction between the races. And in the light of this fact all the objections of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition fall away. He cannot tell us that because a cow produces one calf a year and a hen lays 300 eggs a year the cow is far weaker than the hen. He must appreciate the foundation that is being laid here. We are building something here by means of which we will be able to eliminate points of friction in the industrial sphere, in the political sphere and in the social sphere. The Xhosas will now not be able to tell the White man, &#x201C;I want the same rights that you have&#x201D;, because we will then be able to say, &#x201C;You have the same rights in your area&#x201D;. Points of friction are being eliminated. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was therefore completely unrealistic in this second objection, just as unrealistic as it would be to compare a cow and a hen with one another as far as production potential is concerned. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that this was &#x201C;an incomplete piece of work&#x201D;. Sir, which of the hon. members opposite have seen a perfect law? Most of the legislation that is passed by this House each year is amending legislation. Do they think then that this legislation can never ever be amended? Of course it is going to be amended just as any law is amended. I think that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was being very unrealistic indeed in his three main objections. He had every opportunity to oppose this Bill at the second-reading stage and at the Committee Stage when he could have raised these three objections and I am very sorry that he has again raised these three objections because they were adequately replied to by this side. That is why I want to say that the criticism of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition this morning, his remarks in regard to this Bill, were completely unnecessary and completely unrealistic. It appears to me that you, Mr. Speaker, will not permit us to deal properly with all the matters that he raised and we do not want to clash with the Chair. But I want to conclude by associating myself with what the hon. member for Heilbron said. I also want to congratulate the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. There are many of us who agree with him. There is one man who will stand head and shoulders above us all in his faith in and enthusiasm for this measure. His enthusiasm can prove to be one of the most important factors in carrying through this legislation and enabling it to form a pattern in the eyes of the world. Because of this Bill the outside world will now understand South Africa properly for the first time and for the first time the outside world will understand the principles and the policy of the National Party.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I shall, with due respect, Sir, dispose of this &#x201C;farm-yard&#x201D; speech of the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) in the course of the few remarks I wish to make, and I hope dispose of it satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The Bill before us embraces a very serious principle but is limited as far as its scope, its content, is concerned. There are certain outstanding provisions, however, to which we must and have to confine ourselves at this stage. The contents of this contentious Bill are in reality and in the main the same as those of the second Bill which was originally submitted to us.</p>

<p>The contents of this Bill envisages in the first place a self-governing state with clearly defined powers, rights, authority, obligations <span class="col_5813_5814" refersTo="page_0239"/>and activities, in respect of which it will be very difficult, if not impossible, for this Government, or any other Government in future, to interfere or to interfere with the specific matters and powers given to the Transkei or even to veto their legislation.</p>

<p>The Bill also contains the germs of further growth and development to the highest logical status which follows constitutionally upon self-government, namely, autonomy, and as the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has also said, sovereignty and self-government in the broader sense of the word, and nationhood. It is not only the inherent content of the Bill, yet the ultimate autonomous status of the area has been recognized with acclamation time and again by my hon. friends opposite and again this morning. The underlying inherent object is, therefore, what my hon. friends have already admitted, namely, autonomy.</p>

<p>The symbols of a nation&#x2019;s sovereignty, its freedom, the emblem of its ultimate national unity&#x2014;and I am using the words in the preamble&#x2014;are emphasized in this Bill and play an important role in its composition and its objectives. It has also been readily admitted by the hon. the Minister himself and by hon. members opposite that the flag, the national anthem, &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; and its own citizenship&#x2014;in this regard I shall deal with the hon. member for Heilbron for a few minutes at a later stage&#x2014;the Transkei&#x2019;s own language and its own Cabinet, we admit, are symbols of the nationhood of a nation and of its autonomy. The hon. member for Heilbron said that it was not a question of dual citizenship that we were conferring upon the Transkeian citizens. He says the position is that they have their own citizenship in their own area but he must admit that at the same time they also retain their citizenship rights within the Republic. The citizens of the Republic are, however, not in such a favourable position because we shall only have citizenship in our own area, not in the Transkei. We are therefore not in the same favourable position in which we were. In comparison we find ourselves in a less favourable position than in the days when we enjoyed dual citizenship in the Commonwealth. I am only referring to that in passing, Sir.</p>

<p>Pre-eminently the symbol of a nation&#x2019;s pride, its independence and its autonomy, its nationhood, its political sovereignty, is its national flag, as is its national anthem and its language and these constitute the strongest outward symbol of its independence. We all admit that. Although we are only talking about self-governing at this stage, therefore&#x2014; we are not talking here about autonomy&#x2014;the entire concept of the Bill is ultimately to determine the autonomy of the area. The hon. member for Heilbron said moreover that the idea of sovereignty was the underlying factor and principle. This Bill does not mention that but he is quite right in saying that it forms the basis for that ultimate autonomy. We are already giving the Transkei those symbols which I have just mentioned, the symbols of &#x201C;independence&#x201D;, of its &#x201C;national unity&#x201D; and nationhood. My hon. friends opposite say that is the natural course of development which a ward of the Republic of South Africa must undergo and is entitled to&#x2014;and here I am using the words of the hon. member for Krugersdorp who said that the Bantu of the Transkei were our wards and that they should eventually get their independence. That was always the understanding. But my hon. friends know that I have always denied that and regarded it as wrong; although I do not intend going over all that again.</p>

<p>Whatever the position may be, this Bill, in its present form, remains a great danger to our country and nation and to all its national groups within and without the Transkei because it holds out the definite and undisputable prospect to the area which is now getting self-government of a Bantu national unit&#x2014;and here I am using the words in the preamble&#x2014; and that in the heart of the Republic of South Africa! My hon. friend says this is a new constitutional concept. I shall return to that at a later stage but the fact remains that here in the heart of the Republic of South Africa we are now establishing a self-governing area which we admit will be independent within a number of years. This Bill is establishing an area which cuts us off from the sea along our eastern border. It is not necessary to go further into the adverse effects which may flow from that, nor will you allow me to do so, Mr. Speaker. It is an area which borders on to another state in the west, Basutoland which will also become independent one of these days if the British Government continues with its present policy. The southern boundary of the area is the Kei River which the Bantu do not acknowledge.</p>

<p>According to Clause 3 these boundaries can be extended and I am also referring to that. I am talking under Clauses 2 and 3. I am dealing with the boundaries as laid down to-day in terms of Clause 2 and then their possible extension in terms of Clause 3. For that reason, Sir, with due respect, I want to return to what I was saying namely, that in terms of Clause 3 the Bantu will be dissatisfied one of these days because they are already claiming the Fish River as the boundary of the Xhosa area. Also as far as its northern boundary is concerned, where it borders on Natal, we know that Matanzima has already asked that it should ultimately become the territory of the Xhosa of the Transkei. The logical conclusion which must flow from the establishment of this area, therefore, is the possibility of agreements with enemies along our eastern border.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Then I wish to reply to the argument advanced by the hon. members for Heilbron and Krugersdorp in connection with the clashes which may possibly occur. It is not only a question of there being a possibility of clashes, eventually, with the Republic of South Africa but there is also a strong possibility of internal clashes because this Government regards this area as a political unit in which the various groups or tribes within the same territorial area are treated as a unit and the Government regard them as such in this Bill. Sir, that cannot work, it will not work and the hon. the Minister ought to know it. He knows that as a result of the fact that this idea of units is accepted in this Bill it can easily give rise to fragmentation, to tribal fights, to dissension and clashes within the territory of the Transkei.</p>

<p>What is the most important in this Bill and what is most dangerous is the fact that the dangerous repercussions which may flow from the false philosophy which is propounded in this Bill, namely a state within a state, is not taken into account at all. I now wish to react to what the hon. member for Heilbron has said when he referred to the establishment of a state within a state. The hon. member was quite correct, of course, when he said that that was a new constitutional concept in this Bill. It is something foreign in the history of the world that a state within a state can ever be a success. This Government, however, introduces this philosophy by way of this legislation and they ought to know that this new so-called constitutional idea does not only clash with history but with reality. It is an historical monstrosity and cannot succeed and will not succeed.</p>

<p>The question arises, of course, why this is being done. Mr. Speaker, you will not allow me to say why it is being done, but it is very clear why it is being done. This legislation can furthermore not succeed because it carries within it certain underlying ideologies which are foreign to the cultural structure of the Bantu. My hon. friend said it would succeed because it was based on the cultural structure of the Bantu. I deny that. Since when is a flag part of the cultural structure of the Bantu? Since when is a national anthem part of the cultural structure of the Bantu? Since where are Ministers or the franchise part of the cultural background of the Bantu?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say that that song was not based on the cultural structure of the Bantu; I said that the idea of a national anthem was not based on it. That is my point, and it is there where the germ of the difficulty lies and why it will not and cannot succeed. The flag, the national anthem, as well as the oath which they have to take, are foreign to them. All this embraces things which are completely foreign to the Bantu and they ignore his past. It must give rise to internal trouble. I also maintain that the self-government which we are giving them with the promise that they can shortly expect to attain their independence can only lead to clashes between them and us&#x2014;a repetition of the clashes between the Whites and the Bantu of the past.</p>

<p>I and this side of the House do not see any reason why the subjects of South Africa should have this Bill, people who have always been the subjects and wards of South Africa and whom we have led to the level of civilization which they have attained to-day. I admit that it is not a high level but we did our duty. It remains the policy of the White man to lead them to the civilization and the religion of the White man. Even the Minister will admit that this legislation does not take sufficiently into account the fact that the Bantu have not yet reached that level of development and civilization to realize what this legislation means or even to understand it. It is for that reason, and because we want to maintain South Africa in the form in which our fore <span class="col_5817_5818" refersTo="page_0241"/>fathers left it to us, that we shall vote against this legislation.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>The Opposition have opposed this Bill up to this stage. In giving his reasons for doing so the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) did not even try to base his arguments on the historical background but he concentrated more on the fact that this Bill does not take into account the traditions and the culture of the Bantu. I want to say immediately that to my mind this Bill &#x2014;and in this lies its strength and not its weakness&#x2014;brings about the harmonious combination of what is good in the traditions of the Bantu and what is best in Western civilization and democracy. We have taken from the background and traditions of the Bantu his system of chiefs, the system of paramount chiefs and indunas, his love for his own land &#x2014;all these fine things that form his background&#x2014;and with them we have combined the Western system of democracy in which these people are given the franchise and where the chiefs are combined with the elected members of the people in order to exercise authority jointly. Here we have a combination of two concepts which are peculiar to the two peoples sharing South Africa at the moment. As the guardian of the Black man the White man considers it his duty to make his influence felt and to pass this on to the Bantu. That is the first point that I want to make. The criticism of the Opposition in this regard will be that we are doing neither the one thing nor the other, but I contend that the failure of the so-called Black states to the north is due to the fact that they did not take into account the traditional customs and practices of the Bantu but that Western democracy was forced upon those Bantu immediately. Because of that fact we did not have a democratic system there but a one-party system which was worse than a dictatorship. But here we have a situation where the traditional tribal chief retains his authority. We are combining this with democracy and we are leaving it to the future to develop in whatever direction it likes, under supervision. I do not want to reply any further to what was said by the hon. member for Hillbrow. I do not want to talk about the internal conflicts and tribal clashes within the Transkei. What reason does he have for assuming that if this sy stem is not set up there, those tribal fights will not take place? That therefore is no argument. It was also argued that attacks were being made upon us from abroad but that does not form part of the Bill and I shall not pursue the matter therefore.</p>

<p>But I want to go further and say this about the United Party. What we are doing in this Bill, with the exception of one single fact and that is that this Bill creates the possibility of eventual self-government for the Bantu, is exactly the same as was envisaged in the policy of the United Party as set out by its Leader, General Smuts, in 1947. I just want to quote a few extracts from what he said and compare what he said with this Bill. I quote here from the <i>Monitor</i> of 16 May 1947&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Huge development in Native policy.</block>

<p>The first point was the establishment of a completely Black legislative body in that area with no Whites in a legislative capacity. General Smuts spoke about the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council and he said&#x2014;,</p>

<p>It is to become a purely African body. It can be given a measure of executive responsibility and will become more directly responsible for the government and administration of the Native reserves, and in fact of the whole Native population in the Union.</p>

<p>In other words, not only for the Black man there, but for the Black man throughout the country. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the Prime Minister&#x2019;s intention to make this purely Native Council responsible for its own administration by Native officials with its own Executive Committee.</block>

<p>We are now calling them Ministers. In other words, they were to be given executive powers, just as is the case in terms of this Bill. No details were given as to what their executive powers were to be, but those details are given in this legislation. Furthermore, the Xhosa in the Transkei were to be linked up with the Bantu in the White areas, and that connection is retained in this Bill. General Smuts put it in this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Not only the rural Natives or the Natives in the reserves will be so governed and administered by this council, but there will also be a link-up with the urban Natives in the White territory.</block>

<p>In 1947 General Smuts had the same link in mind. I want to add that the world has changed to a very great extent since 1947 as far as the emergence of the Black man is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I was simply replying to the question. This Bill makes provision for the development of a Bantu homeland with all its possibilities. I see this Bill as being the start of certain things. In the first place it gives the Black man certain things and it gives the White man in South Africa certain things and it gives South Africa as a whole certain things and it gives the outside world certain things. To the Black man in the Transkei&#x2014;and we are not ashamed or afraid of it&#x2014;it gives a flag which will by a symbol of his own nationhood and his eventual freedom. We do not flinch back from the possibility that that may be the ultimate outcome. It gives him his national anthem which once again will be a symbol of his own nationhood. It gives him citizenship, at this stage a twofold citizenship which may develop into a single citizenship. It gives him a tradition; it gives him a pride in his own nation. We have now come to the beginning of the emancipation of the Black man and I want to use this example to illustrate my point. In a household where children are born and where they grow up we find that at a certain age the child starts to do his own reasoning and wants to start putting his own viewpoint. At that stage it is to the advantage of the child if he is allowed to go his own way, but it is also to the advantage of the parents. I shall say more about this in a moment when I deal with the role that the White man has to play. We have now come to the beginning of the emancipation of the Black man. He has reached the stage where he wants to leave home, where he wants to make up his own mind and wants to go his own way in life. If we deprive him of this, the same thing will happen to him that happens to a child who is kept at home too long; he rebels, and he becomes a &#x201C;ducktail&#x201D; if he is not permitted to enjoy his freedoms once he is mature enough to do so. We have now reached the stage where the Black man is mature and where he can be emancipated and stand on his own feet. This is the start of a process of development for the Black man and it is for this reason that this measure is a mixed Bill. I say this deliberately because while it still contains restrictions it does confer certain freedoms; because it contains part of the law of the White man and part of the traditions of the Black man. The whole measure is a combination of the two concepts because it is the start of a process that will develop gradually and that is why one cannot emphasize only one particular aspect of it. This Bill gives the Black man the start of a worthwhile future, a safe future in which his human dignity will be recognized, in which he will be able to put his point of view to the outside world in respect of many matters because he will no longer be suppressed and because the outside world will no longer look upon him as a subordinate individual. His dignity will be recognized in all respects. I say that this is the beginning of a process of development for him. The period of this process of development will be determined over the years.</p>

<p>This Bill also gives the White man certain things. In the first instance it gives the White man relief in respect of his obligation towards the Black man, and this holds a very great benefit. To use the analogy which I used a moment ago, the father will no longer be responsible for that child in every respect. He is starting to work for himself; he is going to earn his own money for the first time; he is going to buy his own cigarettes and he is going to stand on his own feet. It gives the parent a measure of relief therefore. The White man in South Africa is now allowing the first of the Black states to go its own way. The first child is now leaving home and the White man, the guardian and father of this family, is prepared to look to the future which lies ahead of him. That is the first advantage contained in this Bill&#x2014;the fact that the child will now be given his freedom. In the second place, this measure also safeguards the position of the White man for the future. The Opposition continually accuse us of being a frightened party. Whereas they emphasize the dangers over and over again, I want to emphasize the safeguards contained in this Bill because this is the only basis on which we can have future security. This Bill makes it possible for the Black state to develop alongside the White state. It creates a clearly demarcated area in which he can enjoy his freedom and that is why this Bill has the automatic effect of safeguarding the position of both the Black man and the White man because there will no longer be points of friction but co-existence. In the third place this Bill gives the White man a safe future in his own area. It leads to greater Europeanization of White South Africa, if I may use such a term, because it gives the Black man here amongst us a link with his own homeland. This Bill very clearly sets out the policy that the Black man here in the White area will not be regarded as a member of this community; he will have no rights here; he will be linked up with his homeland. He will therefore retain his traditional links with his homeland and that is why I say that this Bill will lead to greater Europeanization of White South Africa. The Bill also gives South Africa as a whole certain privileges and advantages. In the first instance, this Bill makes it clear beyond any doubt that the positive side of separate development is just as strong and even stronger than the so-called negative side. I deny that there is a negative side. This is important because the world is still bringing pressure to bear upon us and looks down on us because of our attitude towards the Black man. The world has adopted the attitude&#x2014;and still believes&#x2014;that our legislative measures are oppressive and only oppressive. This measure produces positive proof that separate development also makes it possible for the Black man to develop fully, and the advantage that South Africa and the outside world will derive from this measure is that in the light of this Bill we <span class="col_5821_5822" refersTo="page_0243"/>will no longer be suspected of being oppressors by thinking people overseas. There is more and more evidence already, judging by the information that we receive, that people overseas see this Bill as a basis, as an anchor, which now enables them to realize what South Africa&#x2019;s problem is, and to see how we are solving it, and they are willing to give us a chance. This Bill will mean far more to us internationally than all the things that have been done in the past in this connection because it affords positive proof of the fact that we are not dealing here with oppressive measures; that there is no negative side to our separate development policy but a very strong positive side.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to detain the House long. I want to conclude. It is difficult to stay within the rules in a third-reading debate. I want to conclude by saying that as it stands here this Bill is only the start of a process of development but it is and remains the only basis on which we will be able to co-operate and co-exist here in the future. We have now reached the stage&#x2014;and this Bill proves it&#x2014;where we as Whites and the non-White inhabitants of the geographical area of the Republic of South Africa, the territory stretching from the Limpopo down to Cape Point, have found a basis on which we can agree as to how we are going to inhabit this country in the future&#x2014;who will be master and who will be able to exercise authority in certain areas and not in others. This Bill creates the same rights for the Black man in his area as the White man claims for himself in his own area, and that is the only basis on which it can work. I welcome this Bill and eventually, once these measures have succeeded, hon. members on the other side will also welcome the fact that we have taken this step. They will then realize that this was one of the greatest days in our history; and that in taking this step we solved the age-old struggle between Black and White in South Africa, not by force of arms but by purely on the basis of reason and on constitutional lines; that here we found a basis for peaceful co-existence instead of continually undermining each other or trying to gain the upper hand over each other. We welcome this Bill in that light.</p>

<p>I want to reply very briefly to a few points made by the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder). Firstly I want to tell him that he is quite wrong when he thinks that he can in any way make tribalism compatible with a modern industrial economy. The two things are completely incompatible and if there is one thing that this Bill which we are considering to-day cannot do it is to try to reconcile the aims of tribalism with the aims of a modern economy. If the reserves are to be developed at all in order to support the people who live there let alone the people who are to return there then quite clearly it is on the basis of a modern economy that this has to be done. This is something which was very clearly brought out by the Tomlinson Commission Report on which this Bill is partly meant to be based. But the hon. member is quite wrong, as any social anthropologist will tell him. There are vast differences between the demands of a modem economy with its competitive spirit, with its need for individual initiative, and a tribal structure which in fact is based on exactly the opposite characteristics&#x2014;on a non-competitive nature, on a subordination of the individual to the group and a domination of social by kinship relationships. These are elementary facts which are known to any social anthropologist and therefore the hon. member is wrong in one of his major premises. The hon. member made another inaccurate statement, Sir. I will not go into this in detail because you did not allow him to continue to follow along those lines but I must correct one statement that he made in that he assumed that the plan which was offered by General Smuts in 1947 for a reconstituted Natives&#x2019; Representative Council with greater powers, which is eagerly claimed also by the Opposition as being the basis of its race federation plan, could in any way have been more successful than its predecessor. I say this because the Africans at that time firmly rejected the 1947 new Natives&#x2019; Representative Council, with its reforms, by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In our view what is required is a policy which will give the African people a sense of security in the land of their birth, a policy which is flexible and can be readily adapted to changing conditions and varying circumstances; in short, a policy that recognizes that Africans are citizens of this country and not things apart.</block>

<p>They went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">General Smuts&#x2019; proposals do not go to the root of the matter in disputes between the Council and the Government. The main submission of the Council has been and continues to be that the conditions of modern African life demand a reorientation of the whole of our Native policy and not a mere tinkering with the framework of existing Native policy.</block>

<p>That is as far as I wish to go but the hon. member did raise this as a basis on which this Bill is formed, and hon. members on this side proudly acclaimed it as the basis of their race federation plan.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir, I am coming back to the Bill immediately. As far as I am concerned this Bill has only one encouraging aspect and that is really a philosophical aspect rather than anything else. Its contents to me reflect an awareness on the Government&#x2019;s side that the <i>status quo,</i> that is to say, retaining all political domination in the hands of the Whites indefinitely, is an impossible thing in South Africa to-day. It epitomizes at last <span class="col_5823_5824" refersTo="page_0244"/>a recognition that there can be no ethical justification for for ever denying the political aspirations of the Africans, and this is something, because it represents a change in the philosophy of the Nationalist Party. It reflects a complete change from the old policy of wit &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; which used to be so proudly owned and bruited abroad by hon. members on the other side. Inasmuch therefore that this Bill sets up a council with some traces of the elective system in it and gives some very limited powers to the African people, it does at least reflect a change in the thinking of the Government. It also gives the hope that when this fails, as it surely will fail, to prove to be any compensation to Africans for deprivation of rights throughout South Africa, that one will not have to start all over again io try to persuade hon. members opposite, their children and maybe even their grandchildren to make the necessary concessions.</p>

<p>I am trying to give the philosophical reasons for the rejection of the Contents of this Bill and I shall now come to the contents. The Bill is based, of course, on the report of the Tomlinson Commission and particularly, interestingly enough, on that part of the report which exceeded the terms of reference of the commission. The commission took it upon itself to decide the broad lines of general policy for South Africa, rejected integration, the middle way, and plumped for what it called separation. I think however much we may disagree about this Bill there is one thing in regard to which both sides of the House are probably agreed and that is surprise that it should have come in its present form as soon as it has come. I think that is a surprise both to that side and certainly to this side of the House, because although in 1959, with the creation of the Territorial Authority, it was announced that this was to be the forerunner of eventual political autonomy and the Government told us in its White Paper, in a good deal of flowery language, that the creative withdrawal &#x2014;whatever that might mean&#x2014;of the European guardian, would result in ultimate self-government, I do not think that anybody ever believed that it would come quite as soon as it has come.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I had stated that I thought it had come as a surprise to members on both sides of the House that this Bill should have come as soon &#x2019;as it did. Although all of us knew about the so-called &#x201C;creative withdrawal&#x201D; of the White guardian, to use the term used in the original White Paper of 1959, I think nobody expected his Bill, which is the legislative translation of this somewhat flowery phrase used in the White Paper, to come before the House as soon as it has done. The reason, of course, is the one which was mentioned by the hon. member for Randfontein when he spoke earlier and that is that the Government hopes thereby to be able in some way to assuage the criticism which was coming from abroad about the negative side of apartheid. This Bill attempts to represent a positive side to the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid. As I will show later, I do not think that this is succeeding very well. The fact that the Government believes that the time has come to replace the Transkeian Territorial Authority by this Transkeian Assembly would, I think, be a surprise to anybody who did not know the pressures behind the Government to get a move on with presenting the positive side of apartheid. I for one cannot see how by any stretch of the imagination one can claim that the Territorial Authority has been a success, to such an extent that the creative withdrawal of the European guardian can take place and be replaced by so-called self-government. Territorial Authorities have led to strife, corruption and disorder in the Transkei. They have resulted in Proclamation 400 which was introduced in 1960 and which is still in force, and they have resulted in the Transkei being one of the most heavily policed areas in the Republic. Despite that, the Government now comes and tells us that the time is ripe for an introduction of a Bill granting self-government. Of course, the powers conferred in the Bill fall very short of self-government. The Transkei, when this Bill is passed, will still be a very long way indeed from a self-governing state. It is certainly very different indeed from the pictures which we have been reading in the overseas magazines&#x2014;the glossy advertisement placed by the Minister of Information&#x2014; to tell us about the new nation which is about to be formed by the Transkei Bill. The legislative powers contained in this Bill in fact are more reminiscent of an arrangement under the early Colonial days rather than any form of self-government as the hon. the Minister would have us believe. For instance, there is the exclusion of all towns from the jurisdiction of the Transkeian Assembly; in other words, the European guardian will more or less have what I would call extra-territorial claim on this so-called self-governing ward, and the exclusion of all towns meaning, of course, that the very centres of economic life in the Transkei are excluded from the jurisdiction of the Transkeian Assembly. Certain specific subjects are excluded from the powers of the Assembly. This, together with the fact that the Government of the Republic retains the administration of certain laws which are in force both in the Transkei and the Republic, in particular the Bantu Administration Act, which gives vast powers to this Government to promulgate regulations affecting the Transkei, plus the fact that all Bills passed by the Transkeian Authority have to be approved by the State President, plus the very important fact, of course, that of the 109 <span class="col_5825_5826" refersTo="page_0245"/>members in the Transkeian Assembly, 64 will hold their seats only at Government pleasure, all these factors add up to the fact that the so-called self-governing Transkeian Assembly is in fact going to be a subordinate Legislature, subordinate to the Minister of Bantu Administration. The financial arrangements which have been laid down in Part VIII of this Bill are precarious, to say the least, and without financial autonomy or financial security it is difficult to see how this self-governing area is going to be able to maintain itself. The territory in fact is going to be permanently dependent on largess from the Republic, because one knows that the conditions of poverty in the Transkei are such that no amount of revenue raised from those citizens themselves can ever be enough to make it self-supporting. I think the Government is mistaken if it thinks it is going to be easy to collect taxes from so-called citizens of the Transkei who permanently reside outside the Transkei and who will never be getting any benefit from the Transkei or its revenue, to which they are now being asked to subscribe.</p>

<p>Another great financial defect in this Bill is the fact that it does not seem to give borrowing powers to the Transkeian Assembly. No provision appears to be made for appropriations by Parliament for loan funds to meet capital expenditure. I believe that all these factors added together give the lie to the claim made by the Government and its supporters and in particular by the Minister of Information that the Transkei is about to become a self-governing area. I want to point out too that political independence is quite worthless unless it is accompanied by economic viability. Flags and anthems, which are provided for in this Bill, may be rallying points for nationalism for the new nation, but they are not things which are going to help to feed the members of that new nation. The tragedy, of course, is that long before any viability is established in the Transkei, any real economic viability, long before agricultural reforms are really put into effect, the Government is already implementing the second leg of this policy which is the repatriation of Transkeian citizens back to that area. So the territory is being called upon to bear an even greater burden than it has already borne in the past; in other words, not merely the removal of surplus population from the land, which was the obvious solution suggested by the Tomlinson Commission, a solution which dedicated agricultural officers in the Transkei are working very hard indeed to achieve, long before that can be done, the reserves are being more impoverished by the increased numbers of persons who are being sent back to be dependent on it; in other words, the policy of sending back to the Transkei, Africans from the urban areas with no means of support. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister realizes that this action alone is enough to sink the whole of the Transkeian ship, this idea of returning to this impoverished area thousands upon thousands of persons with no means of subsistence dependent on the area, instead of exactly the opposite and that is the removal of surplus people from the land. This is what is being done, and not only is the Transkei suffering as the result of growing unemployment and poverty within the area itself but neighbouring White towns, to use Government language, are suffering inasmuch as they are finding themselves with thousands upon thousands of unemployed Africans coming in illegally and looking for some form of subsistence. There is no sign that any of the necessary 300,000 jobs which have to be found for people who have to be removed from the land if the Transkei is to be agriculturally viable, will be available. There is no sign of industry within the reserves and the border industries, for what they are worth, are still a dream of the future. I do not believe that they are ever going to do any of the wonderful things that the Prime Minister, for instance, has anticipated that they will do; that employment for one will in turn generate further employment for five. The experience in other countries does not bear out his contention, but in any case this ambition that the border industries will be able to supply 500,000 jobs within the next 50 years is a completely fantastic supposition when one realizes that in the whole of the industrialized areas in the Republic of South Africa, 100 years of development since the mineral discoveries and in particular 30 years of an industrial revolution since the &#x2019;30s in South Africa, have only managed to provide jobs in industry for about that number of Africans. The amount of capital investment that has gone into the Republic before it has been possible to create that number of jobs in industry, is of course, so far beyond the dreams of anything that can go into the border industries as to make the whole proposition quite fantastic. It is a dream of the future and I do not believe that it is ever going to be realized. But at least the Government should surely wait until there is some practical implementation of the policy of building up alternative occupations in the Transkei before it goes ahead with its policy of sending back to this area the thousands of people who are being endorsed out of the towns where they already have jobs, to constitute an additional burden on this new so-called self-governing territory.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say, of course, that the whole trouble with this plan, as is the whole trouble with so many other Government plans, is that it is not that the Government so often gives the wrong answers, but it is that the Government so often asks the wrong questions. That is the real trouble. In this case, of course, the right question that should be asked is how &#x2018;best can we develop one multi-racial South Africa? How best can we develop all our great resources so that the entire multiracial population can enjoy the manifold blessings which have been bestowed on this country? Instead, Sir, we have the wrong <span class="col_5827_5828" refersTo="page_0246"/>question which is: How can we separate South Africa, how can we divide it up into its racial components? As a result of the wrong question being asked, and therefore the wrong answer being given, there is a tragic air of unreality about this whole situation, this entire experiment in self-government. It is not going to satisfy the people inside the Transkei because it only gives limited rights and because the economic viability which is so necessary cannot be achieved. It is certainly not going to satisfy the political ambitions of the Africans outside the area. To me, promising a Transkeian citizen who lives in Johannesburg or Cape Town, who has probably not set foot in the Transkei for a generation, is rather like promising that the political aspirations of an Irish-American in New York shall be realized by exercising a vote in Dublin. As far as I am concerned it is equally unrealistic and it will not satisfy the political aspirations of the Africans. In short, Sir, the Bill remains what I said it was at the second reading. It is a fraud, it can achieve none of its objectives, except perhaps to satisfy a few naive Nationalists who are eagerly seeking an ethical backing, an ethical basis, for apartheid. It might satisfy some naive people in that regard. It will not satisfy the Africans inside the Territory; it will not satisfy the Africans outside the Territory; it certainly offers no solution to thinking White South Africans and I can assure the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) that it will do nothing whatsoever to dispel the unhappy impression that South Africa has created in the outside world.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is probably fortunate that the Progressive Party is represented in this House by a lady, because the party has to state its case by means of a lack of unobjectivity and too much self-assurance. It is only by over-emphasizing a certain facet that that point of view can be justified. That is why I do not want to follow the hon. member except in so far as one point raised by her at the beginning of her speech is concerned, namely, that this legislation gives physiological expression to the attitude of the National Party, that they admit that the Bantu should have a form of self-government and that there can be no permanent domination. She said that this was a departure from the former attitude of our party. I just want to emphasize that the attitude to which expression is given in this legislation has been the attitude of the National Party since 1947 when the basis of this policy was consciously formulated and it gives expression to the policy of the National Party as enunciated by General Hertzog in the twenties when there were numerous joint sittings in connection with the matter. To accuse this party of ever having advocated the idea of White domination is to misinterpret the policy of this party.</p>

<p>I want to dispose of a second issue. With your permission, Sir, I shall return more specifically to the contents of the Bill in a moment. That is in regard to the speech made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) in which he, with your permission, reacted to an accusation made by the Minister of Bantu Administration to the effect that on a previous occasion the hon. member was supposed to have made an untrue statement by saying that the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape was closely linked to this legislation, that the two matters were related. In order to justify his statement the hon. member for Bezuidenhout quoted a statement by the hon. the Minister of Finance in which the latter said very clearly that the five year developmental plan in regard to the Bantu area was linked with the removal of the Bantu from the Western Cape. The five year developmental plan was already put into operation last year. That plan has already been in operation for a year. That plan is completely dissociated from this constitutional legislation. That so-called reply which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has offered us is no reply to the statement that he had made himself guilty of an untruth, but he himself has now confirmed it by advancing as the authority for his statement in this matter something which is different from what he stated originally. In the circumstances I find it extravagant on the part of the hon. member, having claimed for himself this unfounded justification, to have the temerity to say that the Minister of Bantu Administration owes him an apology for having accused him originally of telling an untruth. I repeat that original charge and I support it with the defence advanced by the hon. member himself.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as the effects of the provisions of this legislation are concerned, I want to say this in the first instance: This legislation creates a framework for the relationship between the White community of our country and an ordered Black community. For the first time in something like 70 years a lawfully ordered relationship is being established between this White community and an ordered Black community. And I believe that this pattern of relationship between the White community and the Black community is the pattern which can be projected between us and the Black people not only within the territorial area of the Republic but in the entire southern Africa and on our Continent. That is the first meaning which this legislation has to me and to that I want to add this: What has happened is nothing revolutionary. When our fathers came to this country there were relationships between ordered Bantu state communities and a White state community. Over a period of 70 years that basis of relationship between the national groups has disappeared. We are not returning to anything new but this legislation is restoring a human and political relationship which our nation knew, a relationship with which it has grown up and which it has betrayed.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill establishes the equipment for the future of the Transkeian people. What equipment does it establish? I want to <span class="col_5829_5830" refersTo="page_0247"/>refer to three aspects in particular. In the first place it provides to the people of the Transkei as equipment for the future an alliance with this nation. This alliance with our White nation is a very significant alliance, more so than it would have been had it been with one of the European nations. This legislation formulates an alliance with the first indigenous Africa nation who has yearned for political freedom and a Black nation in Africa. In other words, the first nation of Africa, who as a child demanded from Africa the right to develop politically by itself and who attained it, concludes an alliance here with the youngest of Africa&#x2019;s nations so as to act as their ally in terms of this legislation and this alliance covers in the first place direct financial assistance. Which other nation in Africa could travel the road to freedom with a pertinent and defined right to financial support during its early history? This alliance is characterized by the right which the White nation as guardian has in respect of the Transkeian nation to have the Transkeian legislation approved by the State President, in that any extension of its powers is subject to the approval of this House and the Other Place and expression is given to that in that this legislation provides for a Civil Service for the Transkei. A consistent alliance is being created as equipment for the future of the Transkei.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize in the second place that we are creating here an association with the Christian doctrine and church. Reference is made in the preamble to the promotion of religion. We in the Republican State, the State which remains the over-all power, pertinently acknowledge our Christian task and calling. I do not want to enlarge upon this but I wish to make two appeals. In the first instance I want to make an appeal to the large number of Black Christians in the Transkei that they should regard this as a challenge to their own innermost standard of civilization and that they should take the lead in that country. I believe this is a challenge to our South African church and State that where missionary work is being hampered in other areas in Africa to concentrate with renewed effort on the Transkei so that the equipment for the future in this regard as far as the Transkei is concerned, will be in terms of what we are so anxious to see in reality, namely that a Christian future be established there.</p>

<p>The third equipment with which we are providing them is that they are getting an opportunity of bringing about their own freedom. The criticism against the provision of this Bill is that it is vague that it is undefined and that there is a sort of indefiniteness. Formally we have to concede that criticism but it is deliberately so in order to make the growing process possible. We must remember this that these people have to grow towards their own freedom. If I may give an example: When parents see their children get married many of them are tempted to try to regulate the marriage of the child according to what they think it ought to be. But that new relationship belongs to the child. Similarly an image has been projected on to the minds of the Whites as to what we reckon a free Black state should look like. We are all inclined to define it as much as possible so that the Transkei will achieve its freedom in a way which is acceptable to us. It must be realized that this legislation creates the opportunity for the Transkei to find its freedom according to its own pattern. They can find it better than the rest of Africa. The big problems which await the Transkei, problems which have been emphasized by many hon. members are problems which cannot be solved by this legislation: They are the administrative problems, the financial problems, etc. I think we should also be grateful to the Opposition for having drawn attention to the big problems which lie ahead. I want to say this that in each one of these respects the problems of the Transkei are less than the problems in the case of any Black state in Africa which has already become independent. Relatively speaking there are more educated people in the Transkei. Relatively speaking a broader mass of its people follow the Christian belief and materially speaking it is more developed than any other state which is already independent. Its problems in comparison with the rest of Africa are, therefore smaller and I believe that if we give them an opportunity of developing according to this germ we will have created the possibility for the Transkei to grow into an example for Africa. But then this question arises: How long will this growing process take? In which direction will the growth develop? There has been a great deal of speculation about these questions which are not answered in the legislation and I trust you will allow me, Sir, to deal with it for a brief moment because it concerns something which I touched upon during the second reading, namely, what do we envisage the ultimate relationship to be? I used the term &#x201C;confederal relationship&#x201D; as opposed to the term &#x201C;commonwealth relationship&#x201D; which was used by other speakers on this side. I just want to point out that both these terms indicate nothing else than a loose relationship for one or other common purpose. According to all authorities who have analysed the word, a confederation means nothing else than a commonwealth. As a matter of fact, in Dutch that is the correct alternative term. The direction in which it will develop according to this legislation is very clearly a development in which there will be a relationship between this Republic which is creating the Transkeian state and that state itself. A relationship will exist for all time to come but that relationship will not be a burden on a common governmental body.</p>

<p>I want to conclude, Mr. Chairman by pointing out that this legislation is creating an opportunity for the developed Bantu, that this legislation is creating an opportunity for the Bantu with driving power and spiritual force to do creative work amongst his own people. For the first time executive power in respect <span class="col_5831_5832" refersTo="page_0248"/>of important matters is being transferred to a Bantu authority. For the first time an embryonic Bantu civil service is being established. An opportunity, at a scale hitherto unknown in the territorial area of the Republic, is being created for the Bantu to work together and to create something. In this connection I want to make an appeal to those who may not perhaps be present but whom it may nevertheless perhaps reach, an appeal to the Bantu who are to-day frustrated and who feel rebellious in many respects. What are the factors which make the Bantu frustrated and rebellious to-day? Only this that he feels that he lacks the opportunity in our society to achieve that which he feels he as an individual can achieve, that he cannot attain the heights which are within his potential reach as a person. My appeal is this: Let every Bantu who feels that he is equipped as far as technical training is concerned, or that he is equipped as far as spiritual drive and passion for labour are concerned; who feels that he is equipped as far as patriotism towards his own people is concerned, go to the Transkei. There the land is still lying fallow; the posts are being created there; there the executive power is being given to the Transkeian leaders who need their own people to do that work. Let the Bantu with driving force and spiritual force desist from the desire to disturb this society but grasp at this historical occasion to serve his own people and to show the world what the South African Bantu can do. Flowing from that, Mr. Chairman I want to make the following appeal to our own people: Let us give them this opportunity to develop in the Transkei and to take a leading part in Africa in a spirit of goodwill so that we will set an example here of setting the ward free in a Christianlike manner, of Christian development and the establishment of the first Black state in Africa which is characterized by a Christian character and an ordered growth in co-operation with the White man.</p>

<p>It will be very difficult for the majority of Bantu in South Africa to respond to the call of the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) because the majority of them are not citizens of the Transkei and do not qualify for citizenship of the Transkei. Should the majority of Bantu of the classes specified by the hon. member answer his call and flock to the Transkei for the reasons he gave we would have a very embarrassed Minister of Bantu Administration and Development because there are not facilities there, and they will not be there for some time, to give occupation to the people whom the hon. member for Kempton Park wishes to see go there. I do not propose following this line of argument save to say this in regard to the speech of the hon. member that when he suggested that the Transkei had more material development or wealth than any of the emerging states in Africa I think he is drawing a very long bow indeed. To suggest, to give one or two examples, that the Transkei has greater material wealth and development than places like Ghana or Nigeria, is drawing a very long bow indeed.</p>

<p>We are here concerned with the third reading of this measure and I am going to attempt briefly, but in a broad sense, to give the House a picture of this measure so that one can judge it merely on what it contains, so that one can judge it not from the point of view of whether it is good or bad in the sense of the analysis that was given at the second reading but merely on its inherent capabilities and possibilities.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) said that this measure was something quite new in our constitutional life. He is of course quite right but I wonder whether he realizes just how new and how novel it is. It is that aspect of the matter which I hope I shall be able to demonstrate to the House in the short time that I shall detain it. The first chapter deals with the Transkei, naturally enough, that place to which this constitution is to apply. It is described in a novel way. There is no reference to boundaries in Chapter I which is the usual way of describing the area to which you apply a constitution. One finds a reference there merely to the authority which will govern the area. That is how it is defined. The area is defined by reference to jurisdiction, not to boundaries; by reference to the governing authority, not by reference to the geography or the geographical area of the place. That in itself is unusual when constituting a new self-governing entity. Of course, Sir, it has to be in that form and one of the criticisms one has of the contents of the first chapter of th;s Bill is that not only is there provision in the measure for that entity which we are creating, constantly to change in the future, but that very entity is presently changing, its boundaries are presently changing under existing legislation&#x2014;from day to day almost as the 1936 Act is used for that purpose. For that reason this form of description has had to be resorted to. But it assists neither the people of the Transkei nor the people in the Republic of South Africa because on the one matter where one would expect and desire certainty we are left with uncertainty.</p>

<p>Then one comes to the Second Chapter of this Bill. That gives to the Transkei symbols such as flags, anthems and language; symbols inconsistent with the executive and legislative functions and powers set out later in the Bill &#x2014;trappings of sovereignty, Sir, out of place in a measure of this kind and out of place in a constitution which is creating, as this Bill creates, a new area which remains, in terms of the Bill and at this stage, an integral part of the Republic. It is inconsistent to have these trappings and symbols of sovereignty in a measure which has the limitation to which I shall refer later so far as executive and legislative functions are concerned.</p>

<p>Then we have citizenship dealt with in the Third Chapter. This is quite unusual. Citizenship which is related to language and colour and unrelated to place of birth or domicile is a quite novel concept in the role of citizenship. <span class="col_5833_5834" refersTo="page_0249"/>One has a further chapter, Chapter IV, which deals with the executive of the new state. It contains a combination of names reminiscent both of sovereignty and subordination. The juxtaposition of these two inconsistent concepts is used in describing the executive functions; there is the unusual method of the appointment of Ministers. I say &#x201C;unusual&#x201D; because the overall picture suggests that it is attempted to give to this constitution a flavour of British constitutional development but the established norms of that type of development do not appear at all times or at all places in this measure. They are dotted about with measures quite foreign to that system, with forms quite foreign to that system. The election by members of the Assembly of Ministers is a development foreign to the British constitutional system. There is no appointment of those officers by the Prime Minister which is the regular practice throughout the countries of the world which follow the British constituional practice. There is power to the Assembly to petition for the removal of Ministers rather like the power of attainder which the British Parliament exercised in the old days of absolute sovereignty when the King had absolute power. We have the unusual position that the powers and the functions of the Prime Minister are set out in the constitution. Another form which is foreign to the constitutional development I have dealt with.</p>

<p>What is the result of that so far as the executive power of this new body is concerned? It means that you are giving to this new state, to the new community, a new constitution which does not follow established forms, established forms for which we have a number of precedents. The new Government in the Transkei will find itself in this position that it cannot look to the older countries in the older constitutions for guidance as to how it is to function, because it does not follow those lines, and yet there is not sufficient elaboration in this Bill of the new forms which are there described for the new Government to derive guidance by reference to its own constitution. In other words, you have in this Bill some of the old, some of the new mixed up together, not fully set out so that there is, in terms of this Bill, a guide to the newly formed Government. Nor is it sufficiently close to the established forms of Government that those Ministers can look to other historical precedents for guidance. They are left alone in a wide sea in a small boat and they will have to use their wits to keep going. When setting up a new constitution, when starting a new state, all this makes for difficulties. It makes the wheels less easy to run smoothly; it makes this community a lonely community; it makes the persons in authority there a lonely group without precedent and guidance to help them along their way. It is suggestive of a measure hurriedly thought out and brought before this House in a rush. It is suggestive of the committal to paper of ideas which have not had time to mature.</p>

<p>In the Fifth Chapter of this measure we have provisions for the Legislature of the new Transkei, an unusual combination of hereditary and elective principles, a strange combination which seems to me&#x2014;the nearest analogy I can find&#x2014;a sort of mixture of the principles of the House of Lords and the House of Commons under the English system. The chiefs in many respects being close to the peerage in the House of Lords and of course the elected members being closer to the elected persons in the House of Commons. There are aspects of Victorian democratic practice, as was practised in Great Britain in those times where powerful peers, big landowners, holders of wellknown hereditary titles controlled the nomination to Parliament of members of Parliament. We have the same thing appearing in this Transkeian Constitution whereby the chiefs or some of them at least, have power to nominate a representative to sit in their seat in the Assembly. So you have the same principle there. You have the most novel situation of a largely expatriate electorate and the allocation of voters to constituencies in which they do not live, may never have lived and may never in their lives live. These things, to say the least, are quite novel. You have the linking together of hereditary titles with the right to seats in a elected Assembly. You have too the giving to the Legislature of the power to make provision for the enforcement of its laws extra-territorially, beyond its boundaries, but not by intergovernmental agreement (which is the usual form in the modern world) but by virtue of the provisions of the law itself. That too is something quite unknown so far as constitutional development is concerned; All these things give to the Legislature and to the Executive in this new state a system which is unknown in the modern world. We are not giving this entirely new system to a mature society, to a society of any experience; we are giving it to one which is the opposite of those two things.</p>

<p>I have so far looked merely at the provisions of this Bill itself. Marry to that, Sir, the type of society and community to which all this is being given, and it seems that one can draw only one conclusion and that is that there is the very greatest risk of it not being a success.</p>

<p>There is so far as the Chapter I am presently dealing with is concerned the introduction in Clause 40 of the requisite of consent by the head of state, the State President, to any measures passed by the Legislature. That introduces a provision similar to the situation which existed in the early days of the Union of South Africa when the head of state was a monarch, a King, and when he had to assent to laws passed in this House. But whilst introducing that principle into the constitution; there is not introduced at the same time those customs and conventions of the constitution which alone made that system work. But for the customs and conventions which we had under the Union of South Africa, the system of assent by the King would not have worked. <span class="col_5835_5836" refersTo="page_0250"/>We have introduced that system of assent here without those customs and conventions, and it cannot be said that they automatically apply, because there is no direct analogy between the relationship of this new Assembly and the State President&#x2014;between that relationship and the relationship between the House of Assembly in the Union of South Africa and the King who was then the head of state. That convention was that the King acted always on the advice of the South African Cabinet, not on the advice of the British Cabinet. Directly the opposite, so it seems from speeches earlier on, is to be the position under Clause 40.</p>

<p>Finance is dealt with in Chapter VIII. We have flags and anthems in abundance so far as this Bill is concerned, but we have precious little by way of domestic revenue. We have a situation which again, I suggest, is unusual whereby in terms of the provisions of Chapter VIII the revenue of the state&#x2014;I do not speak of subsidies of the South African Government, but of revenue by way of taxation&#x2014;pursuant to the provisions of this Chapter will derive from citizens who are largely outside the borders of the Transkei. Again something quite unusual. The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) earlier on made a speech in which he suggested that we could expect the Transkei constitution to work. In contrast to the states which had been set up by the Metropolitan Powers of Europe in other parts of Africa, here, he suggested (and he alluded particularly to the retention of the principle of chieftainship), we were grafting new forms or norms onto old established institutions, and that would make for this system to work whereas in other parts of Africa what had been introduced was a system foreign to the country, viz. Western democracy, and he held that largely for that reason those systems had not worked. But that is not so. Nearly all the prominent politicians in Nigeria for instance are hereditary chiefs, but Nigeria has its troubles, constitutional troubles, just as much as any other emergent state in Africa has. In fact quite recently things there have been very close to developing into violence. They have there grafted Western democracy onto the hereditary system of chieftainships which is native to that land, but because, I believe, it has been done too quickly they have had their troubles, just as I believe the Transkei will have its troubles.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, a perusal of this measure leads one to believe that what should have come last has come first. It demonstrates that what should have been the last phase of development in the emergence of a new state has come as the first stage. It should have been bread and jobs first and political power following on. But instead of that we have had politics first, and one can but hope (there is at present no indication of it) that the bread and the jobs will follow after. Otherwise this thing bodes very ill for the future.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) who has just sat down gave us a very comprehensive explanation of the details of this legislation and the criticism that he expressed, in so far as it was criticism, was actually in respect of the details of this legislation. But what is so strange is that hon. members on that side had the opportunity of investigating the details of this legislation and of bringing about improvements to those details but they did not make use of that opportunity. I shall refer to this point again briefly during the course of my speech.</p>

<p>First of all I want to say a few words about the remark that is so often made that this measure actually represents a change of policy on the part of the National Party Government. I want to say this particularly in pursuance of what was said by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) who says that the National Party has changed its philosophy. She contends that the previous policy of &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; has now been changed and that the Bantu are now being given a say in the government of the country. Sir, we must ask ourselves for what purpose these areas were set aside for the Bantu. When we go back into history we see that even in the colonial days the policy was to set aside areas for the Bantu. That policy has been followed since Union. We have never departed from that policy; that policy has been confirmed repeatedly. I ask myself what the underlying intention was, not only in our time but many, many years ago when that idea was first mooted, and the least that one can say is that if it was not the intention to set aside separate areas for the Bantu, areas which of necessity would gradually develop and expand, then at least our forefathers felt instinctively that those are the laws along which one should proceed. If we go on then and talk about the guardianship of the White man in South Africa over the Bantu &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Where is that provided for in the Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>That has been accepted over the years and the supporters of the United Party also support the idea that the White man should be the guardian of the non-White. Or does the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) not support that idea? I think the hon. member does support that idea. What are the two important points in connection with guardianship? The first is that the person who is the guardian must protect and exercise supervision over the ward who has not yet reached maturity, who may perhaps still be a minor or who still has the qualities of a minor. But then there is another important factor in connection with guardianship and that is that eventually that person over whom the guardian is appointed reaches maturity. When he becomes 21 years of age he is no longer a minor and the guardianship is then terminated. There are other cases where the person under guardianship does not have the necessary ability but where he eventually develops and acquires the necessary ability and knowledge, and in that case the guardianship <span class="col_5837_5838" refersTo="page_0251"/>must eventually terminate. Do hon. members opposite who all support the principle of guardianship want to suggest that what is an important element of guardianship should be done away with? Do they suggest that irrespective of the degree of development and progress of the Native in South Africa of whom we are the guardians to-day&#x2014;let us investigate this as a principle&#x2014;that guardianship must remain for all time? I say that this is an important element of guardianship and when we talk of guardianship in the true sense of the word it is necessary for us to bear in mind the fact that the person whose guardian we are, will eventually outgrow that guardianship. What we are doing here now is gradually to train those persons whose guardians we are so that eventually that guardianship will disappear completely.</p>

<p>In the debate on a motion for the third reading of a Bill one must ask oneself for what reasons the Bill should be approved at its final stage or what reasons one can advance for refusing to approve of it. The legislation as we have it before us in its final stage, as I see it, makes provision for two or three things in particular. The most important provision, of course, is in Clause 1 in which self-government is given to the Transkei subject to the provisions of this Bill&#x2014;in other words, it is not unlimited self-government. The Bill goes on to set out the restrictive provisions under which self-government is to be granted. It also brings into being a legislative authority and an executive authority and all that goes with it.</p>

<p>My main reason for welcoming this Bill and for thinking it is a good thing for this Bill to be placed on our Statute Book is because what is envisaged in this Bill is in conformity with the views of at least 99 per cent of the White population of South Africa. Hon. members must not misunderstand me. I say &#x201C;what this Bill envisages&#x201D; is in conformity with the wishes of more than 99 per cent of the White people. When one considers what this legislation has in mind, it is difficult for one to understand why there should be so much opposition to this legislation in this House because I am convinced that what is envisaged in this legislation is wanted by nearly all the people of South Africa. At least 99 per cent of the people in South Africa are passionately opposed to race integration. Hon. members of the United Party will I am sure not disagree with me in this regard.</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is trying vainly to distract me. I want to try to prove to him why this Bill should become law. In the first place, as I said, the people of South Africa want it. What this Bill seeks to do is desired by the people of South Africa. The fact that the Liberal Party in South Africa cannot make any headway proves that the people of South Africa are opposed to race integration. It is proved in South Africa by the fact that even the Progressive Party which leans far more in the direction of the United Party is unable to achieve any success worth mentioning. May I ask the hon. member for Hillbrow whether he is opposed to race integration?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<p>I am, but that has nothing to do with the third reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>I leave it to you, Mr. Speaker, to tell me if I am wrong. In the negative sense of the word I say that the people of South Africa are opposed to race integration but in the positive sense of the word I say that it is the aim and desire of the White people of South Africa in the first place to find a safe home for the White man in South Africa and at the same time to create circumstances by means of which not only the White man but the Black man and the Brown man too will be able to co-exist peacefully in South Africa. That is not only my desire, it is also the desire of hon. members on that side. That is why I say that this Bill must become law because this law is going to comply with the wishes of the people of South Africa. If hon. members opposite agree with me that we have the same thing in mind and if they are also opposed to race integration and if they want peace amongst the various races in South Africa, then we are in agreement as to what we are striving to achieve for South Africa. The only difference between us, if I may make a comparison, is that while both the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. the Prime Minister want to go to Swellendam, the one wants to go there via Worcester and the other via Caledon. The only difference between us lies in the method to be followed. What can we do to achieve a common purpose? It is not as simple as the example that I have given of going to Swellendam. It is far more difficult because the policy that is followed by hon. members opposite&#x2014; and I cannot discuss it here because it is not contained in the Bill&#x2014;is objectionable to us and we do not believe that we can achieve any success along that road.</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have now come to the final form of this Bill. Only one amendment was made to the Bill at the Committee Stage. I must say that hon. members opposite, notwithstanding the criticism that was forthcoming, mainly from the hon. member for Zululand, have not been of any real assistance to us. Indeed, they have made a farce of this Parliament. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) himself admitted during the Committee Stage &#x2014;and his Leader confirmed it to-day in this House&#x2014;that they were interested to see whether this proved to be a good law or not.</p>

<from><span class="col_5839_5840" refersTo="page_0252"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY-SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>I do want to point out to the hon. member that he cannot by way of question and answer deal now with what happened during the Committee Stage.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, Mr. Speaker, but I want to point out that in this third-reading debate the hon. the Leader of the Opposition advanced excuses as to why they did not move any amendments. That is why I say that by implication they admit that they wasted time during the Committee Stage and the other stages. They were not interested in ensuring that a good law was placed on the Statute Book as far as its details are concerned.</p>

<p>To my mind this Bill has three particular characteristics and that is why I feel that it must be placed on the Statute Book. In the first place, it does away with the partnership that has failed throughout Africa. Other countries in Africa have proved to us that this policy simply cannot work. Yesterday morning I was in the company of a person whose name I do not even know, an English-speaking person. We had a casual conversation and he was obviously a supporter of the United Party because he spoke very sympathetically of the experiences of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) on the previous day. That is why I am convinced that he was a United Party supporter. He referred to Kenya and he said that the inhabitants of Kenya Would never forget how they were treated there by the British Government. He said that if only one part of the country in the vicinity of Eldoret had been set aside&#x2014;the area in which so many White people from South Africa settled and where they tamed the country&#x2014;for occupation by the White man, things would not have been so bad. The thought then occurred to me that that was precisely what this legislation sought to do. Here we have the same idea of geographical division put forward by an English-speaking person in respect of Kenya, a person who is obviously a supporter of the United Party. That is what we have in mind with this legislation.</p>

<p>The second reason why I feel that this legislation is desirable and necessary is that it is in conformity with the spirit of the world, a spirit which prevails not only in other parts of the world but which also prevailed throughout Africa. World opinion is opposed to colonialism and is opposed to discrimination. It advocates the freedom of the State in which the individual can exercise his rights on an equal footing with his fellow-citizens. That in the main is the spirit that prevails throughout the world and also in Africa to-day. But I do not agree that in other parts of Africa, where freedom has been given to other parts of Africa&#x2014;as we now envisage giving gradual self-government to the Bantu as was the case in the Congo and other parts of Africa&#x2014;this has necessarily resulted in freedom. Indeed, I think that where freedom has been given in those countries, it has led to greater hostility and more trouble and greater dangers. That is why I feel that this legislation is so desirable. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition in criticizing this legislation said in regard to this point&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we consider the proposals before the House, they offer no hope that the development in the Transkei differs from the development in any other part of Africa. No Sir, that development will perhaps be even more difficult because through its inability, its refusal to face the realities of the situation the Government with this very Bill is not only creating the opportunity but also the machinery for friction between the Transkei and the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>I cannot agree with that. This legislation makes provision for circumstances which are very different from those in other countries in Africa. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went on to point out that the Bantu of the Transkei would come along later and ask for more rights in regard to other matters. It was on the basis of that argument that he said that we were creating more friction between the Transkei and the Republic, but we accept the consequences of this policy and it is precisely in this regard that we differ from the rest of the world because in this legislation unlike the position in the other countries in Africa, provision is being made for self-government to be given gradually to this territory. Powers are not being given to them overnight which they are not yet ready to exercise. The Bill provides that only certain legislative and executive powers will be given to the Transkei at this stage. We accept the fact that they will gradually ask for more powers and that as these people develop, as the minor reaches maturity and continues to develop, he will ask for and obtain more powers. That is the great difference. That is why I say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was completely wrong when he said that this Bill would lead to the same difficulties in South Africa that were experienced in other territories in Africa. The great difference is that this is a gradual process. That is why I feel that these are the three fundamental principles on which this Bill is based and that it is necessary for this Bill to be placed on our Statute Book.</p>

<p>The regulation of our racial affairs, the choice that we have to make as far as the handling of these affairs is concerned, is an extremely difficult problem because we as Whites realize that as far as numbers are concerned we are outnumbered four to one. I have never asked a United Party supporter to become a Nationalist. All that I ask is that we should see this Bill as an important measure and ensure that care is exercised in its implementation. I do not ask hon. members opposite to become Nationalists but what I want to ask them is this: This Bill will have been passed by this Parliament with a democratic majority and that is why I think that we are entitled to ask them, if they are not able to <span class="col_5841_5842" refersTo="page_0253"/>support it positively in the interests of South Africa, not to oppose it when it is applied. That is their sacred duty as Whites in South Africa. I said a moment ago that we do not differ as to our ultimate aim.</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if this Bill is implemented, a territory will come into being which will have a large measure of self-government. The whole territory falls within my constituency and during the second-reading debate we drew attention to the fact that there were a large number of Coloureds, my voters, living in that territory. The hon. the Minister was good enough in his reply to the second-reading debate to give me a very brief reply and to discuss the contents of the Bill in regard to the interests of the people there whom I represent and I want to quote what the hon. the Minister said then (Hansard, 3 April Col. 3948)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Bantu areas there is a total of 2,550. There are 314 men 664 women and 1,872 children in the Bantu areas and all the rest are in the White areas. But the hon. the Prime Minister and I have given the assurance that these people need not feel concerned. They will not be treated like animals. They are also entitled to protection by the Government. Only 17 of them are traders; 116 have fixed property of which 112 are only residential sites. There are six farmers, but I have instructed the Heckroodt Commission to investigate their position also. I have personally given them the assurance that they need not feel concerned; their position will be looked after.</block>

<p>Let us imagine that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures are correct. In my opinion there are many more people in this area than the number mentioned, but then the question also arises: If this Bill is implemented, what will be the alternative that those people will have? If we had had a commission of inquiry into the position of those people and if at some stage or other they could have been given an assurance in regard to what was to become of them, then I believe that we would not have had this uncertainty and fear for the future on their part. But we are faced here with an accomplished fact which affects whole communities and they do n&#x01A1;t know where they have to go. There is no certainty as yet. The inquiry is still in its most elementary stage in this regard. Let us put ourselves in the place of those people who have lived there for generations. We tell them that at this stage when this Bill has almost been passed, that their case will be investigated and that we will see whether something can be done for them. In the meantime the circumstances under which they are living are deteriorating from day to day. There was no prior planning. The position of the Coloureds is 100 per cent more difficult than that of the Whites because generally speaking the Whites in the Transkei are people whose economic position is such that they can help themselves to a certain extent. The others are officials who are there because of their work or else they are artisans who can go where they like. If they have to leave the Transkei, they can go and live wherever they like or wherever they can afford to live. They can travel as far from the Transkei as their cars or other modes of transport can take them. But it is a well-known fact that the Coloureds cannot do so. The Coloured cannot decide where he wants to go and live. As far as his future home is concerned he is bound by the provisions of the Groups Areas Act as far as cities or towns are concerned. In the second place, he is placed in a far more difficult position than the Whites. If he is an artisan, he has to think about the application of job reservation and whether he can obtain employment in any particular sphere. If he is a farmer he has to start thinking where he can obtain a small piece of land in a Coloured rural area because of legislation on our Statute Book. No prior consideration was given to the position of the people on whom this burden rests most heavily. I say&#x2014;and I accept responsibility for what I say; I do not say this to stir up racialism&#x2014;that if the evil day should come when this new state loses control over its subjects, as happened in other states of Africa&#x2014;control which the army and police of the Republic have to maintain from time to time&#x2014;the Coloureds will be the first to suffer, as happened with the Whites in the Congo, and those people know it. I had the opportunity, thanks to the courtesy of the hon. the Minister, to discuss the matter with him and with a Coloured leader from the Transkei&#x2014;the details are not relevant to this debate&#x2014;and I mentioned this fact then, but I want to emphasize the fact that at the moment the position is such that in certain Coloured communities in the Transkei these people are being forced to pay up to 10s. a month to Poqo and to other offshoots of that underground movement and they receive no protection. When they make an appeal for assistance to the local Coloured leader and say to him: &#x201C;You have now returned from the Coloured Council session; tell us what the future holds in store for us and what is to become of us,&#x201D; then the local magistrate stops him and says that he (the magistrate) has had a request from the local chief not to allow that Coloured leader to hold a meeting because the chief is afraid of trouble being caused by certain elements and cannot accept the responsibility of protecting the Coloureds. The chief himself is protected by his guards and by the police but the Coloureds are defenceless</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I accept your ruling but the contents of this Bill are under discussion and in terms of the Bill a large measure of sovereignty is being given to a certain territory in which Coloureds are living, people who up to this stage have not had the protection to which they are entitled as citizens of the Republic. That is what I am trying to bring home to this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister said that he would instruct the Heckroodt Commission to investigate the position of the Coloureds. In discussing this matter, I do not do so for the sake of making debating points or to try to tear the legislation of the Government apart. That is not what I am trying to do. In the first place I am concerned about the fate and the future of these people. It has been said that the Heckroodt Commission will investigate their case but I am very disappointed, just as those people are, that up to this stage very little progress has been made. All that we know is that at a certain stage the chairman of the Coloured Council was called to Pretoria and participated in certain discussions there. He returned and was not able to report to the Coloured Council on what had been discussed. I want to say in passing that the mere fact that this person lived in Umtata for some time does not mean that he is in any way representative of the Coloureds in the Transkei. He is completely out of touch with those people. As soon as he heard what was going to happen in the Transkei, he left there and I do not think that he is very welcome amongst the Coloureds in the Transkei any longer. In the meantime the Coloured communities in the Transkei received a circular signed by the secretary of the Coloured Taxpayers&#x2019; Association of Umtata in which they were invited to draw up memoranda for submission to the Heckroodt Commission. The Coloured taxpayers of Umtata consist, according to my information and as I know Umtata and as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) can confirm, of about 30 people. I do not think that it is a body that has any status as far as the Central Government is concerned. I think that the only status that it has is as far as the municipality there is concerned and moreover, according to the hon. the Minister, Umtata is a White area, I can give the assurance that this sort of thing &#x2014;the fact that they have received a circular letter from the Coloured taxpayers of Umtata in regard to something on which their entire future depends&#x2014;has created the impression that they are being overlooked and that their problems are not being considered at all.</p>

<p>In speaking about the effects of the Bill on the Coloured people living in that area. I also want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to ensure that the Heckroodt Commission investigates the position of those people, that this be done in the proper way and that they be fully informed of what is happening so that they can put their case. At the same time I want to express the hope that they will at least be given some idea as to what is to become of them in the future.</p>

<p>I want to come back now to the effects of this Bill upon that territory. I have said that I assume that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s figures are correct. But the hon. the Minister spoke about Bantu areas in the technical dogmatic sense and because the hon. the Minister spoke about Bantu areas he naturally left out the White spots in the territory like Umtata and Port St. Johns. I take it that places like Idutya, Butterworth and Lusikisiki will remain White areas but they will be small islands in that Bantu sea. When we consider what the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) said when he spoke about the measure of sovereignty that this territory will have from the start, then it seems to me that we must think of degrees of comparison. There is a measure of sovereignty. At what stage is there going to be a greater measure or the greatest measure of sovereignty and at what stage will the greatest measure of sovereignty that can be given to that territory result in a demand from that new state that it also wants control over the White spots in its area? It would be stupid and silly for the people living in those White spots to wait until that evil day came. At the moment they are worried about their future. Therefore, with the greatest respect to the hon. the Minister, I say that while it is technically correct to mention these numbers, these are not the only people who are concerned in this matter. There are many other people involved who are now living in the so-called White areas and it is amongst these people living in the White areas that the greatest anxiety exists. In the first place, there is no market for their properties&#x2014;nobody wants to buy, and for obvious reasons. In the second place, if they have to leave there, as they must do, they will not know where to go. As the Bill now stands there will be some form of <i>quasi</i>-sovereignty for that territory. When will it become full sovereignty? When will the stage be reached when the Republic will have to give up its suzerainty over that territory?</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>With the greatest respect, I find myself in this position: When I speak about the contents of the Bill and how the people there whom I represent will be affected, I do not actually know where to draw the line between a second and third-reading speech. But I shall do my best. I hope that you will allow me to speak about the effect of this Bill on the Coloured people living in that territory. In doing so I could make a very long speech but I shall be as brief as possible. When one considers the position of the Whites one finds that they are in this position that they have many Members of <span class="col_5845_5846" refersTo="page_0255"/>Parliament representing them in this House, but the position of the Coloureds is different &#x2014;they only have my colleagues and, mainly, myself&#x2014;and judging by what the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development said, it would appear that the Coloureds in that territory will either have to assimilate with the Bantu or leave. I can say immediately that assimilation with the Bantu is out of the question. If they have to leave, the question arises: Where must they go? We have a great responsibility towards those people because they are not there entirely of their own free will. Their forefathers did not go there of their own free will but to serve South Africa as members of the Cape Corps. I also want to point out, on behalf of the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux), that in the northern part of his constituency, at Vryburg and Mafeking, he is also going to experience the same problem that I am experiencing now, and I want to express the hope that when the Bantustans come into being in that part of the country, planned action will be taken and that the Coloureds in that area will be able to face the future with greater assurance in the sense that they will know what is to happen to them. At this moment when this Bill is about to come into operation, there is great anxiety and uncertainty in the minds of these people. If we could tell them to-day that their case has already been investigated and that some decision has been reached in their regard so that they will know what to do, then it would be my duty to consider very seriously whether I should support this Bill or not. We on these benches try to be objective because we are not tied to any party caucuses. We try to represent our voters to the best of our ability and to consider objectively all measures that come before this House. If one adopts the attitude, as the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) said, that two people may use different roads to get to Swellendam but that the object of both is to reach Swellendam, then one might be able to consider this matter in the same light, and although the one road is slightly shorter, it may be the more difficult road. One can then carefully weigh up which road to choose. But as long as this sort of legislation in which no provision is made for the future of the people whom we represent comes before this House we will not be able to support such legislation.</p>

<speech by="#loots">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LOOTS</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) will understand it if I do not try to reply to the points he raised, because the Minister can do so better than I can. I realize that at this stage it is no longer so easy to make a third-reading speech and to say something which has not already been said, and therefore I shall be brief. I want to repeat that I think that this is an important Bill we have before the House, and to-day we have the last opportunity of looking at it. I still hoped, even after what has happened in recent weeks, that to-day we would be able to find some common ground. I had hoped that in spite of the objections there are against these clauses which, as hon. members opposite say, contain the germ of sovereignty, the Opposition would still say that the Bill would at some stage become useful in terms of their policy of a race federation. After having listened finally to-day to the Opposition&#x2019;s approach to the matter, and having listened particularly to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, who saw nothing in this Bill except &#x201C;seeds of conflict&#x201D;, and having listened to the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp), who saw nothing in the Bill except threats from abroad and conflicts with the Republic, and who revealed nothing but mistrust in these people&#x2014;having listened to all that and to their approach to the matter, and to the total lack of confidence they have in the people with whom this Bill deals, I reluctantly came to the conclusion that I had to agree with the Leader of the Opposition and that in regard to our approach to this matter we have already come to the parting of the ways, and that therefore nothing remains for us but to carry on alone with this instrument we are taking in our hands to-day. This side of the House will implement its provisions with the greatest degree of sympathy, but without the assistance of the Opposition. As from to-day there will be only one course open to them, namely to accept our policy in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>When we come to discuss the clauses before us, I just want to say that the Bill before us, in its short-term effect, contains clauses which will promote good government. Here we have clauses by means of which we set in motion a legislative process, and where there will be the necessary advice and guidance and assistance to solve the problems. This Bill contains clauses which will promote good government. It contains financial clauses in terms of which we will assist the people of that State. It contains clauses which make it possible for us to help them in an orderly manner to outgrow their children&#x2019;s shoes in the constitutional, economic and administrative spheres. I refer now to the clauses which have reference to the public service and the assistance we will give them there. In so far as its short-term effect is concerned, we have here an instrument which I, as a citizen of the Republic and as somebody representing a constituency lying alongside those people, have no doubt will lead to orderly government.</p>

<p>In so far as its long-term effect is concerned, we have something here which will be able to go further. Legislative powers are granted which can be extended. There are other provisions in terms of which we can lead those people further step by step. It contains the germ of sovereignty and that germ of sovereignty will give this sovereign Parliament more status and prestige at a time and in a way to be determined by this sovereign Parliament.</p>

<p>Then I want to deal with the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman), who raised more <span class="col_5847_5848" refersTo="page_0256"/>technical objections. His objections amounted to this, that this Bill is of a constitutional nature and that the people who have to implement it do not have the background of a long constitutional history, people who have not had the benefit of the conventions we have in this Parliament, the unwritten rules of the constitution. Sir, that is true. Everything has not been written into this Bill, and one cannot incorporate everything into it; it is just a piece of paper, but this constitution will work. It is bound to work. Why? Because there will be people of goodwill on both sides of the colour line, on both sides of the borders, who will ensure that it does work. They will develop their own conventions. Hon. members need not be afraid of that. It cannot be precisely like ours right from the beginning. We must still see how the party system will develop in the Transkei. We must still see how the conventions of Cabinet Government will develop in the Transkei system. We must see whether and how a convention will develop, so that whereas in the beginning the State President will be advised by his Ministers in the Republic in regard to those matters, a convention may later be developed whereby he will be advised by his Ministers in the Transkei. Therefore the objection to this Bill that it does not contain all the provisions is not a real objection, because no constitution known to those hon. members or to us contains all the provisions, but the customs and conventions of the constitution will develop just as they did in our case and therefore it will work, and therefore it will also be successful in its long-term development, and will lead to the co-existence of nations in South Africa, and will provide us with a reply to the world in the second half of the twentieth century. It will be the instrument whereby we can give to other people what we demand for ourselves, and also give them human rights. I have never yet heard that giving to others what they deserve leads to one&#x2019;s own doom. Therefore in this most important period in the history of the Republic of South Africa, I as a member of this Parliament and as White South African make bold to say that I will vote for this Bill in its final stage with a clear conscience because to me it is tantamount to an act of faith&#x2014;because this is not something for people who have no faith&#x2014;and because I believe that it will inaugurate a period of wonderful co-existence, of finding each other and of co-operation in the future to the benefit of all of us in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown (Mr. Loots) has quite rightly pointed out that we are drawing to the end of the discussion on this Bill.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Queenstown has made it quite clear that there are some misgivings, but this is an experiment which they hope will work. He says that you must have faith in applying this law. Sir, it is quite obvious that unless you have faith you will be very disturbed at the passage of this Bill. We have pointed out the dangers which are inherent in the provisions of this Bill, Government members have certainly not been enthusiastic in discussing this measure. The hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) who interjected a moment ago has not spoken once. I cannot remember any other piece of major legislation passing through this House with so little active support from Government members, especially during the Committee Stage. In this debate some of them have excused themselves for not going into any detail because they say that the rules of debate do not permit it. It is quite obvious that when they are allowed to talk on ideology there is no hole in the back. They talk for hours, but once they have to deal with a practical measure where their principles and their ideologies are being applied, then they are hamstrung; they do not know what to say.</p>

<p>The preamble states first of all that this Bill is being produced at the request of the Bantu. We have denied it. It is not possible to say how many people will be directly affected by the provisions of this measure but we suspect that nearly half, if not the majority of those who will be affected have not been consulted at all, and they have certainly not expressed themselves in favour of the conception of this measure. We do not believe that the majority of the people living outside the Transkei or inside the Transkei understand or even wanted the principle, and the discussion at the last session of the Territorial Authority supports our view. Certainly, as the preamble says, the Territorial Authority asked for self-government, but it is quite clear from the original motion introduced at the Territorial Authority that they only asked for it because they could see themselves getting no other form of political representation. I just want to quote again the resolution as passed. This resolution was moved by a Pondo and reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in order to ease the present situation of uneasiness in the Union of South Africa and in view of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development and the fact that the Bantu people in the Union have no representation in the Union Legislature, this Authority in session respectfully requests the Government to declare the Transkeian Territories as a whole a separate governing state under the control of the Bantu people.</block>

<p>Sir, on other occasions I have quoted from these reports of the Territorial Authority speeches by others who supported that <span class="col_5849_5850" refersTo="page_0257"/>motion, and it is quite clear from their speeches that the sole reason for asking for this type of government was that they had been denied representation in this House. The most ardent protagonist of separate development, Chief Kaizer Matanzima, recognized this and at the last sitting of the Territorial Authority when this Bill was accepted he had to intervene because there was so much opposition to the measure from chiefs in the Territorial Authority. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The basic principle was that the Bantu of the Republic of South Africa had no share in the making of the laws of the country, and I submit it was this reason why the Council of Western Pondoland brought this motion to the Chamber.</block>

<p>He then went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The movers of this motion should never have brought this motion before the Government if they wanted a multi-racial parliament. Probably there has been terrorism going on and fears about death and so on for the traders in the Transkei and that is why there is so much confusion today.</block>

<p>The confusion was in the Territorial Authority, the body which is said to have asked for this legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not think it says <i>&#x201C;</i> unanimously At any rate it was requested by the Territorial Authority. There was so much confusion on the part of members, members who are opposing this type of Constitution, that they had to be reminded time and again by Chief Kaizer Matanzima and by his brother that they had asked for his form of government in 1961, and that they had passed a resolution the previous year accepting the recommendations of the Recess Committee. They were told that they would be made to look fools if they went back on the resolution passed by them originally. Sir, to show how little they understood it, Chief Kaiser Matanzima found it necessary to remind them that if they did not understand the terms of the Constitution, they could have got interpreters to interpret for them, because it became quite apparent too that they did not realize what was in this Bill. I say that as far as the claim is concerned that the Bantu themselves want this type of legislation, there is no foundation for it. I have raised this question with the Minister before in regard to the urban Bantu who are going to be affected just as much as those living in the Transkei. Again I say that there is no proof that any of them asked for this measure or in fact that they have been consulted either by the chiefs, or by this Government.</p>

<p>This preamble purports to give further powers of self-government to the Bantu. Not only does it give powers to govern Bantu but also non-Bantu and non-citizens as well as citizens. The Minister has made it clear that non-citizens of the Transkei, i.e. the Whites and Coloureds who are living there, will be treated as Pondos, and like foreigners in any other land they must obey the laws of the land in which they live. It is all very well for the Minister of Bantu Administration to say that the Whites and the Coloureds were warned years ago that this process was to take place. I think the first warning came in 1952, but there is no gainsaying the fact that when the Whites settled in those areas they were settling in their own homeland, and when those original settlers went there, there was no suggestion that they would one day be told that they were living in a foreign country. Sir, I have addressed the House frequently on the position of the Whites and the Coloureds. Suffice it to say that until the Prime Minister announces what he is prepared to do in giving compensation or other relief to us we feel that we are and we say that we are, being abandoned by the Government to the mercy of an unknown, an untried government. Sir, the Minister does not know and we do not know what type of government we will have in the Transkei. Nobody knows what type of electorate we will have in the Transkei. If every voter who might be qualified in terms of this Bill decided to apply for registration, you would have a most varied electorate ranging from the uncivilized, raw Native along the coast to the sophisticated, professional and businessmen on the Rand and in the other big cities of the Republic. We know that the chiefs themselves are divided. We do not know whether the voters will exercise the right to vote, or whether they will boycott elections. We do not know what influence the women will have on the election of representatives to the Assembly. The women have the vote in the same way as the man. Sir, it is supposed to be &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; but it depends on the number of wives the men may have. It may be &#x201C;four votes one man,&#x201D; or &#x201C;five votes one man.&#x201D; On the other hand the women may not abide by the decision of their husbands and vote contrary to their husbands.</p>

<p>&#x2026; and the Government has found to its cost that when women have objected to a law and decided to ignore the law, they have been much more difficult to deal with than the men. Sir, it is not only the non-citizens of the Transkei who worry about the type of government that they may get, <span class="col_5851_5852" refersTo="page_0258"/>but the Transkeian citizens themselves who are law-abiding and the mass of the population are worried about what will happen, and that is why they have expressed opposition to this form of government and that is why at the last session of the Territorial Authority the chiefs were trying to go back on this Constitution which they had accepted previously. It was because they realized that there was objection from their own subjects. Sir, the Minister is handing over administration and the power to make laws to this unknown and untried Government and in terms of Clause 37 of this Bill we forfeit our right to pass laws which are in conflict with the powers given to the Transkeian Government. The decision of the United Party not to move amendments to this Bill in the Committee Stage was based on the fact that we were so opposed to the wider principles to have nothing to do with the Bill. The fact remains that we found it necessary in the Committee Stage to move one amendment in order to try to save the sovereignty of this Government and to enable this Government to exercise control over the Transkeian Government, but as you know, Sir, that amendment was ruled out of order. The amendment was to the effect that nothing in this Bill would abolish &#x2026;</p>

<p>Clause 37 of this Bill abolishes and diminishes and derogates from the powers of this Parliament, and as it stands now it definitely derogates from the sovereignty of this Parliament and gives a measure of sovereignty to the Transkeian Government. It is all very well saying that the Government of the Republic has all the necessary powers, as certain Government members have said, because the State President must give his assent before a Bill can be passed, and he may also issue proclamations removing ambiguities, and in terms of Clause 70 he can amend existing laws or make new laws. But if there is a conflict between the Government of the Transkei and this Government, it will be the President who will in fact have to exercise his veto over the Transkei Government. It is all right for members living hundreds of miles away from the Transkei to face the fact that there may be a conflict between the two Governments, but we living in the Transkei are not very happy at the thought of our position if there is any serious conflict between the two Governments, and if hostility does develop how will it be resolved? There is nothing in this Bill which makes provision for difficulties to be resolved. There is nothing in this Bill which deals with the position where the Transkeian Government refuses to accept the advice of the State President. We have had instances of other Governments having difficulty with neighbouring Governments, and where there was no way of resolving the difficulty they had one recourse and that was to go to UNO or to go to other Governments for assistance. The Minister of Information has attempted to allay people&#x2019;s fears by telling them that if there is any conflict the Government of the Republic will not allow any foreign Government to intervene or establish itself in any position of authority in the Transkei. You will remember. Sir, that he made that ridiculous statement that if they did we would take the same line as America took with Cuba. This question of a possible conflict between the two Governments is a very serious one. I regard as one of the most serious aspects of this the fact that you will or can bring about a conflict between the Government of the Republic and of the Transkei. with no obvious solution provided for in this measure. I think the main weakness of this Bill is that it endeavours to give self-government to an area which is not viable. In terms of this Bill provision is made for giving financial assistance to the Transkeian Government, because the Government of the Republic recognizes the fact that they do not have the means to be able to carry on on their own; that they are an impoverished state.</p>

<p>Sir, right from the beginning they have to look for assistance, and without allowing European capital and initiative to go in and develop the area, it will always remain an impoverished state. That is inevitable. The Transkeian Government will never be able to get out of its position of dependence for financial assistance on the Government of the Republic because these people have nothing; there is nothing that they can tax. The pople are paying as much in taxation at the present time as they can pay. There is no other way in which the Transkeian Government can earn revenue. The only thing that they can do of course, is to put into power a Government which does not support the policy of the Government of the Republic, and if they put in a Cabinet which is opposed to the Government of the Republic and that Cabinet decides to open up the Transkei with White initiative and the employment of White capital and decided, for instance to open up the coastline to tourist traffic, offering White people facilities on the coast. what would be the attitude of this Government to the Government of the Transkei when this Government has made it quite clear that it will not allow White initiative and White capital and White settlement in that area? There is nothing in the Bill to stop the Cabinet of the Transkei from carrying out that policy if it so desires. Sir, the opposition of the mass of the Africans and especially of the educated African in the Transkei to this form of Government is based on the fear that the Transkei will become isolated and impoverished. One Paramount Chief described the position of the Transkei, after the passing of this Constitution as being the equivalent to a pigsty isolated. with nobody wanting to go to it. Yesterday when we pointed out that <span class="col_5853_5854" refersTo="page_0259"/>the Transkeian Government would at all times have to look to the Government of the Republic for financial assistance, the Minister made the promise that he would give that assistance. I pointed out that at the present time the Transkei was being subsidized not by this Government but by the Cape Province to the extent of over R 800,000 a year for the maintenance of roads. They are being subsidized, not by the Government of the Republic but by the Province, for the maintenance of hospitals in the sum of R904,000. Sir, is it fair to expect the Cape Province to continue to subsidize the Transkei if the Transkei is to become an independent state? The Minister has undertaken to subsidize the roads, but he has not told us on what basis. He has not given us any assurance that he will give them as much for roads as the province has been spending on roads. We do not know what he is going to give them for the maintenance of provincial roads. They do not know what the position is going to be with regard to their hospitals; whether the province will be prepared to spend money when it knows that in terms of this Bill provincial property may be handed over to the new Government without any compensation.</p>

<p>Sir, I raised the question of Port St. Johns. This is a most important question. Port St. Johns is excluded from the area which is eventually to become the area of jurisdiction of the Transkeian Government, but the only way of access to Port St. Johns &#x2026;</p>

<p>On a point of order, earlier this afternoon the debate was completely open. We talked about Gaul and places in history 2,000 years ago. The hon. member is talking about something which is essential to the Bill. Sir, I must protest against what has been going on to-day.</p>

<p>Order! I have been very fair; I have allowed a certain amount of latitude in discussions. I do not know what happened before I occupied the Chair. The hon. member cannot discuss Port St. Johns. For the purposes of this Bill it is not part of the Transkeian Territory.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I have no intention of discussing it further except to point out that the roads which do give access to a part of the Republic will be taken over by the new Government and al! I am asking is how the Minister is going to subsidize this road. Will he give an assurance now that he will at all times see that that road is maintained in the proper state of repair in which it is to-day? The Minister took exception yesterday to the suggestion that civil servants may find themselves without pay. I point out again that this Transkeian Government will have to depend on the charity of the South African Government. The civil servants who are being transferred in terms of this constitution are being so transferred whether they like it or not. The Minister has abandoned them. What shocked me yesterday was when he said this, that they must serve their own people and that if they were not prepared to do so they must go. He said &#x201C;as hulle dienste nie verder nodig is nie dan moet die Republiek hulle net ontslaan&#x201D;. An assurance was given by the Prime Minister that all civil servants would be protected, that the civil servants need not worry about their position. He was not going to sacrifice them in the way they have been sacrificed by the British Government. It is quite clear to me that in terms of this constitution the Black civil servants and the White civil servants are being treated on a different basis. Surely a man&#x2019;s security in the Civil Service does not depend on the colour of his skin. What is the Minister going to do with those civil servants who joined the service of the Republic and who are now told that they will have to work under a new Government whether they like it or not and that if there is no work for them there they will be sacked?</p>

<p>Clause 60 provides for the handing over of municipal property. This will mean that as municipal areas are zoned and certain portions are handed over to the new Government all progress must stop. There will be no more desire to provide facilities and new services. The ratepayers will say that they are not prepared to undertake the responsibility for any new loans not knowing when they will find half their municipal area or Village Management Board area taken out of their control. The Minister says it will be done by proclamation. He said that the terms of the handing over would be set out in the proclamation but we want a statement now as to what is going to happen. It should be stated in this constitution what compensation will be given to these municipalities and these villages.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) treated us to the Gallic Wars and he said that the development which was now taking place in the Transkei was a combination of the old customary tribal habits and democracy. He is not the only one who has said that. The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) said the same thing. I should like to point out that the position in Britain is not at all akin to the position in the Transkei. You have heredity rulers in Britain admittedly and provision is made for them in the Legislature of the country. I do not think you will find any other legislative body in the world except Basutoland, where you have heredity rulers and elected rulers sitting in the same <span class="col_5855_5856" refersTo="page_0260"/>chamber. Wherever they have sat in the same chamber it has failed and it must fail here. The whole basis of having heredity rulers as the hon. the Minister has pointed out, was to have a better form of government because heredity rulers did not have to look for popular favour, they could govern as they thought best because they would not have to worry about the polling booth. By bringing heredity rulers and elected members into the same House now, the Minister is abandoning that basis. You are now going to have heredity rulers and elected members competing for popular favour and the heredity rulers may find themselves opposed by elected members whose political philosophy is quite different from the territory which they, the heredity rulers, represent. The Paramount Chiefs and chiefs, who will form part of this Government, will only keep their seats and maintain their position if they attend every session. If a chief fails to attend a session of the new Parliament and that Parliament itself decides not to condone his absence he loses his position as chief. Can you imagine the conflicts you might have in that Assembly? These chiefs do not only represent one tribe. It is not a homogeneous nation; there are several different tribes and up till recent years there were frequently tribal clashes. Each tribe has not got the same number of chiefs in the Assembly. It means that you will find that chiefs take sides with other elected members against other chiefs. Instead of having a battle on the battlefield you will have the battle in the Assembly. If a chief is annoyed at what happens in the Assembly and decides to boycott the Assembly in future he may find himself losing his seat and if he loses his seat he loses his position as a chief or Paramount chief. This is a most serious position because unless the other chiefs decide to condone his absence he loses his seat and consequently his position as chief. What happens if the tribe decides to keep him as a chief or as the Paramount chief? Then there will be a conflict and who is going to solve that conflict? There is nothing in this constitution which deals with the position where a chief has lost his seat. Supposing the tribe says they are not going to elect anybody else, that he is their Paramount Chief and that they want him to represent them in the Assembly? Why is the British system successful in Britain? It is because the Paramount Peer does not even go into the House of Lords; it is the King. He does not even go there; he keeps aloof of politics. These chiefs and Paramount Chiefs should also keep aloof of politics. The only way in which a system of co-operation can work between heredity rulers and elected members is by having separate bodies. The Minister should know what has happened to the north of us. Wherever you had heredity rulers and elected members in the same chamber, as is provided for here, the chiefs have lost out.</p>

<p>We are told that this constitution is a natural development. The Government has promised to give the Africans this development because they &#x201C;desired nothing for themselves which they were not prepared to give them There is no power in this new constitution which could not have been given under the old Bunga system. The only difference is this that this type of constitution is necessary for the body which is now planned because of the degree of sovereignty which is being given, because of the powers which are being taken out of the hands of the Government of the Republic. The hon. member for Randfontein said that all we were doing was to give a major child self-responsibility. He said the White people ought to be glad that this child could now manage its own affairs and relieving the rest of the country of responsibility. But that is a lot of nonsense. We are not being relieved of any responsibility by setting this child free, because this child is not in a position to maintain itself. Because of that position, and because it will always have to look to us, it will always be under an obligation to the Government of the Republic, he will always have a feeling of resentment against this Government because he will always have to come hat in hand to this Government to ask for money so that he can carry on. They are going to build up a feeling of resentment because nobody likes a feeling of being under an obligation. Previously they were all part of us and they were entitled to get financial assistance; they were entitled to expect their roads to be maintained as part of the Republic. I have addressed this House on several occasions on the position of the White and the Coloured man in the Transkei. I have continually reminded the Government that we are there and of his responsibility towards us. That has also been of no avail. This legislation is now to be passed. With the final implementation of the policy of the Government which is being started now by the passage of this measure, if it is allowed to be implemented in full, the betrayal by this Government of the Whites and the Coloureds in the Transkei is unsurpassed by any betrayal on the part of the British Government of its own subjects to the north of us. That hon. member laughs. I am going to repeat: Until we get some definite statement from this Government, from the Prime Minister, as to what he intends doing with the White people and how he intends looking after us and the Coloured people, we feel that we have been abandoned. Not only do we and the Coloureds want monetary compensation but what about the law-abiding African who does not want to live under that Government? You must remember this too, Sir, that we will be living under a foreign Government and this Government must always bear in mind, whatever conflict there is with the Government of the Transkei, that its subjects are living out there unprotected in the rural areas. It will always have to be the responsibility of this Government to bear that in mind. We look to them to do that for us at least.</p>

<from><span class="col_5857_5858" refersTo="page_0261"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I think hon. members will realize, having regard to the nature of a third-reading debate, that it will not be necessary for me to deal with all the matters which hon. members have raised here. I shall try as far as possible to deal with the effect of this legislation, as hon. members have put it.</p>

<p>In his great struggle this morning to find certain arguments against the salutory effect of this legislation on the Transkei, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition reminded me very much of the man who was looking for the proverbial needle in a haystack. It was really pathetic to see how the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had to struggle to find any arguments against the salutory effect that this measure will have on the Transkei. He himself actually gave the reply which I was supposed to give him. He stated that there was really a basic difference between the approach of the Opposition to this matter and the approach of this side of the House. The answer is definitely that there is a basic difference between the two sides of the House. Having regard to this basic difference it is natural that the Opposition will see bogies where no bogies exist at all. This important difference between us has become more apparent than ever before during this discussion. We are convinced that what the Opposition see as things which will have a detrimental effect, will in fact have a very salutory effect on the Transkei and on South Africa.</p>

<p>One of the important arguments of the Leader of the Opposition is that there has been no proper consultation. That was one of his objections, and that is why he stated that this measure would not have a salutory effect on the Transkei. Sir, I have already replied to that in the past. It is a remarkable thing that while making this statement members on the other side at the same time make use of reports which show that there was consultation. I want to repeat the challenge which I have so often made to the Opposition to prove that there is any country in the whole of Africa which has become emancipated and where the people concerned were consulted in connection with their constitution as much as the Bantu of the Transkei were consulted. The Territorial Authority is a responsible body and nobody can or will deny that that body represents the Bantu of the Transkei. The Territorial Authority represents 95 per cent or more of the masses in the Transkei. It is the recognized mouthpiece of the people. That is a fact which nobody can deny.</p>

<p>I want to concede at once that the objection of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was really in connection with the Bantu outside the Transkei. The fact of the matter is that we ask the Bantu leaders to send for their recognized leaders in the cities or whereever they might be; we provided the necessary facilities and discussed this matter with them too. I have already pointed out on a previous occasion that about 40 to 50 leaders of the Bantu of various places came to attend the discussions. They came from Cape Town, East London, Johannesburg and other places. They were consulted therefore. I say without fear of contradiction that in no single country in the whole of Africa was there a greater degree of consultation and co-operation in connection with their constitution than there was in the case of the Transkei. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that a further effect of this legislation will be conflict between White and non-White and conflict between the Transkeian Government and this Government. He said that this legislation would have a separatist effect as far as the people of this country and of the Transkei are concerned. In this regard we have the lessons of history and those lessons very definitely support what the Government is doing here. We see what conflicts there are over the whole world from day to day. Just think of the ugly things which are taking place in America; think of the ugly things which are taking place in England where there is only a small number of non-Whites. What is the basic cause of those clashes? It is the very thing that we are trying to avoid by means of this legislation. The lessons of history and the facts prove that the only method to follow is the policy of separate development. Here I want to say again that the vast majority of the people whom we consulted also adopted the attitude that they were against a multi-racial parliament for the Transkei, that they were against the principle of a multi-racial unitary state. As the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) has pointed out, there were others who adopted a different attitude but if he goes carefully into those cases he will find that they were drilled by a White man and that in their heart of hearts they did not believe what they were saying. He also says that we did not consult all the various sections. I want to admit at once that we did not consult Mr. Patrick Duncan and his section because that would have been a slap in the face of the Bantu in the Transkei. We did not consult the supporters of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) because we know that they are the victims of a small group of Whites who are misleading them. Surely we cannot be expected to consult people of that kind. We have to consult the people whom the Bantu themselves recognize as their leaders and net those who Mr. Patrick Duncan and his clique appointed as leaders. There is no idea which the Bantu find more abhorrent than the idea that we should consult those people who are simply instruments m the hands of other sections and groups. I want to say here at once that the effect of this legislation, in a very tangible fashion, is going to bring clarity in South Africa, also in the minds of those people who still refuse to believe and who still refuse to understand. All those shadows of doubt which have hung over South Africa for such a very long time will disappear as a result of this legislation. Those people who are simply instruments in the <span class="col_5859_5860" refersTo="page_0262"/>minds of the Whites but also in the minds of the Bantu. The apartheid legislation that we have already introduced in this House is basically designed not to discriminate, but to eliminate and to obviate clashes. That is the basic principle of our apartheid legislation. When we introduced apartheid legislation in the past there were people&#x2014;I refer to the Press particularly&#x2014;who continually tried to make the world believe that we were perpetrating a fraud, that we were bluffing the world and that we were committing an act of dishonesty against the Bantu of South Africa. I am glad that the hon. member for Houghton has had the courage to admit that it has surprised many people that we have come forward with this legislation. They did not believe that we would do so, in spite of the fact that we consistently announced that that was our intention. This is one of the things which created a great measure of dissatisfaction in the hearts of the Bantu; it created a great measure of doubt in the hearts of the Whites, and it also created doubt in the outside world in respect of South Africa&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>The object of this legislation is to remove those shadows of doubt and make it clear to everybody, that the National Party earnestly desires to give effect to the promises made by it and to the policy announced by it and that it is not merely deceiving the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. S. F. Steyn) has already pointed out the incorrectness of the statement made by the hon. member for Houghton to the effect that this legislation represents a considerable departure from the policy of the National Party; that we have suddenly realized that the reins of government cannot be retained in the hands of the White man only. It has always been our policy, and it was our policy even in the days of the old Republic, to give the Bantu a measure of say and self-government in their areas.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to the relationship which existed between the Republic of the Transvaal and Swaziland. I do not want to go into that history again, but that has always been our attitude. I have frequently pointed out that the promise was made to the Bantu by the White man that he would be given self-government. I have said before that we have reached the stage where we must realize that we cannot satisfy the Bantu with promises only; that we must also take positive steps. This is simply the logical implementation of the policy that we have always announced and the time is ripe now to give effect to it. Our whole Party realizes that the time is ripe now to give effect to it. That is why we are giving effect to it and not because we have become frightened or anything of that nature. This is the logical and natural development of our policy. This Bill confirms and makes it clear to everybody that it is the Government&#x2019;s earnest desire to carry out to the last letter of the law the policy which it has always announced and that we are not going to flinch from it. I want to say here quite candidly that I take no notice of the fuss which the outside world is making. My policy and my conviction are dictated by my conscience and by what is good and right for my fatherland, for South Africa. That is my criterion in these matters, and that is the criterion of every Nationalist. That is why we are unanimous about this Bill and that is the reason for the enthusiasm evidenced in regard to this Bill. It has been said here that we have not consulted the Bantu sufficiently. But without fear of contradiction I should like to state that the Bill we have before us to-day is the creation of the Bantu of the Transkei. There are people here who doubted that, people who laughed about it, and those who even said it was untrue. I repeat that this Bill is the creation of the Bantu of the Transkei. The basic things in this Bill were created by them. I have already said on a previous occasion that the hon. the Prime Minister suggested certain things to them here and there, but thereafter he said, as I did too, &#x201C;That is your affair; if you feel you cannot do it, you must say so; it is your creation&#x201D;. And then they adjourned and discussed it amongst themselves. It goes without saying that the officials had to give technical guidance. Our legal advisers had to give them technical guidance. But does that not happen, too, in regard to every Act passed in every Parliament in the world? Then surely hon. members have no right to come here and deny that this is the creation of the Bantu of the Transkei?</p>

<p>Only this morning the Executive of the Territorial Authority met in Umtata and they passed a unanimous resolution there in which they expressed their thanks to me for the fact that this Bill had gone through in the form in which they asked for and that I had refused to accept any amendments and they pleaded with me: Be firm as far as the passage of this Bill is concerned and see to it that it is passed, unchanged by Parliament. They have done so spontaneously. After all they are people who act in a responsible manner. How can hon. members now say it is not their creation? I repeat that our legal advisers assisted them, but that happens with every Act in every country in the world. Not only do we have an individual creation; we also have a creation that is quite new. This Bill really and truly is a quite new creation in the constitutional history of the world, and I think we have every reason to be proud of it. And here you have the basic feature to which particular reference has been made by one of the hon. members, that here you have a combination of what is good and fine in the government system of the Bantu of the Transkei as well as the best to be found in Western civilization. In other words, care has been taken here, and the world will still be thankful for that, to ensure that the roots and the structure of the Xhosa tree will remain unchanged, that it will not be uprooted, but that at the same time it will be fertilized with the best to be had from Western civilization which, as it develops, will bear the Xhosa stamp, and the people will <span class="col_5861_5862" refersTo="page_0263"/>feel that it is their own creation. That is one of the most important things that has to be done in the life of a nation, and it is in this respect that the world has erred in other countries in Africa, where constitutions perfectly in accordance with the model of Downing Street have been created, and forced upon the people, and they have been told: Everything that is different is not constitutional. I am surprised that the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) made the submission he did. He should really not have been the member for Zululand, but the member for Downing Street, because really a good Zulu would not talk the way like that. A Zulu is too proud. It is the basic approach to create a pattern, to create a constitution which they can feel is their own; it is not something strange. And here I think we have rendered a service to Africa, and we have rendered a service to the world. South Africa has lit a torch. When one refers to the reports of the various conferences of the African States in recent years, there is one important thing that always strikes one, namely that in the end they always come forward with the proposition: &#x201C;Africa has no soul as yet.&#x201D; They are trying to give Africa a soul. In other words, they must seek for the creation of something indigenous in their constitutions. And I make this submission here this afternoon, that in the case of the Transkei, the Xhosa of the Transkei need not go in search of a soul. They have retained their own soul, and that soul can develop further. There we have rendered the world a service, and we have lit a torch for Africa constitutionally. I make bold to say that this constitution will yet serve as a model for many States of Africa, if not now then in the years to come.</p>

<p>This constitution will also have another effect, and that is that we have always been charged with wanting to keep the Bantu in a state of barbarism, that the basis of our policy is to force him back into his primitive state, to keep him as primitive as possible, to keep him in the bush. This thing has been sent forth into the world to such an extent that this is one of the things the world holds against us. This constitution to-day is the active repudiation of that charge against us, against the National Party. Yes, we are now frequently told that we are going too far! Here the proof has been adduced that we have produced a constitution in collaboration with the Bantu, a constitution which has its own soul, but at the same time embodies the best in Western civilization. It will still serve as the model for many nations, not only for the Bantu; indeed, it will yet serve as a model for some White nations.</p>

<p>This constitution will have a further effect, namely that it will herald a new era for the creation of good human relations between the Whites and the Bantu here in South Africa. I have already pointed out that they are now beginning to realize that all the tales they have been told to the effect that we just want to keep them in a primitive state etc., that we really do no want to set them on the road to development and progress, that all that is untrue, and this constitution will give the lie to those stories. In the course of time they themselves will come to realize that all those stories are untrue, and that alone will bring about a new relationship in South Africa.</p>

<p>It will also create a new relationship in South Africa because proof is being given that the White man can in fact be trusted. Why? Because in the hearts of the Bantu there has always been uncertainty, particularly in the Transkei, in regard to the question as to what would become of their territory one day, and as to whether it would not also ultimately all become the White man&#x2019;s territory. That uncertainty is being removed.</p>

<p>Another effect the Bill will have is that it now paves the way for the creation of good neighbourliness in South Africa. Good neighbourliness is the only basis upon which good relations can be built up. I should just like to mention a few reasons for that. An important thing is being done here, namely the recognition of the Bantu as a human being. As I said the other evening, his dignity as a human being is being recognized. What is more, recognition is here being given to the dignity of the Bantu, not only as human beings, but also as a nation. Because a man and his race are indivisible, despite everything the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) says. One must have sunk very low to have severed completely the ties with one&#x2019;s nation. I wish to submit that this is not so in the case of the Bantu, with very few exceptions. The Bantu has remained bound to his own national traditions, and this constitution will allow the Xhosa people to live as a nation once again. That is one of the things they have felt so deeply during past years. There have been conflicts, and strong efforts have been made to destroy them as a nation. This has left its mark on their hearts but now it is being removed and proof is being given to them that here is a Government which recognizes that they also have a right to exist as a nation. Nothing will foster good race relations better than that very recognition. Because it is where recognition is not given to this basic principle in the life of man and the life of a nation that racial clashes occur. This Bill accords recognition, expressly and unquestionably, to the culture of the Bantu. Certain important principles have been embodied in this Bill that could stand before the whole world, and one of them is that in their system of government, which constitutes a part of their culture, they have certain things that are on asset to the world. We need not be ashamed of that, but we can be proud of it. What can create better race relations than that one should also recognize the culture of a nation? The fact that in other parts of Africa the Bantu have been looked down upon frequently because they have no culture, or only a kind of culture derived from the French or the English or whosoever it may be, was one of the greatest <span class="col_5863_5864" refersTo="page_0264"/>causes of the hatred of the White man that arose in Africa. Had that not been done, Africa could have been spared much agony. Here the Government has taken the wise step of recognizing the cultural riches of the Bantu, and the Government is encouraging the development thereof in such a manner that it is enriched by what is best in Western civilization. That approach can only result in creating good race relations in South Africa.</p>

<p>This Bill will also have a valuable economic effect. It will promote the economic development of the Transkei. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories has said that the economic development of the Transkei will now come to a halt. The hon. member for Houghton has said that the Transkei is about the poorest place in the whole word. It is terribly poor. This kind of sneering statement is being made. If the Transkei is so poor, I am surprised at what provides the White people in the Transkei with a livelihood and what is making them so wealthy and why, if it is such a poor part, they are unwilling to get out of the Transkei. I want to say that if we were to remove the Bantu from the Transkei and leave the Whites there alone, with only their present income, what would it look like then? The Transkei is not so very poor. The Transkei is a country of possibilities. But I should also like to submit that in my humble view the development in the Transkei was wrong. Was it right that in a Bantu area one should have had that phenomenon that a large number of White towns arose which lived largely really on the labour and on the revenue produced by those people? Should it not have been the other way about? Should we not have had a large number of Bantu towns in the Transkei? Surely that would have been the proper development. And I hasten to say that nobody appreciates more than I do the services those White people have in the meantime rendered to the Bantu. I admit that the White people have rendered a great service to the Bantu, services the Bantu could not have rendered himself. But this is my submission: If we really are concerned about the Bantu of the Transkei, and really are concerned about the economic development of the Transkei, then we should follow the pattern of all the countries of the world then one should have the Bantu towns and the Bantu towns really growing on the income of the people living there. For that is where the tertiary industries are developed, in which the vast majority of those people make their living. An hon. member has referred to the report of the Tomlinson Commission in which it is stated that only a certain number of farmers can live there. That is quite correct. In other countries of the world one also finds that only a small percentage of people can make a living out of farming alone, and that secondary and tertiary industries have to be created for the others. The rest of the people derive a livelihood from that. Is it not a fact that there is a stream of Bantu always flowing to the White areas? Is that not an accusation against the White man in South Africa? But that is the pattern the hon. member for Houghton wishes to see in South Africa. The pattern must be such that the development will come about in the area itself, and that one should not virtually drive out the people in the way Basutoland at the present time is driving its inhabitants out, but that a country should embrace its children and that its inhabitants should live in it, as the decent Jews are doing in Palestine to-day.</p>

<p>Why has the Transkei developed in this way? For the very reason that one of the most important elements have been omitted. The whole community should be actively engaged in the process of development, and one of the most important tasks in that process of development is that there should be a responsible Government with duties to perform. That state of mind created in the past, particularly under the old Bunga, was unfortunate. That old Bunga always took the following kinds of resolutions: &#x201C;We respectfully request the Government to do this or to do that Surely that state of mind is a cancer in the nation&#x2019;s life. How can one exterminate it? Only when one entrusts those people with responsibility, with the task of the development of their own area. In that way alone permanent and sound development can take place there.</p>

<p>Surely it is senseless to think that we should just go on doing patchwork continually. One can only develop the territory, and help it to develop itself, when everything is set in motion, when a sense of responsibility is fostered, when a spirit of enterprise is fostered, and when they themselves acquire all the skills for the development of their nation. That will bring development in the Transkei, for now we will see that the Bantu exerting himself to mobilize capital also, which was not done formerly, because they did not know how to develop the area. We are already having this phenomenon, with the development of our Bantu Authorities system, that a new state of mind is developing among the Bantu.</p>

<p>I now come to an important phenomenon, and that is that in the Transkei that ceiling that always hung over the heads of the Bantu is being removed, that ceiling which the policy of the Opposition wants to have hanging over the heads of the Bantu in South Africa constantly. That ceiling is being taken away, and every Bantu boy and girl, in every sphere of life, may climb to the highest rung in the life of his or her nation. A boy or girl who now receives education and who produces results knows that for him or her there now awaits a task in the Transkei, and once one has harnessed the officials there, what is going to be the impact of that on the ordinary people? What is going to be the impact economically? But I go further and I should like to ask you: Just think for a moment what the reaction of that is going to be in respect of human relations, in respect of race relations? They <span class="col_5865_5866" refersTo="page_0265"/>will feel that here the Government of the Republic of South Africa comes along and they remove this ceiling, and the boys and girls of the Transkei can now climb to the highest rung in their national life. Surely that means a tremendous lot to a nation. But I say further that now for the first time we are going to create the state of mind that those boys and girls will not flee from their communities but that they will harness their talents and their abilities in the interests of their own national aspirations. They will enrich their own nation spiritually and materially. The hon. member for Kempton Park has appealed to the educated Bantu particularly to show what they can do now. How many will there not be in future who will be thankful to us that this opportunity has been created for them?</p>

<p>In other words, the effect of this Bill is that those possibilities and opportunities will be created for the boys and girls of the Bantu in the Transkei. And it has this advantage, that it not only binds the Xhosa in the White areas to those people, but that they will also make an active contribution to the development of that area. Do not forget that a large number of the people who have knowledge and skill are in the White area. Why? Because in the Transkei there are no opportunities for them, and here they can earn a wage. But harness those people, give them an opportunity there, and do you mean to tell me that they will remain here? I can give the House the assurance to-day that several educated Bantu have already made inquiries about what they can go and do in the Transkei, and where they can be used, people who are offering their services. In other words, for the first time the manpower of the Transkei will be mobilized for the development of the Transkei itself. The people will not flee from their own territory to go and struggle for an existence elsewhere. One thing must be borne in mind. Whatever the Opposition may advocate, under their policy an educated Bantu will never have the opportunity to develop fully and to use his best endeavours to the fullest extent in all the facets of life.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Another effect this Bill will have throughout the Transkei as well as in South Africa, will be that a spirit of confidence, a spirit of co-operation will be created, for it is one of the basic principles in this Bill that in future there will be still greater co-operation with the Government than in the past, that a spirit of co-operation and confidence will be built up. Hon. members have raised objections in regard to consultation. This Bill specially paves the way to that by the relations it will create. Spiritually and materially they will get an opportunity to serve their own nation and to create a new attitude towards the White man. I want to endorse what the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) has stated so clearly, and that is that this Bill in the first place comes as a challenge to the Bantu. In their hearts they have the urge to manage their own affairs. A large proportion of them are asking for freedom and for opportunities. Here the opportunities are being created and the educated Bantu can accept this challenge and show that he will give his services for the development of his own nation. There is a challenge also to the teachers, for now they are getting the opportunities to train boys and girls who will be an asset to and the pride of their nation, boys and girls imbued with the ideal of service. Now it will not be necessary for them to get out of the Bantu areas to go and work for a meagre wage for the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). The challenge also comes for them to develop a sense of responsibility. That has always been one of the shortcomings in the life of the Bantu, but were we not also to a large extent to blame for it, owing to the fact that former Governments wanted to pamper them in everything? But here they are getting an opportunity to do something themselves and to serve their own people. They are given the opportunity to learn to work with money, which has always been a weak point with the Bantu, and that also is a challenge to them. But have the White people not mainly been the cause of that, because former Governments did not even take the trouble to train them how to work with money? But the Bill also is a challenge to the White man of South Africa to grant the Bantu a future also. Here proof is being afforded that this side of the House is prepared to grant the Bantu a future, and living room and opportunities that every nation in the world desires, and to show that they are prepared to give the Bantu a home that is his fatherland. The White man who will not accept that challenge renders a disservice to South Africa. We cannot say that the locations in the cities and towns are their fatherland. That will never be so. They can only have a fatherland when they are tied to it, spiritually and materially, and that is what this Bill is doing. It is a challenge to the White man also to create possibilities and opportunities for them in their own fatherland, which is the only moral basis for any policy that may exist. Hon. members have blamed me for giving them certain symbols. It is my submission that every nation is entitled to those symbols that represent its nationhood, and a party that begrudges another nation those symbols, perpetrates an injustice in regard to that nation. I have already said it is not we who are offering them these symbols; they asked for them, and their symbols are one of the proofs to the world that the nationhood of the Xhosa is taking shape and form. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) has said there are various sections among them. That is quite correct, but among the White people also there are various sections, and even in Scotland there are clans, and they are proud of it, but that does not debar them from being good Scots or Britons. These symbols are the <span class="col_5867_5868" refersTo="page_0266"/>building factor for an own nationhood. In that lies the sound approach of this policy, that we grant them that nationhood which every nation in the world craves. I am deeply convinced that this Bill rings in a new era for South Africa, an era of co-operation and mutual trust, and a new era also of certainty in every sphere of life, certainty also for the future of the White man, and certainty for the Black man about his own future.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>The effect of this clause is to allow universities to be recognized which do not give reciprocity to this country. That is a principle which can be carried too far. While I can well understand the Minister wishing to have it as a temporary measure because there are refugees and immigrants coming into the country, nevertheless it has some undesirable features. It permits people to practice here on diplomas which might not allow them to practice in their own countries or in the countries where they obtained the diplomas. That is being left out in this clause. It is referred to in a previous clause, but I think it should be made clear by the Minister that he will amend Section 8 of the principal Act so as to make this clause clear. It also allows the Minister to withdraw recognition from certain universities, <span class="col_5869_5870" refersTo="page_0267"/>not because they perhaps do not satisfy the standards, but because they fail to provide information. I have no objection to this clause. I think it is quite reasonable, but it could actually seriously affect students from South Africa who may have gone there, because this is a course which lasts for some years and the students may have gone there in good faith because that university degree was accepted by this country, but after one or two years the Minister could take away that right from the university. I know a little more about this than the Minister does. We had similar difficulties in the Medical Council, and according to the Minister this has not been submitted to the Medical Council for approval. Therefore I want to draw the notice of the Minister to this, so that if at any time he withdraws recognition from a university he will bear in mind that he must allow time between the date of warning the university and taking away the recognition, so that any of our students who may be there will not be deleteriously affected. We do not want a student to study for a year or two and then to be told that when he gets his degree it will not be recognized.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I support the hon. member who has just sat down. In this country we are particularly short of veterinary surgeons. Are we going to have students kept back from their studies through little matters that could perhaps be settled by further investigation and by an approach to the university authorities overseas? We need all the veterinarians we can get. Even if they are only research workers; we need them very badly indeed. It does seem that the least the Minister could do is to investigate the matter more fully before taking steps such as this, which may debar students from completing their studies.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The point raised by the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) is a very real one, because it means that the young man, having gone overseas to these universities in all good faith to take up a course in regard to which the degree of that university is recognized, may have done a few years of a four or five years&#x2019; course only to find that the recognition which was previously granted to that university at the time he went there has been withdrawn. It lies within the Minister&#x2019;s power, in this clause as it stands, to obviate that situation, and I hope that in his reply he will indicate that he is aware of this problem and will follow a course which will obviate this difficulty. That means that he will have to take cognizance of the words &#x201C;after a date specified in the proclamation&#x201D; in line 30. It means that in promulgating a proclamation withdrawing recognition from a university, he will have to make it operative some years forward. In other words, he will have to give some years&#x2019; notice of the proposed withdrawal of the recognition of a university degree, so that young men who have already begun their courses will have time to finish before the recognition given to that university is withdrawn. If the Minister says he will only use this power in that sense, by suspending its operation for a number of years after the promulgation of the proclamation, any hardship will be obviated. I would suggest that he also allows a year&#x2019;s grace because all students do not get through their examinations the first time, and it is only fair to allow these students to finish their courses before the recognition is taken away.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I should also like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the mere putting it forward will mean usually that the university or school concerned will immediately try to find out why the Minister has withdrawn the recognition, and in practice it usually means that when it is pointed out to this university in what way they have failed to satisfy the standards in this country, it immediately goes to the trouble to remedy it, and if he then withdraws his cancellation &#x01A1;f the recognition they can carry on quite satisfactorily.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>I think hon. members on the other side are unnecessarily afraid of the provisions of this clause, because the old Act specifically mentions certain universities in other countries which have no reciprocal agreements with Commonwealth countries. The Act mentions and recognizes certain universities for South African students who study there. The Veterinary Board will not suddenly come along therefore and regard the courses of recognized universities of outstanding quality as failing to comply with our standards. To my mind that problem does not exist therefore, particularly as far as our own students are concerned. This really relates not so much to South African students who study overseas, but what we want to do is to give veterinarians who have received degrees in other countries and at other universities, which are not mentioned perhaps in the old Act, and people who are not South Africans, the opportunity to qualify here for registration with the approval of the Board.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) stated at the beginning of his speech that I had said that this Bill had not been submitted to the Medical Council. I do not know where he heard that, but that is not what I said. This measure was submitted to the Medical Council and they agreed with it. The main reason why it was submitted to the Medical Council is that this measure interferes with the right which medical practitioners had under the old Act to provide veterinary services. It was for that reason that the Council&#x2019;s approval was sought, and the Council gave its approval to the whole of this Bill. I want to give the assurance that if it should happen that the degree of any faculty of a university cannot be recognized, it will only be done after due deliberation, having regard to any possible inconvenience which might be caused to South <span class="col_5871_5872" refersTo="page_0268"/>African students at such university, but I hope that that will never happen.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that. Why I am concerned about this matter is that Clause 2 is based on a most unusual way of going about things. The decision is based on the fact that the university refuses to give information, or does not give information, and not on the fact that it is a bad university. Now the university may not be interested in some immigrant who comes here and they may not bother to answer his letters. These things happen. So it is not based on the merits of the degree. The point is that it is based purely and simply on the failure to give information. I think it is unreasonable to have such a clause and therefore the Minister should realize what he is doing. Nor do I altogether agree with him that it will not apply to South Africans. He himself said that he has limited the number of veterinary surgeons who qualify in this country. It is now only 45 a year. That is what it amounts to. On all sides we hear of this shortage of veterinary surgeons. If that is so, there will be students from this country going overseas, and they go to universities which he has already recognized. The same thing happens in America. But we find in medicine that more and more of our students are going to other countries. They go to Belgium, for instance, because Great Britain, after the war, had no room for our students. We have students now in Belgium, because there the Afrikaner students have a language there which they can understand easily. But they write to the S.A. Medical Council first and ask whether the Medical Council will recognize this school. Well, it is investigated and then permission is given and they are assured that they will be accepted.</p>

Our students know it, but will the veterinary students know it and will the Veterinary Board take any notice of them when they write to the Board? This is not quite such a simple matter as it looks on the face of it. It is only after years of experience that the Medical Council has been finding out the difficulties. I am trying to point out a few of the difficulties which should be known to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>Sir, I have no objection to that part of the amending clause in which the Minister refers to any person who for gain practices as a veterinarian and performs an action of this nature. I can quite see that being work appertaining to veterinary practice, any person who performs an action of this nature should not receive remuneration for it, but it definitely says that &#x201C;any person who performs an act specially pertaining to the calling of a veterinarian&#x201D; will be subject to a fine of R200 or to imprisonment for six months. The Minister should realize that in this country of ours where we have such a shortage of veterinarians and great distances to be travelled, there are times when even a farmer has to perform an emergency operation. For instance we have simple instances like abortion or retention of the after-birth. Strictly speaking those are operations to which a veterinarian should attend, but the farmers have to do that work themselves. Through practice over the years farmers in many areas have had to learn to do without the services of a veterinarian and to perform the most important tasks. Farmers have even to go so far as to perform an internal operation on an animal injured by poking; they have had to stitch up the injured intestines and they have done it successfully. There are many operations that a farmer has to perform on animals, operations which are strictly within the sphere of the veterinarian&#x2019;s work.</p>

<p>I am sorry, Sir, but <i>I</i> have had the wrong Bill put on my desk. However, I should still like to move in line 53 to add after &#x201C;or&#x201D; the words &#x201C;for gain&#x201D;. I see no harm in a farmer who is able to perform some operations which is necessary and essential, receiving some present or some recognition from the person for whom he performs the <span class="col_5873_5874" refersTo="page_0269"/>task, or at least allowing that person to pay for the cost of his transport to perform this particular duty. I feel that if the Minister cannot provide the veterinarians he requires in the country, a stringent clause of this nature should not be in this Bill. I also think that the fines which are provided for here for transgressions are very excessive. Originally the fine was R100 and it is now being increased to R200. The sentence of imprisonment is being increased to six months. I feel that the Minister should rather retain the old penalties. I should like the Minister to tell me why he has found it necessary to make provision for increased penalties. Have the veterinary surgeons asked for it, when they themselves are not in a position to provide the services required by the farmers? It must be realized that sometimes the farmer has to travel a distance of 250 miles in order to get a veterinarian to perform some operation or to attend to some animal, and by the time that veterinarian could arrive the animal would be dead. We have had cases where delicate operations have been successfully carried out by a farmer, and I think it is quite uncalled for at this time to introduce a provision of this nature into this legislation in view of the scarcity of veterinarians in this country.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Whilst not supporting the amendment of my hon. friend, I want to point out that both this provision and the previous one were taken holus bolus out of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act. In practice it is very difficult indeed to apply this provision relating to treatment performed for gain. I was sorry to see from a speech by the Minister that he had already worked out a way&#x2014;I do not think it reflects great credit on him&#x2014;by which the doctors have been forbidden to deal with animals could act unethically and I believe illegally and risk imprisonment; that is the terrible part of it. Under the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act you cannot be imprisoned if you act like a doctor and order the patient to have a dose of salts, or anything of that nature, but here the punishment for interfering with an animal is much greater than for interfering with a human. If you interfere with a human you are fined but you do not go to gaol; that is the law. However, if you interfere with an animal you may go to gaol. Sir, I do not think that doctors mind being excluded from this field; in general they would prefer not to deal with animals, and if there are enough veterinarians I have no doubt that this is the right course. While I do not support the amendment of my hon. friend, nevertheless I do feel that it was a little unfair on the part of the hon. the Minister in his speech to suggest a way of getting round his own law.</p>

<p>I want to refer to (a) as suggested by the hon. the Minister, and I want to tell him that it is most important that the Veterinary Board should lay down very carefully on what conditions veterinary students will be registered, because it has been found in practice that the university standards are not always the standards of the Veterinary Board. Medical schools do not always make the same demands, when it comes to the entrance examination, which is not a professional examination as the professional bodies. The point I want to make is that students can enter universities for professional courses on a matriculation examination. Most universities accept the matriculation examination of this country for entrance to <span class="col_5875_5876" refersTo="page_0270"/>the university. In the Medical Council we have found that it is most important that mathematics should be one of the subjects, and it has been found necessary to insist that any student registered as a medical student must show that he has passed matriculation mathematics. The university, however, does not insist on that, and I know of cases where students have gone as far as their fourth or fifth year, passing their professional examinations without having a matriculation certificate which satisfies the Medical Council. The Council has written to the universities and told them that they will not accept those students as registered medical students because their matriculation certificates are deficient in mathematics, which is a subject insisted upon by the Medical Council. I think the Veterinary Board will probably make the same demand. It is important that it should be made quite clear to the universities that they should only register students for professional courses if their qualifications comply with the demands made by the professional body concerned.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to paragraph (b), the registration of auxiliaries and nurses, and I want to suggest to the Minister that this will perhaps give him an opportunity &#x2026;</p>

<p>The point I want to make is that this paragraph (g) does give the Minister an opportunity to set at rest the minds of farmers such as my colleague over here and other farmers with whom I have discussed this matter, and to make it possible for the farmers to employ unqualified people to help them out in minor procedures. He can do this by instituting a course of training for auxiliaries or nurses, a course of training very similar to what we have in medicine. There are many acts which nurses can carry out and which really pertain to medicine, but nurses are allowed to perform these acts because they have been trained. If the Minister could institute courses of some sort he might find that farm managers could for a fee&#x2014;it could if necessary be a fixed fee&#x2014;help the farmers in their difficulty when they cannot get veterinarians. That is a way out which might help the farmers considerably. I put it to the Minister for his consideration.</p>

<p>The Department of Water Affairs is at present constructing the Mooi River State Water Scheme in terms of the Mooi River District Adjustment Act, No. 37 of 1954. This scheme consists mainly of the construction of a large main canal, which will provide water also to the Vyfhoek North section of the Vyfhoek Settlement. The control of the old canal and the distribution of the water in the Vyfhoek Settlement have been in the hands of the Vyfhoek Noord Management Board, and it is because that management board or irrigation board is unable to undertake this work &#x2014;it is simply too expensive and too extensive for them&#x2014;that the State is constructing it, and in the circumstances it is necessary that the State should have control over the distribution of the water. In other words, we are encroaching here upon the powers of an irrigation board. This measure is really a hybrid Bill, therefore, and immediately after the second reading, I propose to move that this Bill be referred to a Select Committee.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I shall then raise it at the appropriate time.</p>

<p>Let me come to the next item which is the expropriation of land for the building of roads. As hon. members will know up to a few years ago land for the construction of roads and railway lines was expropriated under the same terms and conditions, the terms and conditions being that the people were only compensated for buildings that were pulled down or for improved land. According to the report of the Transport Department there were 209 cases in respect of which compensation was paid, the compensation ranging from under R500 up to R5,000. I have raised this matter with the hon. the Minister before. As a matter of fact I was one of a deputation who saw him in this respect and I want to ask him whether his heart has not softened in the meantime because the existing position is untenable.</p>

<p>You must look at the matter from this angle. Sir, these national and special roads are playing an increasingly important role in the life of the country. As a matter of fact. Sir, in all modern countries the accent is to-day being placed on road motor transport. As more and more goods are being transported by road the greater will the demand be for national roads. Where a national road is constructed over a farmer&#x2019;s farm a fairly large piece of land can be expropriated and to-day he is not compensated for that land at all unless that land is improved land or unless there are buildings on it which are going to be demolished. I think all farmers in this Committee will agree with me that this is wrong. A road which is built under the Ribbon Development Act which we passed last year is not in the interest of the farmer over whose land that road goes. As a matter of fact it becomes a liability to him because he is only allowed access at certain places and sometimes rather impossible places. Whereas previously you could expect a national road over your farm to enhance its value the opposite is the truth to-day. It is a liability. My contention is that the people who benefit by such a road should bear the cost and compensate the farmer for his land which is taken away from him. I want to put a specific case to the hon. Minister in my own constituency and I think he knows about it. I want to remind him that near Nottingham Road there was an old railway line and a new railway line was built there and a national road. Subsequently a new national road was built there, running parallel with the old national road. As a result the farms there were cut into four strips. And whilst the Act has been changed in regard to the Railways it has not been changed in regard to roads. Consequently a man finds himself in the position that his farm has been cut up into four strips, and three of these strips directly the result of the building of national roads, and that man does not get any compensation at all because it happened to be ordinary prairie land and it was not improved land and there were no buildings or trees on that particular portion of his land. It can become impossible for a farmer to farm in some instances if we keep on developing our country as we want it to be developed. I think I am speaking for all the farmers if I say that the time has come to have a change there. I know that the hon. Minister will say to me that he cannot accept this because the provinces will not accept it. Mr. Chairman, it is well known that the Government superimposes its will on the provinces if it so wishes, and to me that is not a valid excuse.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation of the progress which the Weather Bureau has made in recent times. Until comparatively recently the area in which I live has been classified for weather forecast purposes, under what is called &#x201C;Elsewhere&#x201D; by the Weather Bureau. They now call it by its name, namely, Gordonia. Not only have they made progress as far as the details which are supplied are concerned, but also as far as the accuracy of the forecasts is concerned. That does not mean that they are perfect, but when they are wrong with their forecasts for that area, the barometers in that area are also wrong. I take it, therefore, that they are in good company. The fact remains, however, as I see the position, that the Minister can feel happy about the progress which has been made in connection with the work which falls under him.</p>

<p>There is another matter which I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister. I want to ask him whether it is not possible for the South African Railways to follow a policy of constructing weighbridges at the larger stations, and if that is already the accepted policy of the Railways &#x2026;</p>

<p>Then there is another matter in connection with traffic on the roads. Until recently certain representations have been made to me by farmers organizations in my area in connection with the curtailment of the bus service along the Onseepkans-Aughrabies-Kakamas route. When complaints were lodged the Department said it was not profitable. I want to point out immediately that that region falls in the area where certain private undertakings have certain rights. If I am correct they have the right to operate within a radius of 100 miles. I want to point out that the farmers are very well disposed towards the road transportation system of the Department.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to raise with the hon. Minister the question whether the time has not come for a stricter examination of pilots of aircraft when these licences come up for renewal. I do so because if one looks at the incidence of accidents the figures are somewhat disturbing. Of the 675 South African registered aircraft in the year 1962, more than 10 per cent were involved in accidents of one form or another, and there was a loss of some 15 lives. I do not know what the percentage of injuries was. I am not referring now to public transport but to civil flying. Whilst there were 75 or 79 accidents, a statistical analysis of those accidents indicates that no less than 41 accidents occurred during landings. That may be due to two causes, either a fault in the aircraft, or insufficient landing facilities at the smaller aerodromes. Of the 61 accidents, excluding the nine accidents that occurred in the case of public transportation, 51 accidents occurred to privately owned aircraft and of the 51 accidents that occurred to the privately owned aircraft apart from the percentage of landing accidents of the 79 accidents, 22 were due to poor technique. And of the 79 ten were found due to carelessness. Taking these two average figures alone of 22 due to poor technique of the 79 accidents, it appears to indicate that when pilot licences come up for renewal insufficient attention is given to the efficiency of the pilots themselves and their right to get a renewal of their licence. The other aspect is that a very high percentage of the accidents are due to carelessness and also due to faults in the aircraft themselves&#x2014;no less than 51 accidents occurred during landing operations, and this also seems to indicate that faults have been found in the aircraft themselves, either during flight or during the operation of landing. When one looks at the total of 675 aircraft registered with the Minister&#x2019;s Department and one sees that nearly 50 per cent of the aircraft are ten years old, I would suggest to the hon. Minister that the time has come for a stricter supervision in regard to possible mechanical faults in these aircraft when they come up for renewal of their certificates. I understand that quite a large number of the certificates have not been renewed or that the owners have not applied for renewal. But even on the figures available of the total number of aircraft, when 10 per cent are over ten years old I think the time has arrived for stricter supervision and stricter examination when these aircraft come up for renewal of their licences. I would go further and ask the hon. Minister whether he could state whether the examinations that are carried out, both of civil pilots and in regard to public transportation pilots &#x2014;well in the case of public aircraft the standards laid down are very strict and we are satisfied with the standard there&#x2014;but as far as civil pilots are concerned, I would ask the hon. Minister whether he could state whether the standards of examination both of aircraft and pilots are conforming to general international standards as such.</p>

<p>Then I want to refer to another matter which I raised earlier in the debate and that is the difficulty that we are experiencing in regard to possible threats of denial of airspace and landing rights to South African aircraft in Africa. I agree with the hon. Minister that it is a very delicate subject and one does not want to discuss it here at length. But I <span class="col_5881_5882" refersTo="page_0273"/>raised the matter with the hon. Minister in regard to our participation as a member of the Southern Africa Air Transportation Council of which our country is a foundation member. In reply to me the hon. Minister stated that he was well aware of these difficulties and that at the present time there was nothing to fear. But I also raised it in another context, viz. in regard to our over-border aircraft service, both South African and international lines being supplied with adequate data in regard to weather reports. As the hon. Minister knows the Southern Africa Transport Council was formed for the purpose of better aviation communications and a closer association of civil aviation communication within the African continent. A large number of the African territories&#x2014;some were not independent then and were subject to the jurisdiction of metropolitan powers&#x2014;are members with us of the Air Transport Council and have as much interest in being supplied with adequate information to facilitate the flight of aircraft on the African continent as we are ourselves. I feel that it may be more diplomatic of the hon. Minister if he is in a position to do so, to indicate that we wish as a country in Africa to play our part with the rest of the African countries in continuing forms of cooperation as far as civil aviation is concerned. I asked the hon. Minister when last this council did meet, and his reply to me was &#x201C;not for some time As a foundation member of that council, as a country to whom air communication is a matter of vital importance, I want to suggest to the hon. Minister that he should go a little bit further and that he should publicly indicate that he wishes to continue to co-operate, that he considers it in the interest of all countries in Africa that there should be this co-operation as far as aviation is concerned. It involves many aspects, Mr. Chairman. The hon. Minister stated on Friday that one of the difficulties he experiences with our over-border services is the supply of adequate weather information over the whole African route between Jan Smuts and Athens. He said that one of the difficulties was to get adequate information of weather conditions in regard to the rest of the African continent. Well, Sir, if there were full co-operation between the members of the Air Transport Council, we would be supplied with that information. We not only want it, but the other airlines operating over the African continent want it as well. I would respectfully suggest to the hon. Minister, rather than to make a curt statement in the House that we have nothing to fear as a country the Minister should state that we wish to play our part with the other countries concerned. He should let it be known that we do wish to play our part with the other countries in Africa in the field of civil aviation. I hope the hon. Minister will do so.</p>

<p>There is one final point I wish to raise and that is that there have been complaints from pilots, not only South African pilots but to my knowledge of pilots in the service of other international airlines, of difficulties in obtaining suitable radio receptions, suitable telecommunication reception of weather conditions between Jan Smuts Airport and Nairobi Airport. These complaints seem to be justified because there is a clear statement in the latest report of the Department of Transport, to the effect &#x201C;that difficulties have been experienced in finding suitable night frequency for the Jan Smuts-Nairobi circuit, due to the congestion in the required frequency bands&#x201D;. I would like the hon. Minister to say whether these difficulties have been experienced and where the remedy lies, and whether those difficulties have now been overcome.</p>

<speech by="#bekker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">H. T. VAN G. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>There is one matter which I think is of the greatest possible importance which I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister. That is in connection with the traffic on our roads, more particularly on our national roads and our special roads. On 30 September 1962, we had 4,920 miles of tarred national road and 420 miles of special roads which were tarred. In other words we have 5,340 miles of tarred roads. That was on 30 September 1962. I have tried to ascertain what was really happening on our roads and I asked the Department of Transport to make certain figures available to me. I find that in the year 1960, that is to say, during the 11 months from 1 January to 30 November (December excluded) there were 2,742 fatal accidents on our roads; in 1961, during the same period, the number of accidents was 2,996 and in 1962, over those 11 months, there were 3,200 fatal accidents on our roads. In other words, during a period of three years there were 8,938 fatal accidents on our roads. When we compare that with World War II we find that over a period of three years there were as many fatal accidents on our roads as the number of South Africans killed over a five-year period of war. That is the position according to the figures. It is a serious position and we should give our serious attention to it. It is not only as though there were 8,938 fatal accidents on our roads, but over the same period of three years many people were seriously hurt: 8,641 in 1960; 8,760 in 1961; 8,434 in 1962, a grand total of 25,835 serious accidents on our roads. As far as non-serious accidents are concerned the figures are as follows; 26.958 in 1960, 26.961 in 1961 and 25.605 in 1962; a total of 79,524. The number of fatal accidents plus serious accidents plus non-serious accidents amounts to 114.277. When you think of that. Sir, it is clear that we should do something to remedy the serious situation and to prevent those accidents. I have gone into the position as far as our national roads are concerned, and there is no doubt about it that at the beginning when we started with the construction of national roads, the roads were made too narrow. They were only 18 ft. wide with a five-foot strip on either side. It is obvious that accidents must happen in those circumstances.</p>

<p>It was then changed from 18 ft. to 20 ft. and still later it was changed to 22 ft. but that has <span class="col_5883_5884" refersTo="page_0274"/>not reduced the number of accidents on the roads. It is impossible to estimate the loss of human life and the cost to the country in terms of money; the position is disturbing. Something must be done but the question is what? As far as I know we have a Road Safety Board but I do not know what its functions exactly are, nor do I know what status they enjoy, but no matter what it is, they try to give us information in connection with what is happening on our roads. But that does not assist in remedying the position. I want to ask the hon. the Minister that a special effort should be made in some way or other to bring about an improvement in the position. Whether the Minister should hold a conference with people interested in transport, with provincial councillors or officials or whether he should send a committee overseas to ascertain whether there is anything wrong with the construction of our roads, I do not know. But I do feel, however, that I must draw this matter to the serious attention of the Minister for his consideration.</p>

<p>Something else is taking place. You have your tarred road and alongside it you have a gravel strip. When two vehicles pass one another, often at great speed, the one vehicle goes off the tarred road on to the gravel portion with the result that those wheels throw up stones and I myself have seen how such a stone hits the windscreen of the car travelling in the opposite direction. As a matter of fact I personally have been in three cars of which the windscreens have been broken to pieces. This is a serious matter which deserves our whole attention. I do not want to suggest a solution, nor am I in a position to do so, but I do feel that it deserves urgent attention because many human lives are lost in that way.</p>

<p>Then there is the case of a road crossing a railway line. I am aware of it that the hon. the Minister is spending vast sums of money on the construction of fly-over bridges and subways but also in this case many human lives are lost. I want to know whether it is not possible to expedite the construction of flyover bridges and subways. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I want to ask the hon. Minister whether any discussions have taken place between the Civil Aviation Board and the Defence Council, or the Defence Department, in relation with Air Commandos. All A licences, B licences and civil aviation pilots and the licensing of all civil aviation aircraft are under the Civil Aviation Board, and their regulations are very strict, and if there are any crashes that take place because of the disobedience or the non-carrying out of any of the provisions of the air regulations, which of course appertain to low-flying, and certain other regulations, such a pilot who is involved may lose his licence. But under the Air Commando system it is essential that the civil aviation pilots, those who belong to aero-clubs and private aircraft pilots, will have to fly low, and it is going to be very difficult to carry out the regulations of the Civil Aviation Board, such as landing only on airfields which are licensed by the Civil Aviation Board, and suchlike. This is important because most insurances which are carried by aero-clubs and by private aircraft owners in respect of the aircraft and the lives of pilots, or the people they carry, are based on the fact that these people must conform to the civil aviation regulations. How can these people conform to that when they have to take part in their Commandos. A full discussion is necessary as to the question at what stage these pilots who are licensed under the Civil Aviation Board can fly other than under the Civil Aviation Board regulations and land on air-strips which have been built for the Army or near camps of the Defence Force, or in other operational areas other than those licensed. Because anything that appertains to those aircraft and those individuals is tied up with the licence, whether the licence entitles them to carry passengers, or even in the case of commercial B licences. The insurance covers insurance of the machine, insurance on his life, and so I want to ask the hon. Minister if he has not already had talks with the Civil Aviation Board and the Defence Department on these issues which are so very important and which of course will form the basis of any success of any Air Commando in the future. If not, such talks or conferences should take place at the earliest possible moment, for I cannot see how private-owned aircraft or aircraft owned by aero-clubs can otherwise take part in such operations and join such Commandos.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of subsidies. In speaking on another occasion to the hon. Minister of Defence I suggested that he should approach the Minister of Transport in regard to the subsidies which are still on the old basis of R100 (&#x00A3;50), and I suggested that in obtaining an A-licence by a pilot who is flying a private aircraft and who gets a subsidy of R100, such a licence should only be granted to a young man who joins an Air Commando or the Air Force Reserve. I would commend the Minister to overhaul the whole question of subsidies so that the R100 subsidy should be_ made to fit young men who are prepared to sign on for the Air Commandos or the reserve. I do not think we ought to subsidize people who just learn to fly for the fun of it if they are not prepared to help in the defence of their country. Most of us who are interested in flying-clubs before the last war only taught people who were prepared to sign on for the reserve, and I would commend to the Minister that he go back to the old system of granting subsidies only to young men who will join the reserve or an Air Commando.</p>

<p>There is one other matter, and that is the question of the smog dangers on the national road created by old diesel engines of heavy transport vehicles, which throw up this heavy smog going up the long hills. Many accidents can be directly attributed to the smog which completely shuts off the view of the motorist behind. Going up the long hills, especially in Natal, you find diesel vehicles emitting heavy <span class="col_5885_5886" refersTo="page_0275"/>exhaust fumes that completely shut off the view. To stay behind those vehicles, you have to drop down to five miles an hour and you are choked by the smoke, and in desperation people pass these vehicles and accidents are caused, and it is nobody&#x2019;s business to enforce these regulations. I think the Minister would be doing a service to the country and to every road-user if he took steps immediately to enforce the regulations to see that this type of smog is stopped as soon as possible.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to a few other matters. I want to refer to the third-party insurance premiums which are brought to the attention of the Minister from time to time. I am in favour of it that these premiums be paid and that the insurance companies be placed in a position in that way to pay the claims for compensation for the loss of life. Following upon that, however, there is another matter which I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister, I think it would be much wiser and much more effective to take action to prevent this loss of life than the steps we are taking to-day. We should look at this matter in a different light, namely, that it was as a result of the contravention of the traffic rules that the State was forced to make arrangements with the insurance companies to pay compensation. Would it not be much better if we followed a different method, namely, if we brought the motorist to his senses by means of fines and other means of punishment so that there will be less loss of life on the roads? I think it can be arranged by this Minister with the Minister of Justice and the local and provincial authorities that in the case of traffic offences the fines and sentences should be increased substantially. I want to refer to Cape Town. I live in an area where there are two very clear traffic signs, namely, a stop sign which is painted on the street itself and a sign indicating that you cannot turn right. I do not think a day passes without those signs being ignored a dozen times, where the people do not stop or where they turn right. If this offence is subject to a very heavy fine I believe those motorists will come to their senses. I think the fact that these traffic signs are ignored is one of the main reasons why there is such a heavy loss of life against which third-party insurance has to be taken out. I want to make an urgent appeal to the Minister to give this matter his attention. The local authorities and the provincial administration retain those fines: they go into the General Revenue Fund. That is why there should be a specific increase which should be ear-marked for a specific purpose so that the increased fines can be paid over to the Minister of Transport or by way of a bonus to the insurance companies so that the third-party premiums can be reduced.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to raise with the Minister a subject of grave importance, namely the roads from Johannesburg to the airport, which go through the municipal areas of Germiston, Bedfordview, Edenvale and Kempton Park. The Minister has taken a great deal of interest in this matter and has indicated that the funds are available for the completion of the special road which will link up with the roads provided by the Johannesburg Municipality and will provide rapid access from the centre of Johannesburg to Jan Smuts Airport. Part of the work has already been done in the Johannesburg area itself, and work has recently commenced on the portion of the road in my constituency through the Village Council Area of Bedfordview. There special service roads are being built which will be a temporary solution of the problem and which will in due course be portion of the final scheme. I cannot too strongly stress just how strongly people feel about the statement to which wide publicity was given in the Press yesterday to the effect that as far as the provincial council was concerned they apparently do not regard this road as urgent, and it would appear that they are quite prepared to go along slowly over the period of the next ten years before this road is finally completed. I would like to say to the Minister that I believe that when a matter is of great national importance, as the Minister has recognized this road to be, he should be entitled to have the full co-operation of the Transvaal Provincial Authorities to get on with the job. The authorities who examined the matter include all the municipalities concerned, the S.A. Road Federation and the Chamber of Commerce, and all of them regard this road as of the utmost importance not only to these areas I have mentioned but also to the areas further east, because from this road will be taken off a branch road which will go to the northern part of the East Rand and that obviously cannot be proceeded with before this road is constructed. I am very glad that the service road is being constructed through Bedfordview, because there we have a very dangerous position at present. The present road is inadequate. I hope the Minister will agree that the mere construction of a service road over portion of the area, from the robot on the road between Edenvale and Germiston up to the Johannesburg boundary, is enough. I make an earnest appeal to the Minister to use his influence, because I believe he could render no better service than to ensure that the Provincial Council gets on not only with the construction of the service road, but that it should proceed as soon as possible with the construction of the <span class="col_5887_5888" refersTo="page_0276"/>remainder of the scheme, which in any case will take some years to complete. But it is quite clear from an examination of the problem and from a traffic count taken on the road from Johannesburg to the airport that that road is utterly inadequate and that the traffic service will break down but for the building of this service road. The special road to be erected is one for which there will of course have to be complicated planning and one knows that that will take time. But there is great distress in the whole of that area about the attitude of the Provincial Council, which simply does not seem to realize how urgent this road is. Whatever the politics may be of those who represent an area, there is complete unanimity as to the essentiality for the construction of this road being proceeded with with the utmost despatch. I sincerely hope that we will have a public statement from the Minister this afternoon, and that he will indicate that he agrees with those bodies that this is a matter of great urgency, and that he will try to speed up the work.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) this afternoon rendered civil aviation no service by his erroneous views as regards air accidents. He came here with two propositions. The first is that the standard of training of our pilots apparently is not effective.</p>

<p>I did not say that.</p>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>The whole argument of the hon. member was based on the fact that an analysis of the accidents reveals that the standard of training should be raised. That was his whole approach, and the second point he made was that the airworthiness of our aircraft leaves much to be desired.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I was referring to the standard of inspection.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>That is just the same submission in other words. In other words, he says that the pilots are not tested properly, and their poor training is not shown up because they are not tested adequately. There has been no better evidence than that of the hon. member for Kimberley (North) as to the safety of civil aviation in South Africa. We have had only 83 accidents, of which 79 were investigated and analysed, and that is a very small number in comparison with the number of accidents on our roads. But let us examine the hon. member for Turffontein&#x2019;s submissions in regard to these accidents. He says that 41 accidents occurred while aircraft were landing. When we analyse those 41 accidents, we find that only a small number of them could have been caused by possible mechanical defects in the aircraft. In five cases the under-carriage collapsed on landing. It is possible that that could have been the pilot&#x2019;s fault, or it could have been a defect in the aircraft itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Or the airport.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#rall">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. W. RALL</person>:</from>

<p>That possibility is remote. Among hard landings there were five accidents that were grouped separately, and there the collapse of the under-carriage was also one of the causes. Then we have to assume that in another five cases the collapse of the under-carriage possibly was a mechanical defect or a mistake by the pilot himself. Only one accident was caused because the engine failed. Two were caused because the brakes became defective, and a burst tyre was responsible for another one. In other words, I want to submit that the mechanical condition of the aircraft left nothing to be desired. When we look at the numbers of flying hours logged by civil aircraft in South Africa and when we look at the hundreds of thousands of miles they cover, and we then have regard to the small number of accidents, and if we were to analyse the accidents carefully, and do not arrive at hasty conclusions like the hon. member for Turffontein, we see that the safety of our civil aviation leaves nothing at all to be desired.</p>

<p>I wish to refer to what the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) has said in regard to the Air Commandos, and that they allegedly act contrary to the aviation regulations. But the hon. member knows that when pilots, who are members of the Air Commando, are having their 24 hours&#x2019; training for the Air Commando, they will be accompanied by an instructor, and the civil aviation regulations provides that training may be given under certain conditions if the pilot is accompanied by a qualified instructor. I should also like to point out to the hon. member that almost without exception, all the training aircraft connected with flying-clubs are licensed in the training category of civil aviation. In other words, they are certified and licensed, and with an instructor in charge and a member of the Air Commando as pupil, these problems he envisages cannot arise.</p>

<p>However, I should like to refer to some other matters briefly. I wish to emphasize a fact mentioned by the hon. the Minister, and I wish to thank him for doing so, namely, that no expense should be spared to make available the best navigational aids. I wish to thank the Minister for the assurance he has given us, that that extremely imporant link in our aviation safety will not be neglected because of a shortage of funds or for any other reason. However, I should like to ask the hon. the Minister a question. On 11 August 1961 steps were taken to put into operation a panel to report upon accidents or near-accidents that could have occurred. I should appreciate it if the Minister could tell us whether that panel has made certain recommendations as yet. In South Africa we are dealing with a rapidly increasing volume of air traffic. If we look at Jan Smuts Airport in 1961, we see there were more than 23,200 air movements, and more than 441.000 passengers were carried, and when we look at the four large airports of South Africa we see there are more than 59,500 air movements <span class="col_5889_5890" refersTo="page_0277"/>and more than 750,000 passengers passed through those airports. I wish to make the submission that aviation is progressing apace in South Africa, and we must devote attention to a few necessities in able to apply this greater volume of air traffic to the best effect.</p>

<p>We have at our disposal the services of a civil aviation advisory committee. I should like to recommend that this statutory body, which exists in terms of Section 5 of the Aviation Act of 1962, should be expanded and converted into a body we could for the sake of convenience call a National Aviation Board, and that it should be similar to the National Transport Commission, and that it should be the first step in the development of a full Department of Aviation.</p>

<p>I should like to raise another matter, and that is the feeder air services. The hon. the Minister said under his Vote that it appeared that this was not a paying proposition, and that the S.A. Airways do not exploit it. There are two ways of tackling this problem. The one is that it should be exploited by the S.A. Airways, but then suitable aircraft should be used, light aircraft which can carry six or seven passengers. The second solution is to grant a subsidy to private enterprise to exploit this air traffic. A proposal was made to the hon. the Minister on one occasion, but I should like to ask again that the Minister should investigate the possibility of giving private air services an opportunity to exploit those services, and that a subsidy of say R40,000, should be given in the initial stages, and that it be reduced to nothing after five years when these services will have become known and will have overcome their initial difficulties. I predict that if such a scheme were to be tackled, it will prove that these air services will receive increasingly greater support. The facilities are available. I may mention my own town, Bethal, for instance, where we have all the facilities. The passengers are there. At the moment they are carried by air in other ways, but if this matter could be assisted in its initial stages, I believe there is a great untapped potential that could be put to good use.

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to touch on another section of this Vote, the Marine Division. I would like to ask the Minister this. On page 80 of the Estimates it sets out the table of officials concerned, and we see that all told, leaving out the chief ship surveyor, we have a dozen ship surveyors, three principals, three seniors and six ship surveyors. I want to ask the Minister whether he finds in fact that these numbers are sufficient to be able to cope with the growing magnitude of this task. Are all the posts actually filled, and can they cope with the volume of work, seeing what a wide range of ships there is? From the ocean-going vessels to the larger fishing vessels, all the surveys of which have to be done by this staff. Perhaps the Minister could also tell us how far the duties of this section cover the surveys and registrations not only of the ocean-going vessels but of both the larger and the smaller types of the growing fishing fleet we have, and also whether the staff available can call on any other staff for assistance. Is there anything provided in the Estimates to enable him to spread the load of work? I want to make it clear that I am not criticizing the work done by that staff. That they are able to get through all the work, I think, reflects the greatest credit on them. But one has to face the fact that there has been a tremendous expansion in the type of fishing craft developing all along our coast, and we are still very far from the limit of that expansion. I think the latest figures reveal that there are approximately 4,000 vessels of various types engaged in the fishing industry off our coasts, and they vary considerably according to the section of the coast off which they operate. The vessels operating off the South West Africa coast and the Cape coast differ enormously from those operating off the Natal Coast, and each in turn provides a different problem to the survey staff responsible for certifying and registering them. The different types of craft, from the nature of their calling, run different risks from those of the sea-going vessels. The risks they are subject to are very often aggravated by the human element, like for instance the desire to take advantage of the occasion when there is a huge run of fish and to overload beyond the scope for which the vessel is registered. I also know how difficult it is to keep up supervision of such vessels. The vessels do most of their work at night at sea and it is almost impossible to exercise full supervision over them. But that being so it also imposes the necessity for a higher standard of certification, than one would normally accept for a vessel where you do not have to face these risks. You set a higher standard to allow for the unknown factors, which you do know will develop as a result of the human element. When I refer to the human element, I mean that people are prepared to take a chance; they are prepared to overload to a certain extent when there is a big run of fish in order to get the fish into the factories. When they accept a measure of overloading they immediately create other risks; they interfere with the stability of the vessel; they interfere with the trim of the vessel. I have myself seen many of these craft hopelessly overloaded and as soon as they meet heavy seas they start shipping water over the bows.</p>

<p>Then the next circumstance comes into operation. On many of the older craft they have a type of hatch, a cap-scuttle hatch, which if it is properly secured is reasonably safe, but again the human element comes into it. It is a little more difficult to unfasten the hatch to get up and down, so they are not properly secured, some of them have not got hinges on them and wash away. You will often find them washed up along the beaches. Then you have a combination of the seas coming over the bows and the open hatch causing flooding of the fish hold, and then risk <span class="col_5891_5892" refersTo="page_0278"/>number three comes into operation. The one which sends her to the bottom eventually. That is that at the entrance into the pump-line the screening is inefficient. You have a full cargo of fish, the bottom of it being mashed and pulped and in very little time your pumps are choked so that there is no hope of keeping pace with the incoming water. The engine goes out of action and there is another casualty. The craft themselves are all wooden craft with a high freeboard when light. They may be exposed to the sun for several weeks in the summer season so they open up; the caulking gets slack, and it takes several hours of immersion before that swells up again sufficiently to keep the water out. When they are overloaded they push this particular portion of the vessel&#x2019;s hull under water and so they start up another series of leaks. Sir, these are some of the headaches which your staff have to cope with. They have to cope with the certifying of these vessels with the knowledge that these things will be done outside of their control and there is little chance of their exercising adequate supervision over that part of their job, until it is too late. The first that you really hear about it is when the vessel is a loss. I would say without any hesitation that the vessels of the fishing fleet, particularly the newer vessels &#x2014;and when I say &#x201C;new&#x201D; I do not mean of to-day only but going back for a few years&#x2014; are vessels which reflect the greatest credit both on the South African boat-building firms which are building them and on the men who sail them. It is not shoddy work. You certainly do find a number of craft which fall outside that high category, but in general even they are a decent type of boat. The weakness is that the factor of safety at the moment is not sufficiently high to take into account the human element which does not observe the rules which are supposed to be observed when loading with fish. Sir, those are just some of the troubles. I would ask the Minister if he would be prepared with his advisers to give consideration to the question of setting up a special department dealing with this particular type of craft. They have their special problems. They have their own particular type of troubles. Quite dissociated and quite separate from those of the larger types of vessels. Each and every one of them is an important problem. The growth of the South African fishing trade is such, that according to the last official return it either occupies the ninth of tenth place in the world as far as sea fishing is concerned&#x2014; in fact I think a few months ago, on the monthly intake of fish, we moved up to something like eighth place in the world fish production for that particular month. It is a new and major development for South Africa which has brought new problems with it. This is of the utmost importance to the future of the country, not only the Republic but to the many thousand which are dependent to-day on the fishing industry. This industry is a tremendous factor both in our domestic food supply and in our overseas trade. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to bring two matters to the notice of the Minister. The first matter concerns the standards of our roads, bridges, traffic interchanges, traffic circles, etc. I think the time has arrived that the Department of Transport should proceed, on the basis of the collected knowledge of the Department and the provinces, to lay down standards that could be applied throughout South Africa, e.g. the size and shape of the most ideal road circle we can have, the requirements for traffic switches, the width of road shoulders and road widths in relation to the traffic count, bridges, bridge approaches, etc., and that as the standards are formulated by the Department of Transport, they should be applied through a process of negotiation with all the local authorities who are doing much of this construction work, and with the provinces, uniformly throughout the country with the least deviation that may be necessary in a particular situation. In South Africa we are struck by the numerous different patterns of solution for the same road construction problems that are applied. I should like to make this small request, that the Department of the hon. the Minister should devise South African standards as far as possible and should have them carried out through voluntary co-operation.</p>

<p>The second matter I should like to raise is the Jan Smuts Aairport-Johannesburg road, which has already been raised by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). I do not wish to emphasize that it is a necessary and desired improvement, but what I should nevertheless like to ask the hon. the Minister is that either he or his Department of Transport should make an authoritative statement on the matter. We are aware of the Transport Department&#x2019;s strong action to have this scheme carried out, but the general public are not aware of the problems because the traffic interchange on the eastern by-pass past Johannesburg and a second traffic interchange on the provincial road from Benoni to Johannesburg and other technical problems are involved. Many rumours are spread about the matter, of which many are unfounded. I do not know whether this House is the most convenient place for it, but I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he or his Department will make an authoritative and somewhat full statement on this matter so that all the interested parties may know exactly where they are. I do not think that at this stage it is justified to criticize the Transvaal Province pertinently, although it does appear as if the province is very tardy in regard to certain aspects of planning. I should like to take the liberty to suggest that if the planning of the province does not progress rapidly enough, the Department of Transport should seek its own remedies by means of private enterprise to have the planning completed.</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister if he does not think it is time that the policy of using major civil airports for <span class="col_5893_5894" refersTo="page_0279"/>blind-flying training for defence purposes should be reviewed. The hon. the Minister will remember that during the course of the last recess I wrote a letter to him with regard to an accident which took place in the approaches to the Louis Botha Airport in Durban where a defence plane which was practising blind approaches collided with a passenger aircraft. At the same time I wrote to the hon. the Minister of Defence, who sent me a very nice reply pointing out, quite sanely, that those were the only places where the Air Force could in fact practice blind approaches, because they were the only places where the necessary equipment was installed. This hon. Minister has not had the courtesy yet even to give me an answer to a question which I posed to him in the letter, and that is why I raise this subject here. At the moment Harvard aircraft are largely being used for the purpose of training pilots in blind flying and blind approaches, but with the speeding up of our defence programme it seemed likely to me that we are going to use faster and faster aircraft even for training purposes, and there must come a stage when the pilots of these faster aircraft must be taught blind-flying approaches at airports other than defence airports which exist in the area of Pretoria. I think that now that we are embarking upon this expansion programme, where obviously our flying activities as well as ground activities in the Defence Force will be stepped up, it might be an opportune time for the Minister of Transport to have discussions so that some of this huge amount which is being set aside for defence, might perhaps be applied for regional bases for the practice of blind-flying approaches by defence aircraft. I think personally that it is very wrong that an airport such as Louis Botha Airport should be used for this purpose, because around that airport quite a big housing scheme has been built. Obviously the approaches to these airports must be the most congested parts in the air, and to superimpose upon all that blind-flying approach practice by aircraft, must impose an extra strain upon the personnel. As the hon. the Minister knows there was an accident there last year which very luckily did not end in calamity for a civil aircraft. As it was the military aircraft crashed. I think this might be an opportune moment for the Minister to reconsider the whole basis on which this blind flying is practised in the area of civil airports.</p>

<speech by="#gorshell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn), although he approached the matter from a somewhat different angle, did, I think, join in the appeal of the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) to the Minister to make what he, the hon. member for Kempton Park, called an authoritative and comprehensive statement in regard to this question of the six-lane highway between Johannesburg and the Jan Smuts Airport. Sir, one of the aspects of the matter is discussed in a Press report, in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of yesterday, and from this it would appear that the President of the Transvaal Chamber of Industries, Mr. Campbell-Pitt, actually led a 15-man deputation to the provincial road authorities last month about what this report calls the delay and confusion which has surrounded the building of the road. Apparently as a result of that approach, the Provincial Director of Roads, Mr. Krogh, made a statement which is quoted in this report. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The province is reluctant to commit itself to the construction of the Jan Smuts Airport road as a freeway at this stage.</block>

<p>He then went on to say that the traffic from Jan Smuts Airport to the business centre of Johannesburg would be able to use the freeway along its entire route only after the following freeways have been constructed: the eastern, by-pass of Johannesburg, the Johannesburg municipal east-west motorway. My first point in this connection is that that is a completely new approach to the question of the six-lane highway from Johannesburg to the Jan Smuts Airport, and perhaps the Minister can explain whether this new approach conceived by the Provincial Administration of the Transvaal was, in fact, undertaken as a result of any negotiation or discussion with the hon. the Minister of Transport. Furthermore, Mr. Krogh made a statement on which I think the Minister should enlighten this Committee. He said that the reason for this delay was that there would be &#x201C;little prestige attached to a freeway which discharges its traffic into a municipal street at Kensington. Full prestige will only be attained when the traffic can be discharged into a freeway system which will carry the traffic close to its destination&#x201D;, Surely the Minister will be the first to agree that in agreeing, as he did, to the building of this road&#x2014;and there is reference in the report to the fact that the Government will meet 70 per cent of the cost of this road&#x2014;that in agreeing to that, &#x201C;prestige&#x201D; was not a first consideration. I think to anyone who has any knowledge of why road-building is undertaken by a local authority or through the National Transport Commission, the last question, surely, is the &#x201C;prestige&#x201D; value of the road. The first question is its essentiality or utility, and even its strategic importance. I fail to understand how it can be said that this road from Johannesburg to the Jan Smuts Airport, which at this stage is the only international airport in South Africa, for practical purposes, should be discarded because there is not sufficient &#x201C;prestige&#x201D; attached to it. Prestige for whom? I do not know whether it is prestige for the province, or for the Provincial Roads Engineer. That is obviously a statement which cannot be seriously regarded. Finally, in this connection it is clear that the Automobile Association as well as the Municipality of Kempton Park are interested in this matter. In fact Kempton Park, according to the Town Clerk, is now considering certain recommendations in regard to the taking of certain steps, obviously to approach the Minister. I can only <span class="col_5895_5896" refersTo="page_0280"/>say again that this is a very important matter which cannot be sidetracked by any consideration of prestige, and on which the people of this country, let alone the people of Johannesburg, are entitled to have the fullest information&#x2014;because I for one cannot accept that the Provincial, Administration unilaterally, without any consultation with the hon. the Minister of Transport, decided to defer the scheme for a period of from nine to 16 years, according to the estimated time.</p>

<p>The other point that I want to deal with, in the time left to me, is the question of the services provided for the transportation of people living in the south-west complex of Johannesburg. I have here certain information from the <i>South African Railway News</i> of January 1963, which is not a propaganda pamphlet, but an authoritative, very objective publication, indicating quite clearly that the difficulties experienced in regard to the transportation of the Bantu residents of the south-west complex have not yet been eliminated. There is, for example, the statement that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A recent census showed that 139.816 non-White passengers travel every working day in each direction from their homes in the villages on the south-western perimeter of Johannesburg to their work in the city, and back home again in the evening.</block>

<p>It goes on to indicate that there are 70 trains carrying workers in each direction every working day. But the point is that in regard to this particular matter, the budget of the Minister of Transport shows that the subsidy on the operation of railway Bantu passenger services to and from townships is r3.500,000, for this year at any rate. The significant statement, in addition to the number of passengers carried, is that the peak hours are from about 4 o&#x2019;clock to 8 o&#x2019;clock in the mornings and from about 4 o&#x2019;clock to 6 o&#x2019;clock in the evenings, and anybody who lives in Johannesburg and who actually employs Bantu labour will tell you that the Bantu worker living in the southwest complex of Johannesburg has a daily spread-over time of 12 hours because of this transportation difficulty.</p>

<p>I should like to associate myself with the hon. members who have expressed their views on the subject of road safety here. I do not think I need apologize for reverting to this subject, for it certainly is a subject of vital importance, a subject of increasing importance from day to day. I believe South Africa cannot afford to lose a single life on our roads unnecessarily. Yet we find, as the hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) I think said, that every day between two and three White people are dying on our roads, and between six and seven non-Whites. I say South Africa cannot afford that. If one studies the cost aspect of the matter, one comes to a shocking conclusion, but it will suffice if I merely point out that a number of people equal to all the immigrants we are annually bringing here at great cost and with much trouble, are wiped out by road accidents. I am mentioning this merely to show how extremely important the matter is. That is one side of the question. On the other hand again, we find that the number of vehicles on our roads is increasing from day to day, from year to year, at a rapid pace; that those vehicles are becoming faster and more powerful, and that on the part of the Government and the provinces large sums of money are being spent to improve our main roads so that they can absorb this traffic. So it remains a matter of the greatest seriousness, but I would just say that we are pleased that the State is not apathetic regarding the question of road safety. We know that the Road Safety Council itself does outstanding work through its road safety associations, but I believe that the hon. the Minister will agree there is still room for improvement. I feel particularly that the Road Safety Council could perhaps work much more effectively if it were supported by a national set of traffic rules. I believe there may be objections on the part of the provincial authorities because there may be interference with their autonomy, if I may put it thus, but I think that if such a set of national rules were established, and the provinces were entrusted with the task of administering those rules, they could not object on that ground, but personally I think that if we could give the Road Safety Council of South Africa a set of national <span class="col_5897_5898" refersTo="page_0281"/>road rules, we shall achieve still better results. I believe also that the Road Safety Council has to contend with another problem, and that is the fact that you find one region that could very easily and very, effectively be served by one road safety association, and then you find more than one association existing in that area. I am thinking of the Cape Peninsula, e.g. where we have two&#x2014;let me say two good&#x2014; associations, but I do believe that in an area such as the Cape Peninsula, where the traffic interests are identical, we ought to have one powerful road safety association that could serve the whole area. I think that if we were to have that national basis, we could possibly pass on the application and the implementation of those road or traffic rules. I think one could approach the matter from two directions, on the one hand educational and on the other hand the more effective application of such laws or rules as may be in existence. Educationally much has already been done. We are aware of the fact that our children in both the primary and the secondary schools&#x2014; perhaps to a lesser extent in the secondary schools&#x2014;are being well trained as regards road safety, but I am concerned about the fact that the man behind the wheel does not receive proper training. Of course that is an entirely different matter. I am convinced&#x2014;and I say this with the greatest deference&#x2014;that where we at present have a wide range of road signs, perhaps 50 per cent of the hon. members sitting in this House do not know those road signs. All those road signs have been devised to promote road safety, and I believe it is most important that those rules and those signs should be observed. I think our problem is that we too easily issue drivers&#x2019; licences, and I have wondered whether the hon. the Minister should not give consideration to the possibility of drivers&#x2019; licences being issued periodically, and that they should be renewed after a period of say five years, and that all those who have committed traffic offences during the period of five years should again be tested as to their competency as drivers at the end of those five years. That will not mean that all drivers will have to be tested. Those who have no endorsement on their licences will automatically receive their renewals, but those who have been convicted of traffic offences ought to be tested on renewal. I also believe that the manner in which drivers&#x2019; licences are issued in the rural areas and in the cities and the application of the Specific rules according to which it is done, should be exactly the same. It is a disturbing fact to me that the incidence of accidents and the incidence of road deaths in the rural districts are about three times as high as in the cities, and it seems to me that it may be attributable to the fact that the roads in the country are not so good and that the ability to drive in the rural areas might not be so great either. I personally know of people who come from the country, here to the outlying areas of your cities and the motor-car is left there because they are afraid to drive in the cities.</p>

<p>I have no objection to that statement. I am sorry only that the hon. member did not raise it earlier in the debate. I should also like to see that our traffic officials should not be connected with specific municipalities. These people should in my opinion be invested as it were with the powers of a police officer. They should enjoy a higher status, and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister should not perhaps consider giving proper training and a proper status to the traffic officials so that they may be able on their own to put the requisite traffic work on a much better basis. But most important of all, we should have a set of national traffic rules for the whole Republic, and I am convinced that if the Road Safety Council were to apply it to all sections of the people, we shall largely succeed in reducing the mortality rate on our roads.</p>

<p>About a year or two ago there was some talk of erecting a hotel at the Jan Smuts Airport for the convenience of passengers. The idea was that it should be an international hotel where descent and race would not count and which could serve at the same time as a centre for international conferences, particularly for delegates from Africa states. I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister can tell us what has become of this idea and whether it is still the intention to use this hotel as a centre for international conferences. I think it will be generally welcomed if something of this nature can be done for the convenience of air passengers, although I would give preference in this connection to private initiative. But I want to say to the hon. the Minister that if this idea of erecting a hotel at the airport is proceeded with I feel that psychologically it will be wrong if it is intended to serve as a centre for international conferences, and I say that for two reasons. In the first place I feel that an airport is not really the most suitable place for such conferences. Delegates from abroad who come to one&#x2019;s country do not want to be dumped at an airport. The other reason is that delegates from non-White countries may feel that this is an attempt to withhold the facilities of the city from them. Personally I hope that the State will do something for the convenience of air passengers in respect of an hotel at or near the airport, and I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will make a statement. Whenever one arrives at Jan Smuts Airport from some other country, one has the feeling that this airport is not the advertisement for South Africa that it can and ought to be. As far as its appearance and its interior arrangements are concerned I am afraid that it compares rather unfavourably with airports in other parts of the world. Take the Nairobi Airport, for example. It is difficult to say where the fault really lies, but I think I can say that what is lacking at Jan Smuts Airport <span class="col_5899_5900" refersTo="page_0282"/>is the atmosphere that one finds at an airport such as the Nairobi Airport, for example. It lacks a South African character. I do not suggest that I have a plan to overcome this, difficulty, but I wonder whether the hon. the Minister would not consider the question of appointing a panel of artists, for example, to see whether they cannot do something about this matter so that people who disembark at Jan Smuts can feel that they are in South Africa and that we are doing something to give Jan Smuts a South African atmosphere and character. One welcomes the improvements which have been made in recent times but I am afraid that there are still a good few shortcomings. The cafeteria is not attractive; it is not attractively furnished and in summer one can hardly endure the heat there. Moreover, the toilet rooms are not convenient and attractive. I do not want to suggest that that is the general rule but I have noticed very often that they are not clean. In some of them there are no towels, soap or other facilities. The service definitely compares unfavourably with the service that one gets in this connection at overseas airports. The hon. the Minister knows as well as anybody else that one often has to spend hours at an airport. I wonder whether, instead of having a small number of toilet rooms, where the facilities are not particularly convenient at any one of them, consideration cannot be given to the question of equipping one large, decent toilet room where one can have a bath or a shower-bath, where one can have one&#x2019;s shoes cleaned and which is staffed with servants who exercise proper supervision over the facilities there. I think it would be a good thing to ensure that there is the necessary supervision at the main toilet rooms at an international airport such as Jan Smuts.</p>

<p>I have noticed that a number of changes have been made at Jan Smuts in connection with the apartheid arrangements which formerly existed there. Non-Whites are also allowed into the main hall now. I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister will just explain to the Committee what the present arrangements are; whether Jan Smuts is also regarded now as an international airport in this respect and what the position is of high dignitaries, particularly non-White dignitaries who land at Jan Smuts and spend a little time there. Do they have to use the separate conveniences or are they allowed to make use of the general conveniences?</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to waste the time of the Committee but I just want to raise one point with the hon. the Minister. If the Minister travels on the national road from Cape Town to Swellendam he will notice that two new fly-over bridges have been constructed to join the road from Hermanus with the national road. Sir, I travel that road about twice a week and I have never been held up for more than two minutes by cars coming from Hermanus, yet the authorities have spent anything up to R140,000 to build two bridges and I do not know now many miles of road to allow the cars from Hermanus to get on to the national road. A roundabout costing a couple of thousand of rand, like the ones at the Strand or Somerset West junctions with the national road would easily have sufficed. I think this is a gross waste of money. They could easily just have widened the road to Caledon with this money. It is a gross waste of money to build these two fly-over bridges, a subway, and I think about four or five miles of tarred road to lead to these two bridges. It is time the Government took steps to see to it that the authority does not waste money like that when the old national road needs widening and repairing. I just wanted to bring this to the notice of the Minister because I think it is time that the matter is gone into.</p>

<p>The Hermanus road merely joins the national road at Bot River, unlike the &#x201C;roundabouts&#x201D; near Somerset West which serve cross roads carrying 20 times more traffic and I know of no accidents having happened at these points.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I also want to make a plea to the hon. the Minister in regard to the construction of a road in the Witwatersrand area which I think should receive top priority. I have cause to believe that I will get considerable sympathy from the hon. the Minister in this plea because the road I have in mind traverses a large portion of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s own constituency. I refer to the main Reef road which gives access to Johannesburg from the west of the Witwatersrand. The north and the south are linked up with the expressways traversing the city of Johannesburg; we have a very good road which goes east to Springs via Alberton. But I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me when I say that the greatest death-trap anywhere in South Africa, is the main Reef road that goes through Langlaagte, Maraisburg, through the outskirts of Roodepoort, through to Krugersdorp. That road has the highest percentage of accidents in the whole of the Republic, particularly that portion between the city confines and the turn-off to the Western Native Townships. The hon. the Minister knows that road well. He knows that it is spattered with yellow crosses where corpses have been picked up from the tarmac as the result of motor-car accidents. The traffic departments of the townships concerned confirm that there is not a single day in the week that an accident does not take place on that road. All the traffic going west from Johannesburg travels along the main Reef road. The Minister knows there are difficulties about construction because quite a number of municipalities are involved. It affects the Minister&#x2019;s own constituency of Maraisburg; it affects the constituency of Florida, Roodepoort and Krugersdorp and the Johannesburg Municipality. One of the difficulties in coming to finality in regard to the construction of this road has been the fact that each municipality if they wish to construct it as an expressway, has to initiate the planning, the financing, the construction and <span class="col_5901_5902" refersTo="page_0283"/>the maintenance of this road individually. Up to now no finality has been reached. Johannesburg is the premier city of South Africa and it should have the best access roads of all cities. In fact, Sir, it has the worst access roads of all the cities in South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to plead very strongly with the hon. the Minister to use his influence to see if some priority could not be given to the planning and the construction of an adequate highway traversing that section of the Reef, i.e. west from the City of Johannesburg.</p>

<p>I just want to raise a small point before I sit down. The Minister will recall that I raised the policy followed by the Government Garage earlier in the debate. I asked the Minister whether, in view of the increasing cost of Government transport, it would not be a better policy to subsidize the field officers, in particular, of various Government Departments to use their own transport instead of using Government transport. I think it would be more economical to subsidize those officers to use their own transport than to provide them with Government transport. I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister will reply to that; I think it escaped his attention earlier in the debate.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>Subsidization has taken place over a number of years, so it is nothing new. It is very problematical whether it is more economical to subsidize an officer of the Department to purchase his own car and paying him a certain travelling allowance than it is to allow him to use a Government car.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of the main Reef road I can only inform the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) that the National Transport Commission does not build roads. In regard to urban roads the National Transport Commission subsidizes local authorities so it is a matter for the local authorities concerned.</p>

<p>If they want the road built they must come together, draw up their plans and submit them to the National Transport Commission. Johannesburg is already being subsidized to a very large extent&#x2014;I think to the tune of some R 15,000,000. That is a matter purely for the municipalities concerned. I agree with the hon. member that there should be an improvement on that road.</p>

<p>Should it not be declared a national road?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>You do not declare national roads inside urban areas; we are concerned about roads outside urban areas.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein also raised the question of the examinations to be passed by civil pilots. I think he has been replied to very adequately by the hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg (Mr. J. W. Rall) who has practical experience of this matter; he owns his own plane. All I want to add to what the hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg has said is that most of the accidents happen as a result of negligence, apart from mechanical defects. No matter how high the standard of examination, no matter how adequate the training is the human factor is still involved when there is an accident. This is not confined to airmen alone. We have the same position on the Railways. Drivers are put through a very severe test; they are highly qualified; they have an excellent record over a number of years and suddenly the human factor enters into the picture, negligence takes place and an accident occurs. What I can say is this that the overwhelming majority of accidents as far as civil aircraft are concerned, are of a minor nature. It is seldom that a person loses his life, as the hon. member will see from statistics. That is, in proportion to the number of accidents. The supervision is strict and the standards are sufficiently high. As the hon. member knows there is a Civil Aviation Advisory Board on which air interests are represented; the pilots are represented on that board. They are consulted in regard to all the regulations drafted by my Department before they are promulgated. They are also consulted in regard to the standard of examination and other ordinary requirements. They are perfectly satisfied with the standards laid down by the Department.</p>

<p>The Southern African Air Transport Council consists of the following members: the United Kingdom, South Africa the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the British High Commission Territories, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, Zanzibar, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. The functions of this Transport Council are the following: To keep under review and promote the progress and development of civil air communications in Southern Africa; to serve as a medium for the exchange of views and information between member countries on civil air transport matters; to consider and advise on such civil aviation matters as any member may desire to refer to the council; to furnish a link and to co-operate with the Commonwealth Air Transport Council; to keep C.O.C.C. fully informed of its deliberations. The hon. member knows what our relationship is with some of these states. It is perfectly obvious from the experience we have had in Africa in regard to other organizations that to hope for co-operation with some of these states at the present stage is a very idle and a very vain hope. I can only say that South Africa desires to co-operate with all these states and if they are prepared to cooperate we are quite prepared to co-operate with them. We will be only too willing to call this Southern Africa Air Transport Council together again if we have any assurance that these territories will agree to co-operate and to take part in the deliberations.</p>

<p><span class="col_5903_5904" refersTo="page_0284"/>The hon. member again stated that there had been complaints from pilots that they have been unable to obtain suitable weather reports when they fly between Jan Smuts and Nairobi. My Department assures me that they have received no complaints. There have been difficulties in regard to the frequency but those have been overcome. But there has been no complaint from any pilot that he has received inadequate or insufficient weather information.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Kimberley (North) (Mr. H. T. van G. Bekker) and several other hon. members raised the question of road safety. I agree with hon. members that the slaughter on the roads is causing concern. There is, however, a small ray of light to be seen, namely that the number of accidents has decreased just recently. Nevertheless the figures are alarming. The road safety organization is doing splendid work. It is a statutory body established a few years ago and it is representative of all interested parties. This organization does not confine itself to publicity only, but they do research educational work, etc. The one shortcoming of this organization is that it does not possess executive powers. This organization can only make recommendations. As hon. members know, the Department of Transport is not responsible for the enforcement of rules of the road. The Department of Transport is not responsible for the control of road traffic on the roads. It is the task and the responsibility of the several provincial administrations, and road traffic is controlled by road ordinances that are administered separately by each provincial administration. That may be one of the defects in the whole system. The road safety organization makes recommendations to the various provincial administrations in regard to heavier punishments, the improvement of road signs and all the various matters that are concerned with the promotion of road safety. But then the provincial administration has to approve those recommendations, and then the various road ordinances have to be amended so that they can fit in with those recommendations. It is a lengthy process. I have proposed that I should have a central traffic Act passed by this Parliament that will bring about uniformity, but which may be administered by the various provincial administrations. I made this proposal to the various provincial administrations but to my disappointment they nearly had convulsions about it. They say I want to deprive the provincial administrations of their powers; they consider they are quite capable enough to draft their own ordinances and to carry them out and to administer them; they do not approve at all of the Minister of Transport drafting a Road Traffic Act and having it passed by this Parliament. I have not yet abandoned the idea; I am still negotiating with the various provincial administrations. If it can be done, it will expedite matters and there will be uniformity. For instance, a year or two ago I appointed a commission that inquired into the matter as to whether a central bureau for traffic offences should be established, in other words, a central bureau where a record could be kept of all traffic offences. When a person commits more than one or two offences, steps could then be taken against him immediately. It could be done much more effectively if there were such a central road traffic Act for the whole country, legislation administered by the provincial administrations, but for which this Parliament will be responsible. In any event, this is a matter that is now being considered.</p>

<p>An hon. member raised the question of heavier penalties. That is also in the hands of the several provincial administrations. They can provide for the punishments in their ordinances. Personally I think the only real hope for an improvement is that the various provinces should agree that I should have a central traffic Act passed by this Parliament. That will bring about uniformity and eliminate delays.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) has suggested that a conference should take place between civil aviation and defence in regard to the training of defence pilots to do blind flying. I can tell the hon. member that when both civil aviation and defence make use of a particular airport all the aircraft are controlled by the same control tower, consequently there is very little danger of accidents taking place. The accident which occurred at the Louis Botha Airport has been inquired into and the report has been submitted. That report will be tabled very shortly. The hon. member will then be able to see to what conclusions that commission came to.</p>

<p>The hon. member suggested that subsidies should only be granted to young men who were prepared to join the Air Force Commandos. I think it would be an excellent thing if that could be done but in a time of war, of course, everybody is called up to do his duty. Even the young men who are not prepared to become members of the Air Commando are liable for service in the case of an emergency. They can be commandeered.

<p>*I can only tell the hon. member for Bethal-Middelburg (Mr. J. W. Rail) that the panel has not yet reported. They will report to both the advisory committee for civil aviation and to the Minister of Transport. The hon. member has also asked that the civil aviation advisory committee should be expanded to a national board, and that civil aviation should ultimately have its own department. This matter has already been considered by me for I had already received suggestions in this regard from certain associations before I introduced the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill last year. It was felt that at this stage there is no need for it. It is felt that the advisory board is quite representative, that it will serve no purpose to expand it further, and that a national council for civil aviation will virtually have no functions. There is a separate section of the Department of Transport which deals with civil aviation exclusively, and thus far no difficulty has been experienced to take all the necessary steps that have been deemed necessary, and to give all the requisite advice and to make inquiries, to conduct examinations, to carry out inspections, etc. However, if it does appear some time in the future that it should be expanded, the question will most certainly be considered. As regards the subsidies for private feeder air services, this also is a matter that is being considered at the moment by the civil aviation advisory committee. In the last resort it is really a matter for the Minister of Finance, for the subsidy, if granted, will have to be granted by the Treasury. I do not know what the attitude of the Minister of Finance and the Cabinet will be in that connection, but I am awaiting a report of the civil aviation advisory committee.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) wanted to know whether there were sufficient ship surveyors and whether all the posts had been filled. All the posts have been filled and my Department has made representations for the creation of additional posts. The hon. member also wanted to know whether fishing vessels were adequately inspected, and I agreed with everything that he said in regard to the fishing fleet. As the hon. member knows fishing vessels do not fall under the International Convention but South Africa has its own strict regulations to cover every aspect of the fishing fleet. Before a boat is built the plans have to be submitted to the Department for approval and the boat is under inspection from thence forward. In cases where problems arise or have arisen my Department has consulted with the United Nations consultative organization at Rome where experts on the fishing boats of the world are ready to give advice. The larger trawlers are still being built overseas although smaller trawlers are built in South Africa. All fishing craft are surveyed annually before they are granted a fishing licence. They are inspected afloat and in drydock in respect of hull, machinery, navigational equipment, life-saving equipment and fire-fighting equipment. All other vessels are inspected at yearly or two yearly intervals as required by the International Convention or our own regulations in respect of load lines, life-saving and fire-fighting equipment, and are further under the inspection of the classification societies such as mentioned before, Lloyds, Germanischer Lloyd, Bureau Veritas, etc. Surveyors are stationed at Walvis Bay, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban and these travel to the smaller port such as Saldanha Bay, Mossel Bay several times a year for the purpose of inspecting craft. By special arrangement with the General Post Office radio inspectors inspect all larger size vessels entering the ports and frequent surveys for renewal of international radio certificates are made on vessels of all nationalities. The smaller vessels are usually equipped with radio telephone. The South African seafaring industry has a very good record in regard to accidents.</p>

<p><span class="col_5907_5908" refersTo="page_0286"/>*The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) has asked that standards should be laid Sown by the Department of Transport for the construction of roads, the erection of traffic interchanges, etc. Of course the Department has its standards for national roads and for special roads, but they vary according to the circumstances. A road constructed by the Provincial Council and carrying much less traffic has totally different standards from those of a national road. But of course the standards fixed by the Department of Transport are within the discretion of the Provincial Administrations and the local authorities that build roads. To the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) I just want to say that the hotel project has been shelved. As regards the atmosphere at Jan Smuts, the question is what is a typical South African atmosphere. The hon. member will find, when he comes through the part for overseas passengers, that there is nothing more typically South African than that. There is one of the most splendid collections of game heads to be found in the country. All the South African game heads are there. That ought to create the proper South African atmosphere for all the overseas passengers who arrive there. There is only one head missing, namely a lion&#x2019;s head, and I hope to shoot a couple of lions this year and to present them with the heads. We obtained the heads from the old Stock Exchange Building. They had the collection in Johannesburg and when the old Stock Exchange was demolished, they gave all the heads to the Department of Transport as a present.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) said that it was a waste of money to build the interchange at the national road Caledon-Hermanus. I don&#x2019;t think it is a waste of money. It is in the interest of road safety and when freeways are built, interchanges must be built to allow the incoming traffic to get onto the freeway, and these interchanges are built in consultation with the Provincial Administration after a survey has been made, and after a count of the vehicles entering or passing over that crossing has been done. I am assured that the interchange being built at that particular spot is absolutely essential in the interest of road safety.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>We all regret the circumstances under which the hon. Minister has to take this Vote in the House to-day, and I would like to assure him of the sympathy of millions of people in this country going out to him, as also of the thousands of families on our land settlements whose well-being he fathers. We know the hon. Minister wants to take his Vote in the thorough manner that we have become accustomed, and so I would like to ask him certain information.</p>

<p>We would like to know what progress the Land Board has made as regards valuing the land to be submerged under the Orange River Scheme. We would also like to know under sub-head F &#x201C;Maintenance and Development of State Land&#x201D; which covers the control of drift sand, for which an amount of R2,000 is now made available, whether the hon. Minister thinks that this is adequate. I know the hon. Minister flies over these areas, as I also fly over some of these areas between Cape Town and Port Elizabeth, and it seems that an amount of R2,000 is very inadequate. We appreciate that the hon. Minister in certain legislation has taken steps to assure improved conditions and control of our various land settlements. I would like, however, to have some information. Could the hon. Minister inform this House what proportion of land will be allowed to the Bantu under the R36,000,000 Pongola Dam. Hrs the necessary survey been completed, and what area is each erven to comprise? We understand that under sugar not quite the same area is necessary as on the Orange River and in the other areas. We wonder if the area to be allocated to each holding is possibly smaller? We would also like to know how many probationers and settlers the hon. Minister aims at accommodating on this Pongola Settlement and if any progress has been made in placing any further settlers there under the enlarged scheme coming under this Pongola Dam project. I take it that the Bantu area will come under the control of the Minister of Bantu Administration, but if the hon. Minister can give us any information regarding this scheme, it would be appreciated. Could the hon. Minister also give us information as regards the Sand-Vet Irrigation Settlement, and how many holdings are prepared for occupation? We would like to know too if any of these settlers have had to leave the Riet River Settlement on account of the scarcity of water there. We would like to know if the Minister regards the scheduling of water there rs having been excessive, and <span class="col_5909_5910" refersTo="page_0287"/>will he have perhaps to reduce the scheduling, and whether it is going to be possible for settlers who have left to come back to the settlement, or will they be given priority on some other settlement?</p>

<p>We know that the scheduling of ground has been a difficult proposition on many irrigation schemes. Over-scheduling took place on all the Fish River-Sunday River schemes, and then the area had to be de-scheduled. Perhaps the Minister can give us any information as regards the de-scheduling or the allocation of ground on the Riet River, because from the conditions appertaining there and the history of that scheme, it does appear that too much ground was scheduled for irrigation.</p>

<p>I would also like the Minister to answer my usual question on what progress he has made in increasing the holdings of the Boegoeberg Settlement on the Orange River.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>I have always been interested. I think I was the first person to bring the matter to the notice of previous governments, the disability settlers suffered under the Boegoeberg scheme. The area allocated is seven morgen, and it was hopelessly inadequate. The hon. Minister has taken this matter in hand and he has said that he is making provision on the other side of the river so as to make the extension of these plots possible. We appreciate that action.</p>

<p>Now I come to a more entertaining subject. Could the hon. Minister give us information as regards the Zebra Park at Kromhoek under the Vote &#x201C;National Parks We would like to know how many zebras there are now, and whether the Minister does not think that there is a fear of over-stocking on account of the springbok which have again been introduced there. We all know that the mountain zebra is the most beautiful zebra in Africa, and up to recently it was threatened with extinction. So we are particularly interested in any information the hon. Minister can give us a regards the Zebra Park. There is also the Addo Park where the elephants from all accounts, and from my own observation, are thriving. There is no doubt that they are increasing to such an extent that very soon the area allocated to them is going to be inadequate. Elephants cannot thrive in too restricted an area. The elephant wanders around and I wonder whether the hon. Minister has also made plans for an extension of that park. That park I regard as one of our best game tourist attractions. It is within 30 miles from Port Elizabeth and is easily accessible to tourists, it has the last remnants of our Cape buffalo, the number of which is estimated at 400, but I doubt whether that is correct&#x2014;but it is a very important park and we appreciate the work the National Park Board has done to develop that park, especially by introducing the eland and other game there, as also the bushbuck. The Minister has taken a great interest in this work and has sought to make provision for adequate funds, and we would appreciate what he can tell us in regard to the development of our national parks.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself with what was said by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) in regard to the Minister&#x2019;s bereavement.</p>

<p>I should like to touch on a matter which undoubtedly lies near to the heart of the Minister. Here in the Western Province, where we have these beautiful mountains and all kinds of lovely flowers and plants, we find that they are continually being destroyed by fires which occur from year to year. I know that quite a number of the mountain tops belong to the State, but as the result of the whole picture, viz. that with soil conservation certain land may no longer be ploughed because it is too steep, and lies against the mountain slopes, I ask myself whether the hon. the Minister should not consider purchasing some of the mountains in the Western Province for the State while they may still be bought cheaply. We know that disas have practically disappeared. Our proteas in the Western Province are so scarce to-day that they are to be found in only a few spots, and the ixias, or green galoshes, which in my childhood were so plentiful in the Western Province, in the Tulbagh mountains and in the Porterville mountains, are becoming increasingly rare as the result of fires and also as the result of other ways of eradicating them, such as the digging out of bulbs and the injudicious picking of the flowers, not even to mention the nerinas. Is it asking too much that, where we are now so conscious of erecting monuments, the Minister should seriously consider purchasing those areas of the Western Province mountains which must in any case serve as the water sponge, the catchment area for rainwater, and which is not under cultivation, for the State. I suggest it for what it is worth, but I see every year how fires are destroying our mountains.</p>

<p>That brings me to a second point, namely that I see in the Estimates that under &#x201C;Temporary Labour&#x201D;, i.e. in so far as the Bantu are concerned, hardly any provision at all is made. Cannot the Department of Lands render us in the Western Province a great service by making more use of temporary Bantu labour in eradicating these weeds, particularly renosterbos which is so imflammable, from the mountains, and perhaps by planting something else in its stead, in consultation with the Department of Agricultural Technical Services, and by making compost of these bushes? These bushes are perhaps the main cause of fires. I personally have had experience of how easily they can be set on fire by lightning. The fire roads which are supposed to be there hardly exist at all. It is so easy to make use of this temporary Bantu labour if there is the necessary co-ordination with the Department of Labour and perhaps in consultation with the Department of Agriculture. During the season when we need labour here, e.g. for <span class="col_5911_5912" refersTo="page_0288"/>grape-picking, etc., we in any case do not have enough labour to supply the needs for temporary labour, and if a reasonable number of labourers are permanently employed by the Department of Lands and are released during those times when the Western Province really needs them for other work, the Minister will be rendering a great service to the Western Province and to South Africa in general. Let us try to preserve our natural beauties for future generations.</p>

<p>There is just one other matter I should like to put to the Minister, and that is perhaps of a local nature, and it is in connection with Vo&#x00EB;lvlei. Five years ago I raised the matter in Parliament and inquired regarding the future of the land in the vicinity of Vo&#x00EB;lvlei. At the moment it is being leased very uneconomically and forms the breeding-ground of jackal, lynx and other vermin. There we have a few large farms adjacent to each other which will never be used by the Department of Water Affairs. The old argument that the land may not be ploughed because it will pollute the water in Vo&#x00EB;lvlei no longer applies, because it so happens that the topography is such that the rainwater does not run into Vo&#x00EB;lvlei. I think the Department would do well to reach finality because there we have enough land to give a few young farmers the opportunity to make a good living if the Department is willing to make available for settlement that land which is near the water, or to sell it to the farmers. I hope the Minister will investigate that matter.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. DE LA R. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I should just like to put one or two small questions to the Minister in regard to the Orange River scheme, both in respect of Van der Kloof and Ruigtevlei. I receive calls and letters daily from people who are affected by the construction of the two dams. The riparian occupiers are not yet quite clear as to which farms will be inundated, but two months ago a start was made with the valuation of land at Ruigtevlei dam, but that work of appraisement was suddenly interrupted. I assume there are reasons as to why the appraisement was not continued. My question to the Minister is whether he cannot make a statement to more or less reassure the people. Cannot he tell us more or less when a start will be made with the valuation. The farmers along the Orange River there are fairly young farmers. They are not very keen to abandon their farming operations, and in the meantime there is speculation in land. There are people who are trying to purchase land in the hope that the State will subsequently have to buy it again and they will then make a big profit on it. That is why the matter is urgent. I suppose that certain difficulties are being experienced in the valuation of the land. A policy has to be adopted and the valuation should be watertight so that difficulties will not arise eventually, but I should like to have it on record from him that there will be no undue delay in the valuation of the land. People are becoming impatient. They would like to make improvements on the land but they do not know whether they will have to get out to-morrow or the day after, and the improvements may then be useless. I hope therefore that the Minister can make a brief statement on the valuation of land along the Orange River above the Van der Kloof and above the Ruigtevlei dams.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to raise with the hon. Minister the question of the sufficiency and accuracy of surveys and departmental maps presently available in regard to State land. We have passed the stage where there is an over-abundance of State land. It is now in short supply and it becomes more valuable by the day as we build larger and larger irrigation schemes and the question arises whether those areas comprising State land are clearly defined and surveyed and mapped with the right degree of accuracy. The problem arises in this form that as a result of certain questions put in the Other Place last year, in regard to the proposed dam at Hluhluwe in Zululand&#x2014;it appears as a result of those questions and as the result of a White Paper put out by the hon. Minister of Water Affairs, that the scheme there to be put into effect was planned on the basis of the 1:50,000 topographical map and the 1:18,000 map of the trigonometrical survey office. When that scheme was worked out, either as a result of the inaccuracy of the State maps, or as a result of an error in the calculations in the Department of the Minister of Water Affairs, in some instances points were a mile out of position from where they should have been. That immediately raises the question and puts doubt in one&#x2019;s mind as to the accuracy of the maps upon which those calculations, also by other departments were based. One does not know how old these surveys upon which these maps are based are. One does not know how long ago that was done. But it does raise a doubt in one&#x2019;s mind whether we have sufficiently accurate surveys of State land at the present time, and because the disposal of State land is assuming an importance to-day which 30 years ago it did not have, I would ask the hon. Minister to, if he is not able to reply immediately, inquire into this question with a view to having more accurate surveys taken so that there can be no disputes over boundaries and matters of that kind in future. The hon. Minister will agree that a lot of this land these days is extremely valuable and it is important that we should have accurately defined land maps of State land in the Republic, wherever it may be, and in Zululand in particular.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WARREN</person>:</from>

<p>There is just one matter I would like to draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to and it arises out of the fact that a lot of attention has been given recently to the sub-division of land and the provision of economic units for farming in the future. While we are doing that, we are allowing sub-divisioning to continue that are really endangering farming in many districts. The hon. <span class="col_5913_5914" refersTo="page_0289"/>Minister will call to mind that some years ago, I drew attention to the very factor that I am raising now again, because it continues to exist. Where you have the sub-division of communal grazing ground where the new allotment was separated from the original allotment, the hon. Minister stipulated that that might be sold. What is happening is this, that certain people are acquiring the original allotments and then selling those original allotments and retaining the new allotments, with the result that you get the same uneconomic state of affairs in respect of each of those pieces of ground. That is being done before the transfers are going through, and let me say that I regard it as a nefarious practice by certain speculators. I would like to see the hon. Minister taking steps at the very earliest possible date to put a stop to it, because we cannot continue to have two uneconomic sections of ground, separated, as they are to-day, and a man who is carrying out this practice purchasing the one piece of ground and knowing that the new piece has been allotted, he sells the original allotment. It is a practice that I regard as a bad one. They have got to have the hon. Minister&#x2019;s permission to do it, but they are being held now by these people who have purchased this land and who carry out this practice. I would honestly urge the hon. Minister to take immediate steps to put a stop to it.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF LANDS</person>:</from>

<p>The matter raised by the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) is a matter particular to his area, because this has to do with the cutting up of the old Crown Land there, and as he knows we have had a lot of problems that arose from time to time with regard to that, and I might say that with his very valuable help we managed to iron out a lot of these difficulties, and I will be very glad if he will come to my Department, because what he has mentioned now is something that apparently has arisen now and it was unforeseen as far as I am concerned, and I promise him that I will go into the matter very thoroughly. Mr. Chairman, might I be allowed to start with the last speakers: The hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) raised the question of certain maps of areas in Zululand which appear to be inaccurate, and he then raised the general question of the accuracy of our system of surveying and mapping in South Africa. As far as the question of surveying is concerned. I think South Africa can be extremely proud of the efficiency of our surveyors and our surveying in South Africa. We are one of the countries where people are very property-conscious and in all the countries where you find people property-conscious, you find that the systems of registration as well as of survey are very accurate. Now I come to the maps. We have in South Africa some of the finest maps, or maps as good as any in the world, but we have not got them for the whole of South Africa yet. The Department of Trigonometrical Survey that is responsible for drawing up maps in South Africa, has got a very efficient staff and some of the most modern machinery for the making of maps you can get anywhere in the world. The hon. member, I take it, knows that maps are no longer made in the old way, because a lot of use is made of aerial-photographs which are reduced to a certain size and then the points are laid down on maps. We are busy with that, but the hon. member will realize that the country is very big and they are working from certain important points, like the Rand and Durban and the Western Province, and also from places &#x00F6;f strategic importance in our defence. We have increased the amount spent on making these maps very considerably, because we have to make a large number also for defence, which were very inaccurate, and that cannot all be done at the same time. I have a map somewhere showing the areas which have already been done. I think about 20 per cent of the total area of South Africa has already been done, and we are going on and the work is being done extremely efficiently. I would like to invite any hon. member to come to our Department of Geometric Survey and see the work being done there. I think they will find it extremely interesting.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for De Aar (Colesberg) (Mr. M. J. de la R. Venter) has raised a ticklish problem. It is always a ticklish question when a dam is built, namely the expropriation of land there. It is not something that can take place immediately, because we cannot start expropriating until we know exactly where the dam walls will come. When we know that, we go ahead as speedily as possible. I give the assurance that I am doing my best to expedite the matter there as much as possible, and the reason is this. When a man knows his land is going to be expropriated, he is like a bird on a twig. He cannot leave until he has received the money for the sale of his land. Therefore he cannot purchase another farm, and he cannot proceed with improvements, because they will be inundated by water. I am always very sorry for those people, and I try to expedite matters as much as possible. There are many difficulties. We stopped the valuations for a time for it came to light that the basis on which we were appraising was not correct. In the long run, I may say, we get very few people who are dissatisfied with the prices that are paid. Of course we do find some who think the Government is a milch cow that can be milked, and we have to take them into account, but we try to expedite the matter as much as possible in regard to all the expropriations.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) i.a. asked about Vo&#x00EB;lvlei. Some time ago I received an application from somebody to purchase a piece of land in the immediate vicinity of Vo&#x00EB;lvlei. It was land we are holding on behalf of the Department of Water Affairs. In other words, the land is registered in the name of the Department of Lands, but if Water Affairs says the land is required for their purposes, we cannot sell it; <span class="col_5915_5916" refersTo="page_0290"/>although we may lease it. They objected to the sale of this piece of land, because they said the water coming from there runs into the vlei. Now the hon. member says there are certain areas the water of which does not flow into the vlei. But our general policy is this: When we expropriate land for a dam, we buy from the surrounding owners as much land as we require, and if it leaves them with too little land, we buy the whole farm from them. We are morally obliged to do so. Then we try to consolidate the land we have bought but which is not required for the dam, and to lease or to sell it. That is our general policy. If the hon. member could give Water Affairs the proof that this land is not required for the dam or for its extension, there is nothing in principle to debar us from selling it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to fires on the mountains and the beautiful flowers that are being destroyed. That is true. I do not think it is so much the fire that destroys the flowers. He has mentioned the nerinas. They are always at their best after a fire. Fire stimulates the growth of some of the flowers and assists their germination. I think the majority of our flowers, and the disas particularly, are exterminated by injudicious picking. The people uproot them and when you uproot a bulb, it cannot grow again. I know of places that used to be red with disas when I was a boy, and there is never a fire there, yet there are only a few now. All the mountain-tops belong to the State. Usually private land extends up to where the krantzes begin. I am now referring to the mountains at Worcester, Stellenbosch, Paarl and Hottentots Holland. The hon. member is thinking more of the mountains at Porterville but there they farm right up to the top of the mountain. But the case of all the other mountains, the tops of the mountains were never allotted under deed of grant. But it is terribly difficult to control them. Some years ago we established fire-fighting organizations. At the beginning it seemed as if the people would not take to it, but suddenly all the farmers decided it was a good thing, and now we have these committees from here to beyond Port Elizabeth. We would rather prevent a fire than extinguish it once it is there, and we prevent it by making fire-breaks, etc. But what is still more important, are access roads to the mountains so that when a fire breaks out, you can speedily extinguish it. Take Simonsberg now. I live near Simonsberg. Never a year passed but the whole mountain was on fire, but I think I can rightly say that it is ten or 15 years since last that mountain had a fire, as a consequence not only of the fire-breaks but also of the access roads, so that when a fire does start the people can be there timeously to extinguish it. With this organization, if there is a fire, the people are called up and all the people help and it is very successful.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker), who always takes a great interest in land settlement, asked me about Gariep. It is getting on fine. We will be able to place about 120 people there. Some have been placed already, and it has already relieved the pressure on the south bank. The ground there is probably of the best along the Orange River, but as the hon. member knows, you do not get a good return the first year or so, because the ground has to be tamed first. The lots there are double the size of the lots on the soutern side and we have, of course, many applications. We are using it essentially to relieve the congestion on the south bank, but unfortunately many of the people on the south bank who have small allotments and whom we hoped would apply for lots on the north bank say they are too old and do not want to start a new farm, and that they prefer to stay where they are. But quite a number have changed over. We have had to allow new people to come in on account of the fact that the people whose congestion we wished to relieve did not make sufficient use of it.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me about the zebra park. The zebra park at Cradock is one of the few places where there are mountain zebra left in the world. I think there are 20 zebras in the park and they are increasing, but on the farm adjoining it, belonging to Mr. Michau, there are also a number of zebra. We are negotiating to increase the size of the park considerably, and we hope to incorporate some of the zebras which are not in the park now. As far as I know, there are only three places where mountain zebra are still found, in Cradock, near George, and in my own constituency. Up to 1902 there was a herd of 120 at Piketberg, but they were unfortunately shot out during the Anglo-Boer War by people who mistook them for the enemy. We are very careful in controlling the game there and when they reported to me a week or two ago on the number of springbok in the Addo Park, I mentioned that we should keep very few springbok there. We do not want to allow other game there in great quantities, because although the eland, the rooi hartebees and the springbok do very well there, we want to keep that park essentially as a zebra park, and we do not want to allow too many other game to encroach there. At Addo we are also trying to get more ground. There is a fork of ground belonging to private people which comes into the Addo Park and we are trying to round off the park, which will make it considerably bigger. Of course, a little influence used with my colleague the Minister of Finance will make my proposition easier. The Addo Park now has a very fine collection of animals. There are the elephants which are increasing. If they increase too much we will have to thin them out. There are quite a large number of buffalo, and there are also buffalo outside the park on private land. They have now brought in a number of types of game which were indigenous to that area before, like eland and the rooi hartebees and rhino and hippopotami. Unfortunately the hippopotami had some very serious trouble between the females, and one of the most valuable females was killed by another equally <span class="col_5917_5918" refersTo="page_0291"/>valuable female. We have now discovered some oribi, which are also indigenous there. Fortunately a farmer in my constituency still has some of them, and we will take some of them over. We have not taken bush buck there because there are many bush buck there already. But Addo Park is getting on very well indeed.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me about driftsand. It has nothing to do with this Vote; it comes under Forestry, but with the permission of the House I will reply to it. We have estimated that there are 54,000 morgen of drift sand in the Republic, which will have to be stabilized. At present we are busy with 16,700 morgen, of which 6,500 morgen have already been stabilized satisfactorily. I appointed a Committee to go into the whole question and to see whether the methods we were using, both from the organizational point of view and the work itself, were satisfactory and they have submitted a report and I think that as the result of the report we will make faster progress than before. But the work is proceeding satisfactorily.</p>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know, in regard to Pongola, whether we would go on with sugar there, and how much of the land there will be given to the Bantu and how many people it can accommodate. In the first place, the number of people who can be accommodated depends on what they farm with. If you farm with sugar, you use considerably more water than for mixed farming. The figures I gave last year showed that if we farmed with sugar we would be able to put about 50,000 morgen under irrigation, and if we went in for mixed farming it might be 60,000 to 65,000 morgen. Last year the sugar position was very bad, and although we started if off as a sugar scheme, we were very chary as to what it would end up as, because if there was going to be a surplus of sugar in South Africa it would be very stupid of us to increase that surplus unnecessarily. However, it seems that the sugar market has taken a change for the better and in all probability we will be able to stick to our first idea to make this a sugar-growing area. It is intended that quite a large section of this land will be used for irrigation by the Bantu. But as the hon. member knows, a Committee has been appointed and it has been taking evidence in Zululand and Northern Natal in regard to what will happen to all the State land there, and this is one of the questions they have to investigate specially, how much of this land which falls under the Pongola scheme will be reserved for the Bantu.</p>

<p>The Sand-Vet scheme is getting on fine. We have already placed 144 people there and as it develops we will place considerably more there. I am not sure what the total number is that we will be able to place there, but it will be between 300 and 400. Of course, when we start with the Orange River scheme we will have a large number of settlers. In passing, I may say that I hope that the Orange River scheme and also the rest of the Sand-Vet scheme will be able to be used for cleaning up the small, uneconomic holdings. In other words, people who have uneconomic holdings will be able to be placed there, and we will be able to consolidate their uneconomic holdings and put other people there. But I explained that matter fully when I introduced the Land Settlement Bill a little while ago. The hon. member asked how many people had to leave the Riet River scheme. I do not think anyone had to leave permanently, but we had applications from a number of people to be allowed to go and work elsewhere, and we gave them all permission, so that they could increase their income. But now I think that most of them are coming back because there is no shortage of water at all now. The dam is 75 per cent full, which means that there is enough water for about two years, and it is hoped that when the Orange River scheme is tackled it will supply the Riet River scheme with water to supplement any water shortage there. The hon. member asked whether we did not give too great an allotment of water. I think we give too much water everywhere. The man who knows how to irrigate, like the man who comes from Oudtshoorn or Calitzdorp, always manages with much less water than an inexperienced man. When I was in charge of Water Affairs, we started selling water as the man used it, and we credited him at the end of the year with the water he did not use, and that had a very beneficial effect. But as far as Riet River is concerned, we have not given out all the plots there are. Quite a lot of them were not allotted during Mr. Conroy&#x2019;s time because they were afraid there was not sufficient water. But if the water there is increased by the water from the Orange River, it will enable us to consider allotting it all.</p>

We are grateful also for the tact he has used in acquiring the lands in the Fish River Valley, and for the manner in which he handled the matter. I just want to tell him that we in the Eastern Province, and I think everybody in South Africa, sympathize with him to-day.</p>

<p>There is one point the Minister touched on which I feel I must reply to. He said he was considering reverting to the original idea of growing sugar under the Pongola scheme. He referred to current conditions in the sugar industry, but I hope that the Minister will take no steps in that regard without consulting the Minister of Economic Affairs and the South African Sugar Association.</p>

<p>As the Minister probably knows, this current expansion may be only a temporary position, and the whole situation could change within six months. We are only able to expand and export at present for two reasons, because the severe winter in Europe has damaged the beet crop there, and because of the difficulties obtaining in the surgar industry in Cuba through the advent of the Castro regime, which resulted in a marked fall in production. That is an area where the climate enables a recovery within 12 or 18 months, and within that period the sugar producers in South Africa might well be back where they were, fighting, as they always have, the difficulties arising from over-production, and trying to find economic markets for our surplus. In those circumstances I would ask the Minister to approach this question of growing sugar and Pongola with great circumspection and not even to consider embarking on that course unless there is general approval of those connected with the sugar industry. I venture to suggest that if the Minister approaches the industry at present they would strongly advise against it, despite the apparently improved position in the overseas sugar market.</p>

<p>I might just point out that my colleague the Minister of Water Affairs has delayed the tempo of construction there for this very reason, and secondly I would like to assure the hon. member that in building any of these dams we always consult Economic Affairs, both Departments of Agriculture, and the industry concerned with the production of the particular article which we think can be produced there, because it is very easy to create surpluses by building a big irrigation scheme. When we decided to go in for sugar there we had the almost enthusiastic agreement of the sugar industry. But the hon. member need not be afraid that we will put up Pongola as a rival to the sugar industry of Natal. We want to work in conjunction with that industry because it is of vast importance to South Africa and it would be very stupid of us to undercut it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to break a lance for the Deeds Registries, and I do so because I have so much respect for that office. I think we can justifiably say that the Minister and all of us can be proud of that office. It is not only an office that renders important work, but the work is also being done by extremely competent people. The result is that we in South Africa have the most efficient system of registration in the world. Since the earliest times it has been important to us to have title deeds, for we attached great value to our land. It is important also in our economic life because ownership in land passes on the registration thereof. After the Deeds Registries Act was passed, it was provided by regulation that five days after it has been lodged a deed must be registered. It goes without saying that there consequently always is an inducement to the officials in that office to do their work according to that schedule. But it is important also because all who are concerned with it, such as the banks and other organizations, must know in advance when registration will take place. Without it, the financial position will be chaotic.</p>

<p>Every transaction in the Deeds Registry is examined very carefully by the officials of the Deeds Registry themselves with regard to the description of the persons involved, the description of the properties, the extent of it the validity of the transaction, the nature of the transaction and a number of the matters that have to be taken into consideration prior to registration. In addition, the Deeds Registry Officials must see to it that the registration complies with our common law principles as well as all the relevant statutes that may be applicable to the registration of deeds. I have said that we have an extremely efficient system and an excellent staff, but for the very reason that that personnel has rendered such sterling services to South Africa in the past, it has in the meantime become customary to burden the Deeds Registry with more and more duties. At the present time we get numerous Acts and ordinances of which the Deeds Registries are aware, and which have to be taken into consideration before registration can be effected. We think e.g. of the townships ordinances, the municipal and divisional council ordinances, the Ribbon Development Act, the Slums Act, the Group Areas Act, the Groups Areas Development Act, the Housing Act, the Water Act, the Native Trust Act and numerous other Acts. The staff of the Deeds Registries have to be acquainted with all those Acts and have to see to it that the, requirements of those Acts are complied with before registration can be effected. We know how many Acts have been passed in this House: we think, e.g. of the Housing Act which was passed here recently, where provision is made for the Deeds Registry to be the safety valve to see to it that the requirements of that Act are duly complied with. As the result of that the Deeds Registry therefore also <span class="col_5921_5922" refersTo="page_0293"/>to a large extent serves as an instrument for carrying out State policy because, as I have said, the Deeds Registry is the safety valve through which that policy is implemented with regard to the registration of titles and other deeds. That means that we should have well-trained people in the Deeds Registries with fairly long experience and a particularly good knowledge of the law because every day in their work they have to deal with lawyers in regard to the registration of deeds. We find also that the Deeds Registry is a very important cog in the State machine that runs quietly from year to year without much being said about the Deeds Registries. But it has come to our attention that much difficulty is being experienced in seeing to it that there always are sufficient trained staff in the Deeds Registries to do the work. We frequently find that when people have been properly trained in the Deeds Registries they receive offers from outside, and that in consequence of that they leave the service and accept other appointments. That is a pity and I think we should try to avoid that. After these many years of training devoted to the staff of the Deeds Registry, it is not desirable that we should lose the Deeds Registry staff, because they have been trained specifically for that work, frequently under very difficult circumstances. We frequently find, as a result of the resignation of officials from the Deeds Registries, that those who remain are so overloaded with work that they simply cannot cope with all the work. Quite recently I ascertained here in the Deeds Registry at Cape Town that the office was no less than four days in arrear with its work. I pointed out earlier on that the regulations provide that deeds must be registered five days after being lodged. They were four days in arrear with their work, and in consequence of that more and more work is loaded upon the remaining officials. I also tried to investigate and asked myself what we could do to make the Department a little more attractive. I made a comparison in the light of our Estimates of Expenditure, and I should like the hon. the Minister to look at page 276, the staff of the Master&#x2019;s offices. I think that is an office we could very conveniently compare with the Deeds Registry. When one looks at the Master&#x2019;s Office, one finds that the estimated expenditure of the Master&#x2019;s Office is a good deal less than that of the Deeds Registry. The personnel in the Master&#x2019;s Office is considerably smaller than that of the Deeds Registry, and as regards conditions of employment, I think the two are very comparable, save that I can say, from my experience, without the slightest hesitation and without derogating in the least from any other government department, that there surely is not another office in our state machine where so much hard work is done as is done in the Deeds Registry. If one draws a graph of the establishment of the Master&#x2019;s Office in comparison with that of the Deeds Registry, one finds that in the Master&#x2019;s Office and in the Deeds Registry there is one official on the highest scale; on the next scale there is no officer in either of the two offices: in the next scale there are four officials in the Master&#x2019;s Office whereas in the Deeds Registry there is only one official on that scale. In the next scale again there are no officials in either of the offices; in the next scale there are four officers in the Master&#x2019;s Office and five in the Deeds Registry, and then we find that the number in the Deeds Registry increases tremendously; in other words, on the lower scales there are many more officers in the Deeds Registry in comparison with the number in the Master&#x2019;s Office. On the next scale there are nine in the Master&#x2019;s Office and 21 in the Deeds Registry; on the next scale there are only 11 in the Master&#x2019;s Office and 32 in the Deeds Registry, and as you go further down the scale the position becomes worse. It amounts to this; When one draws a graph of the two, one finds that the funnel created in the case of the Deeds Registry comes in from the outside and becomes narrower with a long tube towards the top. The Deeds Registry has an establishment of 348; the Master&#x2019;s Office has 256. The Estimates of the Deeds Registry amount to R769,000; that of the Master&#x2019;s Office amount to only R419,000, but in spite of that there are fewer high positions in the Deeds Registry than in the Master&#x2019;s Office, with the result that there are not the same opportunities in the Deeds Registry as in the Master&#x2019;s Office which I used as a comparison. Therefore in the Deeds Registry there are not the same opportunities for these people who have to study and work very hard, to be able to reach the higher rungs of the ladder to a greater extent. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister, in the light of these circumstances, to make some inquiry into the position of the personnel of the Deeds Office.</p>

I notice that there is a general increase so far as the various Deeds Offices are concerned, and this is what one would expect under present circumstances. Knowing something of the work which is being done in the Deeds Office in Pietermaritzburg I am concerned to see that with the exception of Vryburg, which is down by a few hundred Rand, the allocation for Pietermaritzburg is down by a fairly substantial amount.

Very often these officers have to work long hours. It is not in the interest of the public that that should be so. I really do believe that the whole matter should be gone into because I <span class="col_5923_5924" refersTo="page_0294"/>believe that the really splendid work done by this Office cannot be maintained if the officers have to work under the conditions which exist to-day.

<p>The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) has raised quite an important matter here. While he was speaking he sent over to me a graph which is quite impressive but as in the case of most graphs it requires a thorough study to find out what the implications really are. The position does not seem to be quite right to us either, but the way in which the matter is rectified if a department feels that a sub-division of the department is unbalanced, is to call in the Public Service Commission and to cause the work done by the various persons in that department to be evaluated. These evaluations are applicable throughout the Public Service. Hon. members will realize that we cannot, simply because we are sorry for the officials in one department, go along and improve the grading of the posts in that department if the evaluation of the work does not justify it. But we have now asked the inspectorate of the Public Service Commission to examine the whole set-up in the Deeds Office. The inspectorate is doing that at the moment. I hope that we shall have the report in the near future and I can give the hon. member the assurance that we shall act on that report.</p>

<p>Then there is still the question of the shortfall of R 1,500 in the allocation for Pietermaritzburg. Unfortunately I do not have the information here, but I want to assure the hon. member that we shall find out what the reason is for this reduction and let him know.</p>

<p>Last year when we dealt with this Vote the Minister gave us some very interesting figures in relation to the amount of South African timber that was being used in the boxwood industry in South Africa; he gave us the percentage of the total amount used in the boxwood industry and I hope he can give us that figure again for the past 12 months and that he will be able to show that that percentage is increasing, because there must be a growing use of boxwood in the fruit industry of South Africa.</p>

<p>Then I should like the hon. the Minister to give us some information with regard to the wattle industry. I make no apologies for asking the Minister again, as we did last year to give us some information as to the position of the wattle industry in relation to overseas markets because we know that the wattle industry is in a very parlous position. The wattle producer was in a very bad position last year as far as quotas were concerned. I think judging by what happened last year we are going to be in an even worse position as producers in the coming year. Many of the small producers will go under if the present small quota is going to be kept as the limit. Many wattle growers have tried to switch to other agricultural products, mainly dairy produce, and there again they have not only come up against over production as far as the markets are concerned, but as everybody in this House knows, prices in the dairy industry dropped last year. The fixed price for the producer was decreased, with the result that those who switched over from the wattle industry to the dairy industry suffered once again. The question is what these people can do to-day. Practically every market that the producer has in this country is over-supplied. Many producers try to go in for the production of maize, but as everybody knows there is tremendous over-production in maize. The Department of Agricultural Technical Services advised the wattle growers to turn to the production of milk and what happened to them? Milk prices dropped considerably in the last year. At the time we dealt with this Vote last year, there was a conference overseas at which we were represented by officials of the Department together with officials representing the overseas producers of quebracho and representatives of the continental producers of chestnut. Of course, it is the Argentine producers of quebracho who have queered the market and caused a drop in the price of tanning products over the whole world. I wonder if the hon. the Minister can tell us whether there is any hope of international conferences arriving at the sort of agreement which we had and which worked so successfully over the years, an agreement which was based on a quota system and a fixed price system. The Minister himself went across to the Argentine but nothing came out of that visit. At the time we discussed the Vote last year, the Minister informed us that there was a conference going on in Europe at that time in relation to tanning material, and I would like the Minister to tell us whether there is any hope of some future conference helping us in that regard, because the wattle producer is in a very bad way at the present time. Sir, last year at the annual general meeting of the S.A. Timber Growers&#x2019; Association very interesting papers were read by certain of the manufacturers of timber with regard to the construction of houses constructed entirely from timber. In those papers they dealt not only with the experiments which they had made in relation to the various types of timber and how it should be used and treated to stand up to the extreme weather conditions in this country but also with the prejudice that had to be overcome especially on the part of local authorities who feared the risk of fire where timber houses were situated close together. This prejudice is not confined to local authorities only; we find the same prejudice on the part of the various planning bodies. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister can give us any idea what the attitude of his Department is in relation to houses constructed entirely of timber.</p>

<p>Earlier in this Session the hon. the Minister, in connection with a debate which took place on a private member&#x2019;s motion, referred to his policy in relation to Government sawmills and their general activity and the part that they play in the economy of the country. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong when I say that the Minister then stated his policy as being in favour of the maintenance and support generally of private enterprise so far as the timber industry was concerned, in certain directions, more particularly with regard to sawmilling and the processing of timber. The Minister went so far as to say that at the appropriate time, sooner or later, his intention was to dispose of the Government sawmills, starting with those which were making no profit or a very small profit, and then gradually going on until the others were disposed of. The question of the processing of timber of course, goes along with that, but I wonder whether the Minister would elaborate on that and tell us precisely what he has in mind so far as that aspect is concerned. Private enterprise, of course, is now coming more and more into the picture so far as sawmilling and processing are concerned, and therefore this becomes a matter of supreme importance to us. I do not want to go into the question of the use of timber at the moment. I have been associated with that aspect of the matter in another capacity. The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) has raised this matter and if the Minister replies to him, perhaps his reply will also answer my questions. Sir, there is one small item on page 28 of the Estimates to which I would like to refer and that is under Head G, where there is a small note which recurs year after year, &#x201C;subscription to International Union of Forest Research Organizations&#x201D;, R20. That is such a small amount that while I understand that it may simply be a gesture on the basis of good neighbourliness, it does not seem to mean very much &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The point that I am coming to is what we get for our subscription. You, Mr. Chairman, with the background that you have, will understand the value of research organizations, or organizations which are set up for the purpose of research. That is perhaps the better way to put it. Sir, as I have stressed before in this House, in my opinion money spent on research in connection with all aspects of timber, that is to say, right from the selection of your seed trees, your seed, your sowing, your processing and the final marketing of timber&#x2014;is money well spent. There is no aspect of it which will not benefit from more research than we have been able to do so far. I simply want to know from the Minister whether we are getting something out of this subscription. Is this an organization which furnishes us with reports from time to time or with the papers which are read before that organization so that we can be kept up to date so far as our own Department of research is concerned; to keep our department of research abreast of the lessons being learned by other departments of research, lessons which may perhaps be learned at perhaps very great expense in other countries. If those lessons are made available to us we then do not have to spend money on original research in our own country. The work will have been done and paid for in some other country and we get the benefit because we are associated with this organization. Are we getting that kind of benefit or are we just paying a subscription as a good-neighbour policy, without getting very much out of it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_forestry">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member will be surprised to learn how much we are getting for our R20. I think this is probably one of the most profitable investments which anybody has ever made. The International Union of Forest Research Organizations is an organization which undertakes research in forest bibliography, general forest influences, research on site factors, study of foreign plants, technical means of amelioration of forest production (silviculture), forest protection, study of growth and yield and of forest management, forest economics, operational efficiency, mechanical conversion of forest products, etc. All the results which this organization obtains are conveyed to members for a subscription of R20 per annum. I do not know who pays for it but we get the results. I would like to add that as far as our own particular research is concerned, more particularly as applied to our South African conditions we are now doing much more than we have ever done in the past. The grants to our universities have been increased fourfold in the last few years. We have put it to the Treasury, which has accepted this proposition, that forestry in South Africa is becoming a very large industry and that we are entitled to spend more money on research and on advertisement of our products than would be the case ordinarily. Our income from our state forests is very considerable; it amounted to R9,000,000 last year, just from our own forests. The Treasury realizes this and is making more assistance possible. We are undertaking research into the wattle industry through the Natal University and also through the Faculty of Forestry at Stellenbosch as far as silviculture is concerned and we are also doing a lot of research ourselves. We have a very fine developing research station in the Sabie district where they are doing very fine work on selection and reproduction of selective strains.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of our milling policy. The policy remains exactly as I put it. I just want to make one thing quite clear. The hon. member might have created some apprehension amongst people when he said that it was my policy to get rid of the Government mills. What I said was that we would not in the first place erect any more Government mills; that we would leave <span class="col_5927_5928" refersTo="page_0296"/>that to private enterprise. The only new mills which we might erect would be specialized mills for certain types of timber in which private enterprise is not interested. I said that we were doing away with a number of our smaller mills which were uneconomic, and that we have done already. The increase in the number of mills as between private enterprise and our mills shows that private enterprise is now forging ahead. In 1948 private mills milled 1,500,000 cubic feet; last year they milled 22,500,000 cubic feet. The mills which are operated by the Government milled 12,000,000 cubic feet. They are already 10.000,000 cubic feet a head of us, and I may say that the milling industry is quite satisfied with the arrangements which we have made with them. The hon. member will remember that there was a time when the Government mills milled even more wood than private enterprise did, and then a predecessor of mine who is now the Minister of Transport, made an arrangement with them whereby the wood would be divided on a 50-50 basis; that was the first stage. Then as the private millers came in and improved their machinery, which was very important also, I went a step further and said that we would stop the development of Government mills and leave the milling industry to the private millers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#henwood">

<from>Capt. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HENWOOD</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask you a question before you leave that point? Is private enterprise milling 22,000,000 cubic feet of its own wood?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_forestry">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>No, a very large proportion of that is our wood. We are selling it and we will continue to sell it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) also raised the question of timber houses. There has been a prejudice against timber houses by local bodies and municipalities in South Africa. I do not know why that prejudice is there. I am informed that 70 per cent of the houses in Canada are constructed of timber, or at least that they have bricks for the first few feet and then timber higher up. In certain parts of America it goes up to almost 100 per cent. It differs in parts depending upon the availability of wood. I think it has been established satisfactorily in this country that a timber house lasts just as long as a brick house. A timber house also has certain advantages; it is extremely attractive inside and it is so well insulated that it is cool in summer and warm in winter. The risk of fire is no more serious in the case of a timber house than in the case of a brick one. This statement might be rather unacceptable but I believe that is actually the case. We have been trying to propagate the use of timber houses and there are various associations who are also propagating the further use of wood in this country. We work in close co-operation with them and we also subsidize them to a certain extent. They are doing a great deal of good work to encourage people to build timber houses. They are having a certain amount of success. What is actually taking place is that in some towns people have started to erect timber houses just outside the municipal area. The people within the municipal area see those houses and want to know why they cannot erect similar houses within the municipal area. They then exert pressure on the municipalities and many of these municipalities have revised their old rules. I might also add, not by way of an advertisement, but because we consider it more economical, that the Department intends to build wooden houses in certain areas for its employees. Otherwise it will be a bit anomalous if we who propagate the use of timber build brick houses for our employees in the forests.</p>

<p>The wattle industry has, of course, been in deep waters lately. What we have managed to do as a result of the Wattle Bill which I introduced a few years ago, has been to get the whole industry reorganized. I might just say, although the question was not put to me, that the new board is functioning, the relationship between the new wattle board which consists of a chairman appointed by me who is an official of my Department and the millers, the processors and the producers of wattle-bark is most amicable, much more amicable than ever in the past, and I think as far as that is concerned we can be very satisfied indeed.</p>

<p>We then come to the question of the marketing of wattle. As the hon. member knows quebracho came into the market at a considerably lower price than before and has upset things to a very large extent. I have had talks with the Argentinians and I have sent Mr. Malherbe of my Department to have further talks with them and quite recently unofficial discussions took place in London between members of the quebracho industry, the wattle industry and I think the chestnut industry although they are not so much affected. I think I can say that we went considerably further at the London discussions than before. We hope that in the course of time we will be able to get something done. The quebracho people are in this enviable position that they do not have to plant the trees. You find them in enormous areas in different parts of Argentina; you just erect your factory and start working it. When you have exhausted the supply you move your factory and you start all over again. You have no other costs than the costs connected with the collecting and the processing of this tree. That makes it rather difficult for the wattle industry. I do think, however that we are making progress, perhaps not the progress we should like to make. At any rate we have agreed to exchange information and we are also getting information from them which we did not get before.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about the use of boxwood. The Department produced 1,600.000 cubic feet of boxwood this year. This is about the same as last year. I want to warn the manufacturers of boxwood; they are up against a serious problem indeed and that is cardboard. I think it is just as well that I utter this word of warning. I cannot say that <span class="col_5929_5930" refersTo="page_0297"/>I hold a brief for the one or the other because they are both products of the forest. Cardboard is made by a few large firms only whereas there are probably a few hundred small firms sawing boxwood. The cardboard people are pushing their products very hard and if the boxwood people are not careful they are going to find themselves in difficulties. I received a box of apples the other day in a cardboard box. I have seen grapes packed in cardboard boxes; admittedly it was an experiment, but I have seen it. That was for shipment overseas. The cardboard box is more expensive but it has certain advantages.</p>

<p>When the hon. member spoke about boxwood I also think he had the question of the general production in mind. I might just give a few figures to show the enormous increase in production of wood from our Government plantations; that is wood which is either worked by us or sold. In 1940 we produced 10,000.000 cubic feet of wood and last year we produced 52,000,000 cubic feet. This shows that there has been an enormous increase over this period of 23 years. There was a considerable increase last year. The production in 1958-9 was only 35,500,000 cubic feet. Wood is not a product like mealies where the production varies from year to year. We have had a steady increase except for one year where the production was less than the previous year ard that was due to the war and not due to the non-availability of wood. We are now getting a market for our wood in South Africa because the prejudice against South African wood is disappearing to a large extent. Our wood is graded according to the specifications of the Bureau of Standards and people have come to realize the value of wood with the mark of the Bureau of Standards on it. For the first time there is very close cooperation between the saw-millers on the one hand and those people who use the wood on the other hand. I can say quite frankly that in the olden days people were more interested in imported wood than in South African wood but that has changed completely. The timber merchants are pushing South African woods as enthusiastically as the millers and the growers themselves. I think that has contributed largely to the general sound state of the timber industry in South Africa.</p>

<p>I should appreciate it if the Minister could give us for general information the area which is under forest plantations or the number of trees that have been planted. I should also be pleased if the Minister could inform us what area of forest plantations will be handed over to the control of the future Transkeian Government. Now that the Minister is in a giving-away mood I should like to appeal to his generosity to meet the needs of certain White people in the area which I represent. The Minister holds a considerable extent of almost useless land in that area. It is absolutely useless for afforestation. Bits and pieces of forest land have been sold by him in the Alexandra district and there are numerous pieces in the Bathurst district which are only a menace in that they encourage stock diseases. It would be far better if those pieces of land were sold to the agricultural community. Some of these bits could be turned into useful farms and be to the public advantage of the country generally. These pieces of land can never be of any advantage to the Minister as far as afforestation is concerned. They are actually only a encumberance to his Department.</p>

<p>My principal appeal is in regard to the forestry land which adjoins Bathurst. The inhabitants of Bathurst all own erven and they have the right to run a certain number of stock on the commonage. In previous years that stock had the free run of the adjoining Government forestry ground in extent about 2,000 morgen. Latterly the Government has fenced off that forest area so that the available grazing has become very limited. At the moment there are 18 very decent houses vacant in the village of Bathurst. I want to appeal to the hon. the Minister to consider making available to the inhabitants of Bathurst this area of forest ground adjoining that village. In the early days there was a dispute in respect of this ground. The inhabitants of that village regarded it as their own property and they were allowed to use it. Latterly, however, the Government has, because of its hunger for land, decided that they, the inhabitants of Bathurst, were not entitled to this land so they fenced it off. This land is of no value to the Department whereas it will be of great advantage to the inhabitants of Bathurst. This is something which will be appreciated for very many years and I appeal to the Minister to give this question his serious consideration.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) should come and see me about this Bathurst question. It is rather a parochial matter to discuss across the floor of the House and quite frankly this is the first time I have heard about it. The hon. member did ask me how much land we have, under, forests and I should like to give him these figures. To-day there are 318,746 moreen of land under afforestation of which 266,094 morgen are under my Department and 52.652 odd morgen under the Native Trust, I might tell the hon. member that we do the work for the Native Trust. It does not belong to the Department of Forestry but we manage it for the Native Trust. During the year 1961-2 we planted at the rate of about 6.400 morgen and we think that the same number of morgen will be planted during the coming financial year.</p>

<p>What I should like to have from the hon. the Minister is information rather than anything else. I should like to have some information in connection with a possible new set-up between his Department and another Government Department, namely the Department of Posts. A statement has been issued by the Government to the effect that the Post Office is going to take over certain functions of the Department of Public Works. In so far as it affects the Department of Posts I shall, of course, deal with the matter under the relevant Vote, but in view of the fact that these two Departments are specifically mentioned in that statement I should like to know what the position is as far as the Department of Public Works is concerned. I think more than 10 per cent of the work that is done by the Department of Public Works is in connection with the Post Office itself. If there is going to be a new set-up, if some of the powers which the Department of Public Works has at present are going to be transferred to the Department of Posts. I should like to hear from the Minister to what extent such powers are going to be transferred; whether this is going to be purely a formality or whether there is a possibility that a portion of the architectural division, the building workers division, etc., of the Department of Public Works is going to be transferred to the Department of Posts. Provision has already been made for a very large building programme as far as the Department of Posts is concerned. Is the Department of Posts going to carry out that programme or is the position simply going to be that the Department of Posts will lay down certain specifications and that Public Works will carry out the work? It will be interesting to know whether this is going to bring about any saving and if so, what saving? I should also like to know how far this new arrangement between the two Departments has progressed. This is the only opportunity that I have to raise this matter.</p>

There were certain respects in which it was difficult to draw a dividing line between the activities of the Department of Posts and those of the Department of Public Works and certain other Departments. A committee was therefore appointed to draw a dividing line. It is true that there are certain works which were formerly done by Public Works and which are now going to be done by the Department of Posts&#x2014;minor works such as day-to-day repairs. The specifications for large buildings which have to be erected, are drawn up by our architects in co-operation with their engineers.

<p>I should like to extend the same invitation to the Minister of Public Works which I extended to the Minister of Transport on Friday namely that he should visit the East London Airport to study the position there. A serious position has now arisen there as a result of the unprecedented rains we have had. The old apron has been put completely out of action, the apron which adjoins the old buildings, which are a relic of the last war. That apron is now completely out of action and the planes are now landing at the new apron which is right at the other end of the aerodrome. The public has to stand outside in all weather while the plane is being refuelled. They are transported to the old buildings a mile or more away; there is a regular circus of vehicles crossing the runway everytime a plane arrives, as a result of which planes sometimes have to remain circling in the air until the runways are clear. The Minister of Transport has told us that it was not considered worthwhile doing anything to the old area and that the only solution was to get on with the building of the new buildings for which an amount of R260,000 has been allocated, although provision is made in the Estimates for only R50 for this year. On account of the rains the position has now become one of urgency and I hope the Minister for Public Works will give this matter his attention. I shall be very grateful if the Minister will give a statement in connection with this matter.</p>

<p><span class="col_5933_5934" refersTo="page_0299"/>I want to raise a few points in general under this Vote. Although I want to associate myself to some extent with the remarks made by the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan). I should like to know whether the Minister thinks that the Department of Public Works, particularly the architectural section, is keeping pace with development which is taking place in the rest of the country. To judge from inquiries made with Prisons, Defence and from other Departments where new buildings are required and for which money is already provided in the Estimates, substantial delays take place before actual work can be commenced, delays which are caused by the Department of Public Works in preparing their documents. I want to make it quite clear that I am not in any way criticizing the staff of the Department. It is something which we come up against time and time again where the expansion of the Department is not keeping pace with the activities of the State. If you look at the amounts provided for in the Estimates and in the Loan Estimates which have a bearing on the position although I cannot discuss them at this stage, you find that we are being asked to vote very large amounts of money for building development in practically every Department of State. We have Bantu Administration which is developing; there is Coloured Affairs, Justice, Defence in particular. We are making provision for very, very large sums, a programme with which the present staff will be unable to cope. One of the points I want to put to the hon. Minister is this: Can more use not be made by the Department of outside industry? We have established civil engineering firms in this country who have quantity surveyors, civil engineers, architects, etc., available. Is it not possible to off-load a quantity of this work onto them thus avoiding the red-tape which is slowing down and hampering the Department of Public Works? Like all other Departments, Public Works is tied up with a number of regulations which have been in existence for years until they have become a sort of religion in the Department. In the meantime building techniques and building material are changing almost overnight in the outside world. What used to be a tremendous job two or three years ago is to-day taken in its stride by outside industry, and the buildings outside industry produce are equal to anything we require and comparable to any in the world. I would urge upon the Minister to have that aspect examined with a view to making more use of those facilities which are available in the country. There has been a dearth of work in the building industry; it may be speeding up now but qualified personnel has been available and still is to tackle some of the Government works which are all urgent works. In the majority of cases the fact that this work is not completed is holding up other development in the Department concerned.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, when proceedings were interrupted by the suspension of business, I had been suggesting to the hon. Minister of Public Works to give serious consideration to greater use being made of what one might term the commercial professional resources of the country to help the Department cope with the tremendous plans of development requiring the construction of buildings in some shape or form. One of the benefits which will flow from it is that in many of the cases where proposals have to be translated into an item on the Estimates, the first thing required is that the Public Works Department has to draw up a report covering the aspects of the particular proposal before it can be converted into plans and specifications and that type of thing. A report is first of all forwarded by them on various points, such as whether the site is suitable, whether the necessity for the proposal exists, etc. etc. If one relieves them of a certain amount of the professional planning work which follows after that report is completed, it would to some extent relieve the pressure on the Department. The more one studies them, and sees the many millions of rand provided in the Estimates before us, one realizes that almost every item entails a building of some sort, and in the majority of cases buildings which are extremely important. I can think of half-a-dozen cases in the Peninsula where post office development is being held up, it has been approved of, but is being held up, waiting for plans and specifications. If one thinks only of the Defence Department where there is tremendous expansion, the whole organization is being handicapped as a result of the absence of the huge mass of new buildings required. It is unfair to expect a Department which in itself has had practically no expansion on the technical side&#x2014;if you compare the figures between this year and last year, you find that the total increase in the architectural branch, the engineering branch and the survey branch of the P.W.D. amounts to four additional staff members for this year, termed as &#x201C;other staff&#x201D;. Yet the amount of work involved is out of all recognition when compared with previous years. Therefore I would urge on the hon. Minister to give attention to the greater use of the private civil engineering professional services in the Republic. We have got them. In many cases they can cope with all phases <span class="col_5935_5936" refersTo="page_0300"/>of the extra work. They will relieve some of the pressure, and will tend to speed up the work. I am sure the hon. Minister can place full confidence in those people. You only need to look around and see the amount of building work they have dealt with, monuments to their profession, works of tremendous importance which would be a credit to any country. So there is no question of any doubt in regard to their capability to tackle this work. If we do that, I would suggest that they be given an over-all picture of what the requirements are. Do not tie them up with too much red-tape as to what details they have got to adhere to. Let them produce the answer that will get the particular accommodation that the Department requires. If that answer is satisfactory, let them prepare the remaining documents and get on with the work, the same as they would when working for another client. In other words the Public Works Department becomes their client and the Minister passes the work out to them. I am sure that if that scheme is given consideration the hon. Minister will find there will not only be a substantial speeding-up in the work, but it will allow the next stage, the development of the country which has to proceed from these particular works and buildings to make quicker progress. It will also relieve the work of the Minister&#x2019;s Department, so that they can tackle other important and urgent work, which only the Department itself can do.</p>

<p>I should like to support the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) with reference to the erection of Government buildings, and I would urge on the hon. Minister of Public Works to give very serious consideration to the employment of civil engineers and architects outside the civil service, if only to get some modern designs. I want to suggest to the hon. Minister that when he next visits Durban, he should go and have a look at the latest Public Works building, viz. the new Magistrate&#x2019;s Court. If ever there was an example of an old-fashioned designed building and an uninteresting building, it is that building. It was only built last year. It is mainly occupied by the Department of Labour to-day. I do not think the hon. Minister would be very proud of that building. It is an old-fashioned design, uninteresting and drab, and I want to suggest that if buildings are erected for Government Departments we should get some younger men with modern ideas so that a building does not look like a government building and people would ask &#x201C;Who designed that building?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Who designed the other building?&#x201D; I think the design of public buildings should be a challenge to our young men with new ideas, but there seems to be a tendency in all Government Departments to have a sameness. In recent years the provincial authorities have handed out many of their buildings to different architects, and one has seen that when these architects have had some scope, they have introduced some novel ideas, for instance in regard to school buildings. And I know that in his own Department when outside architects have been called in, one has had the opportunity of seeing a few innovations and new designs. I do suggest that when it comes to buildings erected by the Public Works Department, they should be an advertisement for South Africa, and we should be proud of our South African buildings, and they should have a South African character. There are occasions when we have to keep to the original design, for instance in the case of this House of Parliament where the extensions have to conform with the design of the original building, and here a first-class job was done, but the building when completed had to conform with the design of the original building. But when breaking new ground, when it is a question of a new building on a new site, I do suggest that we should encourage new and modern designs which will be a good advertisement for South Africa and to the Department of Public Works, rather than the old type of building which is unimaginative.</p>

<p>I would like to carry just a little further the point raised by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman). I agree entirely with what the hon. Minister said that it would be best to raise these matters on the Vote of the Minister concerned. But last year I raised a question of a magistrate&#x2019;s court in Germiston and I wish to raise it this year. I was told last year that the matter should be raised on the Vote of the Minister of Justice. The Minister of Justice said: Well, there is no provision on the Vote, and in any case it is <span class="col_5937_5938" refersTo="page_0301"/>not a matter for me, it is a matter for the Minister of Public Works. I raise the point, because it appears that it is most important that there should be complete clarity and I hope also that in those circumstances, viz. that when it is urged that priority should be given to the building of a new courthouse or any other public building under any of the posts, it would obviously be convenient to deal with it under that particular Vote, and I wonder whether the hon. Minister can make a statement in that regard in order to clarify the position.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>The position is this: I have no cognizance in my Department of any such building until it is placed sufficiently high on the priority list of that particular Department to come under the purvey of the possible works for the next financial year, or that it should be planned for future financial years. But until it comes on the priority list. I have no cognizance of it and I know nothing about it. The Department of Public Works is in so many words the agent for the different Departments, and the placing of it on the priority list is an instruction in the first instance to us to start planning&#x2014;not necessarily building it. We have a certain amount of funds made available to us and we can go down the priority list of a Department to a certain extent and then we cannot go any further, but if it is on the priority list, we start planning, we start getting ground, etc. But until it comes on that priority list, we have no cognizance of it. Once it is on the priority list, members are perfectly justified in asking how far we have made progress with it and then I will be able to give them the reply, which I can give in respect of a large number of buildings on the list. I do not know whether the hon. member is worried about the Magistrate&#x2019;s court at Germiston, but I can tell him that the work is proceeding and the estimated cost is R62.000, of which R40,000 will be voted this year.</p>

<p>As far as the airport at East London is concerned, the Department of Transport has instructed us to build the new apron there and at the present time we are busy drawing up plans for the building, and we hope that as soon as they are finished we will be able to proceed with the work. That is why such a small amount is put on the Estimates because the actual work will not be commenced in this financial year.</p>

<p>Yes. the building is being planned, but the actual start of constructing the building will not take place this year.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Simonstown and Pinetown have raised a point which is very important, and it boils down to this, that with the big developments which are taking place in South Africa, the Department of Public Works might be overburdened and that it is trying to do too much, and that we should make greater use of private enterprise, private architects, engineers, quantity-surveyors and so on, to do the work. All that is perfectly true and we are trying to do that at the present time. I may say that we have a panel of architects from which we choose. It is free for anybody to come onto this panel, and we have between 400 and 500 private architects on that panel. To what extent do we make use of them? There are two contracts we enter into with them, either the one or the other. In the one case the private architects, the private quantity-surveyors and the private engineers are entrusted with the full work, or otherwise we work in conjunction. More and more, I might say, we are entrusting them with the full work. But we have got to keep a certain amount of control. Because let me give a hypothetical example. Department A comes along and proves to us that it requires a new administrative building. We say &#x201C;All right we will build an administrative building for you Then we appoint Mr. X as architect. Now Mr. X goes to that Department and ascertains what their requirements are, and if we do not control that Department A tells Mr. X as to what they require, you will be surprised about the buildings that will go up. They all have grandiose ideas if they are dealing directly with the architect. So the architect has got to come back to us and we have to exercise control. Certain standards of office requirements are laid down, for typists, for first-grade clerks, second-grade clerks, senior clerks, right up to the Minister are laid down, and that is controlled by my Department. That control sometimes takes quite a while, but without that control, and if we should work through the Public Service Commission we would have some beautiful buildings erected at an enormous cost, and possibly very inefficiently planned. But we are doing this, and I might point out to the hon. member that at present we are busy on work to the value of R70,000,000, and of that R50,000,000 is being done by private practising architects, engineers, quantity-surveyors, that is to say two-thirds of the work. Now one might ask whether it cannot be increased to above two-thirds. We can perhaps but not to a very great extent, because the one-third are minor jobs, alterations to buildings, repairs to buildings, adding a room on here, or an office on there, for which it is not necessary or advisable to get a private architect. But for our new works we are to a very large extent relying on private architects, engineers and quantity-surveyors. We are already working in the direction which the hon. member suggested, and for the reason suggested by the hon. member, but not for the one reason suggested by the hon. member for Pinetown, namely that the architects <i>of</i> the Department of Public Works are without imagination, and only the private architect uses his imagination. I am not certain who built the building he complains about, but I would not be surprised if it was a private <span class="col_5939_5940" refersTo="page_0302"/>architect. But in any case we have very good men in the Department, but there is too much work for them to cope with, and we have to put a lot of work out. The same applies to building. We are building more and more by private tender. In fact the only building work the Department actually undertakes to-day is reparation work, small alterations and that sort of thing. All our big contracts are being put out on public tender.</p>

<p>I was very pleased to hear the hon. Minister&#x2019;s assurance that a large proportion of the work is at present being handed out to the private firms, but I think the hon. Minister put his finger right on the spot that I was trying to get clarified, namely in regard to the red-tape which is sometimes applied to these private firms and which hampers them giving of their best. The hon. Minister said that you have got to comply with certain regulations and standards laid down governing facilities provided for different purposes and officials. I know exactly what that is. I have been in an Admiralty Department for 25 years and seen things tied up with the same sort of bundle of red-tape. Nelson had decided that a room had to be constructed in a certain way and to a certain size and Nelson still decides it to-day&#x2014;in the Admiralty. But here as the Minister said we have standards laid down, we have specifications laid down. I would not go back so far as to say who decided them. But you have them. People in the Department have not got the time to fiddle around and change those specifications, as they should be changed to meet new conditions. They are tied down by State requirements and State specifications and by what I call a bundle of red-tape. I do not say that the staff in the Minister&#x2019;s Department have not got imagination. The trouble is that they are so balked by the restrictions which bind them that they are not allowed to use their imagination. That does not apply to the other private enterprise side. I have been a party to many contracts that had to be given out, where we gave it to an outside engineering firm&#x2014;they can take the whole lot, lock, stock and barrel. If it is a first-class civil engineering firm; they in turn have all the necessary architectural staff, the quantity-surveyors and the civil engineering staff. You give them your rough overall requirements, the number of rooms you require and to what use they are going to be put, and the total over-all cost which may not be exceeded. You give an estimated cost which is your ceiling. Then they fit into that framework the job that you require. They are not hampered by what your Department is hampered with, Mr. Minister. The world is at their feet in regard to new developments in building technique, the world is at their feet with regard to new building materials which often cuts the cost and halves the time of the job. They have all these facilities at their finger tips because they have to show a profit or go under. In their own business concern they have to be able to cut down costs, or their competitors will put them out of business. So they are keen. I believe that if some relaxation were introduced on these lines, if they were given a little more positive freedom of action, so that they are not tied too hard and fast by existing specifications&#x2014;I know you have got to have these and it would be folly to abandon them, and the Minister has rightly said that you have to exercise control&#x2014; but within that framework there still remains scope for improvement. In many cases before your own Department or any other Department can embark on the erection of a building, the Minister&#x2019;s own Department has to report on the groundwork, say exactly what you are going to do and what work it is going to embrace. Until that report is considered and approved of, you cannot start the planning and the architectural work which is later going to be translated into bricks and mortar. Free your Department of some of the routine work. Once the report is finished; free your Department and let the outside business men take on the job which you have approved in principle and in respect of which you have laid down the main characteristics and costs. I believe that it will help to speed up the work and to streamline the work in the Department itself. It will relieve your own officials of a considerable amount of work which they could well do without, and it would help them to meet the tremendous development load particularly in regard to new buildings which is coming about as a result of all these changes in policy which we are dealing with. Take only the defence buildings today. It is impossible to hope that any Department could speedily deal with that expansion. Take the new construction with regard to your Bantu development. Necessary construction with regard to schooling, with regard to education. Take your post office expansion&#x2014;my own constituency to-day there is need for post office expansion as a result of the development of the naval base. The existing post office is completely out of date and has been so for years. I believe that the matter is now receiving highest priority, by the Postal Department, according to a letter to the local authority. But your Departmental people cannot get to it because they are bogged down with other urgent work. These are the things we want to clear out of the way. Let the Departments do the work they have got to do, but farm out everything that you can put out to private contract. We have got in this country the engineering firms with the necessary ability and experience. The proof in the pudding is in what they have produced, something in building that South Africa can be proud of. We have got that asset. Let us use it and get on with the job.</p>

<p>I am sorry to take part in the debate in the exceptional circumstances as far as the hon. the Minister is concerned, but there is a matter which I have to submit to him in the interests of my constituency. I refer to page 32, Loan Vote B, No. (16) &#x201C;Posts and Telegraphs: Boksburg: New post office&#x201D;. The original estimate of total cost is R112,000 and the approved costs for 1962-3 is R112,000, the revised estimate of total cost is R112,000 but the Estimates for 1963-4 shows an amount of R50. This is the third year in succession that these figures have appeared as they do here. In other words, it is pretty definite that the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs regards the post office at Boksburg as a matter which deserves high priority. I may say that I led a deputation froms Boksburg to him in 1960 and he then assured us that this matter enjoyed high priority as far as he was concerned and that was also evident from the estimates for the years to which I have referred, namely 1961-2, 1962-3 and again in 1963-4 when an amount of R112,000 was approved every year for the post office. But again it states here that only R50 will be spent in the year 1963-4. There is a long history to this matter. The question of the main post office at Boksburg was already raised in the &#x2019;thirties when the late Mr. Walter Madeley was still Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. The post office itself was built towards the end of the last century. In the meantime Boksburg has made progress. It has grown and developed, yes it has even become National. Boksburg has grown in a wonderful way but its post office does it no credit. Boksburg is known as &#x201C;beautiful Boksburg&#x201D;, but the one thing which is not to its credit is its post office. The post office reminds me a great deal of one of the lean cows in Pharaoh&#x2019; dream. It is not spacious enough. Additional buildings have to be hired and the building itself looks dilapidated. The staff is cramped because it has grown greatly over the years. They are so cramped that they even have to use the lavatories for storage purposes. I should like to learn from the hon. the Minister what the delay is. After I had made representations to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in April 1962, he inquired from the Department of Public Works and it appeared that even they regarded the matter as urgent because Public Works telexed back as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Public Works Department advises that drawings and specifications are due for completion towards end of next month.</block>

<p>That is to say at the end of May 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Checking of above-mentioned documents and preparation of bills of quantity expected to take a number of months, and although Public Works Department is not prepared to furnish definite information on this point, the intentions are that a commencement with the erection of buildings will be made during the first half of 1963, and completion could be expected a year later.</block>

<p>That raised great expectations in Boksburg, but according to these Estimates nothing is again to be done about it and I should like to learn from the Minister what the reason is for the delay.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think hon. members realize how these things work. The Department of Public Works receives a certain amount of money every year for the erection of public buildings and it is then decided, together with Treasury, how much can be given to each Department according to its needs. We may approve of certain works for, say, the Department of Posts; we are given a certain amount that we can spend in the course of the year. We then take the priority list of the Department of Posts and start at the top of the list, and we then work down the list as far as the funds voted by Parliament permit. We cannot go beyond that. It will not avail the Department of Posts to say that a certain work should have received a higher priority if the Department itself did not give it a sufficiently high priority to be included amongst the works for that particular year. It is very easy for them to say that it enjoys a high priority and then try to put the blame on Public Works, although Public Works are not at all guilty in this matter. We start at the_ top of the list, and gradually the works which are lower down on the list move up on the priority list. This year we are voting the sum of R50 so that we can make a start with this particular work, but it has never enjoyed a sufficiently high priority before to be able to make a start with it. In the meantime we are planning the building but we cannot proceed with the actual building until Parliament has voted the money, and we first have to dispose of those works which enjoy a higher priority. It is easy for them to say that it was given a <span class="col_5943_5944" refersTo="page_0304"/>high priority when they know that we cannot do the work. They passed the buck. They gave a higher priority to other cases. We have reached the stage now where it will come up for consideration and that is why this sum of R50 has been provided for in the Estimates.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I ask for the privilege of the half-hour. One of the most important Votes to be considered by the Committee is that of Social Welfare and Pensions, because it concerns so many persons&#x2019; livelihood, and that is why this evening I wish to address the hon. the Minister in regard to his policy with particular reference to Item &#x201C;K&#x201D;, war veterans, old age and blind persons&#x2019; pensions and disability grants for Whites, which amounts to R39,638,000. This, I believe, is perhaps the first occasion when this Vote is dealt with purely for the White race. It seems that as a result of legislation passed by this House the Department of Social Welfare has become fragmented to such an extent that it mainly deals with White persons. We have seen this Department developing over the years, and we believe that this fragmentation is not in the best interests of that Department. However, I intend to concentrate on the section of the Department which deals with the White people of the Republic.</p>

<p>When we take into account the recent Budget debate and the increases made in the pensions for the Whites, the increase that was received was R30 per annum, but the proviso was that that R30 per annum shall merely be payable to persons who do not possess other assets. Consequently it is another example of the person who has saved during his working life and who has acquired certain assets and who has bought a home for his family being discriminated against, because this R30 is only applicable to those persons who have no assets at all. This came as a great disappointment to a large number of persons drawing the old age pension. When we look at the position we find that the great tragedy of South Africa to-day is that a large number of aged persons are passing the twilight of their lives in abject poverty. There is no need for me to enlarge upon this position, because it is a fact. We know what the increase is in the cost of living. I appreciate that the Government has granted certain increases in the cost-of-living allowances from time to time, but that has lagged behind the cost of living, because the purchasing power of our money has been reduced. It is no good saying that the cost-of-living index is such-and-such and the pensioners&#x2019; allowances have been increased by such-and-such an amount. We must look at the position as to how it affects these people in their pockets, and the position is that these people have not sufficient means to live and have to rely to a great extent on charity. I know that the Minister&#x2019;s view is that in welfare services there must be co-operation between the State, the Church and private charity. I appreciate that position and we on this side would be the last to try to bring about a situation whereby private initiative is stifled, but at the same time it can be stifled by the lack of sufficient funds to continue to function. A number of welfare organizations have to devote almost their entire time to raising funds to keep going, rather than on concentrating on the aims of their association. Consequently, in view of the plight of the pensioner and in the light of the surveys that have been made, I think the State owes a great debt indeed to the contributions of private welfare organizations and Churches. There is an organization like S.A.F.T.A. which assists the aged, but we find that in their annual reports they say that an increasing number of aged persons are finding it impossible to live without assistance from some of these charitable organizations. Particularly in regard to accommodation, surveys have been made and I am sure that hon. members know of many instances where these aged persons are unable to find suitable accommodation and they have to live in back streets in abject poverty. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) says they even live in backyards. I think I might quote from a letter I received from a constituent a few weeks ago, in which this person suggested that the Government should do something to provide homes or flats for the aged, for couples and also for single persons.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>We know that a number of old buildings are being demolished and replaced by new buildings, and every time an old building, which is often occupied by old people, is demolished they have to try to find other accommodation, and we know how difficult it is to find it at a rental within their means. In my own constituency there are no fewer than four large homes for the aged, which might help the hon. member over there who asked about homes for the aged, and I can tell him that in the one home providing accommodation for old women there are nearly 200 on the waiting-list. These people find it very difficult to find suitable accommodation. Some of these people who are faced with this financial predicament in the twilight of their lives have no alternative but to lower their standard of living. That is why I think it is a pity that more attention is not paid to this position by the Department. I realize that funds are limited. The Minister, I am sure, in his own heart believes that these people should receive more pension. I am sure he does not believe that this is an adequate pension on which to maintain a decent standard of living. But what is restricting the payment of better pensions is the fact that we have in operation today a system of old-age pensions which is noncontributory, and consequently they have to be subject to a means test. We on this side of the House would not be so irresponsible as to suggest that the means test should be abolished immediately, but we do believe that with the introduction of a contributory pension scheme it will be possible to abolish the means test. The present means test discriminates against the person who has made some provision for his old age. Where a person&#x2019;s income exceeds R312 per annum, he is disqualified from obtaining a pension. Up to R180 per annum a person can obtain the full pension, but thereafter, for every R12 per annum or any portion thereof, their basic pension is reduced. Consequently they get a minimum pension of R12 a month, and in addition a bonus, which is increased whenever the pensions are increased. Those people who have managed to save some money and have invested it are discriminated against. Similarly, in regard to property, the basis of calculation is R2,400, and thereafter the pension is reduced according to the value of the property. Consequently there are people who fail to qualify for a pension, if they have such a property. Property revaluations have now taken place in all the major municipalities and I know of cases where a person applied for a pension eight years ago, before there was a revaluation, and obtained a reduced pension. The person living almost opposite him, after the revaluation, lived in a property which previously was valued more or less the same as that of his neighbour, but with the revaluation he now falls outside the means test and he does not qualify for any pension whatever. I mention this to show the necessity of revising the means test. I believe the Minister could do a great service to the country by appointing an inter-departmental committee to devise ways and means of modifying and relaxing the means test and at the same time it should investigate the possibility of introducing a contributory scheme. The relaxation of the means test is not something new. As far back as 1944 the Select Committee on Social Security recommended strongly that it be relaxed. The other points raised in connection with the means test are all of vital importance to these people, particularly those who find to-day that they just fail to qualify for a pension, because they are not receiving an income which is sufficient for them to survive, and at the same time they are disqualified from receiving any State assistance by way of pension. This is one of the urgent problems facing South Africa. We are told by the Minister of Economic Affairs that the country should spend more so as to boost our economy. I am sure that whatever additional amount these pensioners are paid, they will spend every penny of it, because they have to spend it in order to survive. But they cannot take the advice of the Minister of Economic Affairs to spend more, because they are merely eking out an existence on the present pensions. I believe that if such a committee were appointed, it would be consistent with the Minister&#x2019;s policy whereby&#x2014;and I must give credit where credit is due&#x2014;this Minister has carried out investigations and has appointed a Committee of Inquiry into the treatment of alcoholics, which produced a very illuminating report, so much so that the Government saw fit to incorporate many of those recommendations in legislation. Similarly, an inquiry was held in regard to family allowances and once again a most illuminating report was received and I am quite sure that the Minister, after considering that report very carefully, will see fit to introduce legislation incorporating many of those recommendations. Incidentally, that report also stated that one of the limiting factors in regard to larger families is the fact that some young couples are compelled to assist their parents. That is part of the answer that the Minister often gives to the House when we plead for increased pensions, namely that it is the responsibility of the children to maintain their parents.

<p>My plea to the Minister is to appoint such a committee to investigate every possible means of relaxing the means test. I realize it will require the work of an actuary, because it is not a matter which can merely be surmised. This side of the House does not have the available figures to ascertain what the cost will be of relaxing the means test. But this is an important matter and I believe the Minister should take the initiative by instituting such an inter-departmental inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="col_5947_5948" refersTo="page_0306"/>While mentioning the question of a contributory pension scheme, reading through the reports of the Department of Social Welfare&#x2014; and I might say that I hope that these reports will become available to the House more often, because the previous report we received was for 1952 to 1959, and thereafter we had this other report covering the period of two years from 1959 to 1962. However, the research that has taken place gives us vital figures to assess what is being done by the Department. In the report covering the period 1952 to 1959, on page 66, it says that the International Social Security Association held a meeting in London in May 1958 which was attended by Mr. I. J. de Villiers of this Department as an observer, and at the same time he studied the contributory social pension scheme of certain European countries, and he also submitted a report. So here we have an official of the Department studying the position overseas, which shows that the Department has taken cognizance of the fact that it is a possible solution to the problem of the increasing number of old persons, which will lead to greater expense as the years go on. So I believe that the Government has seriously considered the matter, but I believe that at this stage, with the increasing amounts&#x2014;and this only covers the White pensioners&#x2014;the Government should take some positive steps to ascertain what the position is.</p>

<p>In regard to other points, I know that the Minister has received a report covering the position of the aged which was undertaken by the Department of Education, Arts and Science. Certain information was obtained, but unfortunately the only way that I have been able to read anything concerning this report has been in the Press, because all efforts to obtain a copy of the report, either from the Department of Education or the Department of Social Welfare, have failed. I believe this must be a very interesting document and I hope it will be made available to Members of Parliament who are interested in this problem. One of the important factors divulged here is the present position of the old age pensioner, the increasing number of aged people, which is now something like 10 per cent of the population, and all this shows the urgency of the problem. The hon. the Minister in the Other Place quoted certain figures and said that if the means test were abolished it would mean an expenditure of R75,000,000. I have tried very hard to reconcile these figures, but I am afraid I was unable to do so because I did not have sufficient information. I hope the Minister will give us an indication as to how that figure was arrived at. However, the contributory scheme has been discussed here very often. It is a matter we have raised on numerous occasions. Numerous motions have been moved calling upon the Government to introduce a contributory pension scheme. The point was raised from time to time by various members and we on this side have put forward a suggested scheme on several occasions. I do not wish to repeat that scheme, but I might just mention certain factors which we put forward from time to time. The one is that we believe that a pension could be paid of R40 a month if a contributory scheme was introduced, on the lines whereby the contributions were fixed on a sliding scale. Briefly, this scheme showed that an amount of R25 a month would be the State&#x2019;s responsibility and would be supplemented by R15 per month by a contributory scheme. The contributions which were suggested in those days when Mr. Pocock was still the member for Sunnyside was that 30 cents a week would be paid by an employee under the age of 21 years and then it would go up on a sliding scale to R1 per week after he reached the age of 30. Various other things have taken place since then, like a change in the ratio in the population. Other schemes have also enjoyed the attention of the House. There is the Swedish system which is partly contributory and partly State-supported and which provides for a basic pension and in addition a supplementary pension, and which is claimed as a right by everybody provided his income from other sources does not exceed a certain amount. There is also the scheme in France and other countries, and we know that the scheme in New Zealand is one of which they are very proud, where they pay an amount of Is. 6d. in the &#x00A3; for social security, which yields an amount of &#x00A3;4 10s. a week for a single person, and &#x00A3;8 a week for a married couple. That was found to be a practical scheme and I am sure it is not beyond the ingenuity of our South African people and the Department to devise a means whereby such a scheme could be introduced; because with the introduction of such a scheme we can see the eventual abolition of the means test. When we consider the disadvantages of the means test, not only the discrimination against thrifty persons but also the over-payments which occur, it is quite pitiful to see how these old people are suddenly confronted with a letter from the Department stating that due to a change in the circumstances that have come about, they are now liable for a large sum which has been overpaid to them. The Department is very sympathetic but it means that a deduction must be made from their pension, if it is not completely withdrawn, and that aggravates the position of the old people. The question of these over-payments must be very costly to the Administration by the Department. There must be thousands of files in the Department and a tremendous amount of checking must take place to find out whether over-payments have taken place, and that must be a very costly administrative matter indeed, to carry out the provisions of the means test. All these costs could be saved by introducing a contributory pension scheme. Some of the hon. members opposite who do not seem particularly concerned about this and want to make interjections&#x2014;I hope they read the leading article in the <i>Vaderland</i> on 15 September 1962. This is a translation of the leading article, which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the moral aspect of the matter is concerned, the means test certainly cannot <span class="col_5949_5950" refersTo="page_0307"/>be regarded as an encouragement to thrift. It places those people who throughout their lives have not saved a penny in the position where they can enjoy the full benefit of their old age pension, while the remainder find that the provision they tried to make for their old age works to their disadvantage.</block>

<p>This is a very important factor and one which I have tried to stress here this evening in my urging of the Minister to carry out an inter-departmental investigation of the whole question of the means test and the possibility of introducing a contributory pension scheme.</p>

<p>There are other aspects which I believe can also assist to make the lives of these people a little happier. The one is the question of loneliness, which is perhaps the greatest bugbear in old age. I believe that this could be overcome to a large extent by establishing clubs for the aged. In the last report of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions the matter was referred to under &#x201C;General&#x201D; on page 52 and certain remarks were made in regard to the subsidization of clubs for the aged, and it ends on the note that the Department recognizes the need for these clubs, but considers it a service which should come from the community. Well, I know that certain local authorities and other organizations have tried to institute such clubs for their aged, but they find that economic factors are the main drawbacks to the establishment of such clubs. I hope the Minister will give further consideration to this aspect and see whether it is not possible to grant some form of financial assistance to those organizations which wish to establish such a club. That would help a great deal to overcome the problem of loneliness.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to raise with the Minister, and that is the private pension fund. Hon. members opposite have said from time to time that it is their policy to encourage private pension funds. I agree, and indeed it is consistent with our point of view that a person making some contribution to a fund then becomes entitled to a pension as of right and not merely as a privilege. However, there are certain drawbacks in regard to these private pension funds. We know that some unemployed persons find it almost impossible to obtain employment with large concerns which have pension funds but which limit the age to 45 years. These persons are left out of these pension schemes, even if they manage to secure employment with such a firm. However, the Minister replied to a question that I put to the Minister of Finance on Friday, 4 May 1962, where I asked him the number of pension funds registered with the Registrar. One question I asked was whether any special steps have been taken or are contemplated by the Department to encourage the establishment of private pension funds. The answer was no; no special steps were being taken or contemplated, apart from certain tax concessions already enjoyed in respect of contributions to a pension fund. So I would like to know what the Government is actually doing to encourage private pension funds. The amount voted here also affects the position of a contributory pension scheme, because the more persons that are covered by a form of insurance or by contributing to a fund the more people will be able to spend the twilight of their years in some security. After all, security in old age is perhaps the corner-stone in any system of social security. In South Africa we have a modified form of social security. We do not have a welfare State, and we on this side do not want a welfare State, because there are great disadvantages in having a welfare State, but at the same time we must see that adequate provision is made for those persons in need of State assistance.</p>

<p>Another point on which I should like to have information from the Minister is in regard to the investigations being carried out. I realize that the services of an actuary will be required and I am interested to see that in the Estimates before us, on page 90, under Miscellaneous Expenses, there is an item &#x201C;Fees for Actuarial Services, R55,000&#x201D;. For the previous year the amount was R17,000. There has, therefore, been a considerable increase. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Having listened to the remarks of the previous speaker, who has tried to paint a very sombre picture to us of the conditions under which the aged have to live, I think we are all sorry that they have to live under those conditions, but at the same time we say that we are grateful that we now have a Government which has ameliorated their lot to such an extent, because if the Government had not done that I wonder what the position of those people would have been to-day. We know that over the past 10 years, from 1953 to 1963, no fewer than ten concessions have been granted. In 1954, for example, the basic pension was supplemented by bonuses amounting to R84, and since then there have been further bonus additions which in 1962 amounted to R66, and apart from that there has also been a constant relaxation of the means test. If the previous speaker goes into the position carefully, he will have to admit that big concessions have been made in respect of the means test. He himself referred to the fact that in 1947 the limit was R184 per annum. But at the moment it stands at R312. That means that since 1947 there has been an increase of 80 per cent, while the cost-of-living index has risen by 68.2 per cent. In the case of oudstryders there has been an increase of 257.7 per cent. Sir, there are many questions that we should like to ask in connection with the means test. We constantly ask ourselves whether it is not possible to apply the means test in such a way that a much greater number of people can become eligible for the old-age pension. But we must concede that that is not a very easy task. If we work it out actuarially and make the test easier, a <span class="col_5951_5952" refersTo="page_0308"/>larger number of people will become eligible, and we must take into account the financial carrying capacity of the country. I think the aged themselves realize that in the circumstances as much as possible is being done to ameliorate their lot. But while we are on the subject of the means test, I would like to put a few questions to the Minister. I should like to know whether in the light of a recent survey made by the Educational and Social Research Bureau into the living conditions of the aged, his Department is going to make further inquiries into the possibility of bringing about further improvements to the existing means test. The previous speaker also referred to that report, and I just want to know whether further investigations are going to be made by the Department. Then I should also like to ask the Minister whether benefits are not likely to flow from a simplification of the whole system. The previous speaker has also pointed out that an involved formula has been built up over the years. Would it not be possible to simplify the whole formula and in that way save a great deal of manpower while at the same time simplifying the whole process? Then I should like to ask the Minister whether in spite of everything that has been said investigations cannot again be instituted into the methods used in respect of the means test, as well as the possibility of a contributory pension scheme. The previous speaker had referred to the fact that the United Party Government repeatedly went into this matter in the past. One of their prominent Ministers of Social Welfare, the late Mr. Hofmeyr, when it was proposed at the time that a contributory pension scheme should be introduced, rejected it as impracticable. I want to know whether somebody cannot be sent overseas or whether the Minister himself cannot go overseas to find out whether something cannot be done to improve this position. The previous speaker only emphasized the position of the aged. It is right, of course, that we should take the aged into consideration. We rejoice over the improved housing which has been provided for the aged. Do you know, Sir, that in 1948 there were 25 old-age homes for all the different races in this country. Since this Government has come into power that number has been more than quadrupled. I want to ask the Minister pertinently whether there has ever been a single case where the building of an old-age home or the equipment of an old-age home has been turned down as the result of a shortage of funds. I personally have not heard of a single case. We note that this matter is receiving the attention of the Minister and his Department.</p>

<p>We are particularly glad that this work is not being done by the State alone. We hope that the Minister and his Department will see to it that the churches and welfare organizations come into their own more and more in this sphere. The State should do this work together with these welfare organizations and the churches.</p>

<p>And now we come to the question of family care and child care. The previous speaker concentrated largely on the aged. We know that the numbers of these people are increasing because the average person to-day lives to a riper age because of improved medical facilities. We are glad that in this connection the Department has recently conducted important investigations.</p>

<p>Here I also want to refer to the Piek Committee. This was also referred to by the previous speaker. This Committee brought out an important report with regard to family allowances. Then there is the report of the Brummer Committee which has also helped to create a sounder family structure. The necessity for a sound family structure is also emphasized in the latest report of the Department itself. There it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The right sense of values must be inculcated, the necessity of building up large and well-cared-for families must be emphasized, the value of a large family must be stressed, home life must be given a new value, the conserving forces of family life must be given greater prominence and commended more strongly, an atmosphere that is conducive to the building up of large families must be created in the national economy, public opinion must be favourably conditioned to large and well-cared-for families, and efforts must be made to make national policy family-centred wherever applicable, i.e. all policy should be family policy.</block>

<p>That is the matter that we should emphasize in particular. That is also the task on which the Department has concentrated particularly in recent times. I want to express our gratitude and our appreciation of the increased maintenance allowance for children who are cared for in children&#x2019;s homes. Although this concession is not as great as we should have liked it to be, it is welcomed by every one of these children&#x2019;s homes and by every one of the welfare organizations who are concerned with this matter and by every one of the churches interested in this matter. But the churches and the welfare organizations must also make their contribution. The State has already made a great contribution. The year before last a commission was appointed by the churches, and it was then found that the cost per child per annum was in the neighbourhood of R340. Of this amount the State provided 66 per cent. We are grateful for this contribution and we hope the welfare organizations and the churches will also make their contribution.</p>

<p>It was recommended by the Piek Committee that a body should be instituted to formulate family policy. I should like to know whether, when the National Welfare Council is re-constituted, steps cannot be taken to see that one of its branches concentrates its attention on this matter. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>This is a Vote under which we all are trying to do something for our fellow men. I differ from the hon. member <span class="col_5953_5954" refersTo="page_0309"/>for Kimberley (South) in only one respect. I agree with everything he said about family life, but I am a more practical man than he is, I think. He thinks that more than enough has already been done for the old-age pensioner and others. That is perhaps not fair. He thinks the Government has done as much as it could. This side of the House, however, does not think so and this is the only point on which I differ from the hon. member.</p>

<p>I want to talk to-night on a subject on which I have talked before, namely, the War Pensions Act, i.e. the Act which applies to all ex-servicemen and also the new trainees. I want to talk about the Minister&#x2019;s policy under this Act as it affects ex-servicemen of the previous wars and the man who is being trained to-day and who will be the ex-serviceman of the next war. To-day we are a country in arms. The Minister knows from his own family&#x2019;s history that when a country is in arms and a war comes casualties result. In 1948 I had to lead a deputation to the late Klasie Havenga, who had then just taken over the Ministry of Finance. Pensions were then under that Department. Mr. Havenga. who is a man for whom every ex-serviceman of this country had, still has, and will for ever have the greatest regard, listened to my case. Certain promises had been made, but then there came a change of Government and these promises had to be redeemed. Klasie said to me, &#x201C;Ross, do not worry. All the promises made by the country to the ex-servicemen will be redeemed.&#x201D; He then told me that there was one thing on his conscience, namely, the war veteran, his old comrade, and the war veteran&#x2019;s pension. In those days this pension was the same as the old-age pension, but Mr. Havenga intended to give him a further &#x00A3;4 per month. He wanted to know what we thought about it. When Governments have wars men suffer. This Minister&#x2019;s family, I believe, suffered greatly during the Boer War as I call it.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir, I am not doing that. I am discussing the Minister&#x2019;s policy. I am only referring to the fact that certain legislation already passed is now going to affect those men serving in new forces. I do not think, therefore, that I am transgressing in any way. This does not affect only the men who served in previous wars, but also those boys now being trained in their country&#x2019;s service. These will number tens of thousands in the years to come. Now it so happens that the particular Act about which I am talking was recently made to apply also to them.</p>

<p>Ex-servicemen have been fighting this particular injustice for decades. Recently I understand the Minister&#x2019;s Department informed the S.A. Legion of the B.C.E.S.L. that the Department could not do anything about the removal of the so-called time limits. One can only assume that that was done for financial reasons. I am not asking the Minister to do something in this respect this year, but I want him to do something in future. I just want to give the House the history of those pernicious time limits. I have done it before and I make no apology for doing so again. In 1942 the following definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D; was laid down&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Child&#x201D; means a child of a volunteer born before, during or within 280 days after the termination of the volunteer&#x2019;s service.</block>

<p>In 1943 the definition was changed to&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x201C;Child&#x201D; means a child of a volunteer born before, during or within five years after the termination of the volunteer&#x2019;s service.</p>

<p>In 1944 it was changed to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Child&#x201D; means a child of a volunteer born at any time within the period preceding his enlistment or the period of his service or within a period of (a) five years after termination of his services; or (b) eight years after such termination if degree of pensionable disability is 80 per cent or more.</block>

<p>In 1946 the definition was further amended to mean&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A child born before or not later than 10 years after the termination of the volunteer&#x2019;s military service.</block>

<p>Exactly the same history applies with respect to the definition of a &#x201C;widow&#x201D;. Now when gentlemen on the other side with such alacrity vote something like R170,000,000 for defence they do not realize that once the weapons bought by that money are used there will be casualties. It is the duty of the country, including hon. members Opposite, to see that such casualties are looked after.</p>

<p>I have already said that the same history which the definition of &#x201C;child&#x201D; underwent, applied to the definition of &#x201C;widow&#x201D;. To-day <span class="col_5955_5956" refersTo="page_0310"/>&#x201C;widow&#x201D; is defined as the widow of a man, only if he married her within ten years of his discharge. Just let me give the House the actual position in which we now find ourselves. Firstly, if any war pensioner marries more than ten years after his discharge, or if any of his children are born more than ten years after his discharge, he is not entitled to the allowances laid down for them under the Act. I want to remind you, Mr. Chairman, that these provisions also apply to those fellows who are now being trained for the defence of our country.</p>

<p>There is another point. Should a war disability pensioner who married after the time limit of ten years, die from the effects of his disability, his wife and children will receive no benefits whatever under this Act. Perhaps you, Mr. Chairman, can find logic in that; I cannot. The payment of family allowances to disability pensioners is a principle which has been accepted right throughout the civilized world. Now I should like to ask the Minister where the logic is in making pensions payable to some wives but not to others? Where is the logic in that, where the basis of such pension is war disability, caused through service to your country? [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#sadie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SADIE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to bring one aspect of child care to the notice of the hon. the Minister. Before doing so, however, I feel that I must express my appreciation not only to the Department but also to churches and other bodies which maintain and control children&#x2019;s homes. In this connection they are doing wonderful work. If there is one thing which proves that a nation is highly civilized, then it is the fact that it provides homes for the care of its children. We have a large number of children&#x2019;s homes in our country. In this connection there is one matter that I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister, and that is whether there cannot be further specialization in this connection. The children who land in these homes are children who come from unhappy home conditions. That is why we quite frequently find problem children in these institutions. One finds these children in every children&#x2019;s home. What they need is psychological treatment.</p>

<p>We find that every home has its hostel parents and staff. But at the same time the position is that the members of the staff are not trained psychologists. In the nature of things one cannot expect all children&#x2019;s homes to have staff who are trained psychologists. Apart from the fact that it would mean a tremendous waste of human material, it would also be a very expensive process, because that type of specialist is entitled to much higher remuneration than the staff attached to these homes to-day. I have already said that we find problem children in every children&#x2019;s home. What I should like to know is whether it is not possible to bring all these children together and to put them in a special institution where trained psychologists can then be appointed. They can then concentrate on guiding this type of child along the right lines.</p>

<p>I contend that it would be in the interests not only of this type of child that he should receive such treatment, but that it would also be in the interests of the other children in these institutions who come into contact with these problem children. The fact of the matter is simply that where a number of children are thrown together in an institution it is the example set by the naughty child that is followed rather than the example of the child of exemplary behaviour. If children of this type are brought together and placed in a special institution where they can receive special treatment, a large percentage of them can become useful citizens of this country.</p>

<p>I hope that the hon. the Minister will give his attention to this aspect of child care and that this suggestion of mine will eventually bear fruit.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with everything the hon. member for Winburg has said. I only wish I could follow him up in this discussion and to support him in his arguments but I hope he will forgive me if I do not do that at this stage.</p>

<p>When the time for my previous speech ran out, I was saying that the payment of family allowances to disabled military pensioners was a principle which was accepted by the entire civilized world. I also asked where the logic was in making pensions payable to some wives but not to others; why allowances were paid in respect of some children in a family but not in respect of the other children in that family.</p>

<p>The point I now wish to make in regard to the injustice of this pernicious clause is its effect on a heavily disabled volunteer. There are many of these volunteers, and it looks as if we are going to have more in future, who have lost their wives while still requiring constant care and attention. If he remarries after ten years, he will not receive any allowance in respect of his wife. I am not plucking cases out of the blue sky. There are many of them in actual fact. There always are after wars. If this volunteer has children more than ten years afterwards, he will receive no allowance for them either. There are many boys who joined the Army at 18 years of age or even earlier who became casualties. But now there is this one clause. I want to be fair to the Minister and say that the rest of the Act is first class. I cannot understand why this Minister in particular allows this one clause to remain in the legislation. Many men joined while very young. Now, if they became totally disabled, they could not receive any allowance for any children born after ten years. Where is the logic or fairness in this?</p>

<p>Our young men are being conscripted to-day in their tens of thousands. We do not want to see more casualties as a result of a war but should a war come, this blot remains on our pensions legislation. I ask this hon. Minister to give this matter some real consideration for a change. Finance cannot be the trouble. We <span class="col_5957_5958" refersTo="page_0311"/>are providing somewhere near R 170,000,000 for defence. In comparison with this, only about R7,000,000 is provided for war pensions per annum. Can anyone tell me that on that basis the removal of this shocking and pernicious clause &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>May I then call it an unfortunate clause. There will be many young men who will be affected by this unfortunate clause. I ask this hon. Minister please to remove this injustice.</p>

<p>This is the only country that still has this clause. It has been a heritage for many years. In Rhodesia such a clause was removed in 1958; Australia never had it in respect of Second World War ex-servicemen and removed it for the First World War ex-servicemen in 1950; Canada did not have it for Second World War ex-servicemen and removed it in respect of its First World War ex-servicemen in 1958; New Zealand never had these time limits although there was a provision there making it possible to check on possible death-bed marriages. That was very easily dealt with. In the United Kingdom the time limit was abolished in 1946. In South Africa there is no justification whatever for retaining it any longer.</p>

<p>I repeat: We are a nation at arms. This clause constitutes a grievance which ex-servicemen will never forget. Just as Klasie Havenga did not forget for 40-odd years, so will the ex-servicemen not forget. We are now on a war footing and this question must be given attention. We hope another war will not come, but obviously there is such a possibility; otherwise we would not be spending all this money on defence.</p>

<p>I hope the Minister of Defence will support my plea and that the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions will give us his reasons for his decision if he cannot meet this plea. It cannot be justified on the ground of a lack of funds.</p>

After all, he is a person who takes an intense interest in the matters with which we are dealing here.

<p>The hon. member knows that I will deal with him fairly. He also talked about the &#x201C;small increases notwithstanding the greater increases in the cost of living&#x201D;. But surely the hon. member has repeatedly heard the figures which were again mentioned by the hon. member for Kimberley (South) this evening. According to those figures the increased concessions granted by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions far exceed the rise in the cost of living. The figures which were given here this evening have been given to the House before. I personally have done so repeatedly. But then the hon. member comes along and says: &#x201C;These people cannot survive without some form of charity.&#x201D; That was a cutting remark.</p>

<p>But I do not propose to argue with the hon. member about these matters in a spirit of malice. I should like to give him the total concessions. The total provision in the Social Welfare and Pensions Vote, excluding social pensions and allowances to Coloureds and Indians, for the financial year 1958-9 was R60,833,000 in comparison with R80,041,000 for the financial year 1963-4, that is to say, an increase of R 19,000,000.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I can reply to that in a spirit of goodwill and understanding by saying that I do realize it. As a matter of fact, I have said so year after year. But I also said that the rendering of assistance to the underprivileged was not solely the duty of the State. That was acknowledged by the hon. member for Umbilo.</p>

<p><span class="col_5959_5960" refersTo="page_0312"/>He said that he was supporting the idea which I have been propagating all these years and that is that social welfare services should be the joint responsibility of the State, the welfare organizations and private initiative. I gave reasons time and again why I thought that that should be so. And the hon. member for Umbilo conceded that in the latter part of his speech.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Umbilo also referred to what I said in the Other Place, viz., that hon. members, in spite of any doubts they may have, must in any case come to the conclusion that as far as I and my Department are concerned we approach the activities of this Department in a spirit of goodwill and willingness. They know that this is a difficult Department. It consists of a multiplicity of sections, as in the case of no other Department. It is a Department with Estimates larger than those of any other Department, except Defence. It is a Department which has to make administrative arrangements in connection with all matters concerning the over-payment of small sums of money to hundreds of people every month.</p>

<p>I do not want to summarize again what has been done through the years in regard to bringing about improvements. The hon. member for Kimberley (South) has already done so. I have a list here of the concessions granted since 1953. I know that every time we make concessions the pensioners appreciate it, and I also know that in his heart the hon. member for Umbilo also appreciates it.. There is one problem with which this Department has to cope, and that is the multiplicity of activities in its administration. We have to deal with all the problem cases throughout the country, from the cradle to the grave. We have to deal with those cases as individual cases. We cannot deal with them unsympathetically, because we are dealing with human beings. From the very nature of the activities of the Department, we continually have to make new investigations, investigations into each separate case, apart from the investigations with which we are continually occupied in regard to improving the position of the less privileged, the aged, and the children who are supported by the State.</p>

<p>One of the things which has kept us very busy through the years is the special investigations we have had to institute from time to time in regard to the application of the means test in the case of pensioners. That is not a matter which can be disposed of in a year. I want to take this Committee into my confidence. I want to tell hon. members that after several years of thorough study, my Department has come to the conclusion that this whole system should be simplified as far as possible. Hon. members will allow me to make a short statement in regard to the simplified system we envisage. Apart from what I am now going to say, I want to give hon. members the assurance that as soon as the details of this system have been worked out further, I will and a copy of this system&#x2019; to every member of this House and of the Senate. Then if, when we assemble again next year, hon. members tell me that improvements made be made here or there, I will appreciate it very much. I think this Vote is <i>par excellence</i> one where we should ignore everything else and just concentrate on the interests of those people whose care is entrusted to us.</p>

<p>Due to the complicated formula of calculating social pensions which has developed over the years, and because of the time and labour involved in lengthy investigations which in terms of the existing formula have to be made, and because of the accompanying growing staff problems, a simplified system has been evolved which will be introduced within the next few months. I do not want to go into details and weary the House with details of a technical nature, but I just want to mention a few of the most important changes. Some of these changes may under given circumstances directly or indirectly benefit some pensioners, probably not too much, and this benefit is purely coincidental. It was not deliberately aimed at. I just want to mention a few of these changes. The determination of the value of assets will now be ignored, and the basic pension will be determined only by the unencumbered value of all assets. That means that all investigations as to the use to which assets are put will be eliminated. As hon. members will understand, assets vary in value, and if one continually has to institute investigations in connection with those assets, one gets a variation in the amount of the pension. We are now eliminating that and the value of the assets will be determined according to one factor only, viz., the unencumbered value. We all know that the unencumbered value of any asset is its true value. That is the first change.</p>

<p>Secondly, instead of trying to ascertain the self-support of a person and his net income, e.g. from agriculture, such support and net income will in future in all cases be calculated at R144 per annum. When I have completed my statement. I will explain a few of these figures. Thirdly, a more uniform basis in respect of assets which are alienated will in future be applied, viz; a diminution in value of R500 per annum per person will be allowed for every year which elapses from the beginning of the year in which the asset was alienated. Say, for example, a person has alienated an asset of R2,000, then that R2,000 will decrease annually by R500 until it completely disappears after four years. This is a very sound system which is being applied here.</p>

<p>Fourthly, the income derived from casual work and unemployment insurance benefits will in future be calculated on an annual basis instead of calculating this income over every separate period within a period of 12 months. Perhaps I should briefly explain this. If a person now draws unemployment insurance benefits for three weeks or six weeks or two months, that amount is calculated at so much per month and he perhaps loses his pension, or his pension is reduced accordingly. In future we will calculate that income over a period of <span class="col_5961_5962" refersTo="page_0313"/>12 months. In other words, if over a period of three months he earned R36, it will be calculated at the rate of R3 per month, and on the basis of R3 per month it cannot affect his pension. That will be to the advantage of the pensioner who can still earn something extra. <i>Usufruct</i> will also in future be calculated according to a simplified formula. A very important change in this new scheme is, <i>inter alia,</i> this, Sir: The whole matter in regard to the repayment of amounts overpaid has been reviewed. Hon. members will remember that every year when my Budget is discussed I ask them to get into touch with me in regard to any case which has come to their notice, and I promise to investigate any specific case. I do not think I am wrong in saying that many of those cases were instances of over-payments. This matter has been thoroughly reviewed. In view of the increasing difficulty in collecting over-payments, which usually results in hardship to the pensioners, and also the heavy expenditure incurred in regard to collecting these over-payments, it has been decided in future to demand repayment only under three circumstances, namely when the Department is of the opinion (a) that there has been deliberate fraud, i.e. when inaccurate statements have been made; (b) when the holders of powers of attorney were responsible and not the applicant himself; and (c) when clerical errors have been made. Any retrospective calculation&#x2014;and in my opinion this is of great importance&#x2014; will be made on the basis applicable when the case is adjusted, and it will not be retrospective for longer than three years. One finds cases where it has to be made retrospective for years, and with the best will in the world these people cannot repay the money, and therefore we are not making it retrospective for more than three years.</p>

<p>The main effect of this system which I have now briefly explained to hon. members will be as follows: It will lead to the elimination of certain investigations, which will be welcomed by all pensioners. Hon. members know h&#x00BA;w it irritates pensioners if they are continually subjected to investigations, and the game is just not worth the candle. Secondly. we will have a simplified and improved system which may possibly eliminate clerical mistakes and lead to greater efficiency and speed. Existing benefits remain unchanged, and any additional future benefits will be negligible. Tests were made in regard to various cases, and that is what we found. I may just tell hon. members that with this complicated system, we had, it was physically impossible to calculate everything even when using the Hollerith system. We had the case of a junior official in the office who wrote the following letter to a pensioner: &#x201C;Your old age pension has been cancelled because you are dead&#x201D;. That is the sort of thing we sometimes find. This simplified and improved system will eliminate clerical mistakes and will speed things up. The existing benefits will remain unchanged and any future additional expenditure will be negligible. After all the discussions we have had we are convinced that it will result in a saving of time and manpower. It will also result in the elimination of over-payments and the time and labour involved. It will greatly facilitate the eventual mechanization of the section concerned, and simplify it. I think this is a great step forward, the introduction of this simplified system, and we hope that it will bear good fruit.</p>

<p>I said I would tell hon. members where we got certain figures from. In connection with the provision as to the use of assets, tests were made, and the value of the basic pension is practically not affected at all. Say, e.g., a person owns a house. In future we will take into account only the unencumbered value of that house. Previously we always had to make investigations from time to time to determine whether the person occupied that house, whether he let it, what he received as rental, or whether he allowed it to stand unoccupied or gave it to someone else on condition that he could occupy a room himself. The tests which were made proved that this new scheme will amount to the same thing, but with fewer problems and less frustration for the pensioner.</p>

<p>Then instead of trying to ascertain the extent of the self-support of the person and his net income from agriculture, such net income and self-support will in future in all cases be taken at R144 per annum. The position is generally such that the self-support of a person who farms, according to the statistics of my Department, has hitherto been put at R72 per annum per person, and then the net income from agriculture has been added. Experience has taught us that in the majority of such cases of people who farm and who draw pensions, there is only one result, viz. that the estimated income from agriculture is practically nil. That is taking it over a period of a few years; one year it is more and the next year it is less. Instead of continuing these investigations, it will in future be a fixed amount of R144 per annum, irrespective of whether the person is married or not. That is an amount equivalent to the self-support which was assessed formerly in the case of married people. We assessed the married people and came to the same figure.</p>

<p>I briefly want to reply to the request made to me by the hon. member for Umbilo in regard to the committee of inquiry which he requests should be appointed into the operation of the means test and all matters concerning the Department of Social Welfare. I can tell the hon. member for Umbilo that I doubt whether any other Department has been the subject of investigations from time to time over the years as often as this Department has been. In many instances it got no further than an investigation. I said just now that I would deal with this positive contribution towards this debate when he referred with gratification to the investigations instituted by the Br&#x00FC;mmer Committee into alcoholism and by the Piek Committee into family allowances. I think those two committees did outstanding work. As far as the Br&#x00FC;mmer Committee&#x2019;s report was concerned, we immediately, as hon. members know, busied ourselves in seeing which of the recommendations we could implement. I may not speak <span class="col_5963_5964" refersTo="page_0314"/>about this, because there is legislation in that regard on the Order Paper. But it was a great step forward to have had such a Committee, and that they were able to make so thorough an investigation into that particular matter. We now have the advantage, on the strength of that comprehensive report, of being able to bring about changes which will considerably improve the position. These improvements will also give effect to the plea made by the hon. member for Kimberley (South), to the effect that in saving the family you save the child, and in saving the child you ensure the future of the nation. We must concentrate our attention on the subject of the structure of families, and remedy the defects there to the best of our ability. Every year I meet the regional heads of my Department, together with the chief officials of my Department. We hold a conference for a week in Pretoria and they each give me a report regarding the matters for which they are responsible. On the last occasion we devoted our attention particularly to the question of family life, and the discussion centred primarily around the prevention of disruption in family life and the restoring of family life after disruption had already taken place.</p>

<p>I want to mention three other matters which are of particular importance. The hon. member for Umbilo mentioned these matters as well, and with the exception of one they are dealt with in the report of the Piek Committee. The one is in connection with the care of the aged. I will see what can be done in regard to this report being made available by the Department of Education, Arts and Science. I received it only a little while ago. I have instructed my officials to study this report thoroughly.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, the Department of Education, Arts and Science has a national bureau for educational and welfare research. It is their report, and it contains useful information.</p>

<p>Hon. members will remember that I have said repeatedly that welfare work is not static. Every year under this Vote I have stressed that it varies and changes like the weather. It is like Shelley&#x2019;s &#x201C; ever-changing cloud&#x201D;. It is something which is constantly changing because it has to be adapted to life&#x2019;s demands. The regulation of our services must also be determined with an eye to the highest possible standards of social care. The hon. member for Umbilo has now asked for an inter-departmental committee to institute an investigation as to the highest possible standards of social care that can be achieved. I can only say that from time to time we have sent missions overseas which have investigated certain aspects of our pension and old-age problems, as well as our child welfare and family problems. From time to time study tours are undertaken and reports are submitted to us. Then our problems are reconsidered. We endeavour to keep abreast of developments elsewhere in the world. I have now singled out an official from the research section of my Department to make a thorough study of all the systems obtaining in countries outside South Africa in regard to pensions, the care of the aged, in which pensions play a very important role, as well as in connection with the building up of family life and child care. We want to study all these systems thoroughly. I have thought the matter over again and have come to the conclusion that it would be a good thing if I myself went to make investigations in certain countries in Europe where the people have had to cope with the problem of building up the nation again after a period of a devastating war. The reason why I am thinking of going myself is not just to make a study on paper of the systems presently in operation there, but to see how those systems work and to see the circumstances in which those people live to whom the system is being applied. We are very keen to see how they take care of their aged. We have already received various schemes from several countries. Many of those schemes I rejected at once as being impracticable. To give one example: There is Section A which consists of sub-economic cottages; Section A has to be very close to Section B where people live who are no longer able to take such good care of themselves. The people well able to look after themselves live in Section A. Those who need care and nursing are moved over to Section C. When they get ill they go to Section D, the last section. My impression is that this is wrong. It is not right that those old people should think: &#x201C;To-day I am in A, tomorrow in B, the next day in C,&#x201D; and so on. I think we must do everything in our power to keep those people within the community so that the community will show an interest in them and so that they, too, can remain interested in the community.</p>

<p>The one aspect which I particularly want to investigate is the question of the care of the physically feeble aged. We have not advanced much as far as the question of their care is concerned. In a short tour of about six weeks we hope to obtain first-hand knowledge, and then to come back and devise a scheme to see how improvements can be brought about. The other questions posed by hon. members I will reply to when the debate is resumed. The hon. member for Winburg put certain questions in connection with children&#x2019;s institutions. According to him, there are certain children who are virtually problem children. My experience is that a large percentage of them are difficult. I discovered, at such an institution which I opened, that of the I00 children there, almost all of them were children who had been committed and not orphans. Children who have been committed can be so influenced by the environment from which they come that they are not really problem children in themselves, but as the result of the circumstances in which they have been living. That is a matter which we have to take into account. Hon. members are free to express <span class="col_5965_5966" refersTo="page_0315"/>just as much criticism as they like, but it should be done in such a way that we always feel that the State, society, church institutions and the people together bear the burdens of these under-privileged people.</p>
