<p>asked the Minister of Housing:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any four-roomed flats are to be erected as part of the sub-economic scheme at Chatsworth Indian Township; if so, how many;</li>

<li>(4) whether the directive is to be applied to White and Coloured sub-economic housing; if so, why; if not, why not.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_housing" to="#hopewell">

<from>The MINISTER OF HOUSING:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. 190 four-roomed flats in Chatsworth Neighbourhood Unit 3, section B.</li>

<li>(2) Yes, the National Housing Commission included in its approval of the local authority&#x2019;s application for a loan for the scheme, a suggestion by the local authority itself to the effect that, and I quote, &#x201C;If, however, the rental differences between two-and four-roomed dwellings are such that rental becomes a material factor, a policy of shared four-roomed dwellings should rather be adopted. Such dwellings would be shared initially until such time as one or other family group becomes economic whereupon such family group could be transferred to economic four-roomed accommodation.&#x201D; Quotation ends.</li>

<li>(3) No, the standard of the dwellings themselves is in excess of the minimum standards determined for dwelling accommodation which have been laid down in consultation with all competent authorities, including public health authorities. As regards the directive in connection with the occupancy of one dwelling by two families, as a temporary measure, it is considered that in the provision of families already suffering from want in respect of the primary requirements of life, it is of the greatest importance that their accommodation should be provided at a rental which will make only the smallest possible inroad on their earnings to prevent privation and consequential ill-health and further loss of income.</li>

<li>(4) The question of applying the directive to Whites has not yet arisen but it has been applied to Coloureds for the same reasons as those given for Indians.</li>

<heading>GENERAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: House to resume in Committee on General Law Amendment Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>[Progress reported on 25 April, when Clause 11 had been agreed to.]</p>

<p>On Clause 13,</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 13 seems to supplant Section 118 of the Post Office Act. On a perusal of the Post Office Act, it does not appear to be as simple a matter as may be inferred from a reading of this clause alone, because there are certain very material differences about which I should like to ask the hon. the Minister certain questions. There is a provision in Section 118 of the Post Office Act in terms of which the detention of a telegram or a postal article can only be undertaken on the written request of any public prosecutor. If that telegram, package or letter is so detained, &#x201C;the Postmaster-General shall if authorized thereto by the Minister of Justice cause that postal article or telegram to be handed over to the said public prosecutor&#x201D;. In other words, it is perfectly clear that within <span class="col_4823-4824" refersTo="page_0986"/>the post office itself no one has the authority&#x2014;of his own volition&#x2014;to detain a telegram or a postal article.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the individual is protected in that respect despite the fact that in Section 115 of the Post Office Act it is laid down that no legal proceedings can be instituted against the Government or against the Postmaster-General for any default, delay, etc. In other words, the addressee of a postal article or telegram cannot take legal proceedings against the Postmaster-General because of a normal delay in the transmission of the article as between the sender and the addressee. That is the position under the Post Office Act. But a completely different situation will arise under Clause 13 which, the Minister says, is in substitution of Section 118 of the Post Office Act. Apart from the fact that the article which may reasonably be suspected of containing something which will afford evidence of the commission of an offence may be found not to contain anything of the sort, it &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be detained by the officer in charge of any post office or telegraph office in which it is or through which it passes. It &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be detained by the officer. Sir, not on the written authority of somebody who has any legal reason for wanting that package detained, and not at the instance of the Minister of Justice. The salient difference, therefore, is that of his own volition a postal official, even a junior postal official, can detain a piece of mail or a telegram. Furthermore, Sir, the Postmaster-General, after the detention of that package by an official of the post office, may bring the detention of such telegram or package to the notice of the Attorney-General. He is not obliged to do so.</p>

<p>Before I take the matter any further, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not agree that, whether or not there is an emergency in South Africa, the transmission of articles through the mail is such a common place in our society, or any other, that nothing should be done which would interfere with that transmission unless there is a very good reason for it. If something has to be done, it should be done on the authority of a person who is competent to judge and competent to issue the instruction, which in turn can, and probably will, be carried out by a junior official. It seems to me that beyond the limitations of the Post Office Act as it stands at present, there is a very strong possibility of an almost complete postal censorship being set up because of the activities of the officials of the Post Office Department, for no good reason or for a very good reason&#x2014;without any motivation from the Minister of Justice, from the Attorney-General concerned or from a public prosecutor. I say, with great respect to the hon. the Minister, that this does require some explanation, and I shall wait for his opinion.</p>

<p>This clause is perfectly clear and is intended to be understood and to be implemented exactly as it stands here. If there is any person who has any doubt about the words &#x201C;reasonably suspected of containing&#x201D; my reply is that that is the precise wording of the original Section 118 which all hon. members accept and which have also appeared in our Post Office Act over the years. I quote from Act No. 44 of 1958, which consolidates our postal laws&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any postal article or any telegram which is reasonably suspected of containing anything which will afford evidence of the commission of a criminal offence or reasonably suspected of being sent in order to further the commission of a criminal offence or to enable the detection of a criminal offence to be concealed &#x2026;</block>

<p>may be demanded by the Attorney-General, on the instructions of the Minister from the Postmaster-General and that article must then be handed over to him. That is the position as the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) indicated. If hon. members listened to my second-reading speech they will know what the problems are in connection with the sending of telegrams from Maseru, telegrams which are sent openly through our telegraph service. I also reminded hon. members that communist literature was also being transmitted. I explained my problem to hon. members&#x2014;that the Attorney-General cannot take action until he has obtained information from outside. We are approaching the stage where it will be necessary for the initiative to be taken not only by the Attorney-General but also by every postmaster. It will not be taken by any cleric but only by the person who is in charge of a post office. I think that we are fully justified in asking that these senior officials should not only take the initiative but should also accept the obligation to disclose these offences. If hon. members tell me now that this is a far-reaching provision, I want once again to repeat my invitation that it will be a very good thing for hon. members to read the British Post Office Act in connection with that point. Hon. members are aware of the fact that in Britain there are no State post offices as we have them here but in spite of that the Home Secretary may at any time demand any postal article or any type of postal article in general from the private post offices and he can give certain instructions to the post offices in that connection. If, therefore, the <i>Times</i> wants to attack me again in regard to this Bill, the <i>Times</i> should first of all put its own house in order as far as the Post Office Act is concerned and it should also put its own house in order as far as the 1922 Act that I quoted in my second-reading speech is concerned, I am not interested, the Government is not interested, nobody is interested in anyone&#x2019;s private correspondence but we are interested in the fact that State machinery and the post office in particular are being used by these people to further their activities. We are not going to be a party to this and we are not prepared to be a party to it. Hon. members opposite and the hon. member for Hospital can raise as many bogies as they like and mention as many possibilities and probabilities as they like. They know what will happen in <span class="col_4825-4826" refersTo="page_0987"/>practice. A fuss may possibly be made about this&#x2014;we have often experienced it in this House&#x2014;but we will never have a fuss in the future again because it will be implemented just as the provisions of other laws have been implemented in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister spent his time in justifying the right of the State to detain subversive literature. Our objection is not against that. The Minister stated his case in the second reading and we heard what he had to say about the telegrams that were being received in this country and about literature being sent through the post, and we wish to deal with that as well. What worries us is that in terms of the wording of this clause it is not quite clear what happens to the letters which are not handed over to the Attorney-General.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>What happens now is that the Postmaster-General does nothing until he gets a request from the public prosecutor or the Attorney-General to detain certain letters and to hand them over to him, but under this provision the position is different. I want to say to the hon. Minister that although an official is in charge of an office, he may not be a senior official, because you have got some very small post offices in the country districts &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>It will be the senior in that office.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but you get post offices with one official only. You even get some private post offices. I know of cases in the Transkei where traders act as post officials. I forget the term they use in those cases, but I think they are postal agencies. So it is not always a senior official who is going to act. It is all right in big post offices where the postmaster is a senior official, but you get small offices and postal agencies, and in terms of this clause they now detain a letter, quite different from the existing law where the Attorney-General or the prosecutor says: &#x201C;We want you to detain a letter; we know it is there.&#x201D; So then he detains the letter and hands it over to the Attorney-General or the prosecutor. But in terms of this clause the official now will detain if he suspects. Admittedly, he cannot open it, but he will detain because he suspects, and I take it then he will bring it to the notice of the Postmaster-General, and the Postmaster-General may bring the detention of such postal article to the notice of the Attorney-General. He need not do so, he &#x201C;may&#x201D;. What happens if the Postmaster-General does not give it to the Attorney-General? The position is altered now. He has still got that letter, it has not been taken from him. And what worries us is that there seems to be no provision for action and that is why we ask the hon. Minister to explain the position to us. There seems to be no obligation on the Postmaster-General to deliver the letter to the addressee.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But there must be some time limit for action. Suppose some official, not necessarily a senior official, suspects there is something wrong with a letter or a newspaper and he keeps it in his office, and say he keeps it for a week or so. There must be some time limit placed on action to be taken by the Postmaster-General or by the official with regard to the letter which is being detained and which is not being handed over to the Attorney-General or to the public prosecutor. That is what we want the hon. Minister to explain to us. There may be something in the Postal Act, but we would like to have certainty about that, certainty as to any duty on the official in such a case where it is not handed over to the Attorney-General, to do something at once to see that the addressee gets the letter within a reasonable time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>There is a very good reason why it should not be made compulsory and why it reads &#x201C;may&#x201D; and not &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. The original intention of the Department was to make this provision compulsory and not permissive, in other words to make it compulsory for such postal article to be handed over, and the provision was framed in that way. It was then submitted to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that Department objected to the compulsion, stating that the provision should be permission. The reason given by the Postmaster-General for his attitude&#x2014;and I am sure that hon. members will appreciate it&#x2014;was that he was not prepared to agree to the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; because he could then be accused of applying censorship in the Post Office. If he was obliged to hand over any such article, he could possibly be accused of applying censorship. He wanted to be able to refuse the request of the Attorney-General if it appeared necessary to do so. If he had the right to refuse then he could not be accused of not having any discretion in connection with the matter and it could not be said that he was merely the &#x201C;stooge&#x201D; of the Attorney-General or of the Department of Justice. It was because of these psychological reasons in the background that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; was inserted and not the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. The Post Office regulations do of course make provision whereby if such article is not handed over it must be delivered. In the present circumstances one can detain and investigate any postal article, but once the investigations have been completed that article must be sent on. If it finds its way to the Attorney-General no new situation arises because the Attorney-General is already in that position. If those articles eventually do find their way to the Attorney-General, the procedure in regard to them is the same as that provided for in the old Act.</p>

<p>We on this side wholeheartedly agree that the Post Office must not be abused by any unlawful organizations. There have been cases in the past where this has happened and any measure to prevent this sort of thing will be supported by this side of the House. There is, however, one point in connection with the clause that I would like to raise. The original Post Office Act was so framed, I think, with the intention of giving only a legal official the right to interfere at all with the conveyance of mail. The Post Office itself was unable to take such action. I admit that the hon. the Minister has experienced difficulty under the old Post Office Act and that is why a change is being brought about in this clause.</p>

<p>Yes, but it was not possible to act as stringently as the hon. the Minister now proposes to do. I admit that wider powers are imperative in this connection. But there is just this consideration: I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not consider making the provision more specific so that it will refer more particularly to postal articles that are printed or that are aimed at promoting the interests of an unlawful organization? He can make the provisions as wide as he wants as far as unlawful organizations are concerned.</p>

<p>I want to explain to the hon. the Minister what I mean. In the Crimes Act of Australia there is reference to postal articles that are printed or published by, forthcoming from, or aimed at the promotion of, an unlawful organization. There the words &#x201C;unlawful organization&#x201D; are specifically mentioned and it may perhaps be better in this case to mention the words &#x201C;unlawful organization&#x201D; specifically.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. Minister did yesterday in quite another context, I think he did me and other members on this side of the House an injustice by saying that we raise this matter in order, as he put it, &#x201C;om spoke op te ja&#x201D;. It has been made perfectly clear by me and other speakers that we agree entirely that there should be some procedure, and perhaps a procedure that goes beyond the present provision in the Post Office Act, to facilitate the detention of mail which is suspected of being of some assistance in the committing of an offence, etc. But I put it to the hon. the Minister that I assume that he did not want to go beyond the needs of the case, and as Clause 13 stands now, he is in fact going beyond the needs of the case. The hon. Minister said that as the position obtains now, a package having been detained is sent on after a certain time. That is true, because there is a clause here which says (Section 96 of the Post Office Act)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any officer who otherwise than in pursuance of his duty opens or tampers with or wilfully destroys, makes away or secretes or suffers to be opened &#x2026; shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Otherwise than in the pursuance of his duties.&#x201D; Now, the postal official acting in terms of Clause 13 of this Bill would be acting in &#x201C;pursuance of his duty&#x201D;, and does not fall within the ambit of Section 96 of the Post Office Act which is the sanction against the postal official unreasonably detaining mail. For that reason, and for the reason mentioned by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) that not all the post offices are run by postmasters and senior officials, I think this clause goes too far. The post office in the area where I live at the present time has a postmistress who comprises the entire staff&#x2014;she is the senior, the junior, the office-boy, everything, and whether this good lady will have the judgment that is required I am not in a position to say, but the fact is that as the clause stands, a person being a postal official can without any good reason detain a package, a telegram or letter indefinitely, which I think is not the Minister&#x2019;s intention, and which does interfere seriously with the transmission of the mail. If the hon. Minister merely wants the power he seeks in this clause, and does not want to impede the flow of mail through the country unnecessarily. <span class="col_4829-4830" refersTo="page_0989"/>I think the amendment I intend to move will solve the problem, because it puts a period to the detention which any postal official can impose on a telegram or postal article, without taking the action which the hon. Minister wants that official to take, namely, to hand it over for prosecution, etc., to the Attorney-General. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end ot the proposed new Section 118:</block>

<p>Provided that if such postal article or telegram is not handed over to any Attorney-General or public prosecutor within 30 days of its detention by the officer in charge of the post office or telegraph office concerned, it shall forthwith be delivered to the person to whom it is addressed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The regulations make provision for that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>That is my difficulty. I cannot find a regulation that makes provision for that. There is a regulation, Section 96, in the Post Office Act, which I have just read, which makes it an offence to delay and detain articles other than in the pursuance of the duty of the official concerned, but that does not cover my point. In terms of Clause 13 of this Bill, the person concerned would be acting in pursuance of his or her duty if he or she could say &#x201C;I reasonably suspected that that package or that letter or that telegram came within the ambit of this clause&#x201D;. I do not want to dilate on the matter. This is a practical matter and a very important one for the ordinary person and for the ordinary use of the mail. The hon, Minister spoke about the <i>South African Communist</i> being a periodical which he cited the other day and which he said passes freely through the mails. I want to put it to him that anybody, whether as a practical joke, or maliciously, could send him or me or anybody else a copy of the <i>South African Communist</i> which we have never seen in our lives, and from that date on the Postmistress of Clovelly, for example, would say &#x201C;I can reasonably suspect every piece of mail that comes to that person because he has just received a brown-paper package which contained the <i>South African Communist.</i> From that day on his mail might be detained for a long time, whereas the matter would be quite innocent. Therefore, I put this limitation on the whole procedure, and the Minister. I am sure, will agree that from the day that the postal official concerned scans the telegram or the piece of mail or package, and says &#x201C;I reasonably suspect that this is something that should receive the attention of the Attomev-General or the public prosecutor&#x201D;, within 30 days, surely, that telegram or package can either be handed to the prosecutor or the Attorney-General, or be sent forward in me ordinary way. For that reason I ask the hon. Minister to consider this amendment to be a reasonable one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I think that it will be very wrong on our part to fix a maximum period in this Bill during which a postal article of this nature has to be delivered to an addressee. The fact remains that because of the vast distances in South Africa one cannot compare the position in Johannesburg, for example, with that of a small place in the north-west or South West Africa. If the amendment is adopted and the Post Office has the right to detain a postal article of this nature for 30 days during which time they will have to decide whether to hand it over to the Attorney-General or not, we will have the position that postal articles which could be delivered at a much earlier stage, perhaps within a day&#x2014;in Johannesburg, for example, the Attorney-General or the head of the Post Office can decide within a day or two&#x2014;will then be detained for a much longer period because the amendment states that the person in charge of the post office or telegraph office concerned will have the right to detain such postal articles for 30 days. The tendency will then be not to deal urgently with a matter of that nature as the post office would like to do, but the tendency will be to say: &#x201C;Well, we have the right to detain it for 30 days.&#x201D; A week or two or three will go by and the postal article will be delayed longer than would otherwise have been the case. If no maximum period is fixed the tendency will always be to send that postal article further on its way as soon as possible. The hon member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) must surely understand that when he fixes a maximum period that a maximum period will at the same time tend to become the minimum period. This amendment therefore will create precisely the undesirable state of affairs which the hon. member for Hospital seeks to avoid with his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) I regret to say that I made a mistake. The provisions to which I referred are not contained in the British Post Office Act but in the Official Secrets Act which refers to the Post Office Act. I want to direct the attention of the hon. member to Sections 4 and 5 of the Official Secrets Act. In Section 4 it is provided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where it appears to a Secretary of State that such a course is expedient in the public interest &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is all: there is no other qualification at all. It merely has to appear to him that such a course is necessary in the public interest&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he may by warrant under his hand refer any person who owns or controls any telegraphic cable or wire office used for the sending of telegrams to or from any place out of the United Kingdom, to produce to him or to any person named in the warrant the original and transcripts either of all telegrams. or of telegrams sent from or addressed to any specified person or place, sent <span class="col_4831-4832" refersTo="page_0990"/>or received to or from any place out of the United Kingdom by any such cable, wire &#x2026;</block>

<p>You see therefore that this provision is much wider than the provision that we are asking for here. But in Section 5 it goes even further. I have read it through very quickly and it appears to me that these provisions are even wider, and that the most important point is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who carries on, whether alone or in conjunction with any other business, the business of receiving for reward letters, telegrams or postal packets for delivery or forwarding to persons for whom they are intended, shall as soon as may be, send to the chief officer of police for the district for registration by him notice of the fact together with the address or addresses where the business is carried on, and the chief officer of police shall keep a register of the names and addresses of such persons&#x2026;.</block>

<p>These provisions give that police officer considerable powers in that connection. In other words, our Post Office Act does not go nearly as far as the Official Secrets Act does in regard to the British Post Office Act.</p>

<p>As far as the amendment of the hon. member for Hospital is concerned, I do not have the slightest doubt that the purpose for which the hon. member moved his amendment has already been covered, apart from the argument raised by the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe). It is an offence for any post office official to detain postal articles. I have not the slightest doubt that in practice there will be no unnecessary delaying of postal articles but that this clause as it stands will give the Attorney-General the necessary powers to bring criminals to book more easily. Because that is the position, I am not prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I think this should be said: The hon. Minister refers to the Official Secrets Act to reinforce his argument, and he has the advantage of me that he has the Act before him. But where he says that the Act lays down that &#x201C;as soon as may be&#x201D; the piece of mail, the telegram is to be handed over to the chief officer of police for the district concerned, then that, in contrast with the clause as it stands now, completely proves my argument.</p>

<p>I cannot explain to the Minister all over again. We are not arguing about the need to retain pieces of mail in certain circumstances, but to try and limit the period in such a way that no unreasonable suspicion by a person in the service of the Postal Department can cause someone&#x2019;s mail to be held up for malicious or whimsical reasons, or even political reasons. You can make of any small post office a &#x201C;dead letter&#x201D; office where your mail may lie and &#x201C;moulder in the grave&#x201D; if the postmistress has a reasonable suspicion.

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>This clause introduces four new sub-sections and three of these will enable the State to equate with the P.A.C. or the A.N.C. some organization of a different name. I make no comment on these; but I want to deal with sub-section (d), which deals with the aspect of the courts in considering the validity of anything done under sub-sections (a), (b) and (c). Now (d) will mean that no court will have jurisdiction to pronounce upon the validity of any proclamation issued under this claues. Normally a court would have that right, and it is an important right. It would be entitled to pronounce a proclamation invalid, <i>inter alia,</i> on two important grounds, firstly that it was arbitrary, or secondly that it was <i>male fide.</i> Arbitrariness means that the person issuing the proclamation did not apply his mind to the question, and <i>male fide</i> means that although the person applied his mind to the question he nevertheless dishonestly says in the proclamation that the position is different. Those are very far-reaching changes. I suggest that a case certainly has been made out for changes. We know that the Snyman Report and the various killings and incidents we have had are reasons for it. A further good reason for it is the threat we have of overseas powers joining with dissatisfied elements in the country to bring the State to a downfall. I am impressed, too, by the fact that Patrick Duncan said openly in London recently that the intention was that there should be an Algerian-type war here. All those facts move me and this side of the House to say that certain changes are justified and I cannot think of anyone who does not agree &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I did not know that. I suppose the Minister is referring to the letter he wrote subsequently to the report. I certainly did not understand him to go so far. But I will say that this serious situation moves us to support far-reaching changes, including the change in the law regarding preparatory examinations. Though we have felt it necessary, albeit reluctantly, to concede these extra powers, it is most important that one should not go a yard further than is necessary. I think one has to weigh, in considering whether a particular provision is necessary, all the facts of the situation. We have to weigh the advantages against the disadvantages it could have both internally among the people who support law and order, and indeed among our friends overseas.</p>

<p>Now one trusts that the Minister will certainly bring his mind to bear upon this problem when issuing a proclamation and that there wil be no possibility of the Minister dishonestly putting something in the proclamation that is not true. But then I ask the Minister whether he really wants to put a provision on the Statute Book which is capable of misconstruction. Therefore I sincerely hope that the Minister will feel that the value of this power to him and to the country is as nothing beside the harm it may do to him personally and to anyone concerned with the issuing of a proclamation. Accordingly, if I am in order, I would like to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<p>I honestly cannot understand the attitude of the hon. member. If he had been a layman I would have forgiven him, but he is a jurist and an able one at that. But what does the hon. member do? He cannot plead not guilty when I make the accusation against him that if you, Sir, had not ruled his amendment out of order, and if he had persuaded me to adopt it, it would have nullified the effect of the whole clause completely, and the hon. member knows that as well as I do. He would have nullified the clause in such a way that it would not even have been necessary for the Committee to adopt it. Then we would have been far worse off than we are now. The hon. member knows that if this provision is not inserted the whole clause will be worthless. He has read the Snyman Report, and I understand from hon. members opposite&#x2014;they must please tell me if they have changed their minds&#x2014;that they accept that report. The report states that this principle must be adopted and I submitted the legislation to Mr. Justice Snyman who made a thorough study of it.

<p>Of course. Can the hon. member split up the clause into various parts? It is permissible to do so in order to help the Opposition, with the consent of the Committee, so I understand, and we do not object to that because one wants to assist the Opposition in this difficult predicament. But hon. members&#x2014;and the hon. member for Pinelands is one of them&#x2014;are now acting in such a way that it will not surprise me at all if we have a suggestion one day that this House should be enlarged so that some members can have two benches to sit on, on one of which is written &#x201C;national&#x201D; and on the other &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; because hon. members continually change their minds when it suits them. But the point is, and this is what I have against the hon. member &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) can always enter the debate if she wants to do so. She can ask her Whip to be relieved of the obligation simply to sit there mumbling. But the hon. member for Pinelands knows what will happen if this provision is not included. Certain cases have been postponed pending the passing of this legislation. We make no secret of that fact, nor does Mr. Justice Snyman. That is why he said that his recommendation should be made retrospective. We have postponed certain cases with the specific object of making it unnecessary for us to prove that Poqo is the P.A.C.. so that the court will have to accept that as a fact when the State President issues such a proclamation, and hon. members opposite support that. But if we do not have this provision, what will happen? None of those cases will be able to come before the court because hon. members know these people just as well as I do. An application will be made to court to cast doubt on this matter and to get a ruling from the court that Poqo is not the same as the P.A.C.</p>

We are not dealing here with an Act of Parliament but with a proclamation; that proclamation can be attacked in court, and it will be so attacked, in an effort to show that that proclamation is <i>ultra vires</i> or has been issued <i>mala fide</i>, and what will the result then be? An application will first be made to the Cape court. It will take time to deal with it because they will use all the delaying tactics that they know so well, but eventually judgment will be given against them.

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>My objections are as follows. First of all. this Bill is being rushed through Parliament within a few days because of the desperate urgency to get this measure through. I have the Snyman Report here which I have read with. I suppose, as much attention as anybody else, and I see it is dated 6 March. It is now 26 April. Why, if there was such desperate urgency, did the Minister wait from 6 March to 23 April before presenting the Bill to the House? If the State was in such a desperate emergency that this Bill had to be rushed through Parliament, that we were given one day to study this Bill. I would suggest that the Easter recess should rather have been delayed. Why the sudden rush now?</p>

<p>The other thing is that the Minister says you either accept the Snyman Report or you do not. There are only two recommendations in the report, couched in very general terms. The one relates to the difficulties of the Attorneys-General about Pocio being the same as the P.A C. and the other is in regard to the membership of Pogo. It does not say anything about summary trials or special courts &#x201C;at any place&#x201D;.</p>

He wrote back and said yes, and this happens to be one of his recommendations. In regard to the other matters, he made certain observations in general, but naturally it would not have been in order for me to ask for his comment or his approval of that.

It was on that basis that the Opposition announced its agreement with the measure. Now we have this Unlawful Organizations Act being made a permanent part of our legislation. Yesterday the hon. member for Durban (North) was very proud of the amendment he got accepted to Clause 4, because it changed the whole complexion of the matter (he said) and it now has to come back to the House to be repeatedly approved every year. Now we see the fate of this sort of thing. Accept this sort of Draconian legislation on this flimsy excuse that as long as an amendment is accepted that the House has to approve of it year after year, everything is fine.

<p>Yes, it must be some sort of malady which has taken from her all her good sense, and which has taken her feet about a mile off the ground. Here we have a recommendation that it is impossible to deal with an organization like Poqo under the existing law, and indeed that has been the experience. If the hon. member for Houghton had taken the trouble to look through the newspaper reports in respect of these matters, she would have found that for more than a year they have been trying to tie up Poqo with the P.A.C., and that was their difficulty, and what happened after a year? Paarl was just one example of what happened, and the Bashee River incident. It is quite possible that these things could have been prevented if that organization had been nipped in the bud in the beginning. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Houghton says we will see what happens this time next year. I am not concerned with next year. I am concerned with now, and that is what this House is concerned with, this urgent situation. I think we would be failing in our duty to South Africa if we did not support this clause upon the recommendation urgently brought to the notice of the country by the commissioner. The hon. member for Houghton has not yet advanced a reason why she is opposed to this clause. We raised the matter in regard to one paragraph which we wanted the Minister to explain, but we must support the principle of the clause because we have to deal with the situation as it has been brought to our attention by an independent person especially seized of the difficulties which exist. The hon. member for Houghton, in her little playings here with politics, is not fighting this difficulty in this country; she is just trying to embarrass the Opposition.

<p>Fortunately the reply is very simple. It will not be my function to define it at all. It will be the function of the courts to define it. As I explained to hon. members at the second reading, Nokwe and others were charged before a regional court; they were found guilty in terms of that section; they went on appeal to the Transvaal courts and the Transvaal court found that although the organization was similar to the A.N.C., in terms of the wording of that section they were not guilty of any transgression of the section. It is to give effect to that judgment of the Transvaal court, which is a technical matter, that these words are being added. If and when anybody is charged in future it will be for the courts to interpret that section in the light of the judgment in Regina v. Nokwe and others.</p>

The recommendations made by him do not cover any suggestion of steps of the sort set out in Clause 17.

<p>The Minister himself has put it forward with great diffidence and it seemed to us that he himself felt that he was asking for something which almost frightened him when he thought about it seriously. Sir, the interesting thing about this clause is that it is to be used not only to obtain evidence or to obtain what might amount to confession of offences which have already been committed but also of offences intended to be committed or which some person or persons might have intended to commit but did not commit. In other words, the hon. the Minister is asking for these enormous powers in respect of two classes of cases which I think I am correct in saying certainly as to one, was not a crime under our criminal law and as to the second one, may or may not be, depending upon the stage of preparation which had been reached in respect of the intention to commit the crime. Intention to commit a crime is no offence; there has to be preparation before that can be established. In other words, we are here in a position where we are asking for powers almost unheard of in any civilized country in respect of three classes of cases, one of which is certainly not an offence and one of which may or may not be an offence whereas the third would be. The only justification for this provision that I could find seems to be the sort of attitude that because we are dealing with people who impose secrecy upon their members by means of torture and by means of violence and by means of murder, the only way in which we can get information is by using the same methods against them. In other words, we are being asked to make the most terrible confession, namely that we cannot protect witnesses or informers who have made information available to the police. Sir, that is a very sad day for South Africa and a very sad state of affairs for the Minister of Justice to have to admit to this House because it is tantamount to saying that where the man has given the State assistance in finding out who <span class="col_4843-4844" refersTo="page_0996"/>has been responsible for a crime, the State cannot thereafter protect him. I wonder whether the Minister realizes the implications of a statement of that kind, because if that is so, then I wonder if a case is not made out for declaring a state of emergency in South Africa, saying that he cannot protect these people and because he cannot protect them he is going to place himself in a position where he can use these methods against this organization.</p>

<p>Yes, I put it that way and I put it that way deliberately because it seems to me that the intention of this clause is to meet third degree with third degree or something worse. Sir, before one can evaluate this clause I think it is very necessary for us to understand what powers the authorities already have at the present time. In respect of a suspect, he is charged with some crime or other; he is brought before the court and remanded, and while he is under remand he can be interrogated. The Minister knows very well that suspects are often remanded from time to time while the police are seeking further evidence and that they have the right to interrogate those people. But, of course, the suspect has the right to legal assistance. Then there are the people whom the police have reasons to believe have information, whom they want as witnesses. They are covered by Section 83 of the Act of 1955 which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The magistrate may at any time, upon the request of the local public prosecutor, require the attendance before him of any person who is likely to give material evidence as to any alleged offence, whether or not it be known or suspected who the person is by whom the offence has been committed.</block>

That could be amended to be used in the case of suspected offences or preparations for an offence, but it would be under proper control <span class="col_4845-4846" refersTo="page_0997"/>and the hon. the Minister would know that on each occasion the accused came before a magistrate and that there was no question of the police being in sole control of him.</p>

<p>I would be very interested to see it, but I can see no justification for it in the circumstances which exist at the present time. Here you have provision made for 90 days&#x2019; solitary confinement which can be repeated for further periods of 90 days, with no limitation. In other words, the unfortunate <span class="col_4847-4848" refersTo="page_0998"/>individual is held incommunicado for 90 days and if he has not answered at the end of 90 days he can be put away again. Sir, I can see no justification in the present situation for an action of this kind. The hon. the Minister has been a practising lawyer as I have. I think we have all had experience of the sort of things which have happened in police cells and which are alleged to happen in police cells but are not proved. I think the Minister agrees with me that the police have the ability to make a period of incarceration under interrogation very interesting indeed for the prisoner, and I wonder if hon. members opposite, other than the Minister and myself, have an idea of what this can mean to the individual who is held and of the sort of treatment to which he can be subjected.

<p>It may amount to the same thing very often. People are prepared to give all sorts of information. I have seen men broken down before; I think the Minister has too. I have seen them broken down here and in other places and I know what the results are. I know how they try to stand by their stories for fear of what may happen to them again. The clause also provides that no court shall have the authority to release such a person. Why, if that is so, have we got this provision, &#x201C;if a police officer believes on reasonable ground&#x201D;? Who is going to decide whether those grounds are reasonable or not? Only a court of law can decide whether they are reasonable. Does this exclude the court altogether, or can a case be brought before the court to find out whether the police officer&#x2019;s grounds are reasonable or not, and the court can declare that they are not reasonable but it cannot release the prisoner. Why put in &#x201C;upon reasonable grounds&#x201D; or is it just white-washing the situation? Why not say that a police officer may at any time for any reason incarcerate an individual who he thinks has information? It need not be reasonable grounds at all. That is white-washing it. No one can test the reasonable grounds. That is white-washing it. The only man who has the right to release the prisoner is the Minister, and who is going to bring information before the Minister as to whether those grounds are reasonable or not? Sir, a provision of this kind is a complete negation of all the principles on which our criminal law is based. Here you have a man who can be locked up for 90 days, who may be entirely unconnected with the crime, but who has, in the opinion of the police, certain evidence. He is kept there for 90 days and subjected to all sorts of interesting experiences. Perhaps he never had information at all. And then? Take the case of a suspect. The whole principle of our law is that a man shall not be forced to confess. If he makes a confession we will not use it; we will just use the facts to which he confesses and establish them in another way. In other words, you are undermining the whole principle of the freedom of confession.

<p>I am not insinuating anything. Let the Minister listen for a moment. He knows very well that torture was an accepted weapon of the authorities in the maintenance of law and order. He knows that it was abandoned because of the uselessness of the statements made by the victims and their readiness very often to confess to anything provided the torture was severe enough. I am not suggesting physical torture; what I am suggesting is that the incarceration of a man without evidence, a man who may not have any information, a man who is merely suspected and may be innocent, for periods of 90 days may amount to a form of mental torture, because he always has the hope that at the end he may come out, and when he comes out he gets another 90 days. I wonder if the Minister knows the effect that incarceration in solitary confinement can have on people. There are some people&#x2014; apparently the Minister is one&#x2014;who are not much affected by it. I have known men who were not affected by it.

He can, however, as has been pointed out, be recommitted any number of times for a further period of 90 days.</p>

<p>To me these words I have read out spell tyranny and despotism. This, in plain English, says &#x201C;South Africa will be a police state&#x201D; as indeed it will if this clause is accepted. I think it is impossible to tolerate this clause. It gives powers to the police to give third degree for three months and then perhaps even longer. I believe that it must be regarded as a barbarous innovation and I say that I condemn it wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>One of the official organs of the Nationalists, the <i>Burger,</i> is correct when it talks about &#x201C;formidable powers being granted to answer the challenge of subversion and revolution&#x201D;. Yet we are told by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Justice that this land is tranquil and peaceful and safe. The <i>Burger</i> differs and must have had this clause particularly in mind when their editor called this Bill &#x201C;a chill reminder that we were already in the midst of harder and more severe times&#x201D; and that &#x201C;we have to fight back with measures such as have seldom been necessary in the past in times of peace and then only sporadically&#x201D;. They are now to become a permanent part of our law. The Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister says &#x201C;peace reigns&#x201D;. The <i>Burger</i> says &#x201C;we are in a state of seige that may last many years&#x201D;. That is why, it says, the Government needs what they call &#x201C;frightening administrative powers which could lend themselves to serious abuse&#x201D;. That is also what my Leader has said. We as parliamentarians, we as people who believe in the rule of law, should never subject the citizens of this country to anything that can lend itself to serious abuse without adequate correction and without adequate check and without adequate safeguards. The <i>Burger</i> feels, as I do, what it calls, &#x201C;an instinctive aversion to these radical proposals&#x201D;. This clause is the most obnoxious I have ever come across in any law in all my 20 years in Parliament.</p>

<p>Never! I was one of the few who protested in Parliament and out of Parliament against my own party, because I believed that such powers should never be given to any Minister without adequate safeguards. To me this clause is abhorrent; it is obnoxious to all who cherish the liberty of the subject, to all who hate the idea of arbitrary arrests, to all who believe that the test of civilization is the fair administration of justice to all. Arbitrary powers always corrupt and they corrupt not only those who suffer from them but also those who practise them. If you break down the rule of law; it you breach the principle of <i>habeas corpus</i> which we should always uphold; if you break it even temporarily, in any way, there should always be guarantees to see that those who are placed in a position of arbitrary authority, should be liable to speedy and stern correction if there is any abuse of power. If you break down the rule of law the inevitable result must be cruelty and despotism and, in the end, chaos. There are no safeguards or checks against abuse in this Bill.</p>

<p>I think there is one important thing we should remember. This legislation, this clause, is going to be applied in South West Africa which is mandated territory. That is something which we should think of very seriously, Sir. We should remember that there is a case pending at present against us in which we rely on the rule of law as the last bastion to protect our just and legal rights. And we are now, in our own country, abusing and ignoring the rule of law; we are going against its very finest principles. What hope have we to expect people overseas, our friends who have always <span class="col_4851-4852" refersTo="page_1000"/>protected our interests, to do anything else but to despise us. What great harm we are doing to our cause overseas! What harm we are doing to our cause in that court in which we will plead our legal and just rights, as we hoped, with success. Our safety may be grievously imperilled unless the rule of law is honoured and maintained. Yet we ourselves set an example by doing something which every single civilized country abhors and to which we on this side and I personally cannot possibly ever subscribe.</p>

The hon. member knows that before legislation can be applied to South West Africa a provision must be embodied in the legislation to that effect and it is not embodied in this legislation.

<p>I must honestly say, Mr. Chairman, that if that hon. member were a member of my party I would renounce him; I would refuse under the circumstances to be a member of the same party as that to which he belonged; I would refuse to sit in the same caucus with him; I would refuse to be seen in the same company with him. That is all I have to say to the hon. member.</p>

<p><span class="col_4853-4854" refersTo="page_1001"/>I want to direct my remarks now to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who approached this aspect of the matter in a very reasonable manner, which I appreciate. I do not want to reply to all his arguments. I just want to lay a foundation for the arguments that may be raised later. I want to give the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a confidential document dealing with the British Act of 1922. I just want to quote one section from that document&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Regulations in terms of the permissive Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will remember that it was a permissive Act which suspended the entire system of justice and in terms of which there could be government by regulation. That Act is still in force; it is still on the British Statute Book. I am not giving these facts for the information of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition but actually for the information of the London <i>Times.</i> This Act was applied up to 1961. I quote from the document that I want to entrust to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Regulations in terms of the permissive Act were made to cope with the special circumstances existing at that time &#x2026;</block>

<p>This was in 1922, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These regulations, also reviewable by the House of Commons &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is quite a normal procedure&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; were in force in full vigour until 1961 when the I.R.A. announced that it was calling off its campaign.</block>

<p>I will give this document to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. There is one other thing that I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He warned against the abuse of the provisions of Clause 17. I do not resent this fact; I would have resented it if he had not issued this warning. I do not resent his warning because anyone who tries to deny that this clause can lead to misuse is a fool. I am painfully aware of this fact, not only in regard to what I myself have seen happening but for other reasons as well. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that he had seen human beings being broken. It is not a very nice thing to see a human being being broken. I have seen it and he has seen it. The man seeking these powers must take responsibility for them. They can make or break him and I am painfully aware of that fact. Nothing broke a former Minister of Justice under another Government as much as these regulations did&#x2014;broke him to such an extent that his name stank in South Africa. I do not intend to allow that to happen to me. That is why when I accept responsibility for asking for this regulation, I fully realize what the results may be for me as an individual and for this Government; I fully appreciate all the consequences that may flow from this. I realize that it will be my specific duty, my responsibility, to ensure that these powers are not abused. What is more, I realize that I still have to be responsible to this House; I shall have to be able to tell this House with a clear conscience at all times that this regulation has been applied without its having being abused. I cannot say any more than this to hon. members; I do not want to go further than this.</p>

<p>But I want to tell hon. members that we are now entering a new phase in the struggle against these subversive elements. I have reason to believe that we are not very far from the stage, depending upon circumstances which are unknown and therefore unpredictable, when we may perhaps be able to lay our hands on the people who are primarily responsible for this position that has been created in South Africa. Up to the present we have only captured the minions although we have arrested some of the less important leaders; we have even arrested some of the important figures in this movement. But we have not been able to arrest the nucleus of leaders, the group that is behind this whole movement, the people who are responsible for all that is happening in South Africa. I am being very honest and frank in this regard.</p>

<p>I am aware of the fact that there may possibly be people somewhere who can lead us to those people. But Section 83&#x2014;as has been proved clearly in the past&#x2014;is unfortunately not strong enough to bring that about. The Government wants to lay its hands on those people. Not only do we want to lay our hands on them but in the interests of South Africa and in the interests of us all we must lay our hands on them. I hesitate for the reasons that I have given to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to ask for these powers. One does learn something from experience, Mr. Chairman. I have also learnt from my experience. There were times during the past months when I was grateful for what I had experienced. One draws on one&#x2019;s past experience. That experience compels me to say that if this clause can be put into operation we may succeed in our purpose and we may perhaps save ourselves&#x2014;and when I speak about &#x201C;ourselves&#x201D; I mean all the inhabitants of South Africa, White and non-White, no matter to what party they may belong&#x2014;much nameless misery, a great deal of sorrow, if we can get to the root of the matter and solve this problem. Hon. members must please not ask me to say more than this; I am not able to say more than this at this stage. I do not even want hon. members to take my word for this. All I ask is that they give me the benefit of any doubt that may exist in this regard.</p>

<p>I said I was not sure of what the position is myself. The Minister has, however, given me an assurance, and his knowledge is obviously greater than mine on the subject. He drafted the Bill with legal assistance and I accept that it does not apply to South West Africa. Therefore I say to this House and to the world that any argument I may have used in this respect, any argument that hinges on the statement that it will be applied to the mandated territory of South West Africa, I withdraw unequivocally. I am sorry I used that wrong argument to make one point. That is unqualified and I am glad the Committee has given me a chance to correct it immediately.</p>

<p>Let me say this, however, that it does not diminish by one iota my very strong objection to this clause. I believe it will be used inside and outside our land to stoke the fires of hate and antagonism which other countries feel against us, in particular those Western democracies on whom we depend, should the worst come to the worst in connection with South West Africa, to help our cause &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, a clause in a Bill which authorizes the summary arrest by the police of individuals, to be incarcerated for the extraction of information continuously for 90 days or until they give satisfactory replies to interrogation is abhorrent. It is foreign to the rule of law which is honoured by all the countries whose friendship we value&#x2014;the United States of America, Great Britain and France. These countries which could through their right of veto help us on serious international occasions, might well be turned away from us and our interests by the fact that we ourselves have shown an utter disregard for the canons of justice and the rule of law. I say that the withdrawal I have made does not alter my own feelings one jot towards this iniquitous clause nor does it alter the fact that it will be very dangerous to our future relations with other nations if we accede to this harsh and objectionable measure.</p>

<p>In all these years no member of the United Party or of any other party has shown less patriotism towards South Africa than that hon. member. I think that everyone in this House, even his own supporters, hold that opinion of him.</p>

<p>One thing is very clear and that is what has been said by the hon. the Minister&#x2014;that the United Party supports the principle of this Bill not out of principle but out of opportunism. They have agreed that we should have a watch-dog but now that we have that watch-dog, they are trying to draw its teeth. They want to have a watch-dog which cannot bite at all. I want to base my argument on the attitude of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said that this type of measure was quite correct in time of war and in time of crisis. We know that in time of crisis we have to give these powers to the Minister. Will any hon. member say that as far as our internal security is concerned the position during the last war was worse than the position that we are experiencing to-day? Will they tell us that they have not read what Mr. Justice Snyman said in his reply to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s letter? Let me read it for hon. members [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question arises, however, whether, having regard to the circumstances as revealed in my inquiry and the cold war here and in the world, the present time can be regarded as being normal.</block>

<p>This is a time of cold war. Everyone knows that. It is just as serious a period as far as <span class="col_4857-4858" refersTo="page_1003"/>our internal security is concerned as was the case during the war. Those hon. members are in full agreement that those powers would be justified during a time of war. Their attitude is that when they are in power they are entitled to give their Minister more powers than they are prepared to give to this Minister. What are they prepared to do? They are prepared to give a Minister unlimited powers in time of crisis, powers which permit him to act even without parliamentary sanction.</p>

<p>I have here an article which appeared recently in the <i>Cape Argus</i> written by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). What does he advocate? He says that the Minister must not ask Parliament for these powers; he says that if the Minister deems it necessary, he must make use of those powers whether he has parliamentary approval or not. He must do what General Smuts did in 1922. He mentions the example here and states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party can see circumstances in which the present Government too may need extraordinary powers. General Smuts, in his lifetime, had to take drastic action. At one time many years ago, to the distress of the Nationalist Party, General Smuts deported communist leaders from South Africa without parliamentary authority.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Rule of law&#x201D;! General Smuts did not detain people for 90 days and seek parliamentary approval for doing so in advance. There was a localized strike on the Witwatersrand; there was no general crisis in the country, and what did General Smuts do? He did not detain those people for 90 days. He imprisoned them without trial. He then took them from the gaol and deported them without trial.</p>

He must do so whether Parliament gives its approval or not and he must ask Parliament for indemnity afterwards.</p>

<p>I say that their attitude in principle is that in a time of crisis one can give far greater powers to a Minister. Their argument is that this provision is too severe, that it can be abused far too much, but I say that the attitude of this party is that when there is a crisis one must not only give the Minister greater powers but one must also give the Minister the assurance that he can do just what he wants to do: Detain them for 90 days; detain them for 120 days; detain them in gaol; deport them; do just what you want to do for the security of the country. Is that not what the hon. member for Yeoville advocates in his article? They were prepared to assume those powers themselves but they do not want to give those powers to this Minister of Justice. The whole thing amounts to this, that they are continually saying that they accept the Snyman Report, but they then surely accept the fact that the position in this country at the moment makes it necessary to give the Minister extraordinary powers. But now they come along and say that the position in the country is not serious and that there is no justification for these powers. Their attitude is quite clear to me. The hon. the Minister stated clearly why he wanted these powers and he told us precisely what he was going to do with them. Hon. members opposite now object to his being given those powers and they can only object if they do not believe that there is a serious position in the country. They can only object if they have not accepted the Snyman Report. When they say that they accept that report and they vote for the second reading, it is quite clear that the only reason why they do so is that it is politically convenient for them to do so. I say that the attitude adopted by those hon. members is a shocking one. On each occasion that the hon. the Minister has asked for additional powers we have experienced the same complaint from hon. members opposite that those powers can be abused. We have now heard this again from the hon. member for Wynberg who has said that these powers can be abused. They have said this over the years in regard to all the powers that have been asked for. The hon. the Minister challenged them to mention one case where this Minister of Justice or a former Minister of Justice had abused any of those powers. They have not been able to mention one case. They mentioned one case recently and that was in connection with Patrick Duncan, but there is not one single member sitting on that side of the House who can say that that power was abused in the case of Patrick Duncan. But they continue to make us suspect in the eyes of the world. The hon. member for Wynberg is now going to tell the world all the possible and impossible results that can flow from these powers being abused. That is how he brings discredit upon South Africa. If a madman were to have these powers, he would of course be able to do anything. The hon. member for Wynberg has told the world that this is now the position in South Africa. He has also said that our good name will be dragged through the mud even further. What an unreasonable attitude to adopt in respect of one&#x2019;s own country! What an unreasonable attitude it is to adopt while those hon. members agree with us that the position in South Africa is very serious!</p>

<p>I am sorry that the spirit revealed by the Opposition has been to tell the Minister: &#x201C;Strengthen your hand; do not go too far <span class="col_4859-4860" refersTo="page_1004"/>but you can rely on the Opposition in your efforts to combat sabotage in South Africa, in trying to overcome this dangerous position; in your efforts to do so you can rely upon us&#x201D;, while to-day they adopt an attitude which is not at all in conformity with the attitude that they first adopted. I am afraid that they are doing themselves a very great injustice. That would not hurt me so much but the fact is that they are also doing South Africa a very great injustice.</p>

<p>Well, the hon. member for Vereeniging is the last person who should talk to this side of the House as us being opportunists. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has called him a political grasshopper, and let me tell him that we have not been opportunistic in our attitude towards this Bill, and let no one else on that side ever refer to our attitude as opportunistic. We have supported the hon. Minister where he has a case, and he knows it very well, and I think everyone on that side of the House should appreciate that where a case has been made out we have supported him. What case has been made out in this regard? The hon. member for Vereeniging glibly talks about the Snyman Commission Report and then the cold war. There is nothing in the Snyman Commission Report which warrants a clause like this.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about the Snyman Commission Report. That is what we support. The hon. member for Vereeniging wants to do what everyone else on that side apparently wants to do&#x2014;just give the Minister all the powers he wants, without any case being made out for these powers, extraordinary powers in time of crisis, and then&#x2014;the hon. member will correct me if I misquote him&#x2014;he said &#x201C;daar is nie &#x2019;n noodtoestand in hierdie land nie&#x201D;. This is what he said. There is no emergency in this country. I cannot follow the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. In my short time in this House, the most remarkable thing that I have ever seen was when the hon. Minister of Justice stood up and asked for a power like this without being able to tell the House why he wants it. This is the Minister of Justice who said when he introduced the Bill that he had qualms about it. To-day he said that it pains him to do this, for the various reasons that there are; apart from the effect it might have on the hon. Minister&#x2019;s political career, it pains him personally as a lawyer and as a Minister of Justice. In those circumstances surely some case can be made out for this! If the hon. Minister of Justice is so pained about this, why is this clause so drastic, so Draconian? Why is there no reference to the courts? Far from that, the courts are entirely excluded.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>You take the two different people who are going to be dealt with under this clause. There is the suspect who could be an accused person. My hon. Leader has dealt with this. The point he makes is a very valid one, and the hon. Minister knows it. If this undermines the whole principle of our system of justice, of which we had every reason to be extremely proud, is it worth the results that it is going to achieve? Are we going to turn ourselves into a right-wing totalitarian country in order to combat a left-wing totalitarian threat? Are we going to have a right-wing totalitarian legal system to meet a left-wing totalitarian threat? I do not think so. If the hon. Minister could justify this, we would be able to consider it, but the hon. Minister has come here and has asked us for blanket consent. Under those circumstances can any reasonable man be a party to a clause like this, especially when the hon. Minister cannot explain it? The court is specifically excluded. No matter what happens, this is entirely in the hands of the police. I am not casting any aspersions on the police, but what happens to a man in the 90 days? What usually happens to a man when he is held for interrogation? And why is the period 90 days? Surely we are entitled to some explanation of that? Why is it 90 days? My hon. Leader referred to the section known to newspapermen where people can be brought for interrogation before a magistrate and if they do not answer satisfactorily, they can be put into gaol for eight days at a time, and so on, and so on. But, Sir. they always appear before a magistrate somewhere. And there is a very good reason for it. Why are cases remanded in our courts for 14 days at a maximum and then the accused has to be brought into the court? Why were those laws framed in 1917 and even before, and why have we kept them up to this day? For very good reasons. So that the accused will be brought before a court, and if anything has happened to him in that time, then it will be shown to the world. Mr. Chairman, the effect of this clause upon every individual, any individual, is to put him entirely in the hands of the Police Force. Not in the hands of the hon. Minister. He is not going to be in a position to know what happens in every single case. And when the hon. Minister gives his undertaking. no one will seriously dispute that the hon. Minister does not want this to work; as he has pointed out, he has a lot at stake if it does not work. But the hon. Minister is not going to be in a position to be able to look at every single case. It will be impossible for the hon. Minister to do so. Let me put a pertinent question: What will happen if a <span class="col_4861-4862" refersTo="page_1005"/>person who it is thought might be able to give evidence is beaten up? What will happen to him? Who will ever know about it? I am not saying that it is going to happen, but I think that the provisions of our law already are all directed towards this not going undetected. There is the hon. Minister of Information. How is he going to explain this clause? The hon. Minister of Justice cannot explain it to us in this House. How is the hon. Minister of Information going to explain this to the outside world? And he will have an awful lot of explaining to do! But we cannot vote for something we do not know about and as it now stands, it is completely and utterly objectionable to anyone in this House, including the hon. Minister, and I think the hon. member for Vereeniging. It ought to be at any rate. Does the hon. member for Vereeniging like this clause? Is it objectionable to him?</p>

But I am not going to enter into a discussion about something else. I am talking about this clause. The hon. Minister of Justice has said that he is not going to talk about this clause. The powers herein contained, without an explanation, can lead all reasonable men to no other conclusion but that South Africa has become in effect a police state. Are we a police state?

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I was saying before the suspension of business that this clause as it stands finds no acceptance at all on this side of the House. My hon. Leader when he spoke to this clause referred to Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and I said that that was wellknown as a section especially to newspapermen as a section in respect of which it is possible that someone is suspected of having any evidence in respect of any offence that he can be brought before the magistrate and if he does not provide the information that is required, refused to give up the information, he can then be committed to gaol for a period of eight days. At the expiry of eight days he will then be returned to the magistrate who will then again interrogate him and if he still refuses to provide the information, he can again be committed for another eight days, and this could go on <i>ad infinitum.</i> This is a provision in our law already. I think it would meet the case the hon. the Minister has in mind because the inquiry can be held at any place and it can be held without the public having access. In other words it could be held in a gaol. It can be held privately. But, Sir, it has the great advantage that those factors which I say are completely anathema in respect of this clause, to everybody, I think, in this House, will be obviated inasmuch as he will be brought before a judicial officer once every eight or nine days. So I want to move an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;and&#x201D; in line 1, on page 12, until the end of the clause,</block>

<p>which will then provide that people could be arrested if suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed &#x201C;or having intended to commit an offence under the Suppression of Communism Act, or under that Act as applied by the Unlawful Organizations Act or of sabotage, or persons who are in possession of information relating to the commission of any such offence, or the intention to commit such an offence&#x201D;. The persons in respect of whom this provision is to be applied would not be changed at all, but the rest of the provisions would be deleted, and the provisions of Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, should thereafter be applied so that from then on such a person could be interrogated privately but would every eight days have to come before a judicial officer. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;and&#x201D; in line 1, page 12. to the end of the clause and to substitute &#x201C;within 48 hours produce such person before a magistrate whereupon the provisions of Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955 (Act No. 56 of 1955), shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply as if such person had been brought before such magistrate in terms of that section&#x201D;.</block>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is of course one of the major clauses in the Bill. There is little I need add to the criticism of it voiced by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. member for Wynberg and others. It is because I agree with them so wholeheartedly that I voted against the second reading, because I belive that this clause and Clause 4 are the most important clauses in the Bill. They undermine the whole rule of law and that is repugnant to me. This clause provides for the suspension of one of the most ancient writs of law, <i>habeas corpus.</i> It means that a person may be taken time and time again for a period of 90 days for interrogation at the behest of any police officer who has some suspicion that the person might have some information which can be of assistance to the police. The Leader of the Opposition has already expressed his fears and I also have doubts as to the results of such interrogation. I want to say that police brutality is by no means a monopoly in South Africa and I think it would be stupid to deny that it does go on here because we have had enough replies given in this House to questions dealing with assaults on prisoners to know that that is the case. [Interjections.] Police brutality is found all over the world and it is ridiculous for hon. members to tell me that I should be ashamed of myself. But in a multi-racial country one should be particularly on one&#x2019;s guard against giving powers to the police, particularly where the members of the other races are voiceless as far as their political rights are concerned. I want to ask the Minister whether it has not struck him as significant that he should have been so very upset when the hon. member for Wynberg raised the issue, incorrectly, it so happens, in relation to the application of this clause to South West Africa. I am not denying that what the Minister said was correct, but what interests me is his reaction. If this is such a delicate matter that it puts the Minister into a ferment of anxiety, at the thought that anyone overseas could imagine that such a clause should be extended to South West Africa, does he not realize that that is an admission that he realizes just how bad this clause is? If it is bad for South West, it is bad for South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to continue with this theme, in spite of the threats emanating from the opposite side. I want to ask a few questions in regard to this clause, against which I will vote anyway. What provision will be made for the next-of-kin of these people who disappear for 90 days for purposes of interrogation? How is anyone to know who has been taken, how long they will be kept, and where, and what information will be given to the next-of-kin? Will anyone in higher authority immediately be notified about it? There is nothing in the clause to say that this will be so. All we know is that some police officer may decide that somebody has information which he wants to get out of him, and he can detain the man for 90 days. What provision is made for officers to notify their seniors? Will we be given the information about the number of people so held, will the names be tabled, and will the Press have access to those names, or will we get the same sort of reaction I got when I asked how many people had disappeared in the Transkei under Proclamation No. 400? This is just as drastic as Proclamation No. 400. There is no access to the courts or to any legal adviser. If this is not the sort of law which is introduced in a totalitarian country, I have yet to be shown another which shows a closer resemblance to it. I have put some specific questions to the Minister, who has disappeared, though I am sure not for 90 days, and I hope the Minister will give a reply to these questions.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would ask the Minister to give the House more information as to why the powers which already exist in the law, in Section 83, for the purpose of conducting interrogations are insufficient. I know that he has already addressed the House in reply to my leader on this point. I will say this, that the Minister has in other regards, given the House a great deal of information as to his difficulties. As was pointed out by the hon. member for Durban (North), it is so much easier for the House to understand the situation it is dealing with if we are told what the difficulties are. I ask the Minister again why Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act is insufficient, when you have power in that section to bring a person before the magistrate, to interrogate him, and if he does not reply he can be committed to prison for eight days at a time, for as long as you like. Why is that not sufficient in these circumstances?</p>

<p>To realize the stringency of this provision, one must understand what can flow from a <i>bona fide</i> error of judgment. I am not referring to <i>male fides,</i> or the misuse of power by the police. I merely base my case on a <i>bona fide</i> error of judgment by the police.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister may be aware of it, but I would like to repeat it for the sake of other hon. members. It is not only a question of the individual who might suffer injury or assault while being detained, although that is a factor, but one merely has to assume that there is a <i>bona fide</i> error of judgment, and as the result a man&#x2019;s freedom is curtailed for as long as it suits that officer. That, in itself, is enough to make one think again. To be able to deprive a man of all freedom of movement and of any access to anyone is a serious matter when it may be discovered later that it was all as the result of a genuine error of judgment. The Minister says he appreicates that, but of course the situation becomes so much more objectionable if one deals with the abuses which can and do creep into even the best disciplined organization. Those things can happen, and with the best will in the world on the part of the Minister and of the senior police officers such abuses may creep in. Our Police Force is no better or worse in that regard than any other force in the world, and these things may happen unbeknown to the Minister and the senior officers. Bearing in mind all that, and as the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) has been refused, I would like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 3, page 12, after &#x201C;interrogation&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;by a magistrate and in lines 5 and 6, to omit &#x201C;the Commissioner of the South African Police&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;such magistrate&#x201D;.</block>

<p>We are dealing with a clause which covers a wide field. It begins by saying who may detain the person concerned, then it gives the grounds upon which the person may be detained, and then it describes the sort of person who may be detained, and then it says that he may be detained for the purpose of interrogation, and then it says that he shall be interrogated until a certain individual is satisfied, but he does not say who will carry out the interrogation. One assumes it will be a police officer, because it is the police who detain him, but there is nothing to stop the Minister under the clause as it stands from appointing a magistrate to do that job. What I am asking is that there will not be a discretion for him to appoint a <span class="col_4867-4868" refersTo="page_1008"/>magistrate to do the interrogation, but that it shall be a magistrate.

<p>I believe that when the Minister rose this morning to justify the retention of this clause he spoke with conviction and that with the knowledge he has of the matter dealt with in this Bill he is convinced that he has good reason to insert this clause in the Bill but the fact remains that this clause places a very heavy responsibility on the Minister. It is a far-reaching encroachment on the ordinary rights of individuals; we cannot get away from that. I think when such far-reaching powers are given to a single person or to police officers, you have to consider carefully the abuses which may take place or how the original object you had in mind can be departed from. I want to give an example of something I personally experienced a few months ago. I had a servant who came from the platteland. After a few months he fell into bad company. One Sunday morning it appeared as though he had gone to bed very late the previous night and he boldly told me that he had been to a party of the Liberal Party where there were Whites, Coloureds and Bantu, that there was plenty of liquor and that the police arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>He boldly told me that the police arrived there and asked him for his name and address, that he told them that he was in the employ of a Member of Parliament and that they immediately let him go. I told him immediately that if that were to happen again I would immediately dismiss him which I did a few weeks later. What I have in mind here is this: Supposing he was in somebody else&#x2019;s employ and he found himself in such circumstances and that under the influence of the spirit prevailing at the party and of the people with whom he was associating there, he said certain things about his employer. Does the danger not exist that a person who lacks the necessary experience, a person who does not appreciate what the consequences of his actions may be, may perhaps act injudiciously? I want to put this to the Minister: A commandant is in charge of every police district, irrespective of his rank and every police station has a telephone. When it is necessary to take action such as envisaged in this clause &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite right. I fully understand that. It may be that the station commander at a station is not a lieutenant in which case he has to communicate with a lieutenant if such action has to be taken. He himself cannot act. What I should like to see is that it should not be possible for the lieutenant to act and that the decision should not rest with the lieutenant but that the decision to act in this way should rest with the district commandant of that police district.</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>What the Minister says is quite correct; he knows his Department. I have been at police districts where a lieutenant is in charge or where a lieutenant is acting but then it is a senior lieutenant, somebody who has more or less reached the stage where his next appointment will be that of commandant of a police district. As I have said, telephonic communication will in any case play a part, because where the station commander is not a lieutenant he will have to communicate with a lieutenant. There will be no difficulty, therefore, to communicate with the district commandant who will have to satisfy himself that such action is justified. I also think that where such action is taken, the Minister or the person authorized to act on his behalf in his office must immediately be notified of such action.</p>

<p>That happens as a matter of routine.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I think it will be good to provide for that in the Act. That will reassure many people. I think I know what the Minister has in mind. It is stated here that if such a person is detained it will be necessary for him to obtain the permission of the Minister to get legal advice. I know the panel consists of a whole list of advocates and attorneys and where this sort of case has come before a court it has been the same legal firm and the same advocate who have defended those people. Limitations have already been placed on many of them in terms of legislation which is already on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>In conformity with the arguments I have advanced I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 68, after &#x201C;1958&#x201D; where it occurs for the second time, to insert &#x201C;of a rank not lower than that of a district commandant or his deputy or his alternate and to insert the following new sub-section to follow sub-section (2):</block>

<ol>

<li>(3) Any officer as aforesaid shall immediately inform the Minister upon arresting any such person.</li>

</ol>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accept this amendment because apart from the fact that it places the responsibility of making a decision on the shoulders of a more responsible officer, a more experienced officer, it will be embodied in the Act that the Minister should immediately be informed so that he will know about it; that the danger will not exist that the person will be detained and that it will not be weeks before his application reaches the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that there are two ways whereby one can limit the rigour of this clause. The one is by causing the inquiry to be conducted by a judicial officer of some kind or another. That would be a measure of protection against possible abuse. If that effort on the part of this side of the House to limit the rigour of this clause fails, then it occurs to me that there is another method whereby the rigours of the clause can be limited, and that is if one provides for someone to have sight of the person detained; to provide some link, no matter how small and brief it may be, between that individual and the outside world. To that end it seems to me that the least one can do is to provide for access to a person by his doctor and legal adviser. It is difficult to conceive that any abuse in the eyes of the administration can creep in from a visit under control, as it would be, by a detainee&#x2019;s lawyer or doctor. After all, consider the circumstances under <span class="col_4871-4872" refersTo="page_1010"/>which those visits would be made. They would be made in the place where the person is detained&#x2014;probably in a gaol or police cell. They could be made in the presence of a police officer, but there would be that link between the individual and the outside world, between the individual and his family. He would be able to obtain advice from an independent source and his family could be reassured that although having been detained, possibly for a long time, he is still in good health and has not been ill treated in any way. Sir, this is a small thing in a clause of this nature but it does improve the clause to a slight extent. I move therefore&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 10, page 12, after &#x201C;person&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;save and except such person&#x2019;s medical or legal adviser&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It is unprecedented surely for anyone to be detained under provisions of this kind and to have no access whatever to the outside world nor for those near and dear to him to have access to him. As I said when I spoke earlier in this debate, the hon. the Minister, in spite of what he said to my leader, has not given the House reasons as to why he need go this far in this legislation, and I would ask him again to take this committee into his confidence and to explain why the existing powers are inadequate, why they fall down to meet the situation which he believes it is necessary to meet. If he were to do that, it would make the task of this committee so much easier.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member moves that two types of persons should have access to the detainee, firstly a medical practitioner. That is provided for in the regulations and it is consequently not necessary to provide for that in this measure. In the second place the hon. member asks that a legal representative, in other words, somebody who is on the roll at the moment, should be able to talk to him. The hon. member moves that knowing full well that we have already discussed that matter and that I adopted a very firm attitude. I am sorry that I have to say this of his and my colleagues but we all know that there are some legal representatives to whom I have in the past refused permission to contact restricted persons. We discussed that principle very fully and the hon. member knows it. In spite of that the hon. member moves that any legal representative should be allowed to see those people. I am going to mention certain names here and I am not apologizing for doing so. We have to be realistic and practical, Sir. If the people whom I have in mind and whom he has in mind are detained they are not going to ask to see the hon. member or the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). They are going to ask for Arenstein or for Sing or for Fehler. If they get into trouble here in Cape Town they are not going to ask for the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson); nor are they going to ask for Sen. Pilkington-Jordan. They are only going to ask for certain specific people. If they get into trouble in Johannesburg they are not going to ask for those hon. members who are lawyers or advocates or for other lawyers or advocates; there is a certain specific panel of people for whom they will ask. They are going to ask for Wolpe and for Slovo and for Braham Fisher and others. I am perfectly honest with hon. members. If the Committee forces me, and from the nature of things I am in the hands of the Committee, to accept the amendment and let those people have access to those detainees I do not even want to detain them; in that case I shall be defeating the whole object of this clause and for that reason I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member. I do not want to hide those people and that is why I want to say very clearly that I am quite prepared to accept an amendment, if it should be moved, that these people should periodically be visited by a magistrate if hon. members are afraid that I shall tamper with them or hurt them. I am quite prepared to consider such an amendment and even if such an amendment is not moved across the floor of the House, I shall in any case give instructions administratively compelling magistrates to visit these people periodically. Depending on the time available, I may, if such an amendment is not moved, even move that in the Other Place. I regret, however, that in the circumstances I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister in dealing with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) has said that he will accept an amendment making it obligatory for a magistrate or additional magistrate to visit a detainee once a week. The Minister, of course, knew that I was going to move this amendment, because he has already had a copy of the amendment to consider.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>That is why I said it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>In the circumstances I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of sub-section (2):<br/>Provided that not less than once during each week such person shall be visited in private by the magistrate or an additional or assistant magistrate of the district in which he is detained.</block>

<p>The Minister has indicated, quite rightly, that he will accept that amendment but he still refuses to allow the detainee to have his own medical practitioner or his legal adviser. I submit that the fact that in terms of the prison regulations a doctor visits the jail&#x2014;I do not know how often; I believe it is once a week&#x2014; is not sufficient. After all, the detainee may be suffering from some peculiar malady and his own medical practitioner who knows the history of the man knows what is wrong with <span class="col_4873-4874" refersTo="page_1011"/>him. It may not be just the ordinary type of illness from which he is suffering&#x2014;influenza or something of that nature. The Minister himself has said that he has seen men break down in solitary confinement. He has seen men interned during the war. He admits that it is a terrible thing to experience and bearing all that in mind, I submit that surely the least that can be done is to allow the detainee to see his own medical practitioner if he wants to do so. After all, the Minister has not told us why the detainee should not be allowed to see his own medical practitioner. He has told us why he cannot see his own lawyer. I submit that he will not have the same trouble with medical practitioners which he expects to have with certain lawyers. As far as lawyers are concerned, I submit that because the Minister does not want certain lawyers to see detainees is no reason for making it a general rule that they shall see no lawyers. The Minister has the power to prevent certain lawyers from seeing these people and he has already done that. He mentioned the name of Mr. Arenstein; I do not want to mention names. I do not want to go into the other names which he mentioned and discuss the rights or wrongs of the attitude of those other lawyers, because I do not know what the Minister knows about them, but I will just deal with one case which he mentioned, that of Mr. Arenstein. He has already barred Mr. Arenstein; he can debar him from seeing certain people as he has in fact already done, but I submit it is quite wrong for a Minister to lay down as a general principle that he will allow no lawyer to see these detainees because it appears that certain lawyers may influence these detainees in a way contrary to the wishes of the Minister. It is not necessary for them to get Mr. Arenstein or any of these other lawyers mentioned by the Minister. Recently there was a case in Umtata where two people were detained and the Minister could certainly have no objection to the lawyers who were briefed in Umtata to go and see these two people, and yet they were not allowed to see any lawyer. The lawyers had to see the police. Everything was done through the police. I hope the Minister will reconsider this question of allowing legal advisers and medical practitioners to see these detainees, because the Minister has not given adequate reasons why the medical practitioner at any rate should not be allowed to see these detainees. The medical practitioner is not going to give the detainee legal advice.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I have already indicated that I shall accept it if such an amendment is moved. Hon. members have informed me about it but because the other amendments moved had already been put, I did not know whether the amendment would be moved. I am very pleased that it has been moved because I gladly accept it. The hon. member told me that he was going to move such an amendment. It is not an idea, therefore, which has emanated from me; it emanates from the hon. member. The question of medical practitioners visiting all detainees is in the hands of the medical practitioners of the Department of Social Welfare through their district surgeons or their full-time officials. If it should be necessary for such people to see their private medical practitioners I shall not hesitate for a moment to give the necessary permission and instructions. I want to assure the hon. member that as far as this aspect of the matter is concerned I can speak from experience to some extent. I shall not allow those people to undergo what I had to undergo. Under the most difficult circumstances I was not allowed to see a dentist. I shall not let that happen to these people. I readily give that assurance to the hon. member. As far as refusing to allow lawyers to see the detainees I just want to say this: I was a lawyer in those days. I know exactly what the effect of these regulations is. I was not even allowed to discuss pending court cases which I was handling with my partner. I know, therefore the disruption it can cause and I shall consequently issue the necessary instructions. I know exactly what the responsibility is which I am taking upon my shoulders in this connection and I do not want those reproaches to be levelled at me and that is why I shall see to it&#x2014;I am prepared to stake my reputation on this&#x2014;that these things do not happen. But if I open the door as hon. members want me to open it, the horse will be out of the stable before it can be of any service to me. The hon. member for Zululand says that I have not adequately motivated my allegation that Section 83 did not give me sufficient power. Can you motivate your experience, Sir, or can you only relate it to somebody else? I did that this morning. Let me just put this question to the hon. member who was a young boy in those days. I want to tell him in advance that he will be in a dilemma, irrespective of what his reply is going to be. Section 83 is either not the answer&#x2014;and I maintain it is not&#x2014;or if it is the answer, as he says it is, my question to him is this: Were people only detained in those days in order to torture them, if Section 83 is the answer? The question is very clear. The hon. member for Zululand says it is not necessary to detain people for such a long time&#x2014;note well, Sir, I am limiting the period to 90 days. It was absolutely unlimited in those days. I say it must be a lieutenant; it was any police official in those days; I say it must be the Commissioner of Police; that is a safety valve. That safety valve did not exist in those days. Let us accept that the principle is exactly the same as it was in those days. The idea was exactly the same in those days as it is to-day; it is exactly the same. There is no difference as far as the idea is concerned. If Section 83 is the answer to-day it should also have been the answer at that time.</p>

<p>Did it exist at that time?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The relevant section has been in our law since before <span class="col_4875-4876" refersTo="page_1012"/>the rinderpest. To be quite honest it was applied in the case of a young lady, Elsa Nel, a case which was given great prominence in the newspapers. The hon. member can take it from me that that section has been in our laws since before the rinderpest.</p>

<p>My argument is this: If that was the answer&#x2014;where the idea was the same as to-day&#x2014; why was it not applied? In that case there are only two answers: It was either not the answer&#x2014;in which the argument of the hon. member falls away&#x2014;or if it was the answer at that time hon. members owe me a reply as to why people were detained at that time while the answer was there but was not used. Must we, in the interests of hon. members, simply draw a veil over it and forget about it?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories for his amendment. I gladly accept that amendment but I regret I cannot accept the other amendments.</p>

<p>I shall not quibble. The hon. the Minister told us a few minutes ago how he would use this power.

He does not want anybody to share in this responsibility though this is the greatest burden anybody can possibly carry. He, the Minister, who has the greatest measure of courage, is the only one who should be burdened with it. That is the burden of 20 statements he has made. And that is worthy of examination. Even a courageous man must realize that under this Bill, regardless of whether the Minister, in a rush of generosity, is prepared to let a magistrate see the person concerned once a week, or his doctor or his legal adviser, he is confining somebody who may be suspected, according to what may be the view of a minor police official, of having information, not of having committed an offence.</p>

<p>I think in the light of what has happened in other countries, even here, the Minister must realize what this can mean to certain groups of professional men and in certain vocations. A newspaperman, for example, might quite fortuitously hear of something which could conceivably be related to the commission of an offence. And if a police officer with the rank of lieutenant and upwards desires to do so, he can immediately commit him for 90 days. What good does it do if a magistrate sees him once a week? What good does it do if his grandfather sees him once a week? If that police officer can hold him for 90 days until he gets, what he calls a &#x201C;satisfactory&#x201D; answer? I ask the hon. the Minister to put himself in that position. He has boasted of his personal courage. Supposing that man does not know anything about the matter, but the police officer says he believes that he does, and he says: &#x201C;What I call a satisfactory answer is that you say that you do know.&#x201D; That is an impossible position, Sir. [Interjections.] All the wise guys sit on that side, Sir, and I am happy not to be there. Mr. Chairman, I want to tell you something, and it is this: One of the things that makes them terribly sensitive in this House, in fact, one of the surest ways of bringing down on one&#x2019;s head the wrath of the Minister and anybody else on that side of the House, is the very suggestion that South Africa is a police state. I am not going to say that South Africa is a police state. But I wish the hon. the Minister will explain to me what the difference is between a police state and a state in which a policeman, a lieutenant, can pick anybody off the street and say &#x201C;You come with me&#x201D;&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Under certain legislation. I said a policeman with the rank of lieutenant upwards. I realize it is a commissioned officer. Unlike some of those hon. gentlemen who say &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;, I have read this Bill, unfortunately, six times. He can say to that man: &#x201C;You come with me and you will stay here for 90 days, at least, until I get a satisfactory answer from you.&#x201D; In other words, what is the difference between a state where a police official, not even the Minister of Justice acting indirectly or the Deputy Commissioner for the particular command, can commit a man to a place of incarceration for 90 days and recommit him at the end of that period, and what you would call a police state? Can somebody on that side of the House tell me? Can one of the interjectors in the north-east corner tell me? They know everything. They must tell me so that I can dispel the fears of many people outside of this House, and the fears of some of the people in this House.</p>

<p>In the limited time that I have, I want to deal with the issue of what happened during the war. First of all, Sir, there was a war on, whether those gentlemen want to admit it or not. History records there was a war on, in fact, the greatest war in the world. History does not record or will not record at any future stage that there was a war on in South Africa at this stage. Assuming there is a war on&#x2014;which hon. members opposite do not even believe, because the Prime Minister says there is peace and order, and how can you have peace and order during a war&#x2014;how can you argue that the legislation which may have been applied 20 years ago must be applied to South Africa to-day merely because it was applied 20 years ago? What kind of logic is there in that argument? We have just been told about something which happened before the &#x201C;rinderpest&#x201D;. Do you always want to go back 20, 30 or 50 years ago? With great respect to the Minister: I do not stand back for anybody in this country in admiration for his personal courage, but courage has nothing to do with liberty of the individual. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that apart from those few hundred people who may or who may not be affected by this clause, there are 16,000,000 people in South Africa who have nothing to do with this clause, and never will have. The liberty of the individual is far greater than the personal courage of any one of us.</p>

<p><span class="col_4879-4880" refersTo="page_1014"/>Mr. Chairman, if you were to consider the effects of this particular clause of the Bill, I think you would rightly come to the conclusion that the Minister should give every possible consideration to such amendments as have been moved and such amendments that may be moved from this side, for the very reason that he says he realizes the terrible responsibility that this puts on his shoulders. For that reason, Sir, he should say: &#x201C;If you can find a way of assuring me that those people who can reasonably be involved as regards the possession of information and the commission of an offence under these laws can be questioned, etc. I shall give way with my Clause 17.&#x201D; If he does that, then a different situation might possibly arise. But with every amendment, except one so far, the Minister has said in effect: &#x201C;I cannot accept that; I want to carry this on my own shoulders.&#x201D; Let me say in conclusion that I hope the Minister will explain, although he has been good enough to accept this one amendment, what the function of the magistrate &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

He told us that because a condition prevailed at the time which the then Government regarded as a crisis. The then Government then thought that there were people who wanted to overthrow the Government by force. [Interjections.] I say, in the opinion of the then Government.

<p>That is precisely what the position was. Because the then Government regarded the Minister as a danger to internal order the Government took certain steps and what were those steps: Those steps were to lock him up for an unlimited time without trial; without laying a charge against him. If the then Government argued at the time that that was the way they should treat such people, and if hon. members approve of it that that was the way in which the then Government should have acted with the hon. the Minister and other White people, why do they refuse to approve of it that that should happen to Sobukwe? Why do they refuse to approve of it that that should happen to Mandela? As long as they were their political opponents they were quite prepared to give all those powers to Jan Smuts. Now that it is Sobukwe and that type of person they refuse to give those powers to this Minister. That was the only reason why the Minister referred to what had happened to him during the war. The Opposition are adopting this illogical attitude: If they think our internal security is in danger they are prepared to give all the powers. The hon. member for Yeoville even went so far as to say that the Minister should not ask for these powers; he should do what General Smuts did namely he should do what he likes. He must lock up people and ban them from the country and the only thing he should then do is to ask Parliament for indemnification. That is how they want to deal with a crisis. That is how they want to deal with people who want to overthrow the <span class="col_4881-4882" refersTo="page_1015"/>Government by force. Now that the Minister is asking for far less powers they are making all this fuss; now they are trying to create all this suspicion against the country. We have the evidence, evidence which they have accepted, and that is the evidence of Judge Snyman to the effect that the position is serious. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) asked me whether a state of emergency existed. Of course there is not a state of emergency. What did Judge Snyman say? He said that there were certain people in the country, the Poqo movement and other movements, which were trying hard to create a state of emergency and that if the Minister did not act they would create that stage of emergency. The Opposition has no ground whatsoever, therefore, to oppose this clause.</p>

<p>Before I call upon the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) to address the Committee, I just wish to point out that I have allowed a very wide discussion on this clause, but hon. members must now advance new arguments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister, in reply to the point which I raised the last time I spoke, made play of the fact that there were certain legal practitioners who, according to his information, held views which were undesirable and conducted themselves in a manner which was undesirable. I have not the information which the hon. the Minister has in that regard. One hears stories, Sir, but I do not believe that one can rely simply on stories. Even accepting what the hon. the Minister says in that regard, it is difficult to see how, when one or other of these people, such as a doctor of a lawyer, is visiting a prisoner in a room together with a warden or a police constable and a conversation takes place in the presence of such a person, any damage can be done. It is very difficult to see that. To meet the situation which the hon. the Minister finds objectionable in that regard I wish to move a further amendment.</p>

<p>With leave of the Committee, the amendment proposed by Mr. Cadman was withdrawn.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I then move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 10, page 12, after &#x201C;person&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;save and except his medical or legal adviser not himself being a restricted person&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of this amendment is as follows, that the detained person will have a right to see his doctor or his lawyer provided the doctor or lawyer is not a person restricted under one or other piece of legislation such as the Unlawful Organizations Act, the Suppression of Communism Act or any similar Act. It would specifically rule out the type of legal adviser to whom the Minister has an objection.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that when the hon. the Minister says that he has experienced the discomfort of not being able to see medical and legal advisers and that for that reason he will not allow it to take place under his administration, he means every word that he says. But, Sir, the hon. the Minister is the head of a vast organization. He cannot possibly know what is going on at all levels of that organization. It simply cannot be done. With all the experience that he has had, with all the good will in the world, he cannot ensure that what he desires should be done, will be done. That can only be safeguarded if the detained person has a right to see the persons of his choice with the limitation that he may not see banned persons. That is what it amounts to. So I do ask the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment because I believe that it removes the difficulty which he formerly had. It gives a right to a detained person to see his doctor or his lawyer provided neither of those people is a banned person.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister must realize, as he probably does, that you arc not dealing here with people who have committed an offence necessarily; you are dealing with people whom an official believes has knowledge; he has done nothing wrong; but whom an official believes has knowledge which may assist in the solving of a crime. Surely that man has a right to be entitled to see the persons I have mentioned, not that a privilege be granted him, not that regulations be made to accommodate him in that regard but that he has a right to see these people. Not only for the purpose <span class="col_4883-4884" refersTo="page_1016"/>that the relations, the wife and family of the person that may be detained, will be informed, but I can also not stress sufficiently that the person who may be detained may well have done nothing wrong at all. In those cicumstances surely there can be no objection to his seeing a doctor or a lawyer, provided that those persons are not banned, etc.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to Section 83? I will be delighted to reply to that. The hon. Minister&#x2019;s reply was that Section 83 has been in the Act since 1917. Quite correct. He continued that the United Party Government during the war found that that was inadequate. Otherwise why would they have taken the additional powers which they did under the Emergency legislation? The Minister said that I was a small boy at the time. That is not quite correct, but we will let that pass. But what does the Minister&#x2019;s answer amount to? It amounts to this: The United Party Government was not satisfied with Section 83. They took additional powers. But the hon. Minister does not say why Section 83 was inadquate then and why it is inadequate now. His answer amounts to this that because the United Party Government 20 years ago took powers that were more than they needed, therefore he must take unnecessary powers now.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that Section 83 is adequate for the situation which we know now. I do not know what the difficulties were that faced a wartime government. I have not read the legislation of that time and I do not know the facts of that time, I have no knowledge of events at that time. But I will say this, that so far as I can judge: If the United Party Government then faced a situation such as the Minister faces now, then Section 83 would have been sufficient. But I must say this also that I believe, and I think it is accepted all round, that in time of war, as was then the case, problems cropped up far in excess of the problems with which we are faced now. It is accepted that we are not in a state of war. We have what is called a cold war. There are difficulties which require emergency legislation of some sort or another. But I present this squarely to the hon. Minister: He has not yet, in all fairness, told the House why Section 83 is not sufficient. He has quoted an example of where a previous government took further powers. But that may have been quite unnecessary. And certainly on the knowledge of the facts which we have now, and the knowledge which we have of the provisions of Section 83, it seems on what the Minister has told us, that those powers are at the present time perfectly sufficient, and I say again that the hon. Minister has not answered the question as to why those powers are not sufficient now.</p>

<ol>

<li>(5) No confession obtained from any person pursuant to the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be admissible in evidence against him.</li>

</ol>

<p>The amendment would prevent evidence obtained by questioning under this section to be used against a person interrogated should a trial of that person follow. That would give effect to the present position in regard to any questioning that may take place under our criminal code, because where in fact answers are elicited by question and answer, the courts will disallow that as evidence. We have got to ask whether there is any need for the change that is sought in this present position? In the first place I quote the fact that the powers under Section 83 are still there. But in addition the hon. Minister when he brought forward his arguments for justifying this particular clause made it clear what his purpose was, namely to obtain evidence from the lower ranks of subversive bodies in order to enable him to track down the higher ranks. Consequently there would be no need to use the evidence that he obtained from the lower <span class="col_4885-4886" refersTo="page_1017"/>ranks against such lower ranks, but only against the higher ranks. If the hon. Minister accepts the amendment of mine, it will leave him with the power which he has sought to justify and for which he has made a certain case, but it would eliminate the side-effect which he did not suggest was necessary, and which I suggest therefore he could dispense with. Consequently I move the amendment to that effect.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (4) and to substitute the following new sub-section:</block>

<ol>

<li>(4) The provisions of this section shall only be brought into operation by the State President by proclamation in the Gazette if he is satisfied that the security of the State requires such action on his part, and shall continue in operation only for  as long as the State President deems it necessary for the purpose of maintaining the security of the State: Provided that when the State President is satisfied that the provisions of this section are no longer required to maintain the security of the State he shall suspend the operation of any proclamation issued under this sub-section.</li>

</ol>

<p>I am asking that that sub-section be substituted for the present sub-section (4) which merely provides that the State President may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> suspend the operation of the provisions in sub-section (1) for a definite or indefinite period. Sub-section (1) is the particular sub-section in this clause which we are dealing with, the power of a commissioned officer of police to take a person into custody, to hold him for 90 days, in communicado, and to question him, until he answers to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of the S.A. Police. Now the hon. Minister in dealing with this particular matter said in reply to a question put by my Leader that he did not propose that this legislation should be permanent legislation. He was dealing with Clause 17 when he said that. He did not anticipate it being permanent legislation and that the State President could issue a proclamation suspending it from time to time and it could also be reimposed. But it was not to be permanent legislation. My amendment seeks merely to make clear what may be assumed from subsection (4) as printed, but may I say in that regard that I realize that when the state feels that it is threatened, any state, it will take extraordinary powers from time to time. I recognize that, and as to how far those powers should go may well be a matter of sincere argument. It is not a matter of throwing bricks at each other, but it could be a matter of sincere argument. The one side may say &#x201C;That is as far as you should go&#x201D;, and the other side may say &#x201C;That is not far enough, we think you should go thus far&#x201D;. That I accept. The point I want to make here is that that can be a legitimate cause of discussion and difference of opinion because the state is acting <i>bona fide</i> in regard to the safety of the state. Those are the words that I want to emphasize &#x201C;safety of the state&#x201D;. So in this amendment I lay emphasis on that particular point that the State President&#x2014; I take it that he would be advised by the Executive Council, or the Minister concerned&#x2014;nevertheless would apply his mind to the precise position as to whether the safety of the state was still endangered, and if he felt that the safety of the state was no longer endangered, he would withdraw by proclamation this particular Clause 17 that we are dealing with, and so long as the safety of the state was no longer endangered it would remain in abeyance, retaining the right, presumably, for a repro-clamation to take place if and when circum-stances should arise again when he felt that the state was in danger.</p>

<p>Without the slightest doubt the essence of what the hon. member wants us to accept now is contained <span class="col_4887-4888" refersTo="page_1018"/>in sub-section (4) of Clause 17. What does the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment say? It says that this clause shall only be brought into operation by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> if he is satisfied that the security of the State requires such action on his part. In other words, the hon. member now visualizes and wants us to accept this Bill but to post-pone it to a date to be announced by the State President.</p>

<p>This clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, this clause. The hon. member knows that constitutionally the State President can only act on the advice of the Cabinet, of the Executive and this is an Executive measure. It is not my measure, it is a Cabinet measure. In other words, looking at it from whatever angle one likes, whether one agrees with it or not makes no difference at all to the principle, namely, that the Cabinet under existing circumstances feels, rightly or wrongly that the security of the State requires such action. If the Cabinet was not satisfied about that, this Bill would not have come before the House because it is a Cabinet measure. So there the hon. member for South Coast and I are in full agreement, and this Bill naturally, can only become law if and when the State President approves of it. In other words, the only difference now between the hon. member for South Coast and myself is that he wants the Cabinet in another document, not in the Bill, to advise the State President that the security of the State demands that this measure should be applied, instead of letting Parliament say that to the State President and the State President then signing the Bill.</p>

<p>Where does Parliament say that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>By passing the Bill. Parliament says that there is such a state. The Cabinet has already decided, and the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision if the Bill is passed is endorsed by Parliament, and the State President signs the Bill. So there is no disagreement between the hon. member and myself whatsoever as far as the first part of his amendment is concerned.</p>

<p>Then as far as the second part is concerned, &#x201C;provided that when the State President is satisfied that the provisions of this section are no longer required to maintain the security of the State, he shall suspend the operation of any proclamation issued under this sub-section.&#x201D; That is exactly what the sub-section says: The State President may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> suspend the operation of the provisions of sub-section (1) for a definite or indefinite period. In other words, frankly as I see it, if it were not for that provision, I would accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment because I know what his attitude is. But I say that sub-section (4) says exactly, although not in so many words, but in essence and in principle, what the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment tries to imply, and therefore if I do not accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, it is not because I disagree with him at all; I think he is perfectly right, but I say that it is already contained in sub-section (4).</p>

<p>As far as the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) is concerned, viz. &#x201C;that no confession obtained from any person pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), shall be admitted in evidence against him&#x201D;, I think the hon. member is conversant with the law regarding confessions, and I have every reason to think that it is perfectly clear that we can safely leave that for the courts to decide if and when it ever crops up. I do not think his amendment is necessary at all. This is a matter not for the Minister to decide or anybody else, but only for the courts whether or not any confession is admissible, and under those circumstances, I think it best to leave well alone and to leave it to the courts to decide.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I hesitate to participate in an argument between the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. Minister, but it does seem there have been cases when the next of kin have not known, particularly during the emergency, and I think not so long ago there was the case of a man alleged to have been kidnapped in Basutoland, and who was lost from the point of view of all countries for a considerable time, rightly or wrongly. I think perhaps the hon. the Minister might give this matter further consideration.</p>

<p>I want to speak first of all to the amendment put by the hon. member for South Coast. The hon. Minister has suggested that there is no difference between the Minister&#x2019;s point of view and the point of view of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I beg to differ, Sir. I think the question is: Which is the rule and which is the exception. Under the Minister&#x2019;s legislation the exception is that this clause will not be in operaton; under the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast the exception is that it will be in operation. That is a very fundamental difference from the point of view of the permanent law of our country. The Minister earlier on was at issue with me on what was a part of the permanent law of our country and what was not. Here the Minister makes it a part of the permanent law unless suspended by the State President in exceptoinal cases. The hon. member for South Coast wants to make it something that is only applied in exceptional cases. Quite frankly in the interest of the good name of this country&#x2014;and if the hon. Minister feels that there is no difference really between them (I think there is)&#x2014;I think he would be well advised to reconsider the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast. The big difference is between what is the normal law of the country and what will be applied in exceptional circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Looking at it from a practical point of view, is it not rather an academic difference?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not academic. Here Parliament is being asked to decide on very inadequate evidence from the hon. Minister that exceptional measures must be applied, not even recommended by the Commission. But the hon. Minister is prepared to take powers to advise the State President to suspend it from time to time. We wish to advise the State President that if he is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, then for a short period he can apply this law, but we expect him immediately these circumstances change to suspend its operaton and that then we should get back to normal law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Surely the State President only acts on the advice of the Cabinet. It is purely academic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not. I do not know how I can put it to the Minister more plainly; one is the general rule of law and the other is the exception. The general rule is that there should not be powers of this kind, that they should only be applied in exceptional circumstances. That is what the hon. member for South Coast wants. What the Minister wants is that these rules should be applied as a general rule and they should only be suspended in exceptional circumstances. What he is saying to the world is that only in exceptional circumstances the law would not be applied. Surely that is not the impression he want to create or we want to see created.</p>

<p>The second point I want to raise concerns this question of confessions. The hon. Minister here also took the line that that was a purely academic argument and I was inclined to agree with him, but fortuitously, I was browsing through one of the measures the Minister has introduced into this House but which we have not yet had before us, the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill, Bill No. 68 of 1963, and I refer the hon. Minister to Clause 26 and when I read that in view of what we are doing here, then, Mr. Chairman, I get frightened, because here is what this clause says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In determing the admissibility as evidence in any criminal proceedings of a statement made by the accused at any time to a peace officer, the fact that the peace officer did not caution the accused that he is not obliged to say anything, or to reply to any question, and that anything he may say, be used in evidence against him, shall not be taken into consideration by the court.</block>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I accept that, but we are worried because of the situation that may arise under this new legislation, read with the old legislation, quite apart from our worries under the old legislation. To come back to the amendment itself, I would like to ask the hon. Minister to consider that again. He has had some of the experiences I have had and he knows the dangers of accepting anything which is made by way of confession under circumstances of that kind. He has told us to-day that he did not want confessions. What he wanted were the facts. Well, Sir, if he is genuine in that (I think he is), if that is really what he wants, namely information and not confessions, then surely, he can accept this amendment without in any way damaging his Bill, or limiting the scope of what he wants. But it will give this security that when under pressure of that kind an accused person, or a suspect, makes what amounts to a confession, it cannot be used against him. That is a real safeguard. I think it is something worthwhile considering and it is something that the hon. Minister should consider in relation to this clause. You see. Sir, we don&#x2019;t like this clause and we made no bones about it. The Minister knows it, but at the same time in the interest of the country, we have tried to offer him amendments, we have tried to promote constructive discussions on this clause in an attempt to see if we could do away with its worst features even though it may not be acceptable to us in principle. I believe here is one of those respects in which the Minister could ameliorate the possible dangerous effects of this clause, in a manner which might do much to set the public mind at rest, to set public opinion at rest, both here and overseas. I should like the Minister to consider that carefully. If he says he is not asking for confessions but only for information, then surely he can rule that no confession made by a man who is under detention in this way should be admissible in any court.</p>

<p>The hon. member is the first and only man to doubt my personal integrity. I would have respected him if the hon. member had admitted having said this but he did not do so. I want to make it perfectly clear simply for the sake of the record&#x2014;so that it can be recorded in Hansard&#x2014;that I have no personal motives in connection with this matter and I take it that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will accept my statement on behalf of his party. As far as the hon. member for Hospital is concerned, he should not make accusations of that nature against anyone. That hon. member ought to regard the mere fact that he sits in this House as such a great privilege that he should never again make accusations against anyone.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, I cannot agree with him that the proposed legislation to which he referred affects the matter in any way. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of the fact that the intention of this legislation is to bring the position into conformity with the position on the Continent and in Britain. This set of rules, the Judges&#x2019; rules, which do not have the force of law, have never been approved of by Parliament. They do not exist on the Continent of Europe, in Britain or in America.

I am pleased that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me that although we have the same position in Britain that we will now have here if this legislation is passed&#x2014;and our law of evidence in respect of confessions is the same as the British law of evidence &#x2026;</p>

But up to the present we have been compelled to follow the British law of evidence.

<p>The composition of over population is different but a principle is not affected by the composition of the population. The courts will not admit any confession if there is the slightest suggestion that that confession was obtained by means of threats or violence. In that case no problem can arise. If the accused says: &#x201C;I did not make that confession voluntarily; these people detained me for 90 days and bullied me into making it&#x201D;, do hon. members think for one moment that the court will admit that confession? Certainly not. Then there is no problem at all. Because I do not see the dangers that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition sees, I am unfortunately unable to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Then there is the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I am prepared to keep an open mind in this regard and to reconsider it if great value is attached to it. I cannot accept it now and I cannot promise to accept it but because I respect the hon. member I am prepared to consider it. I still maintain that it is purely academic because the fact remains that the Government feels that the present position is one which justifies this course. That is why we are starting the ball rolling by way of an Act of Parliament. But like the hon. member the Government is also aware of the fact that a time may come when we may want to remove this Act from the Statute Book to show that it is not a permanent part of our legislation, and that is why provision is being made for it to be deproclaimed and if a similar position arises at some later stage, then it can again be proclaimed. We shall understand one another better once that is conceded. Let us imagine that the position changes and that the Act is deproclaimed and that another position arises which compels us to proclaim the Act once again, then the hon. member for South Coast and I will be in exactly the same position; we shall then start at the same place&#x2014;in other words the State President will issue a proclamation to the effect that a state of emergency exists&#x2014;because there will not have been one for some time&#x2014;and these regulations will then have to be put into operation again.

I appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s undertaking that he will reconsider his attitude to that amendment and I deal with it merely to refer to some of the points raised by the Minister in order to assist him in seeing the matter in the light in which we on this side of the House are trying to put it to him.</p>

<p>I think the difference between our point of view and that of the Minister is this: As the clause stands at present &#x2026;</p>

<p>What section are you referring to?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to the whole of Clause 17. The amendment provides that the clause shall come into operation only when proclaimed by the State President, whereas sub-section (4) as it reads at present says that the State President may from time to time suspend its operation. The difference is this: If the clause is passed as it stands, with the present sub-section (4), the other subsections (1) to (3) will become part of the permanent law of the land and the operation of those sub-sections will continue as part of the permanent law of the land until suspended. If our amendment is accepted, the effect will be that sub-sections (1) to (3) will not come into operation and therefore will not become the law of the land until proclaimed by the State President in the <i>Gazette.</i> There is also another difference which is important, namely, that in terms of (4) as it reads now the State President is not obliged to suspend the operation of the clause. It says he may do so, whereas in terms of our amendment he is obliged to suspend the proclamation under certain circumstances, namely, if he is satisfied that the security of the State no longer requires it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<p>That is purely for constitutional reasons.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>From the practical point of view, the Minister may rightly say that it is purely for constitutional reasons, but quite apart from that consideration, there is <span class="col_4895-4896" refersTo="page_1022"/>the other consideration mentioned by the hon. member for South Coast and by my hon. leader, viz. the attitude of the public and of the outside world to this clause. I suggest that anything which may remove the emphasis from this clause becoming part of the permanent law of the land would assist in allaying the objections which people have to this clause. I do not need to emphasize this. The Minister has himself conceded that it is a very drastic clause. I hope the Minister will not take it amiss of me if I suggest that under those circumstances, when one is dealing with such a drastic provision, I would have thought that the approach towards amendments should be to accept such amendments as lessen the drastic nature of the clause or the outlook towards this clause provided that the teeth of the clause are not removed and that the object which the Minister wishes to achieve remains. I believe that by accepting the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast the Minister will not in any way tie his hands, while providing reasonable safeguards. While I am on my feet, I wish to move a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following new sub-section at the end of the clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(5) The provisions of this section shall lapse on 30 June 1964.</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not wish to say much about it. It is similar to the amendment which the Minister accepted in regard to Clause 4, save that in regard to that amendment there was the further condition that the operation of the clause may from time to time by resolution of the House of Assembly be extended for a period not exceeding 12 months. This amendment is moved in this form because of the fact that this clause is so drastic. If this is going to be part of the law of the land, it ought to be for a limited period only.</p>

<p>Up to now this Bill has been discussed mostly by the legal men on this side of the House, and they did so very ably. I want to put another aspect to the Minister in all sincerity. We may accept the Bill as being fairly divided into two sections, on the one hand the clause we are dealing with now and certain other measures of that nature, and on the other the portions of the Bill which embody the recommendations of Judge Snyman. It is clear that in that last aspect there may be differences of opinion as to the particular methods adopted, but we are in agreement as to the necessity for those clauses. But Clause 17 falls outside the scope of the recommendations of Judge Snyman. The Minister, however, feels that powers of this nature are necessary in the circumstances. Sir, I want to make this suggestion. We have spent quite a lot of time debating whether or not there can be any relaxation of this Clause 17 and I believe that the House would make much more progress towards giving the Minister the authority he needs <i>(vide</i> the Commission&#x2019;s Interim Report), if it were not for this Clause 17. I want to make what might be an unusual suggestion. You, Sir, with the knowledge at your disposal, feel that it is imperative for the safety of the country that a measure of this sort should go on to the Statute Book as soon as possible. My leader has made it clear that, with the exceptions I have mentioned, we are prepared to support the Minister. An unusual situation exists in the country and I think sometimes unusual difficulties can be resolved by unusual methods. I want to suggest to the Minister to give serious consideration to the withdrawal of Clause 17 from this Bill, and to let us deal with the rest of the Bill, which gives the Minister the bulk of the powers he wants. Then if the Minister feels that Clause 17 is also vital for the successful carrying out of his functions, let him introduce that particular cause in the form of a separate Bill. At the moment that clause undoubtedly stands in the way of the passing of the Bill. I make that suggestion as one who has only one motive, and that is for us to do the best we can for our country. All of us have inherited a certain respect for the law and you cannot uproot those things in five minutes. Whilst this particular clause may be necessary, it is so fundamentally different, so foreign to what we have always accepted as being one of the basic principles of the law of the land that it is unacceptable to us. I ask the Minister to give consideration to this suggestion I have made.</p>

<p>I do not for one moment doubt the sincerity of the hon. member, and if this particular clause happened to be the first clause of a long Bill there would have been substance in his suggestion that I should reconsider it. But this happens to be the second-last clause of the Bill, and we have devoted practically the whole day to discussing this particular clause and, candidly, I see no point in taking it out now that we have practically arrived at the end of the discussion of the Bill, and then to have the whole discussion over again later. I want the hon. member to accept that I am equally sincere, but after all I can judge best as far as this problem is concerned because it is my baby and I have to work with it every day. So I can best judge whether in the circumstances it is necessary to have this clause, and the hon. member knows what I said about this clause myself. I need the clause at this stage, and I deliberately say it&#x2014;at this stage. It may not be necessary to have it next year, but I give the hon. member my personal assurance that it is necessary now. This is the psychological moment to have this power, as I see my problem, and that is why I incorporated it into the Bill, well knowing that if I had only come with the recommendations of the Snyman Commission the Bill would have had an easy passage and would probably have been passed by now. But I had to risk it because I have to have these powers now. Therefore I am afraid I cannot take it any further. I can only give the hon. member the assurance that that is the position.</p>

<p>I have pointed out to the hon. member that that principle was accepted by Parliament last year, and I therefore could not understand why in spite of that the hon. member moved that amendment again. He knows as well as I do that whereas his amendment now says that restricted persons cannot have access to this particular individual, there are others who are not necessarily restricted. Unfortunately the position is that we cannot allow people who cannot be trusted to have access to such a person.</p>

<p>Supposing you detained a man and questioned him; naturally when questioning him you must give him certain information, by implication if not directly. If you ask him a question concerning this book, for example, naturally at some stage or other he must know that this book is in question. You cannot ask him questions about the book without mentioning a book or books. Supposing he has an accomplice outside and he passes on the message to that accomplice, &#x201C;Beware of this, that, or the other thing&#x201D;. You would thereby be destroying the very evidence that you are trying to collect. I do not know whether I am making myself clear, but you can destroy the very thing that you do not want to have destroyed under any circumstances, by the mere passing of information, and that is the sole reason for this provision. Not only in this country but in Britain&#x2014;and I repeat in Britain&#x2014;that is the sole reason why people were held in communicado in Britain in spite of the fact that the <i>Times</i> pretends not to know anything about it. That is the reason why in this country on more than one occasion in the past people were held in communicado. Sir, I make no bones about it: I am not trying to steal a march on hon. members. I am putting my cards on the table. I want this information under the existing circumstances and judging from the experience of everybody concerned with this issue, this is the best way under the existing circumstances.

<p>There are one or two questions I would like to ask the Minister in regard to people who will be detained under this measure if it becomes law. The Minister has already indicated, and I am very happy to hear it, that the next-of-kin will be advised if a man is detained under this section. That is an important statement and we welcome it. What I want to know from the hon. the Minister is what is going to happen to the families of these people if they are married and what is going to happen to the pay which they would have received during the period of detention if they had not been detained? What provision will be made to ensure that the man&#x2019;s job will not be in jeopardy? What provision will be made to ensure that he will not be ejected from his house if he cagnot pay his rental? In other words, what compensation will there be for this man if it is proved to the Minister that he is in genuine employment; that he has been deprived of the opportunity of earning a livelihood? How is his family going to live? Will the Government see to it that his employer pays him or will the Government pay him?</p>

<p>In regard to the points raised by the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) at the time of the emergency in 1960 I happened to be as the hon. member knows, Deputy Minister of Social Welfare. Certain regulations were then promulgated by me to meet the conditions that then existed and to make provision for all sorts of possibilities and probabilities, and those regulations still exist to-day and will naturally be invoked to assist in matters of this kind.

<p>I am sorry. I should have replied to that. The reason why I cannot accept that amendment is because in essence provision is made in subsection (4) that this particular section may lapse before that date. I think it would certainly be in conflict with the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) should I consider accepting that amendment. But I am faced with a further difficulty. I am not making a point of it; I merely want to point out in passing that the Opposition has made it difficult for me, even if it was possible (and it is not possible) to accept that amendment because I accepted a similar amendment from the Opposition to Clause 4 and then the Opposition voted against the clause, as amended at their request. That makes it rather awkward for me, but apart from that it is not necessary in the circumstances to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment because this section will lapse as soon as there is no need for it.</p>

As I understand it a person could, as a defence against a charge of being on a protected area, say that he was unaware of the fact that such an area was a protected area. I see no provision in this particular clause for that. I should also like the hon. the Minister to tell us whether he does not think he goes a little far in his indemnity in sub-section (8).</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I moved an amendment during the Committee Stage which I want to move now in a slightly different form in pursuance of the objections of the hon. the Minister which I think are fairly well-founded. The amendment that I now want to move as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Clause 4, to add the followong provisos at the end of the proposed paragraph <i>(a)bis</i> inserted by paragraph (a):<br/>Provided that the Minister shall not exercise his powers under this paragraph unless he has first consulted with a committee to be appointed by the Minister consisting of a Judge of the Supreme Court, or a former Judge nominated by the Chief Justice, a magistrate of the district in which the prisoner in respect of whom the notice is to be issued lives and a senior police officer: Provided further that if the committee does not concur in any notice issued by the Minister under this paragraph, the committee shall forthwith draft a report setting out its reasons for such disagreement, and the Minister shall lay such report upon the Tables of the Senate and the House of Assembly within fourteen days of the receipt of the report if Parliament is then in session or, if Parliament is not in session, within fourteen days of the commencement of the next session of Parliament.</block>

<p>I moved a similar amendment during the Committee Stage and although the hon. the Minister said that he could understand the motive behind the amendment and was favourably disposed towards it he also said that there were certain practical difficulties. One of the difficulties he mentioned was the fact that he would have to discuss the matter with the Bench to ascertain whether a Judge would be available for this purpose. I am now making it possible for him to appoint an ex-judge and so that difficulty falls away.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to take up too much of the time of the House in regard to this amendment. It is quite clear that we want to give the hon. the Minister the power that he is asking for; he retains all the powers that are asked for in the original Bill.</p>

<p>How do you think that the Minister will be able to follow that procedure before Friday?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister will have no trouble if he has someone in mind, and I understand that he has. If the Minister wants to detain that person for a longer period, I think it will be easy for him to find some way to detain that person from next Friday until this committee is appointed. I think that the hon. the Minister will agree that there are ways in which he can detain such a person, in any case, for a reasonable period. I think the hon. the Minister of Transport must accept the fact that the hon. the Minister of Justice knows more about these matters than the hon. the Minister of Transport. I think that the hon. the Minister of Justice will find some way of detaining that person.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the responsibility for imprisoning a person for practically his entire life, without trial, is a tremendous responsibility for one Minister to bear. I do not think that this Minister or any other Minister will abuse these very far-reaching powers that can have such far-reaching results. This amendment is not intended to hamper the hon. the Minister in maintaining the security of the State. I want hon. members to understand well that this is an honest effort to assist the hon. the Minister but nevertheless to ensure that at the same time the matter is not left to the judgment of one single person. As the hon. the Minister said, it is true that in any case he always acts on the advice of his Department. But, Sir, human beings are fallible. The Minister is fallible. Let me indicate how easily things go wrong within a Department. A little while ago the hon. the Minister named a person a communist, a person who had never been a communist; in reality he was a member of the Nationalist Party. And what was more, that person was already dead!</p>

<p>But when the list was published for the first time, that person was no longer alive. It is possible that that sort of thing can happen. I am not blaming the hon. the Minister personally. I say again that this is a tremendous responsibility for only one Minister to bear. I want to make it easier for him and that is why I am moving this amendment. It does not deprive him of any of his powers. Why does the hon. the Minister now want to adopt the attitude that we are trying to hamper him through the medium of this amendment? Actually we want to help him. We must at least show the world that he is not a Minister who assumes powers by means of which he can detain a person for his entire lifetime simply upon his own judgment. Even if he does not agree with the committee he still has the right to imprison that person for life. All that he then has to do is to tell this House: &#x201C;The committee did not agree with me but nevertheless I considered it to be in the interests of the security of the State to imprison that person for life.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you will appreciate the reasonableness of this amendment. Even the hon. the Minister appreciated its <span class="col_4907-4908" refersTo="page_1028"/>reasonableness although he did have some practical objections to it. To my mind his most important objection was the fact that he had not consulted the Bench. That difficulty has now been eliminated.</p>

<p>The reply that I want to give the hon. member once again is the reply that I gave him during the second reading debate through the medium of the letter from Mr. Justice Snyman [Translation.]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another point that I want to mention is that of the onus of proof in cases where the safety of the State is at stake. It is an established and salutory requirement of our law of evidence under common law that in criminal cases no person can be found guilty of a crime unless the State is able to prove his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt.</block>

<p>He goes on to say [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The effect of this onus of proof under our criminal law may therefore be that no steps can be taken against persons who are in all probability involved in plots against the State, and yet such persons may in all likelihood be engaged in trying to overthrow the authority of the State and to jeopardize the lives of its citizens. In my opinion the law-giver must consider whether some procedure <span class="col_4909-4910" refersTo="page_1029"/>cannot be evolved to combat subversive activities of this nature outside of the ordinary criminal processes.</block>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Clause 17, to omit all the words after &#x201C;and&#x201D; in line 1, page 12, to the end of the clause and to substitute &#x201C;within 48 hours produce such person before a magistrate whereupon the provisions of Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955 (Act No.56 of 1955), shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply as if such person had been brought before such magistrate in terms of that section&#x2026;</block>

<p>The effect of the amendment will be that the same class of persons can be detained for interrogation as is presently the position. They can be detained by the police, but from then on the provisions of the law already existing in relation to interrogations will have effect. The effect of this clause is merely to provide that interrogations will be safeguarded nevertheless if my amendment is accepted, and I want to say if this amendment is not accepted, the hon. Minister of Justice will be responsible&#x2014;and I use a phrase that is frequently used by him&#x2014;that South Africa will stink in the nostrils of the world.</p>

<p>This amendment will put this power on a basis acceptable in the Western World. I want to remind the hon. the Minister of Lands who was the first to shout very loudly at the time in Committee when a similar amendment was moved and rejected and leave was asked to have an instruction; and I would like to remind him of what he said about democracy. He was one of the stars of the Sabotage Film too, and the Minister said that it was a very fine instrument, a delicate instrument which had to be very finely played, and one had to know how to play it. I want to say that this is not the way he played that instrument, this is not the instrument he used, this is not the instrument he used to play that instrument, this is not the strumming he used to get any tones out of that instrument inasmuch as it is a democracy. Sir, I think not only will it play discords, but it will break the very cords which will make the noise of democracy in that instrument.</p>

<p>The effect of this is that a person who is mentioned in the clause as it stands and detained by a police officer, brought before the court, the magistrate, and dealt with under that section, provides that if he does not give the answers which I required of him in the interrogatory, he can be put in gaol for eight days at a time indefinitely until he answers the questions satisfactorily. If that is not what the hon. Minister wants, then I am afraid my suspicions in relations to this clause are even greater than they were before. If the hon. Minister won&#x2019;t accept this, then the hon. Minister has not told this House why he wants this clause, and no one in this House, I believe, should vote for this clause if the hon. Minister cannot say to this House why it is he wants them kept <i>in communicado</i> in a manner which, as I say, will create in the eyes of the world the worst possible image that South Africa can have.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with a clause which provides for interrogation, and the question arises as to who is best qualified in the interests both of the hon. the Minister and the police to conduct the interrogation. Now one of the tasks which is placed upon the police is to provide evidence which will solve the commission of an offence and bring the offender to justice. That is one of their tasks, and in circumstances such as pertain in South Africa at present, that is very often a particularly difficult task. Another of the duties of the police in cirsumstances such as presently pertain entails their dealing with difficult, violent and rough behaviour on the part of unlawful elements. Because of that from the nature of their task and its difficulties they must as human beings tend to develop a certain immunity to rough behaviour, they must tend to develop a certain immunity towards robust behaviour; otherwise they could not do the task properly in which they are employed.</p>

<p>I am insinuating nothing. I am saying that any of us placed in their position would develop a similar immunity to robust behaviour: otherwise we could not do it either. It stems from the difficulties of their task and naturally they must develop an immunity of one or other sort. Bearing in mind that they have to carry out their duty under such difficult circumstances it is certainly in the interest both of themselves and of the Minister and the public that if at all possible, somebody other than a person drawn from that <span class="col_4911-4912" refersTo="page_1030"/>body should undertake the work of interrogation. The amendment which I propose moving, Sir, provides for a magistrate, appointed by the Minister, to carry out the interrogation and to determine when the interrogation shall cease. The point which I should like to make in this regard to the Minister is that in that way he will achieve his objects under this clause and at the same time any dangers which might be inherent, not on account of any wrong motives but in the nature of things, in such an interrogation being carried out by a member of the police will be obviated through it being conducted by a magistrate. At the same time the Minister will achieve the same result.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Reading this clause, one sees first of all that a commissioned officer is given the power to arrest and detain a person. The detainee can then be held in custody for interrogation in connection with the commission or the intention to commit such an offence dealt with here. Now, Sir, there is nothing in this clause saying who shall do the interrogation and. therefore, there is nothing to indicate that such interrogation shall be conducted by a police officer. Therefore no principle has been embodied in this clause to the effect that only a police officer shall do the interrogation. Consequently, I ask you to allow this amendment which will have the effect of stating in the clause who shall do the interrogation. I admit that sub-section (2) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall, except with the consent of the Minister of Justice or a commissioned officer as aforesaid, have access to any person detained under sub-section (1).</block>

<p>This means that some other person can, with the approval of the Minister or of a commissioned officer, have access to the person detained and if a magistrate is to be the interrogating officer, he would have had permission to have access to the detainees. I want to stress the fact that in the whole of the clause there is nothing saying that only a commissioned officer shall have the right to interrogate. Consequently, it cannot be said that any such principle is being enshrined here, because, as I said, there is no provision in this clause to the affect that a commissioned officer only shall have access to the detainees for the purpose of interrogation.</p>

<p>I should like to follow up further what the hon. member for Transkeian Territories has said. Supposing it is desired to use an expert on explosives, for example, to acquire information from the detainee by means of interrogation. As a matter of fact, it might be an expert on any subject who is required to obtain information from the detainee. Now, such expert may not be a commissioned officer of the police. Is this clause intended to limit any interrogation to such a commissioned officer only? The police may, after all, require experts in any particular field to obtain information. In order, therefore, to allow of this being done, I support the argument advanced by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the interrogation mentioned in this clause undoubtedly deals with the investigation of a crime and that is why only the person who is entrusted with the investigation of that crime can do the interrogating. If this function is delegated to some other person, one must face the fact that that person will not have the knowledge necessary to enable him to ask the questions that should be asked.

The work of interrogation is the responsibility of the Commissioner of the South African Police. If he desires any expert advice, it is for him to call such expert advice.

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>With leave of the House, I would like to make the following statement:</p>

<p>In my statement in the House on 6 June 1962, during the second-reading debate on the Commonwealth Relations Bill, I announced that the arrangements which had been concluded with the United Kingdom in regard to the entry into the Republic of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, did not cover the High Commission Territories, in respect of which different arrangements were contemplated and I undertook to inform the House, in due course, of the outcome of the negotiations regarding the Republic&#x2019;s future relations with the High Commission Territories.</p>

<p>Negotiations have recently been concluded on an important aspect of our future relations with the Territories, namely the measures aimed at controlling the movement of persons between the Republic and the High Commission Territories, and the purpose of this statement is to make information available to the House about the arrangements concluded.</p>

<p>In the course of the discussions with United Kingdom representatives, the South African authorities emphasized that, while it was the South African Government&#x2019;s desire to disturb the existing friendly and mutually beneficial relationships as little as was possible within the limits of the changed constitutional position. certain adjustments would have to be made, particularly in regard to the entry into the Republic of Bantu from the Territories and their employment in South Africa.</p>

<p>In this connection, it will be recalled that I mentioned in my statement to the House on 26 February 1962 that as regards the admission to and employment in the Republic of inhabitants of the High Commission Territories, the South African Government would still be prepared to make available opportunities for employment to the inhabitants of the Territories subject, however, to the employment needs of the Republic&#x2019;s own citizens. I then foreshadowed the introduction of some form of entry and/or employment control.</p>

<p>In terms of the new rules which will in future govern the movement of persons between the Republic and the Territories, passport control will be introduced as from 1 July 1963 and all persons entering the Republic from the Territories will from that date have to be in possession of valid travel documents.</p>

<p>Similarly, all South Africans wishing to leave the Republic for the High Commission Territories will, as from 1 July 1963, have to be in possession of valid travel documents. Bantu should apply for the necessary travel documents to the nearest Bantu Affairs Commissioner while persons of Indian and Pakistani origin should approach the Department of Indian Affairs. All other persons should apply for travel documents to the Department of the Interior or one of its regional offices.</p>

<heading>CONTROL MEASURES IN RESPECT OF BANTU FROM THE TERRITORIES WISHING TO ENTER THE REPUBLIC</heading>

<p>No control is at present exercised over the entry of Bantu from the Territories into the Republic. Since 6 May 1958, however, these Bantu could not without permission enter, be or remain in an urban area or a prescribed area, and they could not without permission be employed or continue to be employed in such an area. These Bantu are at present required to take out reference books whilst they are in the Republic.</p>

<p>The South African Government will, as from 1 July 1963, place restrictions on the entry of these Bantu into the Republic in terms of which every such Bantu will be required to obtain prior permission from the South African authorities to enter the Republic.</p>

<p>The following control measures are contemplated.</p>

</debateSection>

<debateSection name="#bantu_who_enter_the_republic_after_1_july_1963">

<heading>BANTU WHO ENTER THE REPUBLIC AFTER 1 JULY 1963</heading>

<p>All Bantu from the Territories who desire to enter the Republic for purposes of employment will have to obtain prior permission from the Department of Bantu Administration and Development for their temporary entry into the Republic for that purpose. Approval will be granted in co-operation with the authorities of the High Commission Territories. In practice, the mining industry will follow the same procedure as at present, in regard to the recruitment of labour, except in so far as the recruiting organization for the mines will also have to route their recruited workers through the control posts and such workers will also have to be in possession of valid travel documents.</p>

<p>As already indicated, Bantu workers will, like all other persons, have to be in possession of valid travel documents issued by their home authority. The travel document of Bantu workers will permit of endorsements by officials of the Republic reflecting, <i>inter alia,</i> particulars regarding service contracts, permission to enter or remain in an urban or proclaimed area and details about engagement and discharge. At the passport control posts the documents of Bantu workers will be endorsed by a duly authorized officer, whilst the travel document of a Bantu visitor will be endorsed to the effect that he has permission to enter the Republic for the purpose and the period mentioned in the endorsement.</p>

<p>When the afore-mentioned measures are put into operation, the issue of reference books in the Republic to Bantu from the Territories will be discontinued. A Bantu from the Territories will then be in possession of only one document, issued by the authorities of the Territory of his origin. The measure will take effect on 1 July 1963 in respect of Bantu entering the Republic on or after that date. All new entrants found in the Republic without the necessary travel documents, or permission, will be dealt with as prohibited persons.</p>

<debateSection name="#bantu_who_are_already_employed_in_the_republic_on_1_july_1963">

<heading>BANTU WHO ARE ALREADY EMPLOYED IN THE REPUBLIC ON 1 JULY 1963</heading>

<p>Bantu who are already employed in the Republic will, from 1 July 1963, have to apply to their home authorities for travel documents, and it is assumed that the High Commission Territories will in due course issue instructions in this regard. After such documents have been issued to them, they will be required to hand their reference books to the local Bantu Affairs Commissioner for cancellation. After 31 December 1965 every Bantu from the Territories now in the Republic should be in possession of a valid travel document issued by the authorities of his home Territory. Every Bantu from the Territories who is not in possession of such a document, even if he is otherwise lawfully in the Republic, will be dealt with as a prohibited person.</p>

<p>In all cases where it is not already compulsory by law, employers will, from 1 July 1963, have to register contracts of service of Bantu from the Territories with the Labour Bureau of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and will also have to report the termination of their employment. Employers will be guilty of an offence if they fail to register contracts of service; employ a Bantu from the Territories, who enters the Republic after 1 July 1963 without being in possession of a valid travel document; or retain in employment, after 31 December 1965, any Bantu from the Territories now in the Republic who is not by then in possession of a valid travel document.</p>

<heading>REPATRIATION</heading>

<p>Every Bantu whose period of service, which may in any case not exceed two years, has been terminated, is subject to repatriation and will only be taken into account for further service if he returns to his country of origin and is again authorized to be employed in the Republic.</p>

<p>When Bantu who were in lawful employment in the Republic prior to 1 July 1963 become unemployed, efforts will be made, however, to place them in other employment provided they are in possession of valid travel documents and provided further that Bantu of the Republic are not available. Otherwise, they will be repatriated.</p>

<p>It may be added that when a service contract is concluded, every employer or his representative will have to undertake to return the Bantu concerned to his home or the railway or road motor transport station nearest to his home, upon termination of his services, either by making provision for his fare or by delivering him personally.</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that Bantu living along the common borders constantly move to and fro in order to visit others across the border, and taking into account the relatively large distances between the passport control posts, it will not be required from all such Bantu to report at passport control posts every time they leave or enter the Republic. They will, however, have to be in possession of valid travel documents.</p>

<p>It will be left to the discretion of officials in charge of passport control posts to grant exemption to certain of these Bantu from the requirement of reporting to a passport control post every time they cross the border. Each person who has been granted such exemption will, however, have to report to a passport control post once every six months, for the necessary endorsement of his travel document.</p>

<heading>INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS</heading>

<p>Whilst the above permanent arrangements are contemplated, it is realized that, in view of administrative difficulties, it may not be possible for all new entrants from the Territories to obtain valid travel documents as of 1 July 1963. It has accordingly been decided that the following <i>interim</i> arrangements will apply during the period 1 July to 31 December 1963:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) With the exception of persons mentioned in paragraph (c) below, all visitors from the Territories should be in possession of valid travel documents as of 1 July 1963.</li>

<li>(b) Bantu from the Territories who enter the Republic for purposes of employment and who have not yet been able to obtain valid travel documents, will be allowed into the Republic during an interim period up to 31 December 1963 provided that they are in possession of an acceptable temporary document, the form of which is being worked out by the South African authorities and the authorities of the High Commission Territories.</li>

<li>(c) Administrative arrangements are to be made for Bantu living along the border who cross the frontiers to and fro, for example for purposes of shopping, etc., in border towns and who have not yet been able to obtain valid travel documents, to enter the Republic without formal documents for these strictly limited purposes during the interim period up to 31 December 1963.</li>

</ol>

<p>These <i>interim</i> arrangements have been agreed to on the assumption that the <i>permanent</i> arrangements re travel documents as described above, will be put into operation as soon as practicable after 1 July 1963 but in any case not later than 31 December 1963.</p>

<debateSection name="#visas">

<heading>VISAS</heading>

<p>As far as visas are concerned the following rules will be applicable.</p>

<p><i>Whites</i> from the Territories will not be subject to visa control.</p>

<p><i>Bantu</i> from the Territories will similarly be exempted from the requirement to obtain visas subject to the further proviso, however, that those Bantu entering South Africa for purposes of employment must have the prior authority of the Department of Bantu Administration and Development.</p>

<p>The travel document of a Bantu visitor will, of course, also have to be endorsed at a passport control post to the effect that he has permission to enter the Republic for the purpose and period mentioned in the endorsement.</p>

<p><i>Coloured,</i> who, like all other persons, will be required to be in possession of valid travel documents when entering the Republic, will also not have to obtain visas but if they intend coming to the Republic to take up employment, they will have to obtain prior permission from the Secretary for the Interior who will in all cases consult the Secretary for Labour.</p>

<p>In this connection, it will be realized that the Republic naturally has to safeguard the interests of its own Coloured community.</p>

<p><i>Asiatics</i> from the Territories wishing to visit the Republic will, apart from being in possession of valid travel documents, have to obtain visas, as at present, before proceeding to South Africa.</p>

<p>In all these cases, that is, both in the case of Whites and non-Whites, the South African Government reserves the right, in special cases, to make the entry of certain persons into the Republic, their continued residence therein or the continued residence of persons already in the Republic on 1 July 1963 subject to the conditions of an Alien&#x2019;s Temporary Permit.</p>

<p>Whites as well as non-Whites from the Territories are, of course, aliens and would normally be subject to the Aliens&#x2019; Registration Act, 1939. All persons from the Territories will, however, be exempted from the provisions of the aforesaid Act, on a basis of reciprocity, and as a result they will not have to register as aliens or notify changes of address.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014; That the Bill be now read a third time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>We are asked to give approval to-day to the third reading of a Bill which has become known as the Poqo Bill and which has attracted a great deal of attention both in the Republic and overseas, a Bill which even the Government Press has described as being frightening in its severity and which the Minister has told us he sponsors with great reluctance. It is a Bill amending no fewer than five existing statutes and, as is always the case with Bills amending the general law, it is difficult to distil any single principle from the many provisions which affect both statute law and common law. In the case of this Bill, however, if one has regard to the background, if one has regard to the reasons for its introduction, one does, it seems to me, arrive at a common principle underlying the generality of its provisions. And that principle, as I indicated at the second reading, was to give effect to the recommendations of the interim report of the Snyman Commission in respect of the Paarl riots and to clothe the Government with power to cope with a developing crisis. It is aimed, not only at the organizations apparently responsible for the ghastly murders at Paarl and in other places, but also at the organization or organizations responsible for the wave of sabotage to which the country has been subject. The fact, Sir, that those crimes have been dictated by political motives makes the position ugly indeed.</p>

<p>The Bill, in its main provisions, follows faithfully the recommendations of the interim feport by Mr. Justice Snyman, firstly, in equating Poqo and other similar organizations which might arise with the P.A.C. as an unlawful drganization, and secondly, in doing away with preparatory examinations in certain cases connected with the safety of the State and thirdly, in providing for Judges to sit without juries in certain cases. These provisions, although far-reaching, do not invade the rule of law; they merely clothe the administration of justice with greater power. In our opinion these steps are justifiable and they were necessary in the unfortunate circumstances which have arisen. We feel the same about those provisions of the Bill which are designed to create new offences to cope with those who undergo courses of training in sabotage outside the Republic and those who advocate the use of force against the Republic by foreign states. We regard these as the main principles of the Bill, and because they are obviously necessary at the present time to enable those in authority to maintain and protect the security of the State against the developing threat, we shall support this Bill at the third reading, and indeed we cannot do otherwise because it is surely a recognized principle in all democratic states that in times of crises, the authorities should be clothed with the necessary powers to maintain law and order and to protect the safety of the citizens of the state.</p>

<p>This Bill, however, has two further provisions which we have all along found unacceptable, and we can support the Bill in spite of them only because to us the safety of the state is paramount. They are, firstly, the powers given to the Minister of Justice in Clause 4 to detain indefinitely a prisoner after he has served a sentence for a crime connected with the safety of the state; secondly, the power given to commissioned officers to arrest persons for interrogation in connection with offences committed or planned against the safety of the state and to detain them, if necessary, in solitary confinement for periods of up to 90 days at a time. Sir, I think we have made our opposition to these provisions clear from the beginning; we have done our best to have them excluded from the Bill. While we failed in our main purpose, we did succeed in ameliorating the application of both these provisions in important respects: The right of the Minister to detain prisoners due for release will now fall away at the end of the year unless renewed by Parliament, and persons held for interrogtion will now be visited in private by a magistrate each week. Sir, these are important concessions which I believe have only been made because we have shown by our attitude that we appreciate the difficulties with which our country is faced at the present time. There must be no misunderstanding, however. These clauses, even as amended, remain anathema to us because we cannot concede that even in the present emergency such draconian measures are justified. The Minister himself, when asking for Clause 17, expressed misgivings and indicated not only that he appreciated its severity but also that he was deeply conscious of the dangers of abuse. In fact he made it clear that in the administration of this clause his own reputation would be at stake. I think he should know that in that respect we agree with his judgment and that his own responsibility is a very real one and that we as an Opposition will consider it our duty to expose any abuses that come to our notice and lay them at his door. The hon. the Minister, the administration of justice, already has certain powers under the Act of 1955, powers to bring people before a magistrate for interrogation and to sentence them to recurrent periods of imprisonment for eight days at a time if they <span class="col_4921-4922" refersTo="page_1035"/>fail to answer satisfactorily. The Minister has taken up the attitude that that provision is not severe enough; he has asked for greater powers. He has told us of the situation with which he is faced. I think he must appreciate that a very great responsibility rests on him to see that these powers are in no way abused. This Bill, we feel, has been dictated by a serious state of affairs and is designed not only to cope with that situation but also to arrest what we see as a developing threat. That threat arises to some extent from circumstances beyond the control of any South African Government, but at the same time there is no doubt whatever that a dangerous growth of that threat has been possible because Government policies have created fertile seed-beds for the germination and the growth of dangerous movements which otherwise would have found it extremely difficult to flourish under our South African climate. This Bill, I feel sure, will assist to end the present wave of political crime, but it is only patchwork. It can only suppress symptoms of an underlying malady. Wisdom dictates that that malady should be diagnosed and treated at its source. On other occasions we on this side of the House have indicated what some of the root causes of this malady may well be&#x2014;what we believe them to be. The rules of the House preclude me from repeating that diagnosis to-day. Nevertheless it is my duty to warn the Government that if they continue with this superficial approach to our problems and refuse to understand how they themselves are contributing to our troubles, this Bill will not be the final instalment of the series of vast powers which this Government has taken from time to time. Hon. gentlemen opposite may refuse to accept the truth of what I say but I believe that people outside will understand and I believe that, understanding, they will act to end this sorry chapter in our South African history.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I have very little to add to what I said about this Bill at the second reading, but I want to make a few comments on what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said and a few additional comments which I feel must be made at this time and stage of the Bill. Sir, I do not agree with the contention of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition where he says that the reason why he has supported this Bill is because the principle of this Bill is contained in those clauses which give legislative effect to the recommendations of the Snyman Commission. He detailed those particular provisions as being the clauses which made the Poqo movement synonymous with the P.A.C., the clause which allows the removal of preparatory examinations and the clause which allows Judges to sit without a jury. Sir, those were indeed part of the recommendations of the Snyman Commission, but of course, the Bill which we have been considering over the greatest part of last week goes a great deal further than those recommendations, and to my mind those are not the principles of the Bill, the contents of which we are examining to-day. To my mind the principles of the Bill are contained in two important clauses, both of which the Opposition say are repugnant to them. The one is Clause 4 and the other is Clause 17. The one is the clause which allows the hon. the Minister to hold indefinitely as long as he so desires, people who have already served prison sentences for the crimes for which they have been convicted and the other is, of course, Clause 17 which allows police officers to take for interrogation anybody without legal redress, without the benefit of legal advice, to take them for interrogation for 90 days over and over again. The Leader of the Opposition also stated that he was in agreement with the idea of a new offence being created, in respect of persons who have been trained outside this country for sabotage or other action against this country. Sir, I am not against the creation of a new offence <i>per se,</i> but I am certainly against the retrospectivity of such an offence. But to come back to the two clauses which the Leader of the Opposition said were repugnant to him and his party and which he felt had been improved during the Committee Stage of this Bill, to such an extent, presumably, that apart from the fact that he considers the principles of the Bill to be the translation of the Snyman Commission Report into legislation, he considers the amendments which he has persuaded the Minister to accept in the Committee Stage to be of such significance that, despite the repugnance of these clauses, he and his side are able to vote for the third reading of this Bill. I do not attach the importance to those amendments that the Leader of the Opposition attaches to them. Under the amendment in Clause 4 the Government now has to come back to Parliament each year for this particular clause to be reviewed by Parliament. I want to remind the Leader of the Opposition of the words that he used when a similar provision was introduced at his behest, in the Unlawful Organizations Act. The Government having accepted this principle, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition then stated that he intended to vote for the principle of this Bill. On 29 March he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We shall support the second reading of this Bill (i.e. the Unlawful Organizations Bill) because we are now in a position that the power which the Minister has will come before this House for review after 12 months and we shall be able then to decide whether the Minister has acted rightly or wrongly.</block>

<p>I want to remind the Leader of the Opposition that all that happened was that the following year the Minister came back to this House and without a peep from the Opposition the period was further extended and the year thereafter, and this year that legislation has now been translated into a permanent provision on the Statute Book. Sir, I make bold to say that exactly the same thing is going to happen to Clause 4 of this Bill, and in any case even if the Opposition does not like <span class="col_4923-4924" refersTo="page_1036"/>the extension of this period, the hon. the Minister will come to this House, the Government members will vote with him and these provisions will be extended for a further year. My prediction is that next year or possibly the year thereafter the hon. the Minister will bring Clause 4 back to Parliament for review and, of course, the period will be extended for a further 12 months as long as the Minister wishes so to extend it, and that in due course we will have another piece of amending legislation which will introduce Clause 4 as a permanent part of the statutory law of South Africa. I do not therefore attach very much importance to this right of review. The amendment achieved in Clause 17 has a little more significance but not very much. That amendment now makes it necessary for a magistrate or somebody deputed by the Minister to visit persons held for interrogation once a week. Well, I do not know what happens after that. There is no provision for the magistrate to report his findings to any public body whatever; the Press and the public of South Africa will be as unaware as they were before this amendment was introduced as to what is happening in the police cell, as to what form the interrogation has been taking and, worst of all, the people most affected by this, the relatives of the person so taken for interrogation, will be given no reassurances whatsoever as to the health and the state of mind of the detainee. The amendment may have some little significance but in point of fact it really does not achieve a great deal. To my mind nothing has happened between the second reading of this Bill and the present stage that we have reached which in any way changes my complete and unequivocal opposition to this Bill. As far as I am concerned it remains as repugnant as it was originally; as contrary to all democratic practices, as destructive of the Rule of Law as it ever was, and it is in fact a gigantic blot on our Statute Book. It demonstrates unfortunately, two things very clearly. It demonstrates firstly that under the leadership of the Nationalist Government South Africa is forgetting its old reverence for traditional freedom and is sliding ever further into the morass of a totalitarian state, and it demonstrates even more clearly and perhaps even more tragically that the official Opposition has now given the green light to this Government to follow that course by failing to oppose this measure which I believe to be one of the worst measures ever put on the Statute Book. By failing to oppose this measure it has meekly acquiesced in South Africa&#x2019;s abdication from the ranks of democratic countries. It seems that the Opposition has learnt absolutely nothing from its earlier experiences of assisting the Government in putting this sort of legislation on the Statute Book. Having achieved one concession the Government will demand the next concession. The Opposition does not realize that this indeed is the very essence that nationalism feeds on, to create crisis situations and then to bring in legislation to deal with such crisis situations, but neither the Government nor the Opposition realize that what feeds White nationalism is also feeding Black nationalism in this country. As extreme White nationalism is fed by crisis situations and tough measures which are then taken to deal with those situations, so too does Black nationalism feed on this type of so-called &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D; and demonstrations of &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D;, As far as I am concerned this Bill goes a great deal further than any of the recommendations of the Report of the Snyman Commission, and leaving all that aside, I want to know from the hon. the Minister whether he seriously thinks that legislation of this sort is going to do anything to relieve any of the tension existing in South Africa. But the hon. the Minister, I would add, has at no stage of the debate in Parliament attempted to give us the real reasons why he is introducing this measure. He has not produced any proof of any emergency situation. Indeed it seems to me that any so-called emergency that existed has been adequately dealt with by the powers which the Minister had before he introduced this legislation. At no time has he taken the country or this House into his confidence. All he has done has been to come along with dark stories of what he knows but dare not disclose to South Africa. Well, that may be good enought for the Leader of the Opposition; it is not good enought for me and I am certainly not going to support this Bill at the third reading. Contrary to all the rather melodramatic things which have been said, I do not feel at all alone in my opposition to this Bill. I know that I have hundreds of thousands of White voters in South Africa &#x2026;</p>

<p>I should like to express my gratitude to the House of Assembly of South Africa for the fact that we have been able, with one discordant note only, to dispose of a contentious measure such as this in this way. That discordant note, as was to be expected, came from the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). I notice that the leader of the hon. member for Houghton, Dr. Steytler, has said that circumstances will now oblige him to take over the leadership in South Africa. I should like the hon. member for Houghton, since her leader is no longer in our midst, to give him this message that the people of South Africa&#x2014;and when I refer to the people of South <span class="col_4925-4926" refersTo="page_1037"/>Africa, I refer to the supporters of the National Party as well as the supporters of the United Party outside of this House&#x2014;are not prepared to allow themselves to be sold out by Dr. Steytler and his followers. I have expressed my gratitude to this House for the fact that we have been able to put through a measure of this kind in this way. I think it redounds to the great credit of all of us. At the same time it also illustrates that a measure can be thoroughly discussed&#x2014;and I submit that this measure has been very thoroughly discussed&#x2014;without the necessity of a discussion extending over days and without a great fuss. I also want to express my gratitude to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for one sentence in particular which he used in the course of his speech this afternoon&#x2014;and I take it that it was that sentiment which motivated the decision of the Opposition to support the third reading of this measure&#x2014;and that is his statement that to them the safety of the state is paramount. I am pleased that that attitude which is adopted by this side of the House is also adopted now by that side of the House, because that is the golden thread that runs throughout the legislation that this side has placed before this House since it came into power, that is, that when one has to choose at a time such as this on the one hand between placing restrictions upon certain individuals because the survival and the safety of the state are at stake and, on the other hand, unlimited freedom for the individual, then the Government in power is not only entitled to take this step but it has a positive duty to do so. That has always been the motive of this side of the House and I am pleased that that attitude, that rule, is now accepted and subscribed to by both sides of the House. I am also convinced that we have been able to adopt this attitude, that we have been able to reach unanimity on this occasion, because hon. members on both sides of the House are conscious of the fact that the provisions of this measure meet with the approval of and have been accepted by the people whom we represent in this House; because, after all, the reaction of a nation, the automatic reaction of a nation, particularly when it is threatened, is never wrong, and the reaction of the nation at this moment, judging by messages which I have received from members of the public, is that they stand by the Government and by this measure. Out of all the reactions that I have received, Mr. Speaker, you will permit me to quote just the final paragraph of a letter which I have received from Amanzimtoti, because to my mind it reflects the attitude of the electorate of South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I feel that never before in our history has a nation been required to pigeon-hole its petty grievances and give to the Government its wholehearted support and loyalty.</block>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that it will be the duty of the Opposition&#x2014; and there I fully agree with him&#x2014;&#x201C; to disclose any abuses&#x201D; and to lay such abuses at the door of the Government and particularly at my own door. I do not mind; on the contrary, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will recall that I stated that this was my responsibility; that I asked that I should be called to account and that my Government, whose mouthpiece I am, should be called to account. We are quite prepared to accept that responsibility because this Government has shown that it is a responsible Government, a Government which can be trusted with powers of this kind. Although hon. members have had the opportunity to lay abuses at the door of the Government in respect of powers which it has taken in the past, I can say that not a single abuse had been laid at the door of the Government&#x2014;a fact which has encouraged the Government and which has encouraged me&#x2014;for the simple reason that there have been no abuses to lay at the Government&#x2019;s door. I want to give hon. members the assurance&#x2014;and in giving this assurance I appreciate my responsibility&#x2014;that just as it has done in the past, the Government will continue in the future to act with the greatest degree of circumspection and that it will never be necessary to lay anything at its door or to reproach it in this connection. I am also grateful to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for another admission which he made and that is that partly, perhaps largely, this situation has come about as a result of circumstances beyond the control of any Government. That is so; that statement is in consonance with the facts which I set out in my second-reading speech, and I am pleased that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has accepted that statement of fact. We must, of course, differ where the Leader of the Opposition talks about &#x201C;fertile seed-beds&#x201D; which this Government has allegedly created. I do not want to quarrel with him in that regard at this stage; I just want to say to him in passing that those seed-beds are nothing new; when this Government took over those seed-beds were already there, and some of the weeds in those seed-beds could best have been exterminated at the germination stage when another party was in power in South Africa. However, I do not want to pursue that argument; it is a matter on which one could argue the whole day.</p>

<p>In conclusion the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated that he did not believe that this measure represented the last instalment. I do not want to make any promises in that connection. I just want to say that since the Government has to bear the responsibility, since the Government is prepared to bear the responsibility, since this Parliament is sovereign and since this Parliament is the place to which we have to come&#x2014;this Parliament, after all, is the guarantee of our democracy and of our survival&#x2014;the Government will come to Parliament, as often as it may be necessary, with such measures as may be necessary to meet any situation that represents a threat to South Africa. It was only after having fully satisfied itself as to the <span class="col_4927-4928" refersTo="page_1038"/>necessity of this course that the Government decided to ask Parliament for these powers, and the Government is deeply grateful to this House for having given it these powers in the way that it has done.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill fulfils certain functions namely to provide insurance and compensation for injury or illness which may result after the licensing of certain nuclear reactors or other nuclear works. The interesting thing about nuclear knowledge is that there is very little known about nuclear effects. Scientists are only on the fringe of what can happen with nuclear power. They are constantly finding new effects. One of the few things which has resulted from the few years&#x2014;few years which run into approximately 55&#x2014;of knowledge gained in connection with ionizing radiation is that the risk to humans is incalculable. By &#x201C;incalculable&#x201D; I do not mean that the risk is so enormous but rather that it is very slowly acquired and cannot accurately be measured. We who come in contact with the sufferers from this force realize more and more that the effect of ionizing radiation upon human tissues, even upon plants and indirectly upon animals through the plants (such as cows giving radioactive milk), manifests itself very slowly. When X-rays were first introduced nobody realized that they were dangerous. It was very fortunate for the world that the first users of this force were mostly medical men, medical men who continued with the work and the rest of the medical profession could observe what was happening, over the years, to those men. They were the martyrs to the early days of X-rays.</p>

<p>It is only within the last five or six years that we have discovered that a form of treatmet which was used for certain types of rheumatism produced in children at the age of about 11 years leukemia. In other words, a treatment which was applied in the case of a disease which is not a killing disease, although an uncomfortable one, and for which there are perhaps other treatments available, produced leukemia in children at about the age of 11. It was only discovered recently that if the foetus in pregnant women came within the range of even small doses of X-rays at a certain stage of pregnancy the offspring was deformed. It is only recently that it was discovered that X-rays changed various forms of plant life and it has been impossible to control any of these changes.</p>

<p>It was as far back as 1928 that I studied at the Radium Institution in Paris. Madam Curie was working in the same Institute at the time, although not in the same department as I was. She had two grammes of radium at her disposal at that time and we began to realize more and more how little we had known about X-rays and that that knowledge was being added to by radium. One thing was said to me there which has stuck in my memory and it is this: &#x201C;There is only one way of avoiding the effects of these rays and that is to keep away from them as far as you can.&#x201D; It is for that reason that I am speaking to-day. I know that the scientists do not agree with me but I also know that those very scientists have often been wrong about these effects and are learning slowly and painfully. I am doubtful about believing them, therefore, and new effects are constantly cropping up. I think that the placing of these nuclear works as near as 14 miles from Pretoria is a grave error. Time will, show that I am right.</p>

<p>I also hope I will be wrong. Although there is no fear of an explosion or anything like that in connection with the work which is going on there there is nevertheless great danger from the rays. This danger may go on silently, undiscovered, for years. I do hope, therefore, that if any further licences are granted by the Department which has control of these affairs, it will see that any reactors are placed as far away as possible from large cities and centres of population.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member expects me to reply to the speech which he has just made. I have already stated in my second-reading speech that the possible effect of nuclear energy rays is scarcely known to us as yet and that we are still only on the threshold of science in that regard. I agree with the hon. member that the possibilities for the future are limitless. We are already doing the necessary research through our Atomic Energy Board and we are already training the requisite scientists. I am sure that our scientists will succeed in achieving great results for South Africa. As far as the siting of this reactor is concerned I have already said that security measures have been taken and will be taken in the future after consultation with the very best experts in this sphere. The hon. member&#x2019;s suggestion that even greater regard should be had in the future to the safety factor in granting licences for such installations is one which will be taken into account.</p>

<p>Third Order read: House to resume in Committee on Coloured Persons Education Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>[Progress reported on 24 April when Clauses 1 and 4 were standing over and Clause 30 was under consideration, upon which amendments had been moved by the Minister of Coloured Affairs.]</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>When this clause was discussed last week, I failed to take your advice to &#x201C;move&#x201D;, Sir, and I overlooked the necessity to move my particular amendment. I misunderstood you at the time, Sir, and I now propose to move it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 59 to omit &#x201C;spread&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;distribution and in line 63, to omit &#x201C;as prescribed&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;five years&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I was pointing out that the use of the word &#x201C;spread&#x201D; here was clearly wrong. I do not want to press the point that &#x201C;distribution&#x201D;, in regard to the population factor, is the correct word, because I believe that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to accept this textual amendment.</p>

<p>As regards the substitution of &#x201C;five years&#x201D; for &#x201C;prescribed&#x201D;, this is obviously something more than just a textual amendment. In terms of sub-clause (3) of this clause, it appears that the Minister, in appointing the Education Council for Coloured persons, will have the right, at any given time decided upon by the Minister in terms of the regulations, to make such changes as he wishes to make in the composition of that council. That principle is, of course, not unusual. But on the other hand, it is also not unusual that an advisory council appointed in terms of a measure like this should have some tenure of office. It is difficult to conceive that the Minister will see it in any different light because I, for one, assume that in appointing this council the Minister will choose those persons who, in his opinion, are qualified to serve and who could therefore normally be expected to perform their duties properly. In other words, the council will, <i>ab initio,</i> be of the Minister&#x2019;s own choosing. That being the case, the only possible result of not appointing them for a period of time would be to create a certain degree of insecurity in the minds of the members of the council in regard to the work and functions of this council. You do not place a very great duty on a man if you appoint him to a responsible position, albeit in an advisory position, and you say to him: &#x201C;I am appointing you to-day because I think you are the right man for the job, but I may change my mind to-morrow and then you will have to go.&#x201D; You are not going to get the very best co-operation and advice from such a person.</p>

<p>My final point in this connection is that the Minister himself has referred to what he called &#x201C;verdagmakery&#x201D; in regard to this Bill. I am not prepared to discuss that here; it is not relevant. But what I do want to say is this: that if such suspicion exists in regard to the Bill itself and the take-over of Coloured education by his Department, the Minister can to some extent allay those suspicions, in fact he can go a long way towards eliminating them completely, if he were to appoint this Education Council for Coloured persons on a permanent basis, rather than on this very tentative basis. It is obvious that these people will be chosen because they are Coloured people, because they are interested in Coloured education and because they are qualified, in the view of the Minister, to advise him. He will be able to select the best from among the Coloured people. In appointing them for a period of five years, he will be following a very well-established precedent in the first instance; and in the second instance, the Minister will make quite sure that the Coloured people feel that he, in fact, intends to have a full-fledged council in regard to the education of Coloured persons, as is the National Advisory Council in regard to the education of White persons. He will also be confirming the belief that some of them have that the Minister&#x2019;s intention is to make use of the advice of the Coloured people and the Coloured educationists themselves. As I have said, he will be dispelling a great part of what he believes is suspicion about this Bill. Again, in this case I do not wish to press the matter, because I think the Minister may well have considered this amendment and come to the conclusion that it is one which merits his approval.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister can at least accept that part of the amendment of the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) which deals with the wording of the clause. I think &#x201C;distribution&#x201D; is a better word than &#x201C;spread&#x201D;. I was also impressed by the arguments advanced by the hon. member for Hospital in connection with a definite period. I have in mind, for example, the National Advisory Council in whose case a definite period is also laid down. I think the hon. the Minister will come to the conclusion, if he has not already decided to accept this amendment, that it will be much better to appoint this body for a definite period. That brings about greater security and continuity and it will also provide greater security to the members nominated.</p>

<p>This clause provides further, <i>inter alia,</i> that an Education Council for Coloured persons shall be established consisting of an officer of the Department having expert knowledge of education matters, to be designated by the Minister from time to time. It is quite interesting to see how the Minister has departed from previous Bills and I want to compliment him on that because the clause goes on to say that the other eight members have to be <span class="col_4931-4932" refersTo="page_1040"/>Coloureds and that they must be appointed by the State President. I think that is a sound departure; instead of the Minister doing it, he enhances their status by having them appointed by the State President. We know, of course, how it works, but it makes a better impression. Personally I would have preferred a different procedure but I realize what the practical difficulties are at this stage. I think the Minister will eventually have his members appointed by educational bodies or by teachers&#x2019; associations. His difficulty is probably at the moment that that will not be practical policy. My amendment goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;council&#x201D; in line 2, page 28, to the end of paragraph (a) and to substitute &#x201C;appointed in terms of paragraph (b) of sub-section (2), as the chairman&#x201D;.</block>

<p>As you will notice, Sir, my amendment asks that the chairman should not be just any one of those nine members, but a specific one, namely a Coloured. In other words, I am asking that the chairman should be a Coloured person. It will not be difficult for the hon. the Minister to do so because there are already competent people amongst the Coloureds. The people with whom we are dealing are not backward as far as education is concerned or as far as their standard of civilization is concerned. They are people who have become civilized with us over 300 years and who already have those educated and competent people. They also have people with the necessary experience and a Coloured chairman will undoubtedly give satisfaction and ensure greater confidence in the Minister&#x2019;s legislation because that will prove still further our good faith towards those people. I am not saying that the Minister will not nominate a Coloured person as chairman; he will in all probability do so, but I maintain that it will create greater confidence amongst the Coloureds if he accepts this amendment of mine.</p>

<p>I have no objection to the amendment of the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp).</p>

<p>As far as the other proposal of the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) is concerned, I want to inform him that I consulted the law advisers and their advice to me has been in the opposite direction as far as the words &#x201C;spread&#x201D; and &#x201C;distribution&#x201D; are concerned. I shall go into the matter again because I am not convinced that the law advisers are wrong. I should like to have more time to consider this matter. The law advisers tell me there is a difference and I shall have to go into it thoroughly.</p>

<p>As far as the second part of his amendment is concerned, he asks that the members must be appointed for five years. There may be practical reasons why we cannot do that. It may be necessary to appoint a man who is nearing 70 years of age in which case we cannot appoint him for five years because the policy is not to appoint a man of over 70 years of age. That is only one instance where we may be faced with difficulties. If the hon. member is prepared to change his amendment to read &#x201C;for not less than three years&#x201D; I shall consider it.</p>

<heading>SLUMS AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>Fourth Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for second reading,&#x2014;Slums Amendment Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Housing, adjourned on 5 April, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was last adjourned, I had referred to the fact that the local authorities which had been handling this matter of slum clearance in the past, were not in the happy position that the Minister is in at the present time, from this particular point of view that whereas the Minister if he feels that the existing legislation <span class="col_4937-4938" refersTo="page_1043"/>is inadequate to deal with the situation which has developed throughout South Africa, he can come before us and, provided he gets the approval of the Government of which he is a member, he is certain of getting the law amended in such form as to suit his purpose. Minicipalities are not in that happy position. I made that point, but I want to reiterate it because it is a long time ago since the debate was adjourned, and I want to lead off from there in regard to what I have to say next.</p>

<p>This Bill when it was first published, was viewed with a great deal of concern by our municipalities who considered that it was likely to impinge very severely upon their existing rights and powers, and they were very concerned that so far as they have in the past had to grapple with this extremely thorny problem, in the future the matter would be taken out of their hands and the Government would step into the picture, their powers would be taken away from them, and developments in connection with the clearing up of slums, the creation of housing schemes, would be something completely beyond their control. I want to say that however one may look on this kind of development, we have to realize that housing schemes associated with our municipalities are really part of the organic growth of a municipality. A municipality and the people that live within their borders have their being there, such a municipality is created by people. You have a number of people living under urban conditions who create a municipality. When pursuant to their getting together as an organized body under the respective local government ordinance of the province concerned, the power to create what is virtually another small township, because it creates a further urban community, a community living under urban conditions is taken away from them, then the control of the area as a whole which the city fathers have viewed from a certain angle, may have to be viewed from a totally different angle, and one cannot blame the municipalities if they felt that development of that kind might go in wrong channels and that they sooner or later might find themselves in difficulties over the developments taking place, pursuant to the determination by an outside body as to what slums should be abolished, how the land would have to be used and replanned and where the people from the slums were to be housed. On going further into the matter, and particularly may I say in the light of the second-reading speech of the hon. Minister, there probably has been a reappraisal of the situation. In passing I would like to say that I think that the fact that the hon. Minister was able to make that speech and then was able to adjourn the debate, has served a very useful purpose indeed. It is an example that perhaps might be followed in respect of some of our important legislation. We were able to read our Bill in the light of that speech, as well as explanations that had come from his Department. In the light of that speech I think the municipalities have now more or less, perhaps not altogether accepted the position that it is not the intention of the Minister to come and take away powers from the municipalities. In his speech he said so categorically. But it is his intention to do away with slums, and machinery is created here with a view in doing away with slums. Here I want to say to the hon. Minister that on this side of the House we are entirely with him in that object. I had just reached that statement when the debate was adjourned, but I want to come back to it now. We on this side of the House feel that slums have an adverse effect not only on our economy, not only on the living conditions and the social life of the people that are concerned, but very often in regard to other considerations of a political and socio-political nature. Slums can be a hot-bed for breeding not only people who have asocial instincts in one regard, but perhaps from many different directions. So from every point of view we think that it is a good thing in principle that the slums should be abolished.</p>

<p>But now one cannot say that in practice, without qualification, one should pursue that principle to the exclusion of everything else. For one thing it is quite clear that in the clearing up of slums if you have a heterogeneous population living in the slum, not only under the policy of this Government, but also under the policy of this side of the House, if the people concerned are to be rehoused, those members of a heterogeneous population, then the various racial groups should go to housing schemes designed for their particular racial groups. The Government will do that and we would do that under similar circumstances. In other words, the rehousing of a mixed population, consisting of various racial groups, offers the opportunity to separate the people out so that you have the residential separation which we all are seeking to achieve. I now speak for the official Opposition. In that regard, I would like to say that there is another consideration and that is the circumstances under which the folk from the slums are to be rehoused, and here perhaps we come to perhaps one of the most difficult and most involved aspects of the whole question of slum-clearance. In principle, as I have said, we all agree that slums must be cleared up. In principle, if there is a mixed population living there, then the people can be given the opportunity of living in housing schemes, associated with their own racial group. But in practice what have the municipalities been up against? I leave it there for the moment: I believe that a commission found in Britain some years ago that a slum paid higher dividends to a landlord than an orthodox housing scheme under the laws then existing in Britain. Leaving out that aspect entirely in so far as it is applicable to South African conditions, the difficulty has been that where municipalities are concerned in some cases&#x2014;and I want to make it clear that I am not laying down a general rule&#x2014;when a slum had to be cleared up and people accommodated in other houses, firstly the municipalities were not their own masters in deciding where those people <span class="col_4939-4940" refersTo="page_1044"/>were to be housed and under what conditions. They could not take a firm decision; they had to get approval in some cases, a few years ago, from as many as three or four Government Departments before they could move. When the picture was sufficiently clear to show that the inhabitants of the slum could be housed at Point A or at Point B, very often these people had to be housed so far away from the place where they lived previously that it became virtually impossible for them to continue in their previous employment and even to carry on their small businesses, which constituted their livelihood. The municipalities visualized them as being placed so far away from the slums where they had previously lived that the burden upon them was one they could not bear. So where we are dealing with a Bill such as this one, and rehousing becomes part of the machinery for the clearing up of slums, we all view this question as one of great importance. Let us have a little mercy for these people who are living in slum conditions, in which they were perhaps bom. It is not their fault. They have perhaps done the best they could under the circumstances. Some of them have employment and their own small businesses and they want to continue with that, but if they are moved so far away that they cannot afford the cost of going back and forth from their homes to their work there is a complete period put to the lives of these men and women and they have to start life completely anew. Whereas it may have been in many cases that their inability to get on in the world stemmed not only from the wretched conditions under which they lived and in which many were born, but also from an inadequate education, that has dogged them all through life, and now when they are being moved we should get an assurance from the Minister that they will not be placed in such an utterly hopeless position in their new surroundings that they will fall into arrear with their rent or instalments or be unable to cope with the cost of living, so that eventually they fall back into the gutter again. You see, Sir, slums really are made by people. There is a clause in this Bill which has been deliberately inserted so that if you have a dwelling, presumably a block of flats or a rooming-house, and if a part of that building has become of such a character that it may be proclaimed a slum, the whole of the building is condemned, and I do not think that has been done by chance. That was the position beforehand; it is not something new in this Bill. It merely made the thing more difficult for the local authorities. It is there, but how far-reaching it is will be apparent immediately to people who may be occupying some flats or rooms in a dwelling a single room or flat of which has been condemned, and the authorities then condemn the whole building. The Government may have to do it.</p>

<p>I am not blind to the responsibility which will now rest on the shoulders of the Minister not only to clear up slums, which is heavy enough already, but the responsibility also of dealing with the human problems which will come about when he starts moving thousands of people. That will be the big difficulty. Here sits the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare, just in front of the Minister of Community Development. The Minister of Social Welfare is grappling with all sorts of problems associated with his particular aspect of the social life of our people, with the heartbreak and trouble that spring from some of these developments which in the public interest must be tackled, and slum clearance is something which we on this side believe must be tackled. May I say that we are going to vote for the second reading. In the Committee Stage there are various clauses we would like to deal with at greater length, but one does not want to see the Minister of Community Development tackling the matter in such a way that he is simply creating a mountain of troubles for his colleague the Minister of Social Welfare to deal with, and it can so easily happen.</p>

<p>In the older towns and cities where, through generations, an area has become characterized in the public mind as a slum area, dilapidated and inhabited by shiftless people, those are the conditions which create the biggest difficulties for the municipalities, very often because they have not known, when they started clearing up a slum, where to find alternative accommodation for those people. May I just deal with that aspect for one moment. We on this side want to plead with the Minister that in clearing slums he must see to it that homes for those people are already established before they are moved from the slums. I am sure that is the intention of the Minister, to provide houses for them. We do not think the Minister is equivocating or avoiding the point; we think he honestly means what he said, that these people will be provided with new homes. Let us see to it that homes are provided before they are moved from these slums. I think it will be conceded by the Minister that whatever may be the figures reflected in the official returns which come in as the result of the population census taken from time to time, he would be a very bold man who would be prepared to risk his money on the accuracy of the figures finally presented by the Bureau of Statistics. Whatever the reason may be, when you have the kind of population living under slum conditions, the census returns are entirely hopeless and inaccurate. Anyone who has tried to ascertain the precise number of people living in a slum will know what I am talking about. There is generally the greatest suspicion whenever a Government agent comes around making any inquiries, and when he starts making inquiries about the number of people living in a particular building then they are doubly suspicious, and there is no means of arriving at the correct figures. You have to take what you are given. The point I want to make is that so often when a slum has been condemned, after the most careful investigation in advance by qualified officials who know what the pitfalls are, when it comes to the rehousing of those people, where you thought you had to rehouse four you find you have to rehouse seven or eight people, and <span class="col_4941-4942" refersTo="page_1045"/>you wonder where they all came from. I made inquiries from a Coloured person in Durban in connection with the rehousing of Coloureds and I said I would like to know precisely what the position is because we get conflicting reports as to the total number of people living there and it is very necessary when dealing with this matter in Parliament to know precisely how many Coloured people there are. And they are not living in anything like the slum conditions the Coloured people live in in many of the towns in the Cape Province. We discussed the matter and he said to me: It is an interesting question because we were dealing with the matter the other day in connection with a Coloured school and we were given the official figures of a dwelling in which there lived a father, a mother and three children, but when an exact investigation was made it was found that no fewer than thirteen people lived in that house, five adults and eight children. Sir, that is the kind of thing that happens when you start clearing up slums. You find that the apparent housing units in the slum are not the number of housing units which will be required in the new township; you find that the new housing units are entirely inadequate to rehouse the people who lived in the slums. So I make this appeal to the Minister, that he should bear this matter in mind.</p>

<p>To come to the Bill itself, we know that the Minister in charge of this matter is now not the Minister of Health but the Minister of Housing. I know that there are certain hon. members who feel it is a pity that the emphasis is not laid on public health but on housing. I would sooner look upon it another way and say that we should lay the emphasis on the responsibility of the Government. It is the Government&#x2019;s responsibility and if the Government decides that the Minister of Housing should take this responsibility, for the reasons set out in the Bill, then that is the way to do it, and I am not going to quarrel because the Minister of Housing is entrusted with it now and not the Minister of Health.</p>

<p>Then there is set up a Slum Clearance Court. Here again there probably will be mixed feelings. The municipalities have had their own slum clearance committees and I must be quite honest that when I investigated the records of some of the municipalities to see how many years it is since those committees last sat, I found it was not for many years&#x2014;not that the town was free from slums, but that under the conditions with which they had to grapple with the problem the city fathers found that they would be inflicting a bigger injustice on hundreds of unfortunate people by moving them than by leaving them where they were. They had many practical difficulties to contend with. As I pointed out before, they were not allowed to make decisions, and they have lacked the funds. So a new Slum Clearance Court is being established which will probably facilitate the work. Then there is provision made for the failure of a municipality, and even for the failure of a medical officer of health to carry out his duty in regard to a recommendation in respect of any property which should be declared a slum. When it comes to the Minister&#x2019;s notice, he can step into the breach. He uses the Slum Clearance Court and he has other instruments at his disposal, and at the worst, he can bring in the district surgeon. But in his second reading speech the Minister has indicated that he does not intend using the district surgeon, but the Deputy Director of Health for the area concerned. That was one of the objections from this side of the House, but the Minister has cleared it up and it is no longer an objection. We are very pleased indeed that the Minister has taken that decision.</p>

<p>There is one other point I wish to deal with. That concerns the town planning schemes which have been drawn up by municipalities. I started off by saying that the housing schemes associated with slum clearance, or for other purposes, are little towns in miniature. They are part of the organic growth of a town. Some of our urban authorities have spent a great deal of time and money in preparing proper town planning schemes, visualizing the extension of their own borders, and I want to pay a tribute to the municipalities which did so. In the past many of our troubles, including many of the black belts, stemmed apparently from a lack of faith in the future of our country. People visualized their town as a complete one and apparently never visualized the growth that was inevitable, that villages would grow into towns and towns into cities, with the result that they allowed these black belts to grow up around them, except that there was special legislation both in Natal and in the Transvaal to cope with it. But even where the municipalities had town planning schemes, many of them failed to realize that even now we are only in the beginning of our development. We must realize that these towns will go on expanding and the time will come when what to-day are small towns will become big cities. Some of them have planned for it. I would ask the Minister to see to it that in these provisions for rehousing, as far as possible his rehousing schemes should fit in with the town planning schemes of those municipalities, so that there is co-operation throughout the whole of the activities and the organization which the Minister may bring into being as the result of this Bill, and that that co-operation will take place continuously with the appropriate committee of the municipality concerned. One of the things I hope will not happen is on the one hand that the Minister will get the feeling that because a town has slums to-day the municipality of that town has been neglecting its duty and that it is blameworthy, and on the other hand I hope that the municipalities will realize that in co-operating with the Minister they can use the machinery provided by him, more particularly now by reason of the fact that the basic trouble of the past has been overcome, namely the question of <span class="col_4943-4944" refersTo="page_1046"/>finance. The old system, under which there was inevitably losses to the municipality on the housing provided for the very poor sections of the people, is now a thing of the past. That was the big stumbling-block. The municipalities found it very hard to justify to their ratepayers the fact that they were incurring liability for the rehousing of the people living on a very low economic level. That is now behind us; the financial side has been cleared up, and it seems to me that the door is now open for the municipalities and the Minister to get together, and even where the Minister initiates a scheme he may, subject to certain guarantees, hand over that scheme to the municipality to complete and to administer, so that his Department is not involved in it any longer than is necessary. On the other hand, where the municipality cannot get on with the job, I suggest that it should co-operate with the Minister&#x2019;s Department, so that there will be as little friction as possible. The question of money, as I said, was the big stumbling-block in the past. Nobody liked to see an account building up against the municipal revenue fund as the result of the low economic stature of the people being rehoused. In that regard we have all had bitter experience. It is not one of the principles of this Bill that the people who are rehoused will be able to pay their rent or instalments. Now there need be no losses, but there is a concomitant responsibility inposed either on the Minister or the local authority to enforce compliance with the regulations by these new inhabitants, and that may be a very difficult proposition indeed, to enforce compliance with the financial regulations which will have to be imposed. If for no other reason than the necessity of working together in that regard I would urgently plead with the Minister to work in conjunction with the municipalities so that from that angle also there will be the greatest co-operation between his Department and the municipality. I do not think there is anything more I want to say. There are other speakers also on this side of the House. We give the Bill our blessing and we are prepared to vote for the second reading. We believe that the principle is a good one, and that the Minister is going to make an honest attempt to get rid of the slums. I hope he will go slowly at the start until he gets the feeling as to precisely how the thing is going with the municipalities which have been grappling with the problem for many years, and which can probably give him a good deal of advice and from their own experience show him where many of the pitfalls lie.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_spuy">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>In his introductory speech the hon. the Minister described this Bill as a declaration of war on slum conditions. I think that is the sort of declaration which every right-minded person will support with pleasure and I am also pleased that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has supported this Bill on behalf of his party, although I am sorry that he did so with so much verbosity, and apparently with his tongue in his cheek.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER SPUY</person>:</from>

<p>Then I say that he did it half-heartedly. In the first instance, the hon. member put up a defence for local authorities and their powers, and he then asked the Minister not to lose sight of certain procedures in the clearance of slums. Finally he deplored the fact that the administration was being transferred from Health to Housing. I find it regrettable that somebody who has been in public life for such a long time has not yet learned that one should not only sacrifice the bad in life for the sake of the good but that one should also sometimes sacrifice lesser values for the sake of greater values. During the course of my speech I hope to refer to certain of the aspects raised by the hon. member. I just want to deal with the final one to which he referred, namely the transfer to Housing.</p>

<p>In the first instance, I want to ask the hon. member whether he knows that it was merely by coincidence that the Housing Commission was under Health when the Slums Act was placed on the Statute Book in 1934, because it was not yet a separate department at that time. In other words it was the convergence of circumstances which brought that about. But in case that does not satisfy him I want to read to him what Dr. E. H. Cluver, who is generally recognized as an authority on health legislation, said in connection with this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Slums, because of the overcrowding and poverty associated with them, are productive of ill-health and other social evils, such as immorality and criminality generally.</block>

<p>In other words, poor housing in slum areas is really the reason for ill-health. As I have said, to refer to this Bill as a declaration of war, is to use very strong language indeed. I do not regard these measures which are now being embodied in legislation simply as measures to remedy the one or other defect; I simply regard this as another step in the process of development, a process which has a very long history and which time does not permit me to go into at the moment, but I do want to ask that this step which is being taken here to-day should be viewed against the background of the task which had to be performed in connection with housing and the clearance of slum conditions and particularly against the background of the achievements of the National Government as far as housing is concerned. The National Government really has a proud record as far as housing generally and <span class="col_4945-4946" refersTo="page_1047"/>the clearance of slum conditions are concerned. I do not want to make claims which I cannot prove. I want to give certain figures and I also want to quote what Mr. Patrick Lewis, the chairman of the Johannesburg non-European Affairs Committee, said. He alleged on one occasion that in 1939 there were 8,700 houses in the Johannesburg municipal area for 244,000 Bantu. That means an average of 28 per house. Thereafter there was a great influx to the city and he says that in 1946 there were no fewer than 395,000 Bantu in the municipal area of Johannesburg and more or less the same number of houses; in other words, on the average about 45 per house. I do not think I can do better than to quote what he said about the post-war conditions which this Government inherited. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These were the days of squatter camps and appalling living conditions owing to a shortage of materials and labour due to the concentration on the war effort. The task of providing decent living conditions seemed impossible, not only because of the cost of houses, but the cost of the provision of services which, in many instances, was more than the cost of the house.</block>

<p>Those were the conditions which this Government inherited when it had to tackle the task of clearing slums and providing housing. Mr. Speaker, it is not merely a question of money. Experience has taught us that money is not the answer to everything, and that was why the National Government, just as it is introducing this measure to-day, came forward with three very outstanding measures. I am merely referring to this in passing. In 1951 the Government introduced the Native Building Workers&#x2019; Act; the following year it introduced the Native Services&#x2019; Levies Act and in 1953 it accepted the site and service scheme as policy. I may tell you, Sir, that it was no mean task to get all these three measures accepted; there was strenuous opposition from the Opposition. What was the result of the application of this approach of the Government? The result was that those very bad conditions which I described a moment ago by quoting Mr. Lewis, have to-day been cleared up completely as far as the housing of non-Whites are concerned. After this problem had been solved by the practical approach and tact of this Government and partly with money provided by this Government, the City Council of Johannesburg published a beautifully illustrated brochure under the title &#x201C;Thousands for Houses&#x201D;. It is the same brochure from which the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) quoted previously. They say in this brochure that the entire backlog has been wiped out. They say that because they want to boast about this to their overseas friends and to the visitors to this great Bantu city. I can go further and quote from newspapers and show that the <i>Star,</i> for example, rapped a former city councillor of Johannesburg, Mr. Patmore, over the knuckles because he was supposed to have said that the present Prime Minister was a negrophilist because he had improved the housing conditions of the non-Whites to such an extent. I do not, however, want to wander as far as that away from the point. In view of the data I have submitted to this House, I wish to state, that South Africa, under the leadership of the National Party, has indeed become the leader in the world in the field of housing, particularly housing at a low cost. It is perhaps not very generally known but in this respect it is very important to know that the standard plans of the Department of Housing are to-day hanging in the offices of UNO in New-York, and what is more those plans are recommended for use throughout the world. I do not think therefore, that UNO is completely at sea in every respect. What is more UNO misses South Africa to such an extent as a member of the Committee of Technical Co-operation south of the Sahara, that through its African representative it even seeks information about housing at a low cost from Abyssinia to-day. But this Government has not only achieved a great deal in connection with the housing for non-Whites. It has also, as far as housing for Whites is concerned, achieved a great deal in co-operation with its research officials and experts, and in spite of the increase in the cost of material and wages since 1948 this Government has succeeded, with the assistance of its experts, in reducing building costs of houses for Whites by between 20 per cent to 25 per cent. I think that is an achievement of which any Government can be proud. Against this background the figures given by the hon. the Minister in his introductory speech assume far greater significance; they appear even more impressive: Over R301,000,000 for over 291,000 houses for Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu! I should like the Opposition to note the boastful language of the Johannesburg members in connection with the attainment of this achievement in co-operation with and wish the assistance of the National Government. It is essential that this point be emphasized because when these people entertain their friends in Johannesburg they refer to those achievements as the results of their policy, and when they address meetings on the platteland they suggest that we are negrophilists. The fact that, in spite of the Slum Act which has been on the Statute Book since 1934, there are still slums and that new slums have even come into existence, emphasizes the necessity that the existing machinery should be overhauled and amended. The first and most essential amendment in this regard is that the Department of Housing itself must, if necessary, take action. The first step taken in Clause 21 is to clothe the Secretary of Housing with the same powers, in certain circumstances, as those local authorities have. It is obvious that since the establishment of the Department of Housing in November 1961 a more positive housing policy has been followed. Because of that it has become essential for this Department also to have a say in the administration of the Slums Act, because the machinery is interwoven: <span class="col_4947-4948" refersTo="page_1048"/>Community Development proclaims group areas; Housing provides the loans and then you come up against the wall that local authorities are not always willing to undertake the clearance, not even in areas which have been declared as slums. I do not want to assume too much, but I think the reason why the United Party is really opposed to this measure is because they associate it with group areas, a system which they condemn basically. I want to give you examples, Sir, to substantiate what I have just said. I refer to District Six in the first place. Do you know, Sir, that there are areas in District Six which have been declared slum areas as long ago as 25 years, and what is more, in spite of the fact that Government loans are available, no development whatsoever has so far taken place in those areas. I want to give a second example, namely Sophiatown in Johannesburg. The clearance of Sophiatown as a slum area was approved as long ago as 1937 by the United Party controlled City Council of the day. Thereafter that decision was re-taken every second year, but what do we find? After the war when the problem had to be tackled and solved, that same City Council, of whom we have the honour of having two former mayors in our midst in the persons of the hon. members for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) and Florida (Mr. Miller), advanced all sorts of excuses. I am not saying that they were afraid of any trouble that might result on account of the clearance but I am convinced that the most important reason, which nobody mentioned, was the fact that the National Party was then in power in this country; that was why they were not prepared to co-operate as far as that important matter was concerned. As a matter of fact the Government had to establish the Bantu Resettlement Board to carry this out. Who will have the courage to allege that that gigantic task which was tackled with so much vigour and completed without striking a blow, has not been a benefit and a blessing to everybody? To prevent a similar situation from arising, it is necessary for the Secretary of Housing to have the same powers, in certain circumstances, as local authorities. It is also necessary for the Secretary not only to have the power to declare slums; he must also, where necessary, be able to provide housing in areas which have been declared slums&#x2014;and in this regard I refer to Clause 23 which I support. I wish to add that any local authority&#x2014;I am addressing this in particular to the hon. member for South Coast&#x2014;who may still be doubtful about this measure, can be reassured by what the hon. the Minister said in his introductory speech, namely that it was not his intention or that of his Department to take the work out of the hands of those local authorities who were indeed prepared to carry on with the work. Furthermore Clause 22 (2) provides that the Secretary of Housing can step back in those cases where the local authorities continue with the work. I really think that any local authority who is still afraid after the Minister&#x2019;s assurance, that, once this provision is passed, their powers may be encroached upon, is really not being realistic.</p>

<p>I want to refer to Clause 3 which provides for the establishment of a slum clearance court in place of the old municipal slum court. The old system of a municipal slum court had very far-reaching effects, although it was accepted as such with the passage of time. In actual fact it amounted to this that that slum court which was at the same time the complainant, the Judge and the sheriff affected the rights of the owner. That is probably the only sphere of our life where that is tolerated and where it will be tolerated. As opposed to that, the clause to which I have just referred provides for an independent body, a slum clearance court, a proper legal body, as against the old quasi-judicial slum court of the municipalities. This body will be under the chairmanship of a magistrate or a former magistrate assisted by two members with a knowledge of housing conditions in that city. I think a court constituted as this one and which is independent will enjoy the higher esteem of the broad masses of the public than the former quasi-judicial body. A very important point I wish to raise in connection with this slum clearance court is the fact that this slum clearance court will lift the thorny question of declaring an area a slum area out of the political arena. This matter is really more serious than it appears at the first glance. I have already referred to the unwillingness on the part of the Johannesburg Municipality after the change of Government in the country as far as Sophiatown was concerned. There are, however, circumstances connected with group areas, for example, in other legislation where the local authority may be opposed to that legislation and that it refuses, for that reason alone, to continue with the declaration of slum areas and that that body, which consists of a committee of the local authority, will, of course, not continue with that task. I may mention that the possibility is not wholly excluded under the old system that some of those councillors may be slum owners and that may give rise to all sorts of abuses. I also want hon. members to consider the position of a municipal health official who, for example, says that slum conditions exist at certain premises and recommends that those premises be declared a slum when those premises belong to one of the councillors who is opposed to that recommendation and who is in a position to use his influence to oppose the declaration of a slum, and, what is more, to use his influence against the official concerned. I think the new system eliminates a serious abuse. We heartily welcome it, therefore. I also want to say this that the fact that the court will consider a specific case on a full-time basis ought to shorten the proceedings considerably. I think it will be conducive to far greater efficiency than in the case of the old slum court.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I heartily support this Bill, also that I hope it will be <span class="col_4949-4950" refersTo="page_1049"/>the forerunner of a slum-clearance policy and slum-clearance plan of which, I think, we are in dire need at this stage.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) who has just sat down should bear in mind the fact that although this Act was originally placed on the Statute Book in 1934 and amended only in 1937, no effort has been made since that date by the previous Government or the present Government particularly to amend it in any way. In spite of what the hon. member has said about the United Party and the question of slum clearance, the fact remains that this is the first occasion on which the Government has come forward to deal with this particular Act. It may well be that the reason is that now that a Ministry for Community Development has been established, more emphasis is being placed on the housing side rather than on the health side to enable the Minister of Community Development to initiate some active work in the housing field. Sir, nobody has deprecated that fact, and one is therefore surprised at this extraordinary attack which the hon. member who has just sat down has made upon the United Party. He has singled out the city of Johannesburg in particular in order to show his approval of the terms of this Bill. His attitude differs very markedly from that of the Minister who did try to place the provisions of this Bill and his reasons for its introduction before the House as objectively as possible. It sometimes helps when one has an objective approach to matters of this kind because it enables both sides of the House to view the matter dispassionately, to weigh up the pros and the cons and to decide what support it could give to any measure that is introduced by the Government. The hon. member who has just sat down has made some very peculiar assumptions and has tried to give the House certain information which is entirely incorrect.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of slum clearance in Johannesburg, I would like the hon. member to note that low-cost housing was certainly the outcome of the research and investigation of the City Council of Johannesburg, who were able for the first time to show the world that the principle of bringing down building costs to the level of the income of the people occupying them was a feasible proposition. The City Council&#x2014;in fact the whole country&#x2014;was faced in the post-war years with the problem of a shortage of labour and a shortage of material and a shortage of finance. The problem that faced large municipalities in regard to the question of slum clearance and squatters&#x2019; camps was how to bring about an improvement in the conditions. The hon. member must know that the Town Council of Springs was the first local authority which was able to make some contribution towards the provision of low-cost housing in its Kwatema Native Township. He must also know that the town engineer of Springs who then joined the staff of the City Council of Johannesburg as its housing director was able to bring about low-cost housing on a scale previously unheard of in this country, where a four-roomed brick house, with fencing and water, was built at as low a figure as R308. He must also know that the work of the Native Resettlement Board in building Meadowlands was based on the experimentation of the City Council of Johannesburg and its original township of Mofolo, which was the first Bantu township in which an experiment was made in regard to lowcost housing. But. Sir, this side of the House in supporting the Bill does not necessarily seek any kudos in this respect. Our only concern is to examine the Bill as the Minister has brought it before the House. I think the first Housing Act was passed by the United Party Government and its predecessors; the Slums Act was passed by the United Party Government and its predecessors, because all Governments must necessarily take an interest in the health of the community and ensure that the health of the community is maintained in the best possible manner. The very authority whom the hon. member quoted was the Secretary for Health under the previous Government. We had men like Sir Edward Thornton, the then Secretary for Health, under whose aegis tremendous strides were made in the field of housing and in the field of slum clearance. Sir. I must say that we deprecate the fact that a member on that side comes here and in an attempt to criticize this side, not only talks with his tongue in his cheek, but in a half-hearted way and then asks the Minister not to lose sight of certain procedural matters and not to loose sight of certain other problems which this amending Bill may bring about. Sir, that is our purpose; our purpose is to support the Bill if in principle it has merit but at the same time to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to certain aspects of the Bill and certain of its clauses. Sir, one of the objects of the Slums Act is obviously to bring about slum clearance and to protect the health of the community. Naturally one watches very jealously the traditional rights of the local authorities of this country. On the other hand, if the Minister feels that a slum-clearance court as a separately constituted body may be more effective, then one cannot deny that that may well be the case. Perhaps the hon. the Minister might consider the question of either increasing the membership of the board or substituting one member of the board by a representative of the local authority, whether it be a City Council, Town Council, Health Board or a Village Management Board. One will then have the necessary liaison between the local authority which is concerned with the immediate needs of the community and this independent body.</p>

<p>The other question that arises is that in terms of the Act it is the local authority&#x2019;s medical officer of health who has to report whether in his opinion slum conditions exist. The hon. the Minister has already brought about an improvement by substituting for the district surgeon a regional health officer, and I wonder whether he cannot go a little further <span class="col_4951-4952" refersTo="page_1050"/>and allow the medical officer of health of the local authority to continue even where in terms of Clause 21 the Minister has reason to doubt that the local authority is effectively performing the duties imposed upon it under the principal Act, because the clause does not suggest that the Minister has reason to doubt that the official is effectively carrying out his duties but that the local authority is effectively carrying out his duties. The medical officer of health of the local authority is enjoined by law to do certain things. The Act as it now stands says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever the medical officer of health is of the opinion that any condition exists which does not conform with the requirements of the Second Schedule; that any premises or part thereof are in such a state or so situated or so dirty or so verminous as to be injurious or dangerous to health &#x2026;</block>

<p>The medical officer of health has a duty imposed upon him by law, which is not being interfered with by this amending Bill. I do not really see why the medical officer of health should not continue to perform those services. Where the Minister is dissatisfied with what the local authority is doing, the slums court can quite easily deal with the report of the medical officer of health, because the medical officer of health who is simply an official would not act any differently from the regional officer. For instance, he would not fail to report if he finds that certain undesirable conditions exist. He would report in the same way as it would be reported by a regional health officer who is asked to look into a certain set of circumstances. If the Minister will concede that matter, because it is a matter of principle, he will be going a long way to satisfy the local authority in maintaining that important link between itself and the citizens. I feel that the Minister could go a little further than the concession he has already made. In that sense we might to a great extent preserve, not only the prerogative, but a field of activity which I feel is important in the interests of the community.</p>

<p>The other question that arises is this. I think the hon. the Minister will concede that for years, particularly the post-war period, it was very difficult to get sufficient money from the National Housing Commission. The demand was so great from all local authorities throughout the country in order to catch up with the back-log in housing that it was very difficult for them to get adequate funds. Local authorities had to be satisfied with less than their real requirements. One might even be critical of the priorities that were granted. Some local authorities felt that they should have priority above others but that is not the field which I want to enter at this stage. I merely wish to confine myself to the point that local authorities were unable to carry on with their work because of the inability to obtain the necessary funds. I notice from the Minister&#x2019;s statement that the National Housing Commission will provide money for electricity, water and other services. At one time however you could not get that money. The Natives Service Levy Act was specially passed to enable local authorities to have some source from which money for services could be drawn because the State and the National Housing Commission were unable to give sufficient money to provide not only for housing but also for services. The Minister will remember the National Housing Commission&#x2019;s outlook at the time, namely that they would provide the money to buy the land and to build the house but nothing more.</p>

<p>I think the Act at that time provided only for the building of a house. Because the local authorities had difficulty in finding the money to finance the services, they found it very difficult to make any progress with their housing schemes. The hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) who is not here at the moment, also knows that as soon as moneys became readily available for services the City Council of Johannesburg was able to provide housing for the Bantu at the rate of 10,000 per annum. That drew world attention to the progress that was being made in the erection of low-cost housing. Those are the plans, I think he said, that are presently hanging on the walls of the United Nations administrative offices. Those are the plans that they would like to put in operation right throughout Africa. In fact the housing engineer who is responsible for that in Johannesburg is now in Mauritius where he is in charge of a building programme amounting to &#x00A3;6,000,000; a programme which is based on the same low-cost basis. We are all very proud of what South Africa has achieved in that direction. I think the hon. the Minister said in the peroration to his address that he was sure that every South African would support any attempt that is made to promote the work that had been done in this field. I do not ithink any party or section of the community should claim any particular credit for this tremendous service that was rendered to the country. Despite the fact that there were differences of opinion between the Government and the local authority with regard to the site and service scheme, those differences were far beyond the political pale. Those differences of opinion were with regard to the method of providing good housing at a low cost with all the necessary services. The hon. Minister is well aware that you cannot embark on a housing scheme to-day unless you are able to provide all the amenities. Even in towns and cities where it is difficult to install sewerage, it is most desirable in order to complete the necessary amenities. Some of the local authorities were held up because of their inability to find the necessary funds to provide a satisfactory sewerage system. The fact that the Minister has conceded that in providing funds for housing schemes the Housing Commission will find all the necessary funds for the necessary services, is an important statement which has been placed on record.</p>

<p><span class="col_4953-4954" refersTo="page_1051"/>There are certain other aspects to which attention must be drawn. The question of alternative accommodation had already been raised by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). That is a very important feature. The Minister knows, for example, that in regard to Coloured housing in large local authorities&#x2014;I shall deal with Johannesburg which I know better&#x2014;it was necessary to obtain the land, it was necessary to obtain the funds from the commission and it was necessary to come to an agreement with the commission with regard to the planning of those houses. He knows the areas to which I am referring. It took a long time before those schemes were eventually concluded. Once all those negotiations were successfully concluded the building of the houses progressed very rapidly. You are in a position to tackle the question of slum clearance once you are able to offer alternative accommodation. I think the Minister has given an assurance on a previous occasion that he would not make use of the Group Areas Act, with its stringent provisions, unless he was able to provide alternative accommodation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am not reading a newspaper; I am preparing an extract from it.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>It is important that alternative accommodation should be provided. Slum clearance can be tackled very effectively in some large cities to-day in order to comply with what was said by one of the previous speakers in supporting this Bill, but it would throw a considerable number of people out of their homes and all the evils which we try to eliminate by way of slum clearance, will immediately come into play because without homes you must of necessity get squatter conditions and all sorts of contraventions of the health laws. As long as the Minister gives us the assurance that the Housing Commission will act rapidly in this matter and that the stringent provisions of this amending Bill will only become operative when there is alternative housing, he will earn the approval of the community. I do not think some local authorities in this country should be criticized. They have already voiced the fear that this amending Bill might possibly be used to make the Group Areas Act a little more effective. If one has to narrow the whole essence of this Bill to slum clearance, if we have an assurance in regard to alternative accommodation, the fact that this may have some incidental purposes cannot be used to detract from the fact that slum clearance is very important in our country.</p>

<p>The other question which I think is important is the question of maintaining much closer liaison with local authorities. I think the hon. the Minister might possibly introduce a further amendment and that is for the Slums Court to indicate its decision to the Town Clerk. In other words, it should maintain close liaison between itself and the Town Clerk or the administrative officer of any particular local authority in respect of which the Slums Court has been established. I think that is very important. I think that when there is a fear on the part of a local authority that certain traditional rights will be removed or that certain prerogatives which they have enjoyed over a number of years will be curtailed, or that any action might be initiated which might inconvenience the sociological life of the community itself, and for which the local authority has an intimate responsibility, the Minister should ensure that there is sufficient liaison between the body that he is constituting and the local authority so that they will work together with confidence. The local authority should have the necessary confidence in the Slums Court and the Slums Court should have sufficient confidence in the local authority to enable them to work together. I do not think that in a matter such as this where senior officials are concerned there can be any question of politics. The question of the health of the community is certainly outside the pale of purely narrow political considerations. The fear which municipalities originally expressed was that there might be friction, for example, between the district surgeon and the medical officer of health. I think the hon. the Minister has met the position by substituting &#x201C;regional health officer&#x201D; for &#x201C;district surgeon&#x201D;. I still feel however that the suggestion that the medical officer of health of the local authority should continue in all his capacities is a much better suggestion and that it will allay the fears of there being any friction between the local authority and the Slums Court itself.</p>

<p>There has been certain criticism of local authorities holding back when an area has been declared to be a slum area, and where that local authority has given certain extensions of time. The Minister must know that the only reason why those extensions are granted is the fact that they are unable to provide alternative accommodation. I should also like to have an assurance from the Minister on another aspect. The idea that the Housing Commission should take over an area which has been declared a slum area and develop that area together with adjoining areas is very commendable if the hon. Minister will give the assurance that his objective is to take action in that respect. I know of areas in Johannesburg where the buildings have been razed to the ground. In one instance there has been a dispute between the local authority and the National Housing Commission which has lasted for some seven years as to the purpose for which that area is to be used. It is situated in a highly industrialized area. Some people are of the opinion that in order to provide low-cost housing for Whites in this particular city an ordinary housing scheme should be developed in that area. Others are <span class="col_4955-4956" refersTo="page_1052"/>of the opinion that an industrial scheme should be developed there. The owners particularly are of the opinion that it should be developed industrially because to develop a housing scheme there would involve them in considerable losses. That situation has existed for nearly seven years. I do not know why the Housing Commission has not taken some sort of action; perhaps they are unable to do so unless they are empowered in terms of this Bill. That is something which the Minister should take into account namely where it would be too expensive to erect fresh houses in an area which has been demolished as a slum area. It may be too expensive firstly, because of its close proximity to the city, and secondly because of the progressive increase in the value of land. How the Minister will meet that situation I do not know, but it is an important matter which will have to be taken into account. The member who spoke before me referred, for instance, to District Six. Assuming there were to be a clearing of houses in District Six that is hardly an area where you will provide ordinary housing. If you provide very cheap housing there it will not take very long for fresh slum conditions to develop there. That is an area where you will either have to provide commercial or industrial types of structures. That is the case in all big cities where slum conditions have developed in close proximity to the city itself. We have that position in Johannesburg and they probably have it in Durban as well. I wonder whether the Minister has given thought to that particular difficulty which may well arise. It is an aspect which I think deserves his consideration.</p>

<p>By and large, say for some of the matters which were raised and which we will deal with in the Committee Stage, we are supporting this Bill. There are no partisan interests in doing so. It is to be regretted that a partisan interest has entered this discussion. Judging from the Minister&#x2019;s statement I was surprised at what followed. I trust, in view of the attitude of the hon. member for South Coast, that the note will rather be on the positive aspect of this amending Bill and not on the negative aspects of refighting the wars of years gone by. I think, as far as a measure of this nature is concerned, a measure which deals with the health of a community, the level of our discussions should be on a very much higher level than to refight the wars of earlier years.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) said at the beginning of his speech that he wanted to reply to the alleged attack made by the hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) on the City Council of which he was formerly a member and of which he also had the honour of being the mayor at one time. It is not my intention to become involved in that quarrel. What struck me was that the hon. member quite extolled the work of the City Council concerned. You expect that, Sir. I am a former mayor of Pretoria and as such think in turn that Pretoria has set a good example as far as housing is concerned.</p>

<p>As a neighbour, at the time, of the city which the hon. member for Florida represents, I just want to refer to a difficulty which was experienced in connection with the clearance of various places in Johannesburg. If I remember correctly, I associate Sophiatown with certain happenings; I also have in mind Page View, Martindale and Newclare. I do not, however, want to go further into that; those are sins of the past.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to traditional rights or powers which may possibly be taken away from local authorities. I want to emphasize the fact that the main idea of this Bill is not to encroach on any existing rights or powers of local authorities but simply to clear up slum conditions and to encourage housing. It is not necessary to advocate the necessity of clearing slum conditions in any community, whether it be a city community or a town community. We are all agreed upon that. Slum conditions generally disfigure a city or a town as a result of the unsightly appearance of those slum conditions. A further result of slum conditions is that the morals and the health of the people in that area are undermined. They also lead to evils in various spheres. They create a very fertile seedbed for social as well as economic evils. We have heard such a great deal about seedbeds lately! Even from the broad political point of view it is very desirable and necessary that those areas be cleared up.</p>

<p>The Slums Act of 1934, Act No. 53, embodies two aspects, namely the health and housing aspect. The health aspect is over-emphasized and we are very pleased that emphasis is placed on it, because it covers the health of the entire community, non-White as well as White. The housing aspect is expressed as follows in the relevant Act. Section 3 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It shall be the duty of the local authority to take all lawful, necessary and reasonably practical measures&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) for preventing or remedying or causing to be prevented or remedied all nuisances in its district, and</li>

<li>(b) for ensuring the provision of suitable housing generally and as far as circumstances permit for the inhabitants of its district</li>

</ol>

<p>Since the Slums Act was placed on the Statute Book 30 years ago circumstances generally have changed greatly&#x2014;economic circumstances have improved. It is essential that the law be changed in such a way that it conforms to those changed circumstances and that it meets the new demands. It is also necessary to streamline the machinery so that it will conform to the fast improving circumstances so that the original object of the Act can be achieved as far as housing is concerned. The key clauses, to which hon. members have already <span class="col_4957-4958" refersTo="page_1053"/>referred, are Nos. 3, 21, 22 and 23. These clauses are self-explanatory and in his second-reading speech the hon. the Minister gave us a very full and crystal clear exposition as a matter of fact he outlined the objects and the principles very clearly.</p>

<p>This is the first time that the Government has really given the green light, by way of legislation, for the clearance of slums. The clearance of slums in city and town areas, with the accompanying provision of housing and city restoration projects, will either be initiated or, if necessary, tackled by the State. The clearance programme, as such, should nevertheless be initiated by local authority, provided the local authorities remain active. The State will, if it gives the necessary incentive to local authorities in connection with the clearance of slums, only activate and will not dominate the local authorities or take the work over from them. Any doubts about this legislation which may exist in this connection are quite unfounded.</p>

<p>Many local authorities have tried to clear unsightly slums to the best of their ability and have provided better housing facilities on those premises. The inhabitants of that city or town as well as the country are grateful to those local authorities. The remarks of the hon. member for South Coast in connection with the semblance of criticism expressed by the hon. the Minister, are misplaced. The Minister has on various occasions emphasized the fact that he had the highest regard and gratitude for the work which city councils were doing in this connection, but that there were nevertheless certain local authorities who were not doing their duty. The position is not what it should be in the case of many local authorities. The difficulty is that some of them, where group areas have already been proclaimed, lack the will and perhaps the desire to clear up the slum conditions and to put the State assistance plans in operation in the interests of their inhabitants. In other words, it seems as if the initiative or the desire is lacking in the case of some local authorities, on the one hand, to clear slum conditions and, on the other hand, to establish the accompanying necessary housing for those people who had to vacate those slums. Some authorities have grasped at every offer and have availed themselves of every opportunity to get the funds to erect housing in order to meet the housing shortage. In this connection I wish to refer to the City Council which I represent and of which I had the honour of being the mayor at one time. That City Council applied for more funds that could be made available to it. There are other local authorities who were in the same position. Although those local authorities made use of every opportunity in that way there are nevertheless those who did not likewise avail themselves of their opportunities. It is essential, therefore, that the existing Act be amended in this way so that it will be possible to clear up slum conditions in those urban areas where the municipalities are perhaps not sufficiently energetic to do their direct duty in this-regard and where the inhabitants suffer in consequence. Many of the difficulties and objections which local authorities may have had, must necessarily fall away in view of this more positive and more effective effort on the part of the Department to streamline the whole question of housing. The Department of Housing has already made the offer to local authorities to provide them with technical and professional advice. Furthermore, housing plans, with a view to maximum accommodation at minimum costs, are made available free of charge and in this connection one should refer to the work which is being done by the building research institute of the C.S.I.R. Local authorities are no longer expected to carry any losses in connection with the provision of houses in view of the fact that the State has even undertaken to bear any interest losses. That is a very great concession and a great relief to local authorities; a great burden is being taken off their shoulders. Apart from that, in order to lighten the burden which rests on local authorities, the National Housing Commission decided in 1962 to make funds available to local authorities, if they wish it, for such service as water and electricity where a necessary scheme had to be carried out. The costs of professional and technical services required in order to carry out a specific scheme can also be a charge against the cost of the scheme and thus paid by the lessee or the buyer.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to congratulate the Department of Housing and in particular the Minister on this forward step in connection with housing; it is unnecessary for any friction to exist between the department on the one hand and a local authority on the other hand, a local authority which may perhaps not be able to tackle the task of slum clearance. There can still always be very wonderful and harmonious co-operation. We on this side of the House are pleased to be able to say that great progress has been made in respect of housing over the past few years and I am convinced that, as a result of the few aspects which are being put right in this legislation, we are facing a wonderful and rosy future as far as housing is concerned.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Any legislation which will accelerate the clearance of slums must be welcomed by all concerned. Therefore we intend to support this Bill, even if there are one or two aspects of the Bill with which we do not agree. But in principle we want to assist in the clearance of slums. I hope, however, that the same mistake will not be made under this Bill as I believe was made under the first Act of 1934. I remember that when I was a member of the Cape Town City Council, the point of view which I held then was that you must not declare property slums and have the people leave those slums until proper alternative accommodation for the slum-dwellers has been provided. If that had been done in 1934, there would have been less slums to-day. The authorities were so anxious in 1934 to declare <span class="col_4959-4960" refersTo="page_1054"/>property slums that they declared thousands of property slums, and people had to leave. But where did they have to go to? They left and went to relatives and friends in other places and over-crowded those houses which had provided decent homes, and so they created fresh slums. It became a vicious circle. I know in the area where I practised there were beautiful little homes all to-day probably on the verge of being declared slums because of that situation. I hope the hon. Minister and his Department have benefited from the mistakes which were made in 1934.</p>

<p>Sir, I believe too that sub-economic houses all tend to become slums. They must become slums, and I think the hon. Minister and I are in agreement when I say that the ideal for any country would be the doing away of sub-economic houses. Those houses of necessity are built to meet the economic standard of the people who occupy them and are built in such a manner and so cheaply as to become slums in a very short time. There again we perpetuate this vicious circle. We try to get people out of slums, we put them into little homes, and then those little homes become slums again, and so you get this vicious circle. I am in good company when I put forward that view, because, Mr. Speaker, only on 17 April, there was an article in the <i>Argus</i> (the Minister undoubtedly has read it) which was headed &#x201C;Higher Sub-Economic Standards urged at Housing Talks&#x201D;, and in that article Mr. Owen, chairman of the Cape Divisional Housing Committee points out that under the one Act certain types of houses were being built and under another Act those houses could not conform with the standards laid down.</p>

I may for the benefit of the House repeat that such houses are built with no inside walls, no ceiling and they have cement floors. The point is that that house from my point of view is completely unhealthy and it causes a lot of illness.

<p>No, it has nothing to do with the Department of Coloured Affairs or with the Department of Housing. I accept that, but I think it is the Parow Municipality building those houses.</p>

<p>There is one aspect in regard to slums that I want to deal with and that is the position of a person who just cannot pay the rent, who cannot pay anything at all. I have not got the latest figures but to put my point I will deal with figures supplied in 1957. There were 2,100 families, comprising about 15,000 people, who were earning under &#x00A3;10 a month. I believe that roughly that number is still the same to-day. People who earn under &#x00A3;10 per month, cannot even pay a sub-economic rent. These are the people that create slums. They have to find some sort of place to sleep in, and unless something is done for that income group, the very, very low income-group earning under &#x00A3;10 a month, we will always have this situation of the creation of slums, because wherever they go to, they will create slum conditions. Our duty therefore is, from the economic point of view to see to it that people earn sufficient to pay some sort of rental and not be the creators of slum conditions wherever they go.</p>

<p>Take the better-paid people. There too the Government has demanded far too low a standard of income to pay economic rentals. That question should also be gone into. A man with a family who earns his &#x00A3;25 or &#x00A3;35 a month, cannot afford to pay an economic rental. It is beyond the amount which he can afford. A man earning &#x00A3;25 a month, cannot pay &#x00A3;5 a month in rent. There too they bring in lodgers and relations and they join together for economic reasons and then again raising slum conditions. I am not attacking the Government in this connection. It is something which has been with us for many a day, and it will probably remain with us for many years, but with all the good intentions of the Minister to do away with slums, he will not succeed as long as that position obtains where people will continuously create slums. Therefore I say that hand-in-hand with slum clearance must go the uplifting of the people economically, and unless you do that, all that the hon. Minister is trying to achieve under this Bill will be to a great extent nullified. I think legislation is required which will lay down a minimum wage to enable people to live decently, in decent homes. Not only this Government, but also previous governments, have had to face the question of housing. Each one has done its best to build houses for the poor people, but if you do not force people to pay a minimum economic wage to the poorer people, you will never do away with slums. Unless that is done, I am afraid we are wasting a lot of money. In fairness I think I should deal with an area which is frequently thrown at the City Council of Cape Town as an example of the inability of the Council to grapple with this problem, that is the Windermere section. The hon. Minister will be pleased to hear that I have information to indicate that that area has been tackled very bravely. I see the hon. Minister smiles. If the acceleration of the slum-clearance there was not as fast as the hon. Minister would have like it &#x2026;</p>

<p>I know all about Windermere. You cannot tell me anything about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that Windermere has always been a disgrace, but in fairness to the City Council of Cape Town I must point out that in 1958, they replied to an article in the <i>Burger</i> about Windermere, and they dealt in that reply with the Windermere-Factreton area&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This area has been planned to form a single entity providing a major housing scheme for Coloureds. The Factreton site, where slum properties have been purchased and demolished by the City Council has been completely transformed by the construction of more than 1,200 new houses which have been let to Coloured families.</block>

<p>The remaining section of the Windermere-Factreton Scheme, i.e. the Windermere slum <span class="col_4963-4964" refersTo="page_1056"/>area is to be redeveloped on a home-ownership basis for Coloureds, providing for the building of some 600 houses, but before development can take place at Windermere, it will be necessary to acquire additional properties at an estimated cost of &#x00A3;100,000. For some years past, the funds made available by the Government for housing throughout the country have been severely limited and all housing-loan funds have been ear-marked for the building of houses in fully approved housing schemes. Consequently, housing-loan moneys for the large-scale acquisition of slum properties, such as is the case at Windermere, have not been readily available.</p>

<p>That was in 1958, therefore five years ago. I do not know whether that position has changed and whether the Minister has made more funds available. If he has, we ought to be grateful to him and I hope that if the City Council of Cape Town or any other municipality has failed in its duty to clear slums, the Minister should be assisted in his attempt to clear those slums. But once more, I want to warn the Minister that if he intends to accelerate slum-clearance under this Bill without making provision for alternative accommodation for the people who will have to leave their houses in the slums, the Minister will fail as they have failed since 1944 to grapple with this problem successfully. I therefore hope that the Minister will heed my warning. Otherwise I am afraid with all the goodwill in the world, he will not succeed.</p>

<p>Where the Minister comes along with a Bill in which he states his policy very positively, and seriously intends to clear up slums, we have the position that hitherto all the hon. members who participated in this debate kept it on a very high level, but then the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) entered the debate, and the first thing he did was to warn the Minister. He hurls threats at the Minister, and he is busy sowing suspicion. He said: &#x201C;I want to warn the Minister&#x201D;. The hon. member did not make a positive contribution to the debate. He is not trying to help the Minister to clear up slums.

<p>If such conditions exist as the hon. member alleges, surely the Minister is trying by means of this Bill to clear up such areas. But instead of assisting the Minister and explaining to these people that this Bill will help to clear up those areas (if conditions there are as bad as he described) and to resettle these people in a different place, he just sows suspicion. The hon. member alleges that the type of house built to-day is too cheap and does not come up to the standard he would like. But in the same breath he says that the rental is too high and that these people cannot afford it. Now I ask who has to pay for it? Is it not better to have subeconomic rentals and to house more of these people? Or does he want these people again to go and live in hessian shacks as they did before?</p>

<p>There has been much discussion in this House this afternoon as to whom the father of housing for the non-Whites is. We do not blame the members of the Johannesburg City Council, or the hon. members who now represent Johannesburg in Parliament, for trying to claim that they were partially responsible for it, but I think they are going too far when they claim that the Johannesburg City Council is the one <i>par excellence</i> which made cheap housing possible. Is it not a fact that the first man who thought of cheap housing for Natives was a Mr. Schreuder of Port Elizabeth? Is it not a fact that the father of housing is the Prime Minister of this country? Not only did he attend the birth of that child, but he cared for it and reared it. It is the Prime Minister of South Africa who made available cheap and efficient housing for the non-Whites. He is the man who, together with the National Housing Commission, did research in regard to cheap housing, and it is the Prime Minister and the National Housing Commission who should be given all the credit for what they have done to provide cheap housing in the Republic. We are grateful for the co-operation which was obtained from local authorities, but the City Council of Johannesburg&#x2014;I do not want to fight with them this afternoon&#x2014;should just remember that they are on record as being one of the city councils which were very obstinate in regard to co-operating in order to solve the housing problem. Let us give credit where it is due, and I say that credit is due firstly to the present Prime Minister of South Africa and the National Housing Commission, who worked together in this respect. The Minister is now introducing a Bill which will facilitate slum clearance. We want to thank the Minister for this positive action he is now taking. We want to thank all the city councils who have helped us to have beautiful cities in South Africa to-day. Our cities have developed in a very orderly fashion. But with the discovery of gold and diamonds and the expansion of our ports and the great industrial development in the Witwatersrand complex, in Cape Town, Port Elizabeth and Durban, this development proceeded at such a tempo that eventually <span class="col_4965-4966" refersTo="page_1057"/>slums developed. But with the means at the disposal of the local authorities and with the assistance of the Slums Act of 1934, the City Councils to the best of their ability tried to prevent slums developing, and to clear up those which had developed. But as time went on, and as the result of the shortage of funds, the city councils fell into arrears in this connection. We find that as the result of the positive attitude adopted by this Government in regard to the clearing up of non-White slum areas, the non-Whites to-day are being housed very decently. But the Minister realizes that, with this new dispensation we now have, and where to-day he is in charge of community development, and with the emphasis being laid on housing to a greater extent than it was previously laid on health, we are falling into arrears in regard to slum clearance; and the Minister wants to assist the city councils and he is introducing a Bill which does not seek to deprive the city councils of powers, but which grants the city councils greater powers to clear up slums if they are prepared to co-operate. It is non-sense for any city council to say to-day that it is being deprived of powers. But one of the obstacles which was always in the way of a city council&#x2019;s deciding whether an area should be declared to be a slum was conflicting interests. It was not so easy for the city council to decide to declare an area a slum because there were always conflicting interests. The medical officer of health did his duty and submitted his report to the council, but when the report was submitted the council hesitated to take steps. The medical officer did his duty, but it usually took months before a decision could be reached on the matter. Now the Minister tells the city councils: I am removing what has always been an obstacle in your way and I am giving you a Slum Clearance Court. The hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) explained very clearly the problems with which we were faced formerly. I think this Slum Clearance Court will contribute towards slums being cleared up more expeditiously. But I want to tell the Minister this. Where the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) asked that there should be a certain measure of liaison between the Slum Clearance Court and the city councils, I have no objection to that, but I want to ask the Minister to see to it that when they have submitted that report to the council it should be a final report, and no more negotiations should be allowed to take place between the council and the court, because that will just lead to delay.</p>

<p>I have no objection to their being given notice so that there may be co-operation, but from experience we know what delaying tactics there can be if the city council is able again to make representations to that body. Where the Minister places this Bill on the Statute Book, we are convinced that he, as he said, had declared war on slums, and we are convinced that he and his Department will tackle the problem forcefully, and to those who are sceptical in regard to the matter we just want to say that they should go and look at what has already been done by the Minister and the Department.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I should like to refer to and which in my humble opinion may be a contributory factor to the existence of slum areas. It is the practice in the Cape Province to levy a tax on improvements to properties. I think the time has arrived for a thorough investigation to be made as to whether this tax on improvements does not lead to people refusing to improve their buildings, with the result that slums develop, because the worse the condition of the building the less tax one pays. I wonder whether the system should not be applied right throughout the country whereby one pays only a tax on the site, instead of the system of double taxation where one pays taxation on the site as well as on any improvements. I think that is a matter which should be investigated to see whether perhaps it is not one of the reasons why there are so many slums.</p>

<p>We hope and trust that the city councils will all welcome this Bill and co-operate with the Minister, because the Opposition has also said that they want to co-operate to clear up these ugly conditions, so that our cities may really be a credit to this beautiful and sunny land.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, up to now the ex-Mayors of Brakpan, Pretoria and Johannesburg (two of them!) have intervened in this debate and I think this is becoming a &#x201C;Mayors&#x2019; nest&#x201D;, but let us not lose sight of the fact that when the Minister introduced the second reading, he said that not only does this Bill relieve the city councils of an unpleasant duty, but it also completely removes the question of slum clearance from the local political arena, which might well result in action being taken more freely. Yet the very first speaker on the Government side this afternoon, the hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy), immediately dragged this matter into the political arena. There was the Minister telling the House that this was a matter which should be taken out of the political arena, and yet the hon. member, the first one to support it this afternoon on his side, said: Let us have a political fight over this. Well, I do not want to play politics in regard to slum clearance, but certain allegations which have been made must be either true or false, and I propose to examine them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Westdene took the liberty of accusing the Johannesburg City Council, and he said there were two exmayors of Johannesburg sitting here virtually cheek by jowl&#x2014;neither of us is to blame for this proximity!

As hon. members know, the reason was the fact that there was a deprivation of free-hold title. Is that true or false?</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Three people have made this accusation against us and I think I should, at least, be allowed to answer briefly. [Interjection.] Even if one were to assume that the United Party in the City Council of Johannesburg was wrong in adopting the stand it did in regard to freehold title, at least hon. members who criticized the United Party are well aware of the fact that that stand was taken honestly and in good faith, and that it was not the intention of the City Council to frustrate the Government in regard to any slum clearance scheme. Sir, I could develop this theme with your co-operation, but I am afraid I will not get it. It is all very well to use this Bill as a political argument against one city which happens to be a city where there is this so-called political control, but surely the intention of this Bill was not to deal with one particular city, or with two or three, but with South Africa as a whole. Therefore I can only say that whereas I deprecate the fact that these issues have been dragged into the debate, the rights and wrongs of the attitude of the Johannesburg City Council, I merely want to dispel from the mind of the Minister that I intend to make this a political matter. I want to deal with it as objectively as the Minister himself did.</p>

<p>The intention of the Bill, as explained by the Minister, is to accelerate the elimination of slum conditions where they exist. He says in effect that the existing procedure is not adequate or satisfactory. Now, I know that the Minister has had regard to the Slums Act of 1934. In his second-reading speech he quoted the definition of a slum as contained in that Act. But I am constrained to wonder whether in considering this Bill, the Minister has had any regard to the Public Health Act. In due course, no doubt, the Minister will tell me whether my conjecture is correct. The point at issue is this. If it is said that there has been in the past, and there are to-day, local authorities which have been remiss in their duties, which have either been neglectful or obstructive in regard to slum clearance, then all along the machinery has existed, and it exists to this day, to compel the local authority to do its duty towards the population of that town or city and towards the Government. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has said that we support the principle, and I also say that if the principle of this Bill is the quicker removal of slums, I naturally support it, as we all do. But that does not mean that we should not have objective regard to the circumstances in which the Bill is introduced, and to ask the Minister certain relevant questions.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the provisions of Section 11 of the Public Health Act, in which I believe he has not really taken any interest, and if he has, he has failed to indicate in his second-reading speech what the situation is in regard to the operation of this section of the Act. Section 11 of Act 36 of 1919 reads as follows: It says that whenever upon the report of the Chief Health Officer it appears to the Administrator that the public health in any locality is seriously endangered by the failure or refusal of the local authority to exercise its powers or to perform the duties devolving upon it in terms of any law, the Administrator may, after causing an inquiry to be held, call upon the local authority by written notice forthwith to exercise such powers or to perform such duties &#x2026; and if the local authority fails to comply with such written notice, the Administrator may exercise such powers or perform such duties and may authorize any person to take all the necessary steps for that purpose in the same manner as if he were the local authority. Now, anyone who reads the Bill against the background of Section 11 of the Public Health Act will ask himself immediately, why this particular legislation is necessary. Why is it that when the Administrator already has an overiding authority over the local authority, and if he is satisfied that the local authority cannot or will not bestir itself in order to remove a slum, he can appoint any person to do everything that the local authority can or should do, why is it that a similar situation has to be created whereby the Secretary for Housing can do all those things, also, as if he were the local authority? I hope that in the course of this discussion the Minister will tell us why Section 11 of the Public Health Act, which clearly gives that power to the Minister of Health, and through him to the Administrator, to do certain things which the local authority has failed or refused to do, cannot be left as it is, and why that power cannot be invoked by the Minister of Health whenever he considers it necessary. With great respect to the Minister of Health, there is a certain reflection cast upon him by this Bill, because the inference is that the Minister of Health cannot or will not use Section 11 of the Public Health Act, but the Minister of Community Development can and will use exactly the same power. It is a question I ask with deference.</p>

<p>But this clause goes even further than that. Where the members of the local authority or some of them have resigned without leaving <span class="col_4969-4970" refersTo="page_1059"/>a quorum, or where the persons entitled to elect a local authority fail to do so, the Administrator may exercise the powers and perform the duties of the local authority and may authorize any person to take the necessary steps for that purpose.</p>

<p>You see, Sir, how powerful the Minister of Health is in terms of this section of the Public Health Act. Even where the local authority has been stubborn, the Administrator can proceed to appoint this body which can do everything that the local authority should have done and further, it says in (c) that the Administrator shall possess all the rights and powers of a local authority, and any expenditure incurred by the Administrator under this section may be recovered by him firstly by action in a competent court of law against the local authority, or secondly, by levying a special rate upon all rateable property within the district of the local authority, or thirdly, by a deduction from any subsidy, grant or other moneys payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or payable by the Administrator to the local authority, or by all three or any two of such methods of recovery, subject to an appeal to the Minister, whose decision shall be final. Let me say immediately that if anyone at least is genuinely interested in slum clearance, he should at least have regard to the provisions of Section 11 of the Public Health Act. Sub-section (2) says that a copy of every report by the Chief Health Officer shall be furnished to the Minister, and if such action thereon is not taken by the Administrator as the Minister may under the circumstances consider adequate and necessary, and within such time as the Minister may consider reasonable, the Minister may decide to take action and may notify the Administrator accordingly, and thereupon all powers and functions conferred on the Administrator by this section shall cease to be exercisable by the Minister. In other words, in terms of this section the local authority has always had not one master, but two. It has had the Administrator, who of his own volition could take any action he desired in order to ensure that the local authority did what was required of it under the Slums Act; and failing that, it always had the Minister of Health, over and above the Administrator, to tell the Administrator that he should do certain things. Failing that, the Minister himself could always exercise the powers of the local authority, and mulct the ratepayers accordingly for the expenses. They had no recourse if a special rate was levied for that purpose. Therefore, one of the things I think the Minister should explain is this, because all local authorities, whether they are run by one political party or several, or whether there are no political parties, are asking the same question, and I certainly know of several who are (I know of two at least who have asked me this question): Why is it necessary, when this power exists in Section 11 of the Public Health Act, for the Minister to come with this Bill?</p>

<p>Now, to deal with another aspect of the matter, if you had listened, Sir, to all the arguments advanced by the hon. members for Brakpan and Westdene, and also to the rather gentle rebuke which came from the hon. member for Pretoria (East), you could have come to only one conclusion, and that is that slums can only be equated with political control. In other words, wherever you have political control, you have slums. They ask us to read between the lines of that argument or thesis, that wherever you have political control in the form of the United Party, you certainly have slums. That is a very interesting argument, but I would like to know on what basis it is advanced. If you travel through the world, I can think of half a dozen countries where in the principal cities there are enormous slums, and there, that argument does not apply. Take Washington, D.C., which is not even controlled by a local authority, but by a Board of Commissioners appointed directly by the President of the United States of America. In other words, it is a satellite of the United States Government. No election of members of the local authority takes place. In fact, the people of Washington have no vote in anything but there I have seen some horrible slums which have grown up in spite of the fact that there is no political control. On the other hand, there are cities which also have no political control, like London&#x2014;at least not to the extent that we have political control in, e.g., Johannesburg&#x2014;but where there are very serious slums, and therefore one must completely discard this argument that there is some tie-up between slum conditions and political control. The fact of the matter is, of course, that cities have a habit of either growing or declining, according to all kinds of factors which have nothing to do with political control. I do not want to burden you, Sir, with the details of it because it is a long story, but as an example, I would say that in South Africa we have the position where there has been a constant shifting of population from the country to the towns, especially in the last 20 years, and there has been a tremendous influx of population to the towns. Whatever may be the position in regard to the Bantu, who are subject to influx control. that does not apply to the Whites. No White man has ever had to consult anyone as to whether he should leave his farm and go to an urban area. He can come freely, and there has been this constant &#x201C;drift&#x201D; from the platteland, as it is called. It is more properly a movement, because drift implies something which is helpless, or even wrong. This constant arid deliberate movement from the platteland to the towns, due to the increasing industrialization of the country, and due to a natural inclination of people to go where the bright lights are, has resulted in a tremendous influx of population of Whites, from the platteland to the cities. So I am surprised that the hon. member for Pretoria (East), who should know the facts, does not know what I was told as recently as ten days ago, namely, that the urban population of Pretoria is growing at the rate of 1,000 Whites a month. [Interjections.] One letting agent who has 4,000 units, houses and flats, to let in Pretoria, started the month <span class="col_4971-4972" refersTo="page_1060"/>of April with only three available units. In other words, this movement from the country to the towns is a very important factor in the urban growth of South Africa. That being the case, we must look for the root causes of slums not entirely in the lack of interest of a politically controlled local authority, or in the human failure of the members of such a local authority to grasp the nettle and to tackle the problem, but in the constant change of the &#x201C;spread&#x201D; of population over South Africa. [Interjection.] What I wanted to illustrate was this. It is necessary for a planned approach to the position of housing, in its broadest terms, to be undertaken by every authority concerned with that question, from the Government downwards, and exactly the same applies obviously to the improvement of the housing conditions of those people who already live in slums in the cities. The only question that may create a difference between the Minister and me is this: How is this question to be approached and dealt with in regard to governmental control of the housing situation in the urban areas, the improvement of those conditions, and the removal of slums?</p>

<p><i>Evening Sitting.</i></p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned for the dinner break, I had touched upon the question of governmental control of housing conditions. I now want to put this point to the Minister; namely, that whereas it is necessary that there shall be such governmental control of housing, it is the question of the nature and extent of that control which should be considered. This I should like to do in the time still at my disposal.</p>

<p>In the first place, as I have already said, this control could well have been undertaken by the Minister under this Bill merely by transferring the functions of the Minister of Health, as laid down in Section 11 of the Public Health Act, to his own Department. As far as the extent of that control is concerned, a far more difficult position I think arises by virtue of the fact that, as the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has already pointed out, it is a traditional function of local government to administer its own area to the greatest possible extent under the law by virtue of its election as a local authority, with all that implies&#x2014;in other words, that that body elected by the citizens should have the maximum amount of authority in determining the development of the area which is under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The case of Johannesburg has been cited here by other hon. members in connection with the question whether local authorities have carried out their functions as far as the clearance of slums is concerned. I do not want to reminisce about Johannesburg as other hon. members have done, but I want to say to the hon. the Minister that I want in all sincerity to assist him&#x2014;not because I am an ex-mayor of Johannesburg, but because for some years I was chairman of the Health Committee of the City Council of Johannesburg. This committee exercised the functions of seeing to the needs of housing for Europeans. For some years I also was chairman of the Slums Court of Johannesburg. I think I can say, therefore, that I can speak as someone who actually had to carry out the procedure hitherto applied to the elimination of slums in the area of a local authority. In saying that, I must make it clear to the House that to the extent that a city like Johannesburg was able to eliminate slums, it did the best possible job it could whenever action was called for. Other hon. members have pointed to the fact that there was not always the necessary money available, as is offered by the Minister to-day in terms of his circular on housing, and in terms of the promise contained in this Bill. I recall very clearly times when I, as chairman of the Health Committee of Johannesburg City Council, led a deputation to interview the National Housing Commission in Pretoria in order to try to persuade them to give us either a slice of the available funds where we felt that we should get it, or a bigger allocation. At times we were told that it was not possible having regard to the needs of all the other local authorities, to meet the requirements of the City of Johannesburg. That was one difficulty which one, I think, need not stress because it was an obvious difficulty.</p>

<p>Another difficulty was&#x2014;and here I do not want to raise a laugh on the other side of the House&#x2014;the backlog which had developed through the war years. Whether it should have been allowed to develop, it is not my intention to discuss. Undoubtedly a backlog of low-cost housing for Whites as well as non-Whites had developed during the war years. Those years after the war were difficult years for a city like Johannesburg. As a matter of fact, I need not defend the City of Johannesburg under any circumstances, as far as its actions to clear slums are concerned. It had to face the difficulty of, firstly, a shortage of materials; secondly, a shortage of funds and sometimes a shortage of both these indispensable elements. Despite that, however, I cannot recall an instance where the Minister of Health, under Section 11 of the Public Health Act, directly intervened in Johannesburg because the City Council did not do any particular job it was required to do. I cannot recall anything like that ever having happened. The Minister may, however, correct me, as he may have the facts before him.</p>

<p>So, Sir, there are some local authorities which can, with some degree of truth, claim that under present legislation they had to the best of their ability complied with the ordinary dictates of town planning, good housing conditions, etc., within their own areas. That being the case, such local authorities will have some objection to being superseded, as it were, by the hon. the Minister in the appointment of slums courts. As a matter of fact, he has <span class="col_4973-4974" refersTo="page_1061"/>admitted that this is one of the contentious clauses of his Bill. At the present time local authorities, as the Minister is aware, appoint their own slums courts. It has been said that it may be the factor of local politics, or even a case of pressure from an owner who was either a member of the Council or had the necessary influence to prevent the Council from doing its duty in regard to the clearance of slums, that has influenced the Minister to say that he is going to set his own slums courts.</p>

<p>My difficulty with Clause 3 is that the clause does not say, as it might well have said, that the Minister will set up a slums court in a particular area where, in his opinion, that is required, but&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is hereby established in respect of each local authority district a body to be known as the Slum Clearance Court&#x2026;.</block>

<p>Therefore, he will establish such a slum clearance court in every local authority, irrespective of whether a particular local authority has carried out its functions in regard to slum clearance.</p>

<p>I want to suggest to the Minister that a more reasonable approach will be to take unto him-self the power to appoint such a slum clearance court in every local authority which, in his opinion&#x2014;I am prepared to make it subjective&#x2014;has failed to carry out its functions in this regard. I suggest that in such local authorities only does he set up his slum clearance courts. But unfortunately this Bill says &#x201C;in every local authority area&#x201D;, i.e. including those which have carried out their duties properly. That, the Minister will understand, is the subject of a natural complaint from a local authority which <i>bona fide</i> believes that it has done the job. I think he should give an answer to such local authorities&#x2014;and Johannesburg is not the only one that has raised complaints of this nature. I have here a clipping from a Cape Town newspaper of a statement made on behalf of the City Council of Cape Town. In the <i>Cape Times</i> of Tuesday, 2 April, under the heading &#x201C;Slums&#x2014;City fears loss of authority&#x201D; appears the following statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Cape Town City Council has appointed a deputation of four to seek an interview with the Minister of Housing for clarification of some of the provisions of the Slums Amendment Bill and to express concern that the measure will make further inroads into the powers of local authorities.</block>

<p>I quote this merely to indicate that it is not only Johannesburg which is concerned because this Bill will make further inroads in the powers of local authorities. I quote this to illustrate that not only I, who have connections with the City Council of Johannesburg, say these things. I have no contacts whatsoever with the City Council of Cape Town, and yet I read in a newspaper that it has appointed a deputation to interview the Minister to express concern that the measure will make further inroads into the powers of local authorities.</p>

<p>At any rate, the relevant newspaper clipping is followed by the names of the deputation and then by a statement by the City&#x2019;s medical officer of health who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I consider that this Bill is far-reaching in its scope and is another measure aimed at reducing the autonomy of local authorities in regard to purely domestice matters which they are perfectly capable of resolving them-selves &#x2026;</block>

<p>&#x2026; and, secondly, that he has seen them and has deflated their idea of their own ability to cope with slums. But the Minister says that he has seen them and I will, therefore, not pursue this unduly. The Minister knows best what has transpired at that interview.</p>

<p>In general terms, Sir, it seems reasonable that in a matter of this nature and having regard to the fact that we support the principle of the elimination of slums as speedily and efficiently as possible, the Minister will agree that the local authority should feel that it is in the picture, as far as any changes in its own area is concerned, to the greatest possible extent. The Minister might well ask me how he can incorporate the function of local authorities in this Bill, if he, as Minister of Housing, has already said that he must have full control of the position? This is a fair question which I should like to answer. For example: The Minister says to us in Clause 3 of this Bill&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is hereby established in respect of each local authority district a body to be known as the Slum Clearance Court for that district, which shall exercise the powers <span class="col_4975-4976" refersTo="page_1062"/>and perform the duties and functions conferred or imposed upon it by this Act.</block>

<p>It goes on to say that such a slum clearance court shall consist of&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(i) the magistrate having jurisdiction in the district of the local authority concerned &#x2026; (ii) and two other members to be appointed by the Minister by reason of their knowledge of urban housing and health conditions.</block>

<p>Now, these officials will be paid for the work they are going to do&#x2014;that must be so. The Minister has also indicated that to a certain extent he has introduced this measure in order to relieve city councils of an unpleasant duty. That, Sir, is a very generous attitude on his part, but I am sure that many serving town councillors do not welcome this relief at all. Many local authorities, far from being under a debt of gratitude to the Minister for relieving them of this responsibility, will be heard to say, I am sure, that since they have performed this function up to now without any payment whatsoever to their city councillors&#x2014;I can say from my own experience that one sits on a slum clearance court day after day and goes on tours of inspection without getting a fee for it&#x2014;they will gladly carry on, and many town councillors worthy of their salt will be glad to continue serving in this respect.</p>

<p>I should like the Minister, therefore, to consider whether it is not advisable to enlarge this proposed court, consisting of three officials, by incorporating an additional two members to represent the local authority concerned. I can see no difficulty, on the fact of it. to this suggestion, because if that is done, the relationship of governmentally appointed and representatives of a local authority will be three to two. with the officials in the majority. In addition, the local authority would not have been excluded from representation on a slum clearance court set up by the Minister with jurisdiction in the area of that local authority. This is a point which can be developed to some extent, but I want to put it to the Minister that in the course of the discussion in this Bill, he should apply his mind to this particular suggestion because he might come to the conclusion that the Bill should be amended to provide for the inclusion of. say, two representatives of a local authority to serve with the three officials on the slum clearance court for the area of that local authority. The hon. the Minister has said that he expects local authorities to co-operate with him in this regard&#x2014;I think he said he would welcome such co-operation&#x2014;and if he does what I have suggested, he will be able to say that he has provided for their point of view that they be represented, instead of his having taken some hieh-handed action, that he is genuinely seeking that degree of collaboration which he says is essential for the elimination of slums.</p>

<speech by="#cruywagen">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRUYWAGEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) said at the beginning of his speech that he might as well get into the nest in which ex-mayors of other cities find themselves and also take part in the discussion. Although I am not an ex-mayor I also want to climb into this little nest and fulfil the role of the ugly duckling in the nest. I can give the House the assurance, however, that I shall not tarry long in the nest, because I do not see my way clear to remain long in the same nest together with the hon. member for Hospital. I am pleased that the hon. member reacted to an interjection by the hon. member tor Rustenburg and that he apparently intends to consider the advice given to him.</p>

<p>In connection with the resettlement of the Bantu, of the Witwatersrand in particular, to which reference has been made here, I want to say, without going into it at any length, that it seems to me that there are many people who are now advancing excuses for what they did in the past, as well as for what was done by the city councils whom they represent. They are anxious to advance reasons to explain their conduct at the time. It is nevertheless interesting to note that in spite of all those reasons they are perfectly satisfied to-day, and not only satisfied, but that they even boast about the results which have been achieved in this connection. It is correct perhaps to say that the Minister already has powers to compel local author.ties to clear slums. In this connection hon. members referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the Health Act. But I cannot imagine that the hon. the Minister would come along with this Bill if the powers which he already has are adequate and if the machinery which is already at his disposal is functioning smoothly. There must be hitches somewhere in carrying out this important task, and it is those hitches which the Minister wants to do away with by means of this Bill. The main object of this Bill, as the Minister has already stated in his second-reading speech, is to make the machinery of the Slums Act function properly, to create a positive approach to the clearance of slums, and to provide decent housing in places where there are slums to-day. I wonder whether the hon. member for Hospital, with all his verbosity, was of any assistance to the Minister in this respect.</p>

<p>The factors to which slums owe their origin are well known. As a matter of fact, reference was made to those factors over and over again in the course of the second-reading debate. I should like to point out that in my opinion this problem will always be with us; we shall always have to contend with it. although perhaps not to the same extent because the conditions which exist to-day may be cleared up perhaps. We are faced with the fact, however, that some of our older urban areas have stood for many years. As time goes on we shall have to keep our eye on these older urban areas to prevent the development of slum conditions there in due course. It is necessary to clear up certain slum conditions as quickly as possible so as to obviate any undesirable conditions that <span class="col_4977-4978" refersTo="page_1063"/>may be caused by social evils. This Bill creates the machinery by which we propose to do so. I believe that with the assistance of this legislation we shall be able to act expeditiously and effectively in this connection. We therefore welcome this Bill and we support it whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>There is one problem, however, to which &#x00CE; want to refer. Although this instrument will enable us to tackle slum clearance expeditiously and effectively, the question is whether we are providing alternative housing just as quickly without causing a dislocation to the people concerned. In this connection the local authorities are faced with certain problems. Firstly there is the question of the availability of land. The hinterland as well as other land available to many of our local authorities has already been built up. They have no land left therefore on which they can build. It may even prove impossible to use land which is released by the clearance of a slum for this purpose because it may be zoned for industrial or other purposes. One problem therefore is the scarcity of land.</p>

<p>But there is also a second problem. Even if land were available, one finds that it is available next door to an existing residential area. We find unfortunately that the inhabitants of existing residential areas do not like the idea of other housing schemes springing up right next to their borders or just across the street. But housing has to be provided in some way or other in the urban areas concerned to people in the lower income group. I feel therefore that an appeal should be made to the inhabitants of existing residential areas not to complain so quickly when city councils are obliged to establish such a housing scheme practically on their doorstep. This idea of a &#x201C;White location&#x201D; which is sometimes spoken about should be rooted out. We should ask the inhabitants of built-up residential areas first to obtain all the relevant information before they try to thwart the plan of any city council in this connection.</p>

<p>We can only ask the Minister and his Department to continue to undertake research into the planning of housing for the low-income group, and to plan in such a way that the appearance of the houses will conform to the appearance of the houses in the existing residential area so that the inhabitants of the existing residential area will have no reason to complain. Then I want to ask that where city councils have to clear slums and provide alternative housing, the Department should make it as easy as possible for such city councils to provide that alternative housing as expeditiously as possible.</p>

<p>The fear has been expressed that this legislation will curtail the powers of local authorities. Fortunately I live in the area of a city council which co-operates very well in this connection. But if there are other city councils&#x2014; I do not know whether such city councils still exist&#x2014;which are out to put stumbling-blocks in the way of the Minister and of his Department and to make slum clearance difficult, then I am in favour of the proposition that the powers of such city councils might as well be curtailed if they refuse to meet their obligations in this connection. We trust that with the assistance of this legislation the Minister and his Department will be able to clear up certain unsightly slum areas and at the same time provide decent housing in their place.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Bill before us deals with the clearance of slums, but before you can clear slums you must be sure that you can provide alternative housing. This is, as the hon. member for Germiston (Mr. Cruywagen) has pointed out, a never ending job: as you complete the clearance of one slum, you find there is another.</p>

<p>We will always have the sub-economic group with us as part of our population. For various reasons these people are not able to better themselves, and, therefore, we will always have them with us. We hope, however, that with better education and training this sub-economic group of our population will in time be able to help themselves more than they do to-day. It is a social problem. Where there is a slum, you have to get down and find out what the underlying problems are. You will probably find that underpayment of wages and conditions as a result thereof are the causes. But we have this sub-economic group for whom we have to provide better housing. Generally, when we talk about slums, we seem to think of the Coloured and Bantu groups only. But there are also White slums besides the Coloured and Bantu slums.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister under Clause 3 of this Bill makes provision for the establishment of slum clearance courts in every local authority. Under Clauses 21 and 22 he obtains the power to inflict his might on local authorities in order to make them to move. I am pleased, however, with what he said in this connection in his introductory speech, i.e.. that he was reluctant to take such action, although he would have to take it if local authorities refused to get a move on. In our democratic system of government we have always recognized the right of citizens to elect their own local authorities, which are then subject to our provincial authorities. I was consequently disappointed that the Minister, in his introductory speech or in the Bill, did not make any reference to the provincial authorities. The provincial administrations are. after all, entirely responsible for local authorities. We know, however, that Parliament has the overriding authority, i.e., over both provincial and local authorities, and that when we talk about provincial administrations and local authorities being autonomous we use a misnomer, because there is really no such thing as an autonomous body. Parliament is. in reality, the power above everybody. I should, however, have liked to see the Minister making closer contact with the administrators in this connection. We have these provincial administrations and local authorities, but we are inclined to take away their powers. The hon. the Minister responsible for this Bill is busy with another Bill which takes away Coloured education from the provincial authorities&#x2014;this <span class="col_4979-4980" refersTo="page_1064"/>I say in passing. Now he comes with this Bill whereby he is taking certain powers unto himself to get local authorities to get on with clearance of slums.</p>

<p>The clearance of slums is not an easy matter; it is full of snags. It is not just a question of saying that we will remove all the dwellings in a slum area and that we will put up houses elsewhere. It is not as easy as all that. Let me demonstrate this by reference to what is happening in my constituency. Recently a road programme through my constituency was started which will also go through a portion of District Six. It has taken quite a number of years to remove the affected people and rehouse them. As a matter of fact, it has not yet been completed. There is this difficulty of uprooting people and providing for them at other places. I hope the Minister is going to see to it that people uprooted as a result of the clearance of a slum will be properly housed elsewhere.</p>

<p>The Minister has said that this Bill is in the way of a new deal as far as slum clearance is concerned, but we hope that by clearing one slum he is not going to create another elsewhere. The hon. member for Boland has pointed out what can happen. To-day with the shortage of money as far as housing is concerned the engineers, architects, officials of the Department have been prevailed upon to stretch the available funds as far as possible. This has been done to such an extent that to-day you merely get four walls, a roof, a concrete floor with an ablution block in the backyard, and, as the hon. member for Boland said, probably one tap for eight people. I would say that is stretching it too far. We close the one slum down only to create another one in its place elsewhere. I call it a new slum because the type of house which is being provided is not such as to assist the inhabitants to build up their own outlook on life. They are miles away from their work in a sub-economic house and consequently they feel that they have little or no future.</p>

<p>I should like the Minister to consider the provision of a better type of house, even if that means building fewer houses. Let us give them something better than what we are giving them at the present moment. I know that various types of houses are provided for those who can afford to purchase a house. The design of these houses are in some cases quite pleasant. There is, however, this other group, the sub-economic group, who cannot afford a house of this type, and consequently have to put up with four walls and a concrete floor.</p>

<p>Slums are caused when the industrial areas of a city or town encroach upon the housing areas. There is another cause too. Over the years we have, in order to protect the sub-economic wage earner, controlled rent by means of the Rents Act. The various rent boards have controlled rents very stringently, although I would say not unfairly, because if a property owner can show that he is spending money oh his property these boards do sometimes agree to a rise in rent. However, they are reluctant to do so, with the result that owners allow their properties to deteriorate. Eventually it becomes a slum. This is a matter which justifies consideration. Property owners should be encouraged to keep their properties in first-class condition and not to allow them to develop into slums.</p>

<p>Now that the Minister is going to take over slum clearance from local authorities he should have a look at their town planning schemes. Where industrial areas are included in a township consideration should be given to what is going to happen to the people living nearby&#x2014;what is going to happen to their properties. The hon. member for Germiston has pointed out that certain local authorities do not have the ground for the development of new townships to replace slums. Here we often make a big mistake. We always seem to think that when clearing up a slum we must go far out into the veld to find a piece of open ground, put up some houses there, make a few roads, lay on light and water, and think that by that we have done a good job of work. Meanwhile the people who have to go out there cannot afford to&#x2014;they have not the money for train fares. So what do we find? Those people eventually move back into town and make already overcrowded areas more overcrowded. Housing should therefore be provided for these as near as possible to their place of work, even if the Minister has to expropriate existing properties. I think it is all wrong to move these people miles out of town The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) has referred to the Schauder scheme and other housing schemes at Port Elizabeth. I think the Schauder scheme is really an outstanding scheme. A wonderful job of work has been done there. But there again, because of this stretching of money too far, you find that a portion of the Schauder scheme is developing into a slum. They have achieved outstanding results at Kimberley in moving a complete location. As I have said, we must get away from the standard type of building. We must build something better than that. We must uplift the population and not push them down. I hope that the Minister is going to take action as far as slums are concerned, and he will also take planning into consideration.</p>

<p>When certain hon. members rise here and criticize housing schemes that are being put up for certain sections of the population by the Government, they should at least be fair enough to ascertain under what circumstances these people were accommodated before being accommodated in these new schemes. Many of these people who are being housed in these schemes, to which the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) and other hon. members object, come from very poor circumstances. They come from the slum areas. Many of these people have never yet had a proper roof over their heads; they have never had a home. They are only too thankful to be housed in these schemes. But now certain hon. members are <span class="col_4981-4982" refersTo="page_1065"/>condemning summarily certain schemes, and I do not think that is fair. It is only fair to have regard to the housing these people had before.</p>

<p>I really rose to reply briefly to the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). The hon. member for Boland made certain remarks here which I cannot allow to pass without comment. The hon. member apologized for not being able to be present this evening, but that does not matter; I am obliged to reply to his remarks. Mr. Speaker, if there is one national group that has benefited considerably by the clearance of slum conditions by this Government during recent years, it is the Coloured people of the Cape Peninsula. The great mass of the Coloureds of greater Cape Town were until comparatively recently housed in unenviable and parlous slum conditions. Now one can ask oneself; What did hon. members do, such as the hon. member for Boland who is a prominent and responsible member of the Cape Town City Council? What did the hon. member for Boland do when he was in a position to do something about combating the slum conditions successfully in places such as Kensington, Windermere etc.? If the hen. member takes the liberty to point a finger at another local authority, he should at least sweep before his own door first. At the present time the Peninsula has been planned to a large extent. Coloured slum areas are being cleared so rapidly that the face of some parts of the Peninsula has changed almost overnight, thanks to the National Government and the Departments of the present Minister. The Minister and his Department should be congratulated on the fantastic progress that has been made in recent years in the clearance of slums. These slum areas of the Peninsula received a tremendous blow from this Minister and his Department during the past few years. The hon. the Minister pointed out in his second reading speech that in recent years no less than R31,000,000 had been granted in the form of loans for the construction of more than 31,000 dwellings for Coloureds in the Peninsula. The majority of these Coloured families came from the worst slums, slum areas about which many of the hon. members who were in a position to do something, did not lift a finger to have them removed. They simply boasted; they had Harry the home builder, but the dwellings were never built. Mr. Speaker, there were parlous slum conditions on the borders of our White residential areas, slum conditions that have been eliminated one by one in recent times. With this legislation the hon. the Minister is now getting more power to act more effectively against that hard core of slum conditions still existing in the Cape Peninsula. As I have said, certain hon. members, such as the hon. member for Boland, will of course not see the wood for the trees in this whole mighty process. That is why the hon. member comes along and indignantly gives the Municipality of Parow a slap in the face because they have a number of galvanized iron and wooden homes whereby they have in fact cleared some of the most awful slum conditions in that municipality. These people who are now being temporarily housed in these galvanized iron and wooden houses are squatters who have never had a roof over their heads; these are the people who have been sleeping underneath sheets of galvanized iron and opened-up oil drums and in pieces of motor bodies; they are people who have been sleeping on grain-bags under the bushes. These people are grateful to the Municipality of Parow for having created these temporary facilities for them until they can find better housing. However, the hon. member is not concerned about that. The hon. member cast an aspersion on the Municipality of Parow, that did much for Coloured people who had been living in the slum areas. The municipality made a survey of its slum areas in order to determine how many Coloureds there were for whom alternative housing had to be provided. They ascertained that there were about 350 such dwellings and shanties that had to be removed from White slum areas. The municipality put up 330 neat brick dwellings for these Coloureds with the aid of the National Housing Commission. The hon. member for Boland does not refer to that however, for it does not suit him to do so. He does not notice those 330 neat houses, the nice streets with lights; he notices the few galvanized iron and wooden dwellings that have been put up to meet temporary conditions. The Municipality of Parow had no obligation to those people; they had an obligation to their own established Coloured population. They did not only meet that obligation by putting up neat homes for those people, but they even went further. They spent R80,000 to build a splendid civic centre for those people in that area; they spent a further R 10,000 to establish a fine and well equipped library for them; they spent a further R8,000 to lay out a playing field for them. They spent R 100,000 on accommodation so as to accommodate these people who came from the slum areas in decent residential areas. But the hon. member for Boland had not noticed that. He traversed that whole area looking for one or two iron and wood dwellings the Municipality of Parow was obliged to put up because of its humane feelings in order to temporarily accommodate certain people. And who were these people? When the municipality was engaged in removing Coloureds to the new residential areas, they found that families were squatting in some backyards; they rigged bags there and crawled under that. The Municipality of Parow could then simply, as so many other local authorities did, have flattened the place with a bulldozer, and left those people to their own fate. What would they have done then? They would simply have gone to other Coloured areas, and again crawled under bags and drums and sheets of galvanized iron there. But what did the Municipality of Parow, which had no responsibility towards these people, do? Those people had been squatting there illegally. The Municipality of Parow then put up, on its own land, about 60 proper two-room iron and wood dwellings, that are better than those that are being occupied <span class="col_4983-4984" refersTo="page_1066"/>by many White people in certain back streets. The dwellings have a concrete floor and water is available. The municipality said those people could move in there temporarily until such time as they could afford to find other accommodation. However, these people usually have no income; they are casual workers; they cannot afford even the absolute minimum sub-economic rental per week. The Municipality of Parow has no obligation towards them, but for the sake of humanity they housed these people and the hon. member for Boland to-day slapped the Municipality of Parow in the face in a most unworthy manner. We in the Cape Peninsula wish to thank the hon. the Minister of Housing and his Department very much for the exceptional manner in which they have tackled this comprehensive task of the Cape Peninsula, and for the phenomenal success they have achieved with it up to now.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, an eminent South American professor recently visited South Africa in order to make a study of some of our university institutions. After he had been with us for a while, he was so impressed by what this country is doing to improve the living conditions of people that he occupied himself here for a long time with further investigations. After his return to his own country, he wrote a letter that has come to my attention, a letter in which he made the following statement, namely that the housing provided in South Africa for the lowest income groups is better than that provided in his own country for the middle classes. That is why it is a pity that in a debate such as this which has been carried on on a very high level this afternoon, there should have been a discordant note here and there. I am referring particularly to the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) who did not have the right this afternoon to launch that attack against the Municipality of Parow. In this connection I should like to associate myself with the hon. member who represents them, and to say that if there is one municipality that has gone out of its way to co-operate with the Government in creating improved conditions, then it is the Municipality of Parow. I sincerely regret that the hon. member for Boland deemed it expedient, knowing that we are at the present time investigating the position there and that we could have given him a reply in any event, to avail himself of the opportunity not to broadcast to the world anything about the good work of the Municipality of Parow, but only to cast a slur on that municipality. I take the strongest exception to that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) sounded the second discordant note. The hon. member had obviously read the statement by Mr. Owen of the Cape Divisional Council for his speech consisted of what Mr. Owen is supposed to have said. All I wish to say is that to say that the Department of Housing and the Government, through the Department, are creating slum conditions with its low-cost housing, can only be said by people who have not the foggiest notion of what a slum is, and who have not the vaguest idea of the conditions under which those people have been living. It is beyond my comprehension how the hon. member can compare this well-ordered community and this cheapest form of housing with slum conditions. The hon. member knows that every scheme put into operation by this Government is in the form of sub-economic housing schemes, so constituted and so planned that it will not lead to over-crowding; that it will not lead to unhygienic conditions, and that it can easily be converted into better conditions when those people are able to fulfil the requirements in regard to the interest and redemption payments. The hon. member knows that. Why then does he compare this effort of the Government with the continuation and the creation of slums?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Are you satisfied with that scheme?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, just listen to that question. Does the hon. member know that numerous municipalities have written to my Department and to me personally, and have said that there are so many unhousable elements in the country that the cost involved in our present sub-economic housing is still too great for them? As a result of that, the National Housing Commission has devised a further low-cost housing scheme which will serve as a temporary measure at least to get these unhousable elements into an environment where we can teach them a sense of responsibility, and can help them to accept certain elementary health principles, and where we can try to uplift them so that they can do something to enable themselves to move into the higher class of housing. But the hon. member does not know about that; the hon. member just talks for the sake of talking. He is echoing Mr. Owen, and Mr. Owen is obviously echoing someone else. Mr. Owen was given a reply, and to my regret not one of the newspapers took the trouble, when the Secretary of Housing furnished Mr. Owen with a reply, to publish the full statement by the Secretary of Housing. They published Mr. Owen&#x2019;s statement fully, but they did not publish the reply in full.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) referred to the proposed slum clearance courts, and then he referred to Johannesburg. It is not my intention to attack Johannesburg this evening. We are now dealing with a measure whereby we shall try to do the best for the whole Republic of South Africa, irrespective of the municipalities that will be affected by it. The hon. member stated, <i>inter alia</i>, that he had led a deputation to interview the National Housing Commission and that they had then told him that they did not have funds available for slum clearance. I think I should refresh the hon. member&#x2019;s memory a little. He led a deputation to the National Housing Commission in connection with Bantu housing. At that time the City Council of Johannesburg did not have in mind at all the clearance of the slum areas at Page View, Vrededorp, Jeppes and Ferreira-town <span class="col_4985-4986" refersTo="page_1067"/>town. Those slum conditions are still there at the present time in spite of the tremendous zeal of the hon. member. So the hon. member is completely mistaken when he says that the National Housing Commission told him that they did not have funds available for slum clearance. I leave it at that.</p>

<p>I should like to thank the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) for the positive manner in which he dealt with this matter. The hon. member did however differ from me as regards my statement that some local authorities are not doing their duty. I can assure the hon. member that while the vast majority of local authorities are only too willing to do their duty, there are local authorities (whose names I shall not mention this evening) who look for every technical excuse to retard and make impossible the carrying out of such a policy. I should just like to refer to one without mentioning its name. A fortnight after my assumption of this portfolio in 1961. a certain big city council had discussions with me at Pretoria, at which representatives of the National Housing Commission and of my Department were present, on proposed schemes in that particular city. That was towards the end of 1961 and we are now almost in the middle of 1963, and we are still trying to persuade them to do the things we discussed with them in 1961. The funds are available and they are being offered every possible assistance, but they are looking for every technical difficulty to continue with these delaying tactics. That is what this measure is required for. In that case there are White people living under the most appalling slum conditions: I went to look at it. In that instance, the city council at one stage told my Department that they were unaware of a housing need among the Whites; they wanted me to put into operation certain provisions of the Housing Act to discharge them from restriction in connection with the breaking down of buildings, because they said that in their area of jurisdiction there no longer was such a thing as an actual housing emergency.</p>

<p>No. It is an outstanding characteristic of the City Council of Pretoria that they do everything in their power to clear up slums. When my Department made a survey there, they found a shortage of between 1,200 and 2,000 dwellings for Whites, but they are unaware of it. I think the hon. member for South Coast will accept my word for it, because I think he has had similar experience that there are some people you cannot get moving before you have a measure of this nature. Whilst saying this. I should like to express my thanks and appreciation to the large number of local authorities that avail themselves of every opportunity to improve their position.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>Do not let us joke about a matter of this matter where thousands of our people are living under poor conditions.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member said that the point of view of both parties was that in planning such residential areas, groups of the population will necessarily have to be moved. That is quite correct, but I deny that the housing of groups of the people has been delayed in consequence of this Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of group areas. I shall tell the hon. members why. At the present time it is possible for a local authority, if there are no proclaimed group areas, to come to the Department of Community Development and to say: Give me an open permit to put up a housing scheme for this or that group. In numerous instances we have granted that open permit, even before proclamation. Thus, if city councils will cooperate with us, we can overcome those ostensible difficulties and it is not necessary that it should cause delay.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member referred to the cost of transport. He said we really should not move people for whom there is no alternative accommodation. Other hon. members also referred to that. Then in the same breath the hon. member referred to the question of spurious census statistics in many instances where you are dealing with clearance. It seemed to me that the hon. member had virtually come to the conclusion that we do not do so, for he said we should always have proper regard to town planning in the planning schemes of local authorities when we force housing on them. The hon. member for Westdene (Mr. van der Spuy) and other hon. members who referred to urban renovation, also referred to that. The hon. member for South Coast also referred to it, and said that in cities you find parts that deteriorate over the years. I just want to deal with these few points briefly. It has always been the attitude of the Government, and I have said so repeatedly, that people will not be forced out of dwellings if they cannot look after themselves. That is the qualification. If they cannot look after themselves, they will not be forced out of their dwellings unless there is alternative housing for them. That is our accepted policy. I think the manner in which we have acted in Johannesburg, Kimberley and other large centres show that we try to make available that alternative housing. I do not think it is more than proper that we should do so.</p>

<p>As regards the question of transport, I should like to say to the hon. member that the Department of Community Development is represented on the inter-departmental Transport Committee through which we are trying to arrange for the transport of those people when we are obliged, for the sake of good planning to move out with your housing. But it is not only a question of transport, it is not only a question of low-cost housing being made available; but it is also a question that numerous municipalities can do much more to make the services they provide, available at less cost, so that not more has to be paid in the form of services levy than is to be paid in the form <span class="col_4987-4988" refersTo="page_1068"/>of redemption on the housing itself. The other day the Secretary of Housing, in reply to the Divisional Council of the Cape, quoted this example that there is one instance of which the Department is aware, where capital and interest amount to approximately R48,000 whereas municipal services to the occupants amount to more than R50,000 for the same period. That shows that many authorities should proceed to provide these services more cheaply.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member also referred to the question of planning. Let me say at once that the National Housing Commission does not approve a loan unless it has been approved as a town planning scheme. In other words, a condition of the grant of a housing loan is that the scheme should have regard to a particular town-planning scheme. We do not simply grant loans without having regard to town planning. We co-operate as closely as possible under present circumstances, with the Townships Board, e.g. The hon. member for Westdene, and the hon. members for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) and Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) and Germiston (Mr. Cruywagen) referred to urban restoration. I should like to take this opportunity to say that during the recess, as soon as possible after the Session, the Departments of Community Development and Housing will institute a thorough investigation, on a very high level, in various other countries of the world, on urban restoration, on reconstruction and on housing and all the various housing schemes that have been accomplished in other countries.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, every aspect. I hope to engage the two heads of the Departments at least in that inquiry. I do not wish to say more about that this evening, because negotiations are still proceeding. We shall probably be able to benefit considerably by that searching investigation.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Westdene, Brakpan and Germiston and to a certain extent the hon. member for South Coast also, referred to this, <i>inter alia,</i> that greater cognizance should be taken of the various bodies dealing with planning and whose planning results in proper housing for our people. I would say this merely, that although I have no intention to destroy the rights of local authorities, although I do not propose to interfere unduly with the rights of provincial administrations, with the little experience I have thus far gained as the Minister concerned, that there is far too much overlapping as regards our planning: that in the second place there is far too much delay with planning; and thirdly, that there should be greater co-ordination between the Central Government&#x2019;s planning departments and the provincial authorities and the local authorities. I have said this on various occasions. I should like to mention the example of building regulations. Our building regulations in South Africa are completely out of date; they require a thorough overhaul. You have to go from pillar to post before you can come to light with a proper scheme in regard to housing. It is my intention to take further steps, after this inquiry overseas has been completed in consultation with the provinces, in order to bring about greater co-ordination and streamlining in this connection. So what we are doing here to-day is only one of the steps taken to see to it that slum clearance is effected.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) has referred to the matter of representation on the Slum Clearance Court and to the position of the medical officer; he wants the medical officer to be able to do the work for the Department of Housing too. I do not think that is correct, for that medical officer is then an official of the unwilling city council, for the Department of Housing only comes into the picture when it is convinced that that city council is unwilling, and I should then not want to use that medical officer for the purposes of the Department of Housing. As regards representation on the Slum Clearance Court. I am reluctant to accept that. But I should like to tell the House that I am first considering, although I have not yet taken a final decision on the matter, the possibility of having a slum clearance court consisting of a few people for whom it should be made worth their while to devote their time to this matter, and that we should not appoint an <i>ad hoc</i> slum clearance court for every single local authority, but that we should be able to use the same slum clearance court for various cases, although we appoint an <i>ad hoc</i> slum clearance court for that particular area. But we are seriously considering arranging things in such a way that they can gain experience at various places and that they should develop a degree of expertness in the matter. At the present time we have some of our retired magistrates whom we could probably use people who although they have retired, still have a capacity for work and who could be used for this purpose. That is why I am hoping it will be possible to constitute a slum clearance court in such a manner that it can deal with the areas of jurisdiction of various local authorities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Can it be done under this Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. You will just have to appoint it for that area every time, but I want to try to give the personnel as much continuity as possible. For instance, I shall not now appoint a slum clearance court for the whole Cape Province or for the whole Western Province, but I shall appoint it in such a way that it will always merely be the same slum clearance court which is used for the various towns, say, in the Western Province. That is my first reason.</p>

<p>My second reason is that I think that the moment one gives the local authority representation on the slum clearance court, one again <span class="col_4989-4990" refersTo="page_1069"/>has dawdling in the proceedings of the slum clearance court, for it can only conduce to introducing the local politics which I want to take out of it, into the slum clearance court. I am sorry, but I do not agree with the hon. member at this stage. It is a matter we can discuss further in Committee, but at this stage I am not favourably disposed to that.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) raised the matter of the Health Act of 1919, Section 11. I have looked at the Act, but I really cannot understand what the hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty is. The provisions of this old Act are very clear, but throughout the years nothing has happened under it. That is my first reply, and I think the obvious reason why nothing has happened is because the administrators have had no instruments at their disposal to be able to take action.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has a Department of Housing; he has a machine. If a local authority will not meet its obligations at the present time, the Minister can go into action with the machinery at his disposal. I need not wait for a municipality to carry out a housing scheme at the present time. Take Cape Town. There the local City Council has been asleep all these years with regard to White housing. I have already announced that the Department of Housing is going to develop Bosmansdam, which will result in a housing scheme of 4,000 to 5,000 dwellings for White people. We have the machine; we have the instruments at our disposal and I think that is my reply to the hon. member. But what instrument does the Administrator have now? What can he do now? He may call upon a local authority to do something.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<p>He can enforce it&#x2014;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, he can enforce it, but they in turn surely have also to come to the Department of Housing. And that brings me to the last point I should like to mention. There is one thing that worries me in our country at the present time, and that is that one sometimes has a long fight with local authorities behind the scenes to persuade them to take action as regards housing, and when finally the first sods are turned and the first bricks are laid, one could swear that the local authority has taken the funds somewhere out of a satchel of its own, and one is nowhere in the picture. I think the time has arrived that local authorities who want to help, or do not wish to help and who have to be compelled, should at least acknowledge that if there is one department which deserves recognition for what it does in respect of Whites and Coloureds and Indians and Bantu in respect of housing, then it is the Department of Housing, and they could at least have the decency, when tackling these big schemes, to come forward and say: &#x201C;We are doing this with the aid of the Central Government authority that is doing so much to make it possible for us.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Therefore, when we boast now so much about what this or that city council has done, do not let us forget that it is the State which at the present time has to bear the loss, if there are losses to be borne, on housing. It is the State that makes it possible for means to be available for your middle-income group down to your lowest-income group to provide for their housing. It is the State, that in many instances has to stand with a red-hot iron behind people to compel them to take action, and then they still want to claim the kudos when they have already been burnt and compelled to act.</p>

<p>I trust that you, Sir, and hon. members have found this to be of value. Thanks to this ex planatory memorandum, I need, therefore, deal only with the principle of this Bill.</p>

<p>The crux of the Bill is contained in Clause 2 (4), which makes it possible to regard a designated area or a specific portion of it as an ordinary municipal location, despite the fact that Bantu may have rights of ownership to the land there. It also grants power to the controlling authority to issue regulations in the same way that a local authority can normally issue location regulations. It should be remembered that for such an area and the Bantu living there who own the land no location regulations can be issued without this legislation which is now under consideration.</p>

<p>The powers provided for in this Bill are, therefore, necessary to supplement the existing <span class="col_4991-4992" refersTo="page_1070"/>powers in order to take effective action in those places within the White area (i.e. outside the Bantu homelands) where Bantu have acquired property rights to land and where this land has now become over populated, or is unhygienically occupied, or undesirable persons are allowed to live there, or where the land is utilized in a manner which is not in the public interest. In the case of the urban Bantu residential areas, we have at our disposal what are generally known as the &#x201C;location regulations&#x201D; (promulgated in terms of Section 38 (3) of Act No. 25 of 1945) and which operate effectively. But as is indicated in the memorandum, we do not have power to issue regulations in the case of those areas where the Bantu own the land. Such an area cannot be declared to be a location. This defect, therefore, has to be remedied.</p>

<p>This measure will become applicable to three types of &#x201C;designated areas&#x201D;, i.e. areas which, with the approval of the local authority concerned, may be established by the State President by proclamation, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Firstly, in urban areas where city councils can apply the law; secondly, in an area outside an urban area, but inside an area in which a local authority has been designated as an urban local authority to apply the Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, 1945; and thirdly, in any other area outside the Bantu areas where no form of local government exists and where a Bantu Affairs Commissioner will exercise these powers.</block>

<p>In other words, they are areas falling outside the jurisdiction of a city and also outside a peri-urban area where a sort of local authority exercises jurisdiction. They are, therefore, areas which, for example, lie in the rural areas outside Bantu homelands, and where in such cases, in terms of this Bill, the Bantu Affairs Commissioner will exercise the powers of a local government.</p>

<p>By proclamation the State President will also be able to apply certain other Acts to a designated area, namely the Urban Areas Act, the Native Services Levy Act, the Urban Bantu Councils Act, the labour bureau regulations and the Bantu Beer Act. In terms of this Bill, in a designated area the provisions of the Group Areas Act may also be applied to exercise control over property, and the provisions of the Native Building Workers Act, in order to use Native building workers for building work in those areas, and also the provisions of the Housing Act, in order to enable the local authority to acquire property. It will further be noted that provision is made for a Bantu revenue account for the particular circumstances of a designated area, on the same lines as the Bantu Revenue Account in terms of the Urban Areas Act.</p>

<p>Clause 4 contains provisions regarding the regulations, and it amounts to this, that, in addition to the regulations issued in terms of the Urban Areas Act, regulations may be issued, in terms of this new measure, dealing with a number of matters not covered by the Urban Areas Act. The provisions in regard to misdemeanours and penalties contained in this Bill are in the main in line with those contained in existing measures. Clause 9 contains the useful provision that a designated area may be the urban Bantu residential area (or location) for Bantu in an urban area which falls completely outside the designated area concerned.</p>

<p>In paragraph 7 of the memorandum it is stated that it is intended immediately to apply the provisions of this Bill to Alexandra, which lies just north of Johannesburg, but beyond the area of jurisdiction of that city. I considered it better not to draft an <i>ad hoc</i> mea sure dealing with Alexandra alone, because we know that there are other areas also where these additional powers are equally necessary.</p>

<p>I foresee that various local authorities and control bodies may approach us from time to time with a view to the application of the powers contained in this measure in their respective areas. However, I do not regard it as desirable to deal with those other areas here.</p>

<p>I feel, however, that I should give more detail in regard to the local circumstances in Alexandra, the origin of that township, the gradual deterioration of conditions there, the various measures which have been adopted from time to time to improve those conditions, and the conditions prevailing there which justify the introduction of this measure. I, therefore, mention Alexandra here simply because it is the most striking example and requires the most urgent attention.</p>

<p>This township, which at present falls within the area of jurisdiction of the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board, was established in 1905, before the promulgation of the various control measures which to-day regulate the establishment of townships. Therefore because no obligations were laid on the founders of that township with a view to the provision of services, and because there was no local authority, that township was neglected. In view of the fact that Whites were not interested in this new township, it was converted into a township, for Bantu and Coloureds in about 1912. This township is situated on 415 morgen of land and there are 2,537 erven, each about, 140 by 50 feet in extent, which became owned predominantly by Bantu. In 1958 the population was approximately 98,000, almost three times what it should have been according to recognized yardsticks. Hon. members will be shocked to know that in 1958 there were approximately 236 people per morgen in Alexandra, as compared with 61 in Orlando. 43 in Atteridgeville, 77 in Vrededorp (Whites of course), and close on the heels of Alexandra we have District Six in Cape Town, with 221. At present in Alexandra we still have approximately 120 Der morgen. After the re-planning there should be only about 70 Der morgen, and then the position there would be comparable to that of for instance Orlando.</p>

<p>In 1916 a Health Committee was established for Alexandra which, after having undereone <span class="col_4993-4994" refersTo="page_1071"/>several changes, was abolished in 1958 because it could not provide local administrative services and had allowed the population to increase disturbingly as the result of insufficient funds and its unwillingness to spend more money, its inability to manage the area, and statutory shortcomings. Various investigations by commissions throughout the years did not help either.</p>

<p>In 1958 the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board took over control, with an undertaking by the State to assist in regard to funds by way of loans, and the State also undertook to grant funds to cover the losses resulting from administration. A special territorial committee was established for Alexandra, on which our Department was represented. I should like to pay a tribute to-day to this body, the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board, which in the past five years brought about great improvements in Alexandra. Up to 1962 R146,770 was borrowed from the State for the establishment of services, and R960,000 for the purchase of property on a voluntary basis, whilst administrative losses were subsidized by the State to an amount of R390,000, but presumably this has now come to an end, thanks to the beer-hall profits.</p>

<p>All kinds of improvements were introduced and the population figure has already been reduced to about 52,000. Crime has decreased appreciably, streets were improved, sanitation, recreational and health services were improved and schools were established. To prove how crime has decreased, let me mention that since 1956 murders decreased by 50 per cent, armed robbery by 90 per cent and assaults by 30 per cent. The Resettlement Board resettled 44,700 Bantu of Alexandra in Meadowlands and Diepkloof. According to the latest figures already 472 properties were purchased for R 1,275,350.</p>

<p>Although to a much lesser extent than before, there is still exploitation in regard to the letting of rooms by Bantu landlords, in view of the fact that hitherto such leases have not been controlled at all. In that way just as much is being paid for a single room as is paid for a whole house in a controlled location. And lack of control, particularly due to the non-existence of location regulations, also results in a continual change of address of the Bantu who are not qualified to reside in Alexandra, the result being that the over-population of sites cannot be combated effectively. This change of address, however paradoxical it may sound, is in a certain sense increased by the clearing up which has been done, because it has resulted in more space being available to the inhabitants of the township who have remained there. When this Bill is passed it will be possible to issue regulations by which the over-population of sites can be effectively reduced to acceptable proportions, and continued influx will be prevented.</p>

<p>Other anomalies are the lack of control over the erection of buildings and the regulation of trade in this township, as is the position in a location. In 1958 businesses were being carried on on 737 sites, or 29.5 per cent of the total number of sites. In terms of this Bill, a statutory liaison committee between the local authority and the Bantu population can now be established also, the lack of which has always been felt.</p>

<p>In so far as the future of Alexandra is concerned, not much need be said because detailed information in that regard was released recently. It amounts to the fact that Alexandra, for sound practical reasons, cannot be demolished, but that now for the first time since its establishment it can be properly planned. This replanning will make provisions for the gradual establishment of single quarters for single male and female Bantu workers of the northern suburbs and peri-urban areas of Johannesburg. The built-up areas and the recreational grounds will occupy a smaller area than at present, because provision will also be made for the proper unoccupied buffer strips around the developed area, as the result of which Alexandra will be better separated from its immediate environment than ever before.</p>

<p>Attention has also been devoted to the question as to who should control and develop Alexandra, because this is an onerous task. For the foreseeable future this work will continue to be carried out by the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board, which now of course gets these additional legal powers. We shall therefore have to be guided by the experience we gain. If practical problems or other serious reasons arise which require a revision of the position, we shall not hesitate to take suitable steps for the promotion of effective control and for the development of this area, and if that should require legislation, we shall not hesitate to introduce it.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think I have now given you a general exposition of the basis of this Bill and also of the urgent necessity for the Bill, namely, the prevailing conditions and the developments envizaged for Alexandra. I hope that, having done so, it will be possible for us to obtain support for this measure, because it establishes something good, in the sense that it provides supplementary legal provisions where those are likely for certain types of occupied areas where Bantu have settled and which are neither Bantu homelands nor proper urban areas or locations, so that in this way we can ensure that there will be proper Bantu residential areas which can be managed as if they are locations, as they have in fact become. I hope the Bill will receive the general support of the House.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have listened with great interest to what the hon. the Deputy Minister had to say. In the main it is entirely in line with our understanding of this Bill and of the White Paper which he kindly issued. Let me say at once that so far as what one might call the cleaning up of many of these areas is concerned we agree entirely that that should be done. The hon. the Minister has dealt particularly with Alexandra, and in so far as it is necessary to clean up <span class="col_4995-4996" refersTo="page_1072"/>Alexandra we believe that should be done. The White Paper also dealt at length with Alexandra. But having said that I think we must look at the White Paper and the Bill and the speech of the Minister and the statement recently issued by the Minister of Bantu Administration, where he dealt with the future of Alexandra, because these all have a bearing on our consideraton of the Bill before us.</p>

<p>Clause 2 of the Bill deals with different types of areas in which Bantu persons have land ownership. Clause 2 (a), (b) and (c) respectively deal with the situation of the Grahamstown Fingo Location, (b) deals with the position of Alexandra, and (c) deals with the portion of Evaton which comes under the Native Commissioner, because it lies outside a released area. The Bill provides that a designated area, from a date to be specified, can be proclaimed in respect of any such area. It is noteworthy that there are two kinds of area in respect of which a designated area cannot be proclaimed. A designated area cannot be proclaimed in a scheduled Native area or in a released area. The reason for that will appear presently, but I want to get that point very clear. When the Deputy Minister was speaking just now he said in respect of certain aspects of the present law which he referred to that there was a gap or hiatus in respect of a certain position. The hiatus arose in respect of those areas where the Bantu actually owned the land. The Deputy Minister has tended to deal to a great extent in his arguments this evening with Alexandra, and I would also like to say a few words about Alexandra.</p>

<p>The Deputy Minister said it was established in 1905. It provided freehold for the Bantu and it has had a very checquered career. I do not think it has been a credit to anybody. When I say that I go right back to its beginings. It is at present under the control of the Peri-Urban Areas Board of the Transvaal, a body set up, like the local Health Commission in Natal, to deal with the black belts and the black areas outside the towns, some larger and some smaller. But the truth of the matter was that in respect of these areas, the White urban area where black belts developed outside them, in the main they provided homes for the Bantu people who were employed in the adjacent urban area. I am not going to voice any particular criticism of this Government, which came into power in 1948, but I will say that the growth of those areas reflected no credit on any previous Government. In fact, many of them were just a plain disgrace to the adjacent local authority and the Provincial Adminisiraion. in so far as the Provincial Administration had any authority or jurisdiction, and to the Government of the day, and that covered all Governments since Union. Industrial expansion in our big White urban areas led to the Bantu coming along to seek a place where they could get an economic wage, according to their standard of living. They came in to be close to their place of employment, exactly as anyone else would have done, and there was no consideration given to that aspect of their lives. I know, because I have been through it. I held a Commission of Inquiry into it. As long as the Bantu turned up to work and were law-abiding and respectable people and went home after work without worrying anybody, nobody worried about them. I say again that it brings no credit on anyone that conditions developed such as exist, amongst other places, at Alexandra. The latest figures given in this House recently in reply to a question show that at Alexandra to-day there are some 35,000 Banu.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the figure is very material, except for the breakdown, but there is one figure which I would like to know is the correct figure. I would hate to be wrong in respect of this one figure. Let me come back to my point, that whether it is 35,000 or 50,00 Bantu&#x2014;and there are Coloureds also&#x2014;whatever the density of population may be in regard to Alexandra, it was nobody&#x2019;s concern until the Provincial Administration of the Transvaal set up the Peri-Urban Areas Board, and from what the Minister has said I take it that funds were made available from Government sources by Parliamentary vote for the purpose, at any rate, of providing some of the facilities that have been provided at Alexandra.</p>

<p>The one figure in respect of which I do not want to be wrong is the figure dealing with the freehold owners, and that is given as 1,972 Bantu. There are Coloured people there also, but I am not dealing with them now.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that. Now, may I refer again to what the Deputy Minister calls the link-up, the gap in the law. What was this gap in the law? It was simply the fact that the law advisers found that they could not treat Alexandra as though it was a Native location for the purposes of many laws that was the difficulty. For the purpose of a number of laws&#x2014;the Biff here specifies some of them&#x2014;they could not find legal grounds for Alexandra, to be treated as a Native location. So this Bill, amongst other things provides that Alexandra, together with other areas like the Fingo Location at Grahamstown and part of Evaton, can be proclaimed Native locations for the purpose of a number of Acts which are referred to here. They are the Native Services Levy Act, the Urban Bantu Councils Act, the Native Labour Regulation Act, and the principal Act of this Bill, which is the Native Urban Areas Consolidation Act of 1945. May I also add <span class="col_4997-4998" refersTo="page_1073"/>that the Natives Resettlement Act of 1954 also comes into the picture, even though it is for limited purposes, as the Deputy Minister says. What we then have to consider is that this area, owned by Bantu in freehold, established in 1905, with 1,972 Bantu land owners, has remained there, and apropos of what I have already said, these areas were not cared for by anyone because nobody wanted to spend any money on them. As the result of overcrowding and slum conditions, various commissions of inquiry were appointed up to the time the Peri-Urban Areas Board was established in the Transvaal, and finally this area was pro-claimed as falling under the jurisdiction of that body, and until that time nobody took any notice of the conditions which developed. But subsequently the Peri-Urban Areas Health Board itself carried out an investigation and in a letter published in &#x201C;The Star&#x201D; of 20 December 1960, it stated: &#x201C;To create at Alexandra a township which can house its residents in reasonable comfort and under acceptable conditions, it has been decided that the population should be reduced to about 30,000&#x201D;. At the same time the Board made it clear that people working in the northern suburbs of Johannesburg and who were housed at Alexandra would have to leave. Alexandra was to be the centre from which people who wished to find employment in Johannesburg proper could live, but it was not to be a centre from which people could radiate out to employment all over the northern suburbs, like Randburg. Even at that stage, at the beginning of the control by the Peri-Urban areas Board, certain improvements started to take place, and in certain spheres the improvements were remarked upon by the Deputy Minister this afternoon. There was a reduction in crimes of violence, murders, etc. But the Peri-Urban Areas Board apparently in 1960 believed that if it could bring the Bantu population down to about 30,000 in Alexandra, they would be able to live under hygienic conditions. Of course, in terms of the regulations of that Board, there is complete control over the public health of that area. The people there must pay a rate. The regulations cover public health and the normal amenities which apply to people living under urban conditions. Had the Government come along to-day and had it stated that position and told us that they proposed to clear up Alexandra and the other areas, and had the Government said: We will clear up Alexandra; there are many people living there who have no right to be there, and who are working in other areas where they have no right to work if they live in Alexandra, and other accommodation will have to be found for them, but we are going to clear up Alexandra and they will have to pay rates to assist us, and if they want to live under urban conditions those are matters for which they will have to share the responsibility. and we are going to apply the provisions of the Urban Bantu Councils Act to them, then we on this side of the House would have had no complaint. But that is not the attitude of the Government. The Government has now come with a Bill which is clearly designed not to clear up Alexandra in the sense of getting the condition for public health on a proper basis and providing proper amenities like streets, water, sewage, etc., but they have set out from the point of view that they want to get rid of all the Bantu at present living in Alexandra, and then to re-establish Alexandra on a different basis. The 1,972 Bantu who have freehold rights there have been approached recently to sell willingly to the authority which is competent to buy. That process, the Government is presumably satisfied, cannot be brought to finality on the basis of a willing seller and a willing buyer, and so in this Bill provision is made for expropriation. The White Paper refers to expropriation under the Housing Act, but there is another authority for expropriation which is not referred to in the White Paper, and that is the principal Act, the Native Urban Areas Consolidation Act of 1945. From what the White Paper says, and from what the Minister has said, there is no doubt whatever that it is the intention of the Government to expropriate if the people concerned will not sell. Sir, we on this side of the House cannot possibly agree to this. This is to use condition there which can be cleared up and which can be made suitable for the living of the urban Bantu, and it can be a place where they can establish an urban council to run their own affairs, through which they will get experience not only in the privilege of running their own affairs but also in the responsibilities that go with it&#x2014;all that can be done in Alexandra, but the Government says that notwithstanding what the Peri-Urban Areas Board said in 1960&#x2014;and there have been other assurances also that their freehold title will not be taken away from the Bantu&#x2014;they are going to clear up Alexandra. The White Paper frankly says that there will of course only be justification for the application of the Bill in the case of those areas where Bantu have acquired ownership of land. This Bill, when it becomes law, will have justification for its application only where the Bantu have acquired ownership.</p>

<p>I want to say quite frankly that I have looked at this Bill very carefully indeed to see if there was not some saving clause, or some statement by Government spokesmen, which would make it clear that the land ownership enjoyed by the Bantu in Alexandra to-day would remain vested in them. On the contrary, the Bill, the White Paper, the speech of the Deputy Minister tonight and the statement made by the Minister all point to the fact that they intend to get rid of the freehold title of these Bantu, and then, on the present site of Alexandra, having replanned it, and having set aside green belts and the other various requirements, they will then establish huge hostels, up to eight in number, each housing 2,500 people who are called single Bantu. Just imagine. 20,000 single Bantu will be in hostels! The White Paper, in par. 6. referred to Clause 6 of the Bill and it says that under Clause 6 it will be possible to regard Alexandra as a Bantu residential area for Bantu of other residential areas such as Randburg and Johannesburg. In other words, <span class="col_4999-5000" refersTo="page_1074"/>what is foreseen here now is that it shall be a dormitory area, so that the people domiciled there shall have a wider area in which to forage forth and go to work. The Minister said that a large number of people would be disappointed because we are not getting rid of Alexandra as a Black area entirely, but he said that for very practical reasons they have to keep the Bantu there. What are these practical reasons? They are that they are required there for service, not only in that area or in the area of the Peri-Urban Areas Board, but also in the area of Johannesburg and Randburg. It is to be a central depot for 20,000 single Bantu.</p>

<p>Now, what is a single person when they are living under these conditions? One of the things I personally have set my face against is this grouping together in great communities, living under hostel conditions like a beehive, where each one lives in his own little cell, of thousands of people, 2,500 in each hostel, 20,000 in all. I know there are many people in the neighbourhood of Alexandra who would very much like to see it wiped out as a place for Bantu to live. They want to have their cake and eat it. May I say in passing that that is not unique as far the the people of Johannesburg and Randburg are concerned; it is the same anywhere. If a Native township is to be established, people agree in principle that it is an excellent thing that the Bantu should be properly housed, and it should always be established just in front of their neighbours&#x2019; door but nowhere near them. That happens in every case. So I am not surprised that many people want Alexandra to be cleared up and become a White area. But they also want their servants close to them and not far away, because according to where the servants live, so will the cost of those servants rise proportionate to the distance they live away from their place of employment. If the servant lives ten miles away instead of two, somebody has to pay the cost of the extra transport. It may be done by way of subsidy, which means that the general body of taxpayers have to pay for it. or it can be done by paying higher wages to the servants, but somebody has to pay for it. The practical reasons that are worrying the Deputy Minister are the number of people who will complain if they lose their labour from along-side of them, because it is very convenient to have their labour at that price in the immediate vicinity. If they are moved miles away, they will have to pay considerably higher prices for their labour, if they can get it. Let us face the fact that we will get nowhere by running away from the realities of the position.</p>

<p>At this stage perhaps I should say that we will oppose the second reading of this Bill, and I want to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, while accepting the need for better administration in designated areas, declines to pass the second reading of the Better Administration of Designated Areas Bill because the Government thereby proposes to disrupt normal family life of the urban Bantu and to eliminate the established freehold rights enjoyed by Bantu in designated areas&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I can conceive of few things worse than for the Government deliberately to create these eight great hostels holding 20,000 single Natives, men and women. I have put the rhetorical question: What is a single person? I should like the Deputy Minister not to treat this as a rhetorical question but as an actual question. Will he tell us who are the single Bantu who will be housed in this great complex of hostels? A servant coming in from outside, duly furnished with the proper papers and who takes up residence in one of these hostels, must be single. It is a prerequisite for accommodation that he or she shall be a single person, and if they say they are single persons there is no way of disproving it. Provided they are armed with the requisite documents they can take up their abode there as single persons, and they are classed as single persons. Can the Minister comprehend what the position is in regard to the White people around Alexandra, when he has 20,000 so-called single Bantu living in that area? What conditions is the Minister creating there? I think it is a shocking thing. [Interjection.] We are well aware of the conditions under which the Bantu are living at present in single quarters in other areas, and every sociologist condemns the idea of single quarters of this magnitude for Bantu. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>Because of the amendment I moved. I want to come back to this question of freehold rights. I say again that this is wrong. It is utterly wrong for us in Parliament to be asked to pass legislation where, if the Bantu will not sell willingly, the Government will take expropriation measures. I said in this House a few years ago that there are some things which in the past were held sacred in South Africa. Many of those things have been jettisoned to-day. but there is still one thing which we ought to keep sacred, and that is our title deeds. These chickens will come home to roost one day if we in Parliament start ignoring title deeds, when we are prepared simply to wipe out these freehold titles.</p>
