<p>asked the Minister of Housing:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether any four-roomed flats are to be erected as part of the sub-economic scheme at Chatsworth Indian Township; if so, how many;</li>

<li>(3) whether the directive has been submitted to any public health authorities; if so, what was their comment; if not, why not; and</li>

<li>(4) whether the directive is to be applied to White and Coloured sub-economic housing; if so, why; if not, why not.</li>

<answer by="#minister_of_housing" to="#hopewell">

<from>The MINISTER OF HOUSING:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. 190 four-roomed flats in Chatsworth Neighbourhood Unit 3, section B.</li>

<li>(2) Yes, the National Housing Commission included in its approval of the local authority&#x2019;s application for a loan for the scheme, a suggestion by the local authority itself to the effect that, and I quote, &#x201C;If, however, the rental differences between two-and four-roomed dwellings are such that rental becomes a material factor, a policy of shared four-roomed dwellings should rather be adopted. Such dwellings would be shared initially until such time as one or other family group becomes economic whereupon such family group could be transferred to economic four-roomed accommodation.&#x201D; Quotation ends.</li>

<li>(3) No, the standard of the dwellings themselves is in excess of the minimum standards determined for dwelling accommodation which have been laid down in consultation with all competent authorities, including public health authorities. As regards the directive in connection with the occupancy of one dwelling by two families, as a temporary measure, it is considered that in the provision of families already suffering from want in respect of the primary requirements of life, it is of the greatest importance that their accommodation should be provided at a rental which will make only the smallest possible inroad on their earnings to prevent privation and consequential ill-health and further loss of income.</li>

<li>(4) The question of applying the directive to Whites has not yet arisen but it has been applied to Coloureds for the same reasons as those given for Indians.</li>

<heading>GENERAL LAW AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: House to resume in Committee on General Law Amendment Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>[Progress reported on 25 April, when Clause 11 had been agreed to.]</p>

<p>On Clause 13,</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 13 seems to supplant Section 118 of the Post Office Act. On a perusal of the Post Office Act, it does not appear to be as simple a matter as may be inferred from a reading of this clause alone, because there are certain very material differences about which I should like to ask the hon. the Minister certain questions. There is a provision in Section 118 of the Post Office Act in terms of which the detention of a telegram or a postal article can only be undertaken on the written request of any public prosecutor. If that telegram, package or letter is so detained, &#x201C;the Postmaster-General shall if authorized thereto by the Minister of Justice cause that postal article or telegram to be handed over to the said public prosecutor&#x201D;. In other words, it is perfectly clear that within <span class="col_4823-4824" refersTo="page_0986"/>the post office itself no one has the authority&#x2014;of his own volition&#x2014;to detain a telegram or a postal article.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the individual is protected in that respect despite the fact that in Section 115 of the Post Office Act it is laid down that no legal proceedings can be instituted against the Government or against the Postmaster-General for any default, delay, etc. In other words, the addressee of a postal article or telegram cannot take legal proceedings against the Postmaster-General because of a normal delay in the transmission of the article as between the sender and the addressee. That is the position under the Post Office Act. But a completely different situation will arise under Clause 13 which, the Minister says, is in substitution of Section 118 of the Post Office Act. Apart from the fact that the article which may reasonably be suspected of containing something which will afford evidence of the commission of an offence may be found not to contain anything of the sort, it &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be detained by the officer in charge of any post office or telegraph office in which it is or through which it passes. It &#x201C;shall&#x201D; be detained by the officer. Sir, not on the written authority of somebody who has any legal reason for wanting that package detained, and not at the instance of the Minister of Justice. The salient difference, therefore, is that of his own volition a postal official, even a junior postal official, can detain a piece of mail or a telegram. Furthermore, Sir, the Postmaster-General, after the detention of that package by an official of the post office, may bring the detention of such telegram or package to the notice of the Attorney-General. He is not obliged to do so.</p>

<p>Before I take the matter any further, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not agree that, whether or not there is an emergency in South Africa, the transmission of articles through the mail is such a common place in our society, or any other, that nothing should be done which would interfere with that transmission unless there is a very good reason for it. If something has to be done, it should be done on the authority of a person who is competent to judge and competent to issue the instruction, which in turn can, and probably will, be carried out by a junior official. It seems to me that beyond the limitations of the Post Office Act as it stands at present, there is a very strong possibility of an almost complete postal censorship being set up because of the activities of the officials of the Post Office Department, for no good reason or for a very good reason&#x2014;without any motivation from the Minister of Justice, from the Attorney-General concerned or from a public prosecutor. I say, with great respect to the hon. the Minister, that this does require some explanation, and I shall wait for his opinion.</p>

<p>This clause is perfectly clear and is intended to be understood and to be implemented exactly as it stands here. If there is any person who has any doubt about the words &#x201C;reasonably suspected of containing&#x201D; my reply is that that is the precise wording of the original Section 118 which all hon. members accept and which have also appeared in our Post Office Act over the years. I quote from Act No. 44 of 1958, which consolidates our postal laws&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any postal article or any telegram which is reasonably suspected of containing anything which will afford evidence of the commission of a criminal offence or reasonably suspected of being sent in order to further the commission of a criminal offence or to enable the detection of a criminal offence to be concealed &#x2026;</block>

<p>may be demanded by the Attorney-General, on the instructions of the Minister from the Postmaster-General and that article must then be handed over to him. That is the position as the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) indicated. If hon. members listened to my second-reading speech they will know what the problems are in connection with the sending of telegrams from Maseru, telegrams which are sent openly through our telegraph service. I also reminded hon. members that communist literature was also being transmitted. I explained my problem to hon. members&#x2014;that the Attorney-General cannot take action until he has obtained information from outside. We are approaching the stage where it will be necessary for the initiative to be taken not only by the Attorney-General but also by every postmaster. It will not be taken by any cleric but only by the person who is in charge of a post office. I think that we are fully justified in asking that these senior officials should not only take the initiative but should also accept the obligation to disclose these offences. If hon. members tell me now that this is a far-reaching provision, I want once again to repeat my invitation that it will be a very good thing for hon. members to read the British Post Office Act in connection with that point. Hon. members are aware of the fact that in Britain there are no State post offices as we have them here but in spite of that the Home Secretary may at any time demand any postal article or any type of postal article in general from the private post offices and he can give certain instructions to the post offices in that connection. If, therefore, the <i>Times</i> wants to attack me again in regard to this Bill, the <i>Times</i> should first of all put its own house in order as far as the Post Office Act is concerned and it should also put its own house in order as far as the 1922 Act that I quoted in my second-reading speech is concerned, I am not interested, the Government is not interested, nobody is interested in anyone&#x2019;s private correspondence but we are interested in the fact that State machinery and the post office in particular are being used by these people to further their activities. We are not going to be a party to this and we are not prepared to be a party to it. Hon. members opposite and the hon. member for Hospital can raise as many bogies as they like and mention as many possibilities and probabilities as they like. They know what will happen in <span class="col_4825-4826" refersTo="page_0987"/>practice. A fuss may possibly be made about this&#x2014;we have often experienced it in this House&#x2014;but we will never have a fuss in the future again because it will be implemented just as the provisions of other laws have been implemented in the past.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister spent his time in justifying the right of the State to detain subversive literature. Our objection is not against that. The Minister stated his case in the second reading and we heard what he had to say about the telegrams that were being received in this country and about literature being sent through the post, and we wish to deal with that as well. What worries us is that in terms of the wording of this clause it is not quite clear what happens to the letters which are not handed over to the Attorney-General.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>What happens now is that the Postmaster-General does nothing until he gets a request from the public prosecutor or the Attorney-General to detain certain letters and to hand them over to him, but under this provision the position is different. I want to say to the hon. Minister that although an official is in charge of an office, he may not be a senior official, because you have got some very small post offices in the country districts &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>It will be the senior in that office.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but you get post offices with one official only. You even get some private post offices. I know of cases in the Transkei where traders act as post officials. I forget the term they use in those cases, but I think they are postal agencies. So it is not always a senior official who is going to act. It is all right in big post offices where the postmaster is a senior official, but you get small offices and postal agencies, and in terms of this clause they now detain a letter, quite different from the existing law where the Attorney-General or the prosecutor says: &#x201C;We want you to detain a letter; we know it is there.&#x201D; So then he detains the letter and hands it over to the Attorney-General or the prosecutor. But in terms of this clause the official now will detain if he suspects. Admittedly, he cannot open it, but he will detain because he suspects, and I take it then he will bring it to the notice of the Postmaster-General, and the Postmaster-General may bring the detention of such postal article to the notice of the Attorney-General. He need not do so, he &#x201C;may&#x201D;. What happens if the Postmaster-General does not give it to the Attorney-General? The position is altered now. He has still got that letter, it has not been taken from him. And what worries us is that there seems to be no provision for action and that is why we ask the hon. Minister to explain the position to us. There seems to be no obligation on the Postmaster-General to deliver the letter to the addressee.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>But there must be some time limit for action. Suppose some official, not necessarily a senior official, suspects there is something wrong with a letter or a newspaper and he keeps it in his office, and say he keeps it for a week or so. There must be some time limit placed on action to be taken by the Postmaster-General or by the official with regard to the letter which is being detained and which is not being handed over to the Attorney-General or to the public prosecutor. That is what we want the hon. Minister to explain to us. There may be something in the Postal Act, but we would like to have certainty about that, certainty as to any duty on the official in such a case where it is not handed over to the Attorney-General, to do something at once to see that the addressee gets the letter within a reasonable time.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>There is a very good reason why it should not be made compulsory and why it reads &#x201C;may&#x201D; and not &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. The original intention of the Department was to make this provision compulsory and not permissive, in other words to make it compulsory for such postal article to be handed over, and the provision was framed in that way. It was then submitted to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that Department objected to the compulsion, stating that the provision should be permission. The reason given by the Postmaster-General for his attitude&#x2014;and I am sure that hon. members will appreciate it&#x2014;was that he was not prepared to agree to the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D; because he could then be accused of applying censorship in the Post Office. If he was obliged to hand over any such article, he could possibly be accused of applying censorship. He wanted to be able to refuse the request of the Attorney-General if it appeared necessary to do so. If he had the right to refuse then he could not be accused of not having any discretion in connection with the matter and it could not be said that he was merely the &#x201C;stooge&#x201D; of the Attorney-General or of the Department of Justice. It was because of these psychological reasons in the background that the word &#x201C;may&#x201D; was inserted and not the word &#x201C;shall&#x201D;. The Post Office regulations do of course make provision whereby if such article is not handed over it must be delivered. In the present circumstances one can detain and investigate any postal article, but once the investigations have been completed that article must be sent on. If it finds its way to the Attorney-General no new situation arises because the Attorney-General is already in that position. If those articles eventually do find their way to the Attorney-General, the procedure in regard to them is the same as that provided for in the old Act.</p>

<p>We on this side wholeheartedly agree that the Post Office must not be abused by any unlawful organizations. There have been cases in the past where this has happened and any measure to prevent this sort of thing will be supported by this side of the House. There is, however, one point in connection with the clause that I would like to raise. The original Post Office Act was so framed, I think, with the intention of giving only a legal official the right to interfere at all with the conveyance of mail. The Post Office itself was unable to take such action. I admit that the hon. the Minister has experienced difficulty under the old Post Office Act and that is why a change is being brought about in this clause.</p>

<p>Yes, but it was not possible to act as stringently as the hon. the Minister now proposes to do. I admit that wider powers are imperative in this connection. But there is just this consideration: I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not consider making the provision more specific so that it will refer more particularly to postal articles that are printed or that are aimed at promoting the interests of an unlawful organization? He can make the provisions as wide as he wants as far as unlawful organizations are concerned.</p>

<p>I want to explain to the hon. the Minister what I mean. In the Crimes Act of Australia there is reference to postal articles that are printed or published by, forthcoming from, or aimed at the promotion of, an unlawful organization. There the words &#x201C;unlawful organization&#x201D; are specifically mentioned and it may perhaps be better in this case to mention the words &#x201C;unlawful organization&#x201D; specifically.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. Minister did yesterday in quite another context, I think he did me and other members on this side of the House an injustice by saying that we raise this matter in order, as he put it, &#x201C;om spoke op te ja&#x201D;. It has been made perfectly clear by me and other speakers that we agree entirely that there should be some procedure, and perhaps a procedure that goes beyond the present provision in the Post Office Act, to facilitate the detention of mail which is suspected of being of some assistance in the committing of an offence, etc. But I put it to the hon. the Minister that I assume that he did not want to go beyond the needs of the case, and as Clause 13 stands now, he is in fact going beyond the needs of the case. The hon. Minister said that as the position obtains now, a package having been detained is sent on after a certain time. That is true, because there is a clause here which says (Section 96 of the Post Office Act)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any officer who otherwise than in pursuance of his duty opens or tampers with or wilfully destroys, makes away or secretes or suffers to be opened &#x2026; shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Otherwise than in the pursuance of his duties.&#x201D; Now, the postal official acting in terms of Clause 13 of this Bill would be acting in &#x201C;pursuance of his duty&#x201D;, and does not fall within the ambit of Section 96 of the Post Office Act which is the sanction against the postal official unreasonably detaining mail. For that reason, and for the reason mentioned by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) that not all the post offices are run by postmasters and senior officials, I think this clause goes too far. The post office in the area where I live at the present time has a postmistress who comprises the entire staff&#x2014;she is the senior, the junior, the office-boy, everything, and whether this good lady will have the judgment that is required I am not in a position to say, but the fact is that as the clause stands, a person being a postal official can without any good reason detain a package, a telegram or letter indefinitely, which I think is not the Minister&#x2019;s intention, and which does interfere seriously with the transmission of the mail. If the hon. Minister merely wants the power he seeks in this clause, and does not want to impede the flow of mail through the country unnecessarily. <span class="col_4829-4830" refersTo="page_0989"/>I think the amendment I intend to move will solve the problem, because it puts a period to the detention which any postal official can impose on a telegram or postal article, without taking the action which the hon. Minister wants that official to take, namely, to hand it over for prosecution, etc., to the Attorney-General. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end ot the proposed new Section 118:</block>

<p>Provided that if such postal article or telegram is not handed over to any Attorney-General or public prosecutor within 30 days of its detention by the officer in charge of the post office or telegraph office concerned, it shall forthwith be delivered to the person to whom it is addressed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The regulations make provision for that.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>That is my difficulty. I cannot find a regulation that makes provision for that. There is a regulation, Section 96, in the Post Office Act, which I have just read, which makes it an offence to delay and detain articles other than in the pursuance of the duty of the official concerned, but that does not cover my point. In terms of Clause 13 of this Bill, the person concerned would be acting in pursuance of his or her duty if he or she could say &#x201C;I reasonably suspected that that package or that letter or that telegram came within the ambit of this clause&#x201D;. I do not want to dilate on the matter. This is a practical matter and a very important one for the ordinary person and for the ordinary use of the mail. The hon, Minister spoke about the <i>South African Communist</i> being a periodical which he cited the other day and which he said passes freely through the mails. I want to put it to him that anybody, whether as a practical joke, or maliciously, could send him or me or anybody else a copy of the <i>South African Communist</i> which we have never seen in our lives, and from that date on the Postmistress of Clovelly, for example, would say &#x201C;I can reasonably suspect every piece of mail that comes to that person because he has just received a brown-paper package which contained the <i>South African Communist.</i> From that day on his mail might be detained for a long time, whereas the matter would be quite innocent. Therefore, I put this limitation on the whole procedure, and the Minister. I am sure, will agree that from the day that the postal official concerned scans the telegram or the piece of mail or package, and says &#x201C;I reasonably suspect that this is something that should receive the attention of the Attomev-General or the public prosecutor&#x201D;, within 30 days, surely, that telegram or package can either be handed to the prosecutor or the Attorney-General, or be sent forward in me ordinary way. For that reason I ask the hon. Minister to consider this amendment to be a reasonable one.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_merwe">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER MERWE</person>:</from>

<p>I think that it will be very wrong on our part to fix a maximum period in this Bill during which a postal article of this nature has to be delivered to an addressee. The fact remains that because of the vast distances in South Africa one cannot compare the position in Johannesburg, for example, with that of a small place in the north-west or South West Africa. If the amendment is adopted and the Post Office has the right to detain a postal article of this nature for 30 days during which time they will have to decide whether to hand it over to the Attorney-General or not, we will have the position that postal articles which could be delivered at a much earlier stage, perhaps within a day&#x2014;in Johannesburg, for example, the Attorney-General or the head of the Post Office can decide within a day or two&#x2014;will then be detained for a much longer period because the amendment states that the person in charge of the post office or telegraph office concerned will have the right to detain such postal articles for 30 days. The tendency will then be not to deal urgently with a matter of that nature as the post office would like to do, but the tendency will be to say: &#x201C;Well, we have the right to detain it for 30 days.&#x201D; A week or two or three will go by and the postal article will be delayed longer than would otherwise have been the case. If no maximum period is fixed the tendency will always be to send that postal article further on its way as soon as possible. The hon member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) must surely understand that when he fixes a maximum period that a maximum period will at the same time tend to become the minimum period. This amendment therefore will create precisely the undesirable state of affairs which the hon. member for Hospital seeks to avoid with his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) I regret to say that I made a mistake. The provisions to which I referred are not contained in the British Post Office Act but in the Official Secrets Act which refers to the Post Office Act. I want to direct the attention of the hon. member to Sections 4 and 5 of the Official Secrets Act. In Section 4 it is provided&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where it appears to a Secretary of State that such a course is expedient in the public interest &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is all: there is no other qualification at all. It merely has to appear to him that such a course is necessary in the public interest&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; he may by warrant under his hand refer any person who owns or controls any telegraphic cable or wire office used for the sending of telegrams to or from any place out of the United Kingdom, to produce to him or to any person named in the warrant the original and transcripts either of all telegrams. or of telegrams sent from or addressed to any specified person or place, sent <span class="col_4831-4832" refersTo="page_0990"/>or received to or from any place out of the United Kingdom by any such cable, wire &#x2026;</block>

<p>You see therefore that this provision is much wider than the provision that we are asking for here. But in Section 5 it goes even further. I have read it through very quickly and it appears to me that these provisions are even wider, and that the most important point is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who carries on, whether alone or in conjunction with any other business, the business of receiving for reward letters, telegrams or postal packets for delivery or forwarding to persons for whom they are intended, shall as soon as may be, send to the chief officer of police for the district for registration by him notice of the fact together with the address or addresses where the business is carried on, and the chief officer of police shall keep a register of the names and addresses of such persons&#x2026;.</block>

<p>These provisions give that police officer considerable powers in that connection. In other words, our Post Office Act does not go nearly as far as the Official Secrets Act does in regard to the British Post Office Act.</p>

<p>As far as the amendment of the hon. member for Hospital is concerned, I do not have the slightest doubt that the purpose for which the hon. member moved his amendment has already been covered, apart from the argument raised by the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe). It is an offence for any post office official to detain postal articles. I have not the slightest doubt that in practice there will be no unnecessary delaying of postal articles but that this clause as it stands will give the Attorney-General the necessary powers to bring criminals to book more easily. Because that is the position, I am not prepared to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I think this should be said: The hon. Minister refers to the Official Secrets Act to reinforce his argument, and he has the advantage of me that he has the Act before him. But where he says that the Act lays down that &#x201C;as soon as may be&#x201D; the piece of mail, the telegram is to be handed over to the chief officer of police for the district concerned, then that, in contrast with the clause as it stands now, completely proves my argument.</p>

<p>I cannot explain to the Minister all over again. We are not arguing about the need to retain pieces of mail in certain circumstances, but to try and limit the period in such a way that no unreasonable suspicion by a person in the service of the Postal Department can cause someone&#x2019;s mail to be held up for malicious or whimsical reasons, or even political reasons. You can make of any small post office a &#x201C;dead letter&#x201D; office where your mail may lie and &#x201C;moulder in the grave&#x201D; if the postmistress has a reasonable suspicion.

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>This clause introduces four new sub-sections and three of these will enable the State to equate with the P.A.C. or the A.N.C. some organization of a different name. I make no comment on these; but I want to deal with sub-section (d), which deals with the aspect of the courts in considering the validity of anything done under sub-sections (a), (b) and (c). Now (d) will mean that no court will have jurisdiction to pronounce upon the validity of any proclamation issued under this claues. Normally a court would have that right, and it is an important right. It would be entitled to pronounce a proclamation invalid, <i>inter alia,</i> on two important grounds, firstly that it was arbitrary, or secondly that it was <i>male fide.</i> Arbitrariness means that the person issuing the proclamation did not apply his mind to the question, and <i>male fide</i> means that although the person applied his mind to the question he nevertheless dishonestly says in the proclamation that the position is different. Those are very far-reaching changes. I suggest that a case certainly has been made out for changes. We know that the Snyman Report and the various killings and incidents we have had are reasons for it. A further good reason for it is the threat we have of overseas powers joining with dissatisfied elements in the country to bring the State to a downfall. I am impressed, too, by the fact that Patrick Duncan said openly in London recently that the intention was that there should be an Algerian-type war here. All those facts move me and this side of the House to say that certain changes are justified and I cannot think of anyone who does not agree &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I did not know that. I suppose the Minister is referring to the letter he wrote subsequently to the report. I certainly did not understand him to go so far. But I will say that this serious situation moves us to support far-reaching changes, including the change in the law regarding preparatory examinations. Though we have felt it necessary, albeit reluctantly, to concede these extra powers, it is most important that one should not go a yard further than is necessary. I think one has to weigh, in considering whether a particular provision is necessary, all the facts of the situation. We have to weigh the advantages against the disadvantages it could have both internally among the people who support law and order, and indeed among our friends overseas.</p>

<p>Now one trusts that the Minister will certainly bring his mind to bear upon this problem when issuing a proclamation and that there wil be no possibility of the Minister dishonestly putting something in the proclamation that is not true. But then I ask the Minister whether he really wants to put a provision on the Statute Book which is capable of misconstruction. Therefore I sincerely hope that the Minister will feel that the value of this power to him and to the country is as nothing beside the harm it may do to him personally and to anyone concerned with the issuing of a proclamation. Accordingly, if I am in order, I would like to move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<p>I honestly cannot understand the attitude of the hon. member. If he had been a layman I would have forgiven him, but he is a jurist and an able one at that. But what does the hon. member do? He cannot plead not guilty when I make the accusation against him that if you, Sir, had not ruled his amendment out of order, and if he had persuaded me to adopt it, it would have nullified the effect of the whole clause completely, and the hon. member knows that as well as I do. He would have nullified the clause in such a way that it would not even have been necessary for the Committee to adopt it. Then we would have been far worse off than we are now. The hon. member knows that if this provision is not inserted the whole clause will be worthless. He has read the Snyman Report, and I understand from hon. members opposite&#x2014;they must please tell me if they have changed their minds&#x2014;that they accept that report. The report states that this principle must be adopted and I submitted the legislation to Mr. Justice Snyman who made a thorough study of it.

<p>Of course. Can the hon. member split up the clause into various parts? It is permissible to do so in order to help the Opposition, with the consent of the Committee, so I understand, and we do not object to that because one wants to assist the Opposition in this difficult predicament. But hon. members&#x2014;and the hon. member for Pinelands is one of them&#x2014;are now acting in such a way that it will not surprise me at all if we have a suggestion one day that this House should be enlarged so that some members can have two benches to sit on, on one of which is written &#x201C;national&#x201D; and on the other &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; because hon. members continually change their minds when it suits them. But the point is, and this is what I have against the hon. member &#x2026; [Interjections.] The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) can always enter the debate if she wants to do so. She can ask her Whip to be relieved of the obligation simply to sit there mumbling. But the hon. member for Pinelands knows what will happen if this provision is not included. Certain cases have been postponed pending the passing of this legislation. We make no secret of that fact, nor does Mr. Justice Snyman. That is why he said that his recommendation should be made retrospective. We have postponed certain cases with the specific object of making it unnecessary for us to prove that Poqo is the P.A.C.. so that the court will have to accept that as a fact when the State President issues such a proclamation, and hon. members opposite support that. But if we do not have this provision, what will happen? None of those cases will be able to come before the court because hon. members know these people just as well as I do. An application will be made to court to cast doubt on this matter and to get a ruling from the court that Poqo is not the same as the P.A.C.</p>

We are not dealing here with an Act of Parliament but with a proclamation; that proclamation can be attacked in court, and it will be so attacked, in an effort to show that that proclamation is <i>ultra vires</i> or has been issued <i>mala fide</i>, and what will the result then be? An application will first be made to the Cape court. It will take time to deal with it because they will use all the delaying tactics that they know so well, but eventually judgment will be given against them.

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>My objections are as follows. First of all. this Bill is being rushed through Parliament within a few days because of the desperate urgency to get this measure through. I have the Snyman Report here which I have read with. I suppose, as much attention as anybody else, and I see it is dated 6 March. It is now 26 April. Why, if there was such desperate urgency, did the Minister wait from 6 March to 23 April before presenting the Bill to the House? If the State was in such a desperate emergency that this Bill had to be rushed through Parliament, that we were given one day to study this Bill. I would suggest that the Easter recess should rather have been delayed. Why the sudden rush now?</p>

<p>The other thing is that the Minister says you either accept the Snyman Report or you do not. There are only two recommendations in the report, couched in very general terms. The one relates to the difficulties of the Attorneys-General about Pocio being the same as the P.A C. and the other is in regard to the membership of Pogo. It does not say anything about summary trials or special courts &#x201C;at any place&#x201D;.</p>

He wrote back and said yes, and this happens to be one of his recommendations. In regard to the other matters, he made certain observations in general, but naturally it would not have been in order for me to ask for his comment or his approval of that.

It was on that basis that the Opposition announced its agreement with the measure. Now we have this Unlawful Organizations Act being made a permanent part of our legislation. Yesterday the hon. member for Durban (North) was very proud of the amendment he got accepted to Clause 4, because it changed the whole complexion of the matter (he said) and it now has to come back to the House to be repeatedly approved every year. Now we see the fate of this sort of thing. Accept this sort of Draconian legislation on this flimsy excuse that as long as an amendment is accepted that the House has to approve of it year after year, everything is fine.

<p>Yes, it must be some sort of malady which has taken from her all her good sense, and which has taken her feet about a mile off the ground. Here we have a recommendation that it is impossible to deal with an organization like Poqo under the existing law, and indeed that has been the experience. If the hon. member for Houghton had taken the trouble to look through the newspaper reports in respect of these matters, she would have found that for more than a year they have been trying to tie up Poqo with the P.A.C., and that was their difficulty, and what happened after a year? Paarl was just one example of what happened, and the Bashee River incident. It is quite possible that these things could have been prevented if that organization had been nipped in the bud in the beginning. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Houghton says we will see what happens this time next year. I am not concerned with next year. I am concerned with now, and that is what this House is concerned with, this urgent situation. I think we would be failing in our duty to South Africa if we did not support this clause upon the recommendation urgently brought to the notice of the country by the commissioner. The hon. member for Houghton has not yet advanced a reason why she is opposed to this clause. We raised the matter in regard to one paragraph which we wanted the Minister to explain, but we must support the principle of the clause because we have to deal with the situation as it has been brought to our attention by an independent person especially seized of the difficulties which exist. The hon. member for Houghton, in her little playings here with politics, is not fighting this difficulty in this country; she is just trying to embarrass the Opposition.

<p>Fortunately the reply is very simple. It will not be my function to define it at all. It will be the function of the courts to define it. As I explained to hon. members at the second reading, Nokwe and others were charged before a regional court; they were found guilty in terms of that section; they went on appeal to the Transvaal courts and the Transvaal court found that although the organization was similar to the A.N.C., in terms of the wording of that section they were not guilty of any transgression of the section. It is to give effect to that judgment of the Transvaal court, which is a technical matter, that these words are being added. If and when anybody is charged in future it will be for the courts to interpret that section in the light of the judgment in Regina v. Nokwe and others.</p>

The recommendations made by him do not cover any suggestion of steps of the sort set out in Clause 17.

<p>The Minister himself has put it forward with great diffidence and it seemed to us that he himself felt that he was asking for something which almost frightened him when he thought about it seriously. Sir, the interesting thing about this clause is that it is to be used not only to obtain evidence or to obtain what might amount to confession of offences which have already been committed but also of offences intended to be committed or which some person or persons might have intended to commit but did not commit. In other words, the hon. the Minister is asking for these enormous powers in respect of two classes of cases which I think I am correct in saying certainly as to one, was not a crime under our criminal law and as to the second one, may or may not be, depending upon the stage of preparation which had been reached in respect of the intention to commit the crime. Intention to commit a crime is no offence; there has to be preparation before that can be established. In other words, we are here in a position where we are asking for powers almost unheard of in any civilized country in respect of three classes of cases, one of which is certainly not an offence and one of which may or may not be an offence whereas the third would be. The only justification for this provision that I could find seems to be the sort of attitude that because we are dealing with people who impose secrecy upon their members by means of torture and by means of violence and by means of murder, the only way in which we can get information is by using the same methods against them. In other words, we are being asked to make the most terrible confession, namely that we cannot protect witnesses or informers who have made information available to the police. Sir, that is a very sad day for South Africa and a very sad state of affairs for the Minister of Justice to have to admit to this House because it is tantamount to saying that where the man has given the State assistance in finding out who <span class="col_4843-4844" refersTo="page_0996"/>has been responsible for a crime, the State cannot thereafter protect him. I wonder whether the Minister realizes the implications of a statement of that kind, because if that is so, then I wonder if a case is not made out for declaring a state of emergency in South Africa, saying that he cannot protect these people and because he cannot protect them he is going to place himself in a position where he can use these methods against this organization.</p>

<p>Yes, I put it that way and I put it that way deliberately because it seems to me that the intention of this clause is to meet third degree with third degree or something worse. Sir, before one can evaluate this clause I think it is very necessary for us to understand what powers the authorities already have at the present time. In respect of a suspect, he is charged with some crime or other; he is brought before the court and remanded, and while he is under remand he can be interrogated. The Minister knows very well that suspects are often remanded from time to time while the police are seeking further evidence and that they have the right to interrogate those people. But, of course, the suspect has the right to legal assistance. Then there are the people whom the police have reasons to believe have information, whom they want as witnesses. They are covered by Section 83 of the Act of 1955 which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The magistrate may at any time, upon the request of the local public prosecutor, require the attendance before him of any person who is likely to give material evidence as to any alleged offence, whether or not it be known or suspected who the person is by whom the offence has been committed.</block>

That could be amended to be used in the case of suspected offences or preparations for an offence, but it would be under proper control <span class="col_4845-4846" refersTo="page_0997"/>and the hon. the Minister would know that on each occasion the accused came before a magistrate and that there was no question of the police being in sole control of him.</p>

<p>I would be very interested to see it, but I can see no justification for it in the circumstances which exist at the present time. Here you have provision made for 90 days&#x2019; solitary confinement which can be repeated for further periods of 90 days, with no limitation. In other words, the unfortunate <span class="col_4847-4848" refersTo="page_0998"/>individual is held incommunicado for 90 days and if he has not answered at the end of 90 days he can be put away again. Sir, I can see no justification in the present situation for an action of this kind. The hon. the Minister has been a practising lawyer as I have. I think we have all had experience of the sort of things which have happened in police cells and which are alleged to happen in police cells but are not proved. I think the Minister agrees with me that the police have the ability to make a period of incarceration under interrogation very interesting indeed for the prisoner, and I wonder if hon. members opposite, other than the Minister and myself, have an idea of what this can mean to the individual who is held and of the sort of treatment to which he can be subjected.

<p>It may amount to the same thing very often. People are prepared to give all sorts of information. I have seen men broken down before; I think the Minister has too. I have seen them broken down here and in other places and I know what the results are. I know how they try to stand by their stories for fear of what may happen to them again. The clause also provides that no court shall have the authority to release such a person. Why, if that is so, have we got this provision, &#x201C;if a police officer believes on reasonable ground&#x201D;? Who is going to decide whether those grounds are reasonable or not? Only a court of law can decide whether they are reasonable. Does this exclude the court altogether, or can a case be brought before the court to find out whether the police officer&#x2019;s grounds are reasonable or not, and the court can declare that they are not reasonable but it cannot release the prisoner. Why put in &#x201C;upon reasonable grounds&#x201D; or is it just white-washing the situation? Why not say that a police officer may at any time for any reason incarcerate an individual who he thinks has information? It need not be reasonable grounds at all. That is white-washing it. No one can test the reasonable grounds. That is white-washing it. The only man who has the right to release the prisoner is the Minister, and who is going to bring information before the Minister as to whether those grounds are reasonable or not? Sir, a provision of this kind is a complete negation of all the principles on which our criminal law is based. Here you have a man who can be locked up for 90 days, who may be entirely unconnected with the crime, but who has, in the opinion of the police, certain evidence. He is kept there for 90 days and subjected to all sorts of interesting experiences. Perhaps he never had information at all. And then? Take the case of a suspect. The whole principle of our law is that a man shall not be forced to confess. If he makes a confession we will not use it; we will just use the facts to which he confesses and establish them in another way. In other words, you are undermining the whole principle of the freedom of confession.

<p>I am not insinuating anything. Let the Minister listen for a moment. He knows very well that torture was an accepted weapon of the authorities in the maintenance of law and order. He knows that it was abandoned because of the uselessness of the statements made by the victims and their readiness very often to confess to anything provided the torture was severe enough. I am not suggesting physical torture; what I am suggesting is that the incarceration of a man without evidence, a man who may not have any information, a man who is merely suspected and may be innocent, for periods of 90 days may amount to a form of mental torture, because he always has the hope that at the end he may come out, and when he comes out he gets another 90 days. I wonder if the Minister knows the effect that incarceration in solitary confinement can have on people. There are some people&#x2014; apparently the Minister is one&#x2014;who are not much affected by it. I have known men who were not affected by it.

He can, however, as has been pointed out, be recommitted any number of times for a further period of 90 days.</p>

<p>To me these words I have read out spell tyranny and despotism. This, in plain English, says &#x201C;South Africa will be a police state&#x201D; as indeed it will if this clause is accepted. I think it is impossible to tolerate this clause. It gives powers to the police to give third degree for three months and then perhaps even longer. I believe that it must be regarded as a barbarous innovation and I say that I condemn it wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>One of the official organs of the Nationalists, the <i>Burger,</i> is correct when it talks about &#x201C;formidable powers being granted to answer the challenge of subversion and revolution&#x201D;. Yet we are told by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Justice that this land is tranquil and peaceful and safe. The <i>Burger</i> differs and must have had this clause particularly in mind when their editor called this Bill &#x201C;a chill reminder that we were already in the midst of harder and more severe times&#x201D; and that &#x201C;we have to fight back with measures such as have seldom been necessary in the past in times of peace and then only sporadically&#x201D;. They are now to become a permanent part of our law. The Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister says &#x201C;peace reigns&#x201D;. The <i>Burger</i> says &#x201C;we are in a state of seige that may last many years&#x201D;. That is why, it says, the Government needs what they call &#x201C;frightening administrative powers which could lend themselves to serious abuse&#x201D;. That is also what my Leader has said. We as parliamentarians, we as people who believe in the rule of law, should never subject the citizens of this country to anything that can lend itself to serious abuse without adequate correction and without adequate check and without adequate safeguards. The <i>Burger</i> feels, as I do, what it calls, &#x201C;an instinctive aversion to these radical proposals&#x201D;. This clause is the most obnoxious I have ever come across in any law in all my 20 years in Parliament.</p>

<p>Never! I was one of the few who protested in Parliament and out of Parliament against my own party, because I believed that such powers should never be given to any Minister without adequate safeguards. To me this clause is abhorrent; it is obnoxious to all who cherish the liberty of the subject, to all who hate the idea of arbitrary arrests, to all who believe that the test of civilization is the fair administration of justice to all. Arbitrary powers always corrupt and they corrupt not only those who suffer from them but also those who practise them. If you break down the rule of law; it you breach the principle of <i>habeas corpus</i> which we should always uphold; if you break it even temporarily, in any way, there should always be guarantees to see that those who are placed in a position of arbitrary authority, should be liable to speedy and stern correction if there is any abuse of power. If you break down the rule of law the inevitable result must be cruelty and despotism and, in the end, chaos. There are no safeguards or checks against abuse in this Bill.</p>

<p>I think there is one important thing we should remember. This legislation, this clause, is going to be applied in South West Africa which is mandated territory. That is something which we should think of very seriously, Sir. We should remember that there is a case pending at present against us in which we rely on the rule of law as the last bastion to protect our just and legal rights. And we are now, in our own country, abusing and ignoring the rule of law; we are going against its very finest principles. What hope have we to expect people overseas, our friends who have always <span class="col_4851-4852" refersTo="page_1000"/>protected our interests, to do anything else but to despise us. What great harm we are doing to our cause overseas! What harm we are doing to our cause in that court in which we will plead our legal and just rights, as we hoped, with success. Our safety may be grievously imperilled unless the rule of law is honoured and maintained. Yet we ourselves set an example by doing something which every single civilized country abhors and to which we on this side and I personally cannot possibly ever subscribe.</p>

The hon. member knows that before legislation can be applied to South West Africa a provision must be embodied in the legislation to that effect and it is not embodied in this legislation.

<p>I must honestly say, Mr. Chairman, that if that hon. member were a member of my party I would renounce him; I would refuse under the circumstances to be a member of the same party as that to which he belonged; I would refuse to sit in the same caucus with him; I would refuse to be seen in the same company with him. That is all I have to say to the hon. member.</p>

<p><span class="col_4853-4854" refersTo="page_1001"/>I want to direct my remarks now to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who approached this aspect of the matter in a very reasonable manner, which I appreciate. I do not want to reply to all his arguments. I just want to lay a foundation for the arguments that may be raised later. I want to give the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a confidential document dealing with the British Act of 1922. I just want to quote one section from that document&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Regulations in terms of the permissive Act &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition will remember that it was a permissive Act which suspended the entire system of justice and in terms of which there could be government by regulation. That Act is still in force; it is still on the British Statute Book. I am not giving these facts for the information of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition but actually for the information of the London <i>Times.</i> This Act was applied up to 1961. I quote from the document that I want to entrust to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Regulations in terms of the permissive Act were made to cope with the special circumstances existing at that time &#x2026;</block>

<p>This was in 1922, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These regulations, also reviewable by the House of Commons &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is quite a normal procedure&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; were in force in full vigour until 1961 when the I.R.A. announced that it was calling off its campaign.</block>

<p>I will give this document to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. There is one other thing that I want to tell the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He warned against the abuse of the provisions of Clause 17. I do not resent this fact; I would have resented it if he had not issued this warning. I do not resent his warning because anyone who tries to deny that this clause can lead to misuse is a fool. I am painfully aware of this fact, not only in regard to what I myself have seen happening but for other reasons as well. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said that he had seen human beings being broken. It is not a very nice thing to see a human being being broken. I have seen it and he has seen it. The man seeking these powers must take responsibility for them. They can make or break him and I am painfully aware of that fact. Nothing broke a former Minister of Justice under another Government as much as these regulations did&#x2014;broke him to such an extent that his name stank in South Africa. I do not intend to allow that to happen to me. That is why when I accept responsibility for asking for this regulation, I fully realize what the results may be for me as an individual and for this Government; I fully appreciate all the consequences that may flow from this. I realize that it will be my specific duty, my responsibility, to ensure that these powers are not abused. What is more, I realize that I still have to be responsible to this House; I shall have to be able to tell this House with a clear conscience at all times that this regulation has been applied without its having being abused. I cannot say any more than this to hon. members; I do not want to go further than this.</p>

<p>But I want to tell hon. members that we are now entering a new phase in the struggle against these subversive elements. I have reason to believe that we are not very far from the stage, depending upon circumstances which are unknown and therefore unpredictable, when we may perhaps be able to lay our hands on the people who are primarily responsible for this position that has been created in South Africa. Up to the present we have only captured the minions although we have arrested some of the less important leaders; we have even arrested some of the important figures in this movement. But we have not been able to arrest the nucleus of leaders, the group that is behind this whole movement, the people who are responsible for all that is happening in South Africa. I am being very honest and frank in this regard.</p>

<p>I am aware of the fact that there may possibly be people somewhere who can lead us to those people. But Section 83&#x2014;as has been proved clearly in the past&#x2014;is unfortunately not strong enough to bring that about. The Government wants to lay its hands on those people. Not only do we want to lay our hands on them but in the interests of South Africa and in the interests of us all we must lay our hands on them. I hesitate for the reasons that I have given to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to ask for these powers. One does learn something from experience, Mr. Chairman. I have also learnt from my experience. There were times during the past months when I was grateful for what I had experienced. One draws on one&#x2019;s past experience. That experience compels me to say that if this clause can be put into operation we may succeed in our purpose and we may perhaps save ourselves&#x2014;and when I speak about &#x201C;ourselves&#x201D; I mean all the inhabitants of South Africa, White and non-White, no matter to what party they may belong&#x2014;much nameless misery, a great deal of sorrow, if we can get to the root of the matter and solve this problem. Hon. members must please not ask me to say more than this; I am not able to say more than this at this stage. I do not even want hon. members to take my word for this. All I ask is that they give me the benefit of any doubt that may exist in this regard.</p>

<p>I said I was not sure of what the position is myself. The Minister has, however, given me an assurance, and his knowledge is obviously greater than mine on the subject. He drafted the Bill with legal assistance and I accept that it does not apply to South West Africa. Therefore I say to this House and to the world that any argument I may have used in this respect, any argument that hinges on the statement that it will be applied to the mandated territory of South West Africa, I withdraw unequivocally. I am sorry I used that wrong argument to make one point. That is unqualified and I am glad the Committee has given me a chance to correct it immediately.</p>

<p>Let me say this, however, that it does not diminish by one iota my very strong objection to this clause. I believe it will be used inside and outside our land to stoke the fires of hate and antagonism which other countries feel against us, in particular those Western democracies on whom we depend, should the worst come to the worst in connection with South West Africa, to help our cause &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, a clause in a Bill which authorizes the summary arrest by the police of individuals, to be incarcerated for the extraction of information continuously for 90 days or until they give satisfactory replies to interrogation is abhorrent. It is foreign to the rule of law which is honoured by all the countries whose friendship we value&#x2014;the United States of America, Great Britain and France. These countries which could through their right of veto help us on serious international occasions, might well be turned away from us and our interests by the fact that we ourselves have shown an utter disregard for the canons of justice and the rule of law. I say that the withdrawal I have made does not alter my own feelings one jot towards this iniquitous clause nor does it alter the fact that it will be very dangerous to our future relations with other nations if we accede to this harsh and objectionable measure.</p>

<p>In all these years no member of the United Party or of any other party has shown less patriotism towards South Africa than that hon. member. I think that everyone in this House, even his own supporters, hold that opinion of him.</p>

<p>One thing is very clear and that is what has been said by the hon. the Minister&#x2014;that the United Party supports the principle of this Bill not out of principle but out of opportunism. They have agreed that we should have a watch-dog but now that we have that watch-dog, they are trying to draw its teeth. They want to have a watch-dog which cannot bite at all. I want to base my argument on the attitude of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said that this type of measure was quite correct in time of war and in time of crisis. We know that in time of crisis we have to give these powers to the Minister. Will any hon. member say that as far as our internal security is concerned the position during the last war was worse than the position that we are experiencing to-day? Will they tell us that they have not read what Mr. Justice Snyman said in his reply to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s letter? Let me read it for hon. members [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The question arises, however, whether, having regard to the circumstances as revealed in my inquiry and the cold war here and in the world, the present time can be regarded as being normal.</block>

<p>This is a time of cold war. Everyone knows that. It is just as serious a period as far as <span class="col_4857-4858" refersTo="page_1003"/>our internal security is concerned as was the case during the war. Those hon. members are in full agreement that those powers would be justified during a time of war. Their attitude is that when they are in power they are entitled to give their Minister more powers than they are prepared to give to this Minister. What are they prepared to do? They are prepared to give a Minister unlimited powers in time of crisis, powers which permit him to act even without parliamentary sanction.</p>

<p>I have here an article which appeared recently in the <i>Cape Argus</i> written by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn). What does he advocate? He says that the Minister must not ask Parliament for these powers; he says that if the Minister deems it necessary, he must make use of those powers whether he has parliamentary approval or not. He must do what General Smuts did in 1922. He mentions the example here and states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The United Party can see circumstances in which the present Government too may need extraordinary powers. General Smuts, in his lifetime, had to take drastic action. At one time many years ago, to the distress of the Nationalist Party, General Smuts deported communist leaders from South Africa without parliamentary authority.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Rule of law&#x201D;! General Smuts did not detain people for 90 days and seek parliamentary approval for doing so in advance. There was a localized strike on the Witwatersrand; there was no general crisis in the country, and what did General Smuts do? He did not detain those people for 90 days. He imprisoned them without trial. He then took them from the gaol and deported them without trial.</p>

He must do so whether Parliament gives its approval or not and he must ask Parliament for indemnity afterwards.</p>

<p>I say that their attitude in principle is that in a time of crisis one can give far greater powers to a Minister. Their argument is that this provision is too severe, that it can be abused far too much, but I say that the attitude of this party is that when there is a crisis one must not only give the Minister greater powers but one must also give the Minister the assurance that he can do just what he wants to do: Detain them for 90 days; detain them for 120 days; detain them in gaol; deport them; do just what you want to do for the security of the country. Is that not what the hon. member for Yeoville advocates in his article? They were prepared to assume those powers themselves but they do not want to give those powers to this Minister of Justice. The whole thing amounts to this, that they are continually saying that they accept the Snyman Report, but they then surely accept the fact that the position in this country at the moment makes it necessary to give the Minister extraordinary powers. But now they come along and say that the position in the country is not serious and that there is no justification for these powers. Their attitude is quite clear to me. The hon. the Minister stated clearly why he wanted these powers and he told us precisely what he was going to do with them. Hon. members opposite now object to his being given those powers and they can only object if they do not believe that there is a serious position in the country. They can only object if they have not accepted the Snyman Report. When they say that they accept that report and they vote for the second reading, it is quite clear that the only reason why they do so is that it is politically convenient for them to do so. I say that the attitude adopted by those hon. members is a shocking one. On each occasion that the hon. the Minister has asked for additional powers we have experienced the same complaint from hon. members opposite that those powers can be abused. We have now heard this again from the hon. member for Wynberg who has said that these powers can be abused. They have said this over the years in regard to all the powers that have been asked for. The hon. the Minister challenged them to mention one case where this Minister of Justice or a former Minister of Justice had abused any of those powers. They have not been able to mention one case. They mentioned one case recently and that was in connection with Patrick Duncan, but there is not one single member sitting on that side of the House who can say that that power was abused in the case of Patrick Duncan. But they continue to make us suspect in the eyes of the world. The hon. member for Wynberg is now going to tell the world all the possible and impossible results that can flow from these powers being abused. That is how he brings discredit upon South Africa. If a madman were to have these powers, he would of course be able to do anything. The hon. member for Wynberg has told the world that this is now the position in South Africa. He has also said that our good name will be dragged through the mud even further. What an unreasonable attitude to adopt in respect of one&#x2019;s own country! What an unreasonable attitude it is to adopt while those hon. members agree with us that the position in South Africa is very serious!</p>

<p>I am sorry that the spirit revealed by the Opposition has been to tell the Minister: &#x201C;Strengthen your hand; do not go too far <span class="col_4859-4860" refersTo="page_1004"/>but you can rely on the Opposition in your efforts to combat sabotage in South Africa, in trying to overcome this dangerous position; in your efforts to do so you can rely upon us&#x201D;, while to-day they adopt an attitude which is not at all in conformity with the attitude that they first adopted. I am afraid that they are doing themselves a very great injustice. That would not hurt me so much but the fact is that they are also doing South Africa a very great injustice.</p>

<p>Well, the hon. member for Vereeniging is the last person who should talk to this side of the House as us being opportunists. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has called him a political grasshopper, and let me tell him that we have not been opportunistic in our attitude towards this Bill, and let no one else on that side ever refer to our attitude as opportunistic. We have supported the hon. Minister where he has a case, and he knows it very well, and I think everyone on that side of the House should appreciate that where a case has been made out we have supported him. What case has been made out in this regard? The hon. member for Vereeniging glibly talks about the Snyman Commission Report and then the cold war. There is nothing in the Snyman Commission Report which warrants a clause like this.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about the Snyman Commission Report. That is what we support. The hon. member for Vereeniging wants to do what everyone else on that side apparently wants to do&#x2014;just give the Minister all the powers he wants, without any case being made out for these powers, extraordinary powers in time of crisis, and then&#x2014;the hon. member will correct me if I misquote him&#x2014;he said &#x201C;daar is nie &#x2019;n noodtoestand in hierdie land nie&#x201D;. This is what he said. There is no emergency in this country. I cannot follow the hon. member&#x2019;s argument. In my short time in this House, the most remarkable thing that I have ever seen was when the hon. Minister of Justice stood up and asked for a power like this without being able to tell the House why he wants it. This is the Minister of Justice who said when he introduced the Bill that he had qualms about it. To-day he said that it pains him to do this, for the various reasons that there are; apart from the effect it might have on the hon. Minister&#x2019;s political career, it pains him personally as a lawyer and as a Minister of Justice. In those circumstances surely some case can be made out for this! If the hon. Minister of Justice is so pained about this, why is this clause so drastic, so Draconian? Why is there no reference to the courts? Far from that, the courts are entirely excluded.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>You take the two different people who are going to be dealt with under this clause. There is the suspect who could be an accused person. My hon. Leader has dealt with this. The point he makes is a very valid one, and the hon. Minister knows it. If this undermines the whole principle of our system of justice, of which we had every reason to be extremely proud, is it worth the results that it is going to achieve? Are we going to turn ourselves into a right-wing totalitarian country in order to combat a left-wing totalitarian threat? Are we going to have a right-wing totalitarian legal system to meet a left-wing totalitarian threat? I do not think so. If the hon. Minister could justify this, we would be able to consider it, but the hon. Minister has come here and has asked us for blanket consent. Under those circumstances can any reasonable man be a party to a clause like this, especially when the hon. Minister cannot explain it? The court is specifically excluded. No matter what happens, this is entirely in the hands of the police. I am not casting any aspersions on the police, but what happens to a man in the 90 days? What usually happens to a man when he is held for interrogation? And why is the period 90 days? Surely we are entitled to some explanation of that? Why is it 90 days? My hon. Leader referred to the section known to newspapermen where people can be brought for interrogation before a magistrate and if they do not answer satisfactorily, they can be put into gaol for eight days at a time, and so on, and so on. But, Sir. they always appear before a magistrate somewhere. And there is a very good reason for it. Why are cases remanded in our courts for 14 days at a maximum and then the accused has to be brought into the court? Why were those laws framed in 1917 and even before, and why have we kept them up to this day? For very good reasons. So that the accused will be brought before a court, and if anything has happened to him in that time, then it will be shown to the world. Mr. Chairman, the effect of this clause upon every individual, any individual, is to put him entirely in the hands of the Police Force. Not in the hands of the hon. Minister. He is not going to be in a position to know what happens in every single case. And when the hon. Minister gives his undertaking. no one will seriously dispute that the hon. Minister does not want this to work; as he has pointed out, he has a lot at stake if it does not work. But the hon. Minister is not going to be in a position to be able to look at every single case. It will be impossible for the hon. Minister to do so. Let me put a pertinent question: What will happen if a <span class="col_4861-4862" refersTo="page_1005"/>person who it is thought might be able to give evidence is beaten up? What will happen to him? Who will ever know about it? I am not saying that it is going to happen, but I think that the provisions of our law already are all directed towards this not going undetected. There is the hon. Minister of Information. How is he going to explain this clause? The hon. Minister of Justice cannot explain it to us in this House. How is the hon. Minister of Information going to explain this to the outside world? And he will have an awful lot of explaining to do! But we cannot vote for something we do not know about and as it now stands, it is completely and utterly objectionable to anyone in this House, including the hon. Minister, and I think the hon. member for Vereeniging. It ought to be at any rate. Does the hon. member for Vereeniging like this clause? Is it objectionable to him?</p>

But I am not going to enter into a discussion about something else. I am talking about this clause. The hon. Minister of Justice has said that he is not going to talk about this clause. The powers herein contained, without an explanation, can lead all reasonable men to no other conclusion but that South Africa has become in effect a police state. Are we a police state?

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I was saying before the suspension of business that this clause as it stands finds no acceptance at all on this side of the House. My hon. Leader when he spoke to this clause referred to Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and I said that that was wellknown as a section especially to newspapermen as a section in respect of which it is possible that someone is suspected of having any evidence in respect of any offence that he can be brought before the magistrate and if he does not provide the information that is required, refused to give up the information, he can then be committed to gaol for a period of eight days. At the expiry of eight days he will then be returned to the magistrate who will then again interrogate him and if he still refuses to provide the information, he can again be committed for another eight days, and this could go on <i>ad infinitum.</i> This is a provision in our law already. I think it would meet the case the hon. the Minister has in mind because the inquiry can be held at any place and it can be held without the public having access. In other words it could be held in a gaol. It can be held privately. But, Sir, it has the great advantage that those factors which I say are completely anathema in respect of this clause, to everybody, I think, in this House, will be obviated inasmuch as he will be brought before a judicial officer once every eight or nine days. So I want to move an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;and&#x201D; in line 1, on page 12, until the end of the clause,</block>

<p>which will then provide that people could be arrested if suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed &#x201C;or having intended to commit an offence under the Suppression of Communism Act, or under that Act as applied by the Unlawful Organizations Act or of sabotage, or persons who are in possession of information relating to the commission of any such offence, or the intention to commit such an offence&#x201D;. The persons in respect of whom this provision is to be applied would not be changed at all, but the rest of the provisions would be deleted, and the provisions of Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955, should thereafter be applied so that from then on such a person could be interrogated privately but would every eight days have to come before a judicial officer. I therefore move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;and&#x201D; in line 1, page 12. to the end of the clause and to substitute &#x201C;within 48 hours produce such person before a magistrate whereupon the provisions of Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955 (Act No. 56 of 1955), shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply as if such person had been brought before such magistrate in terms of that section&#x201D;.</block>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This clause is of course one of the major clauses in the Bill. There is little I need add to the criticism of it voiced by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, the hon. member for Wynberg and others. It is because I agree with them so wholeheartedly that I voted against the second reading, because I belive that this clause and Clause 4 are the most important clauses in the Bill. They undermine the whole rule of law and that is repugnant to me. This clause provides for the suspension of one of the most ancient writs of law, <i>habeas corpus.</i> It means that a person may be taken time and time again for a period of 90 days for interrogation at the behest of any police officer who has some suspicion that the person might have some information which can be of assistance to the police. The Leader of the Opposition has already expressed his fears and I also have doubts as to the results of such interrogation. I want to say that police brutality is by no means a monopoly in South Africa and I think it would be stupid to deny that it does go on here because we have had enough replies given in this House to questions dealing with assaults on prisoners to know that that is the case. [Interjections.] Police brutality is found all over the world and it is ridiculous for hon. members to tell me that I should be ashamed of myself. But in a multi-racial country one should be particularly on one&#x2019;s guard against giving powers to the police, particularly where the members of the other races are voiceless as far as their political rights are concerned. I want to ask the Minister whether it has not struck him as significant that he should have been so very upset when the hon. member for Wynberg raised the issue, incorrectly, it so happens, in relation to the application of this clause to South West Africa. I am not denying that what the Minister said was correct, but what interests me is his reaction. If this is such a delicate matter that it puts the Minister into a ferment of anxiety, at the thought that anyone overseas could imagine that such a clause should be extended to South West Africa, does he not realize that that is an admission that he realizes just how bad this clause is? If it is bad for South West, it is bad for South Africa.</p>

<p>I want to continue with this theme, in spite of the threats emanating from the opposite side. I want to ask a few questions in regard to this clause, against which I will vote anyway. What provision will be made for the next-of-kin of these people who disappear for 90 days for purposes of interrogation? How is anyone to know who has been taken, how long they will be kept, and where, and what information will be given to the next-of-kin? Will anyone in higher authority immediately be notified about it? There is nothing in the clause to say that this will be so. All we know is that some police officer may decide that somebody has information which he wants to get out of him, and he can detain the man for 90 days. What provision is made for officers to notify their seniors? Will we be given the information about the number of people so held, will the names be tabled, and will the Press have access to those names, or will we get the same sort of reaction I got when I asked how many people had disappeared in the Transkei under Proclamation No. 400? This is just as drastic as Proclamation No. 400. There is no access to the courts or to any legal adviser. If this is not the sort of law which is introduced in a totalitarian country, I have yet to be shown another which shows a closer resemblance to it. I have put some specific questions to the Minister, who has disappeared, though I am sure not for 90 days, and I hope the Minister will give a reply to these questions.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would ask the Minister to give the House more information as to why the powers which already exist in the law, in Section 83, for the purpose of conducting interrogations are insufficient. I know that he has already addressed the House in reply to my leader on this point. I will say this, that the Minister has in other regards, given the House a great deal of information as to his difficulties. As was pointed out by the hon. member for Durban (North), it is so much easier for the House to understand the situation it is dealing with if we are told what the difficulties are. I ask the Minister again why Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act is insufficient, when you have power in that section to bring a person before the magistrate, to interrogate him, and if he does not reply he can be committed to prison for eight days at a time, for as long as you like. Why is that not sufficient in these circumstances?</p>

<p>To realize the stringency of this provision, one must understand what can flow from a <i>bona fide</i> error of judgment. I am not referring to <i>male fides,</i> or the misuse of power by the police. I merely base my case on a <i>bona fide</i> error of judgment by the police.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister may be aware of it, but I would like to repeat it for the sake of other hon. members. It is not only a question of the individual who might suffer injury or assault while being detained, although that is a factor, but one merely has to assume that there is a <i>bona fide</i> error of judgment, and as the result a man&#x2019;s freedom is curtailed for as long as it suits that officer. That, in itself, is enough to make one think again. To be able to deprive a man of all freedom of movement and of any access to anyone is a serious matter when it may be discovered later that it was all as the result of a genuine error of judgment. The Minister says he appreicates that, but of course the situation becomes so much more objectionable if one deals with the abuses which can and do creep into even the best disciplined organization. Those things can happen, and with the best will in the world on the part of the Minister and of the senior police officers such abuses may creep in. Our Police Force is no better or worse in that regard than any other force in the world, and these things may happen unbeknown to the Minister and the senior officers. Bearing in mind all that, and as the amendment moved by the hon. member for Durban (North) has been refused, I would like to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 3, page 12, after &#x201C;interrogation&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;by a magistrate and in lines 5 and 6, to omit &#x201C;the Commissioner of the South African Police&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;such magistrate&#x201D;.</block>

<p>We are dealing with a clause which covers a wide field. It begins by saying who may detain the person concerned, then it gives the grounds upon which the person may be detained, and then it describes the sort of person who may be detained, and then it says that he may be detained for the purpose of interrogation, and then it says that he shall be interrogated until a certain individual is satisfied, but he does not say who will carry out the interrogation. One assumes it will be a police officer, because it is the police who detain him, but there is nothing to stop the Minister under the clause as it stands from appointing a magistrate to do that job. What I am asking is that there will not be a discretion for him to appoint a <span class="col_4867-4868" refersTo="page_1008"/>magistrate to do the interrogation, but that it shall be a magistrate.

<p>I believe that when the Minister rose this morning to justify the retention of this clause he spoke with conviction and that with the knowledge he has of the matter dealt with in this Bill he is convinced that he has good reason to insert this clause in the Bill but the fact remains that this clause places a very heavy responsibility on the Minister. It is a far-reaching encroachment on the ordinary rights of individuals; we cannot get away from that. I think when such far-reaching powers are given to a single person or to police officers, you have to consider carefully the abuses which may take place or how the original object you had in mind can be departed from. I want to give an example of something I personally experienced a few months ago. I had a servant who came from the platteland. After a few months he fell into bad company. One Sunday morning it appeared as though he had gone to bed very late the previous night and he boldly told me that he had been to a party of the Liberal Party where there were Whites, Coloureds and Bantu, that there was plenty of liquor and that the police arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>He boldly told me that the police arrived there and asked him for his name and address, that he told them that he was in the employ of a Member of Parliament and that they immediately let him go. I told him immediately that if that were to happen again I would immediately dismiss him which I did a few weeks later. What I have in mind here is this: Supposing he was in somebody else&#x2019;s employ and he found himself in such circumstances and that under the influence of the spirit prevailing at the party and of the people with whom he was associating there, he said certain things about his employer. Does the danger not exist that a person who lacks the necessary experience, a person who does not appreciate what the consequences of his actions may be, may perhaps act injudiciously? I want to put this to the Minister: A commandant is in charge of every police district, irrespective of his rank and every police station has a telephone. When it is necessary to take action such as envisaged in this clause &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>That is quite right. I fully understand that. It may be that the station commander at a station is not a lieutenant in which case he has to communicate with a lieutenant if such action has to be taken. He himself cannot act. What I should like to see is that it should not be possible for the lieutenant to act and that the decision should not rest with the lieutenant but that the decision to act in this way should rest with the district commandant of that police district.</p>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>What the Minister says is quite correct; he knows his Department. I have been at police districts where a lieutenant is in charge or where a lieutenant is acting but then it is a senior lieutenant, somebody who has more or less reached the stage where his next appointment will be that of commandant of a police district. As I have said, telephonic communication will in any case play a part, because where the station commander is not a lieutenant he will have to communicate with a lieutenant. There will be no difficulty, therefore, to communicate with the district commandant who will have to satisfy himself that such action is justified. I also think that where such action is taken, the Minister or the person authorized to act on his behalf in his office must immediately be notified of such action.</p>

<p>That happens as a matter of routine.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>I think it will be good to provide for that in the Act. That will reassure many people. I think I know what the Minister has in mind. It is stated here that if such a person is detained it will be necessary for him to obtain the permission of the Minister to get legal advice. I know the panel consists of a whole list of advocates and attorneys and where this sort of case has come before a court it has been the same legal firm and the same advocate who have defended those people. Limitations have already been placed on many of them in terms of legislation which is already on the Statute Book.</p>

<p>In conformity with the arguments I have advanced I wish to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 68, after &#x201C;1958&#x201D; where it occurs for the second time, to insert &#x201C;of a rank not lower than that of a district commandant or his deputy or his alternate and to insert the following new sub-section to follow sub-section (2):</block>

<ol>

<li>(3) Any officer as aforesaid shall immediately inform the Minister upon arresting any such person.</li>

</ol>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to accept this amendment because apart from the fact that it places the responsibility of making a decision on the shoulders of a more responsible officer, a more experienced officer, it will be embodied in the Act that the Minister should immediately be informed so that he will know about it; that the danger will not exist that the person will be detained and that it will not be weeks before his application reaches the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that there are two ways whereby one can limit the rigour of this clause. The one is by causing the inquiry to be conducted by a judicial officer of some kind or another. That would be a measure of protection against possible abuse. If that effort on the part of this side of the House to limit the rigour of this clause fails, then it occurs to me that there is another method whereby the rigours of the clause can be limited, and that is if one provides for someone to have sight of the person detained; to provide some link, no matter how small and brief it may be, between that individual and the outside world. To that end it seems to me that the least one can do is to provide for access to a person by his doctor and legal adviser. It is difficult to conceive that any abuse in the eyes of the administration can creep in from a visit under control, as it would be, by a detainee&#x2019;s lawyer or doctor. After all, consider the circumstances under <span class="col_4871-4872" refersTo="page_1010"/>which those visits would be made. They would be made in the place where the person is detained&#x2014;probably in a gaol or police cell. They could be made in the presence of a police officer, but there would be that link between the individual and the outside world, between the individual and his family. He would be able to obtain advice from an independent source and his family could be reassured that although having been detained, possibly for a long time, he is still in good health and has not been ill treated in any way. Sir, this is a small thing in a clause of this nature but it does improve the clause to a slight extent. I move therefore&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 10, page 12, after &#x201C;person&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;save and except such person&#x2019;s medical or legal adviser&#x201D;.</block>

<p>It is unprecedented surely for anyone to be detained under provisions of this kind and to have no access whatever to the outside world nor for those near and dear to him to have access to him. As I said when I spoke earlier in this debate, the hon. the Minister, in spite of what he said to my leader, has not given the House reasons as to why he need go this far in this legislation, and I would ask him again to take this committee into his confidence and to explain why the existing powers are inadequate, why they fall down to meet the situation which he believes it is necessary to meet. If he were to do that, it would make the task of this committee so much easier.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member moves that two types of persons should have access to the detainee, firstly a medical practitioner. That is provided for in the regulations and it is consequently not necessary to provide for that in this measure. In the second place the hon. member asks that a legal representative, in other words, somebody who is on the roll at the moment, should be able to talk to him. The hon. member moves that knowing full well that we have already discussed that matter and that I adopted a very firm attitude. I am sorry that I have to say this of his and my colleagues but we all know that there are some legal representatives to whom I have in the past refused permission to contact restricted persons. We discussed that principle very fully and the hon. member knows it. In spite of that the hon. member moves that any legal representative should be allowed to see those people. I am going to mention certain names here and I am not apologizing for doing so. We have to be realistic and practical, Sir. If the people whom I have in mind and whom he has in mind are detained they are not going to ask to see the hon. member or the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). They are going to ask for Arenstein or for Sing or for Fehler. If they get into trouble here in Cape Town they are not going to ask for the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson); nor are they going to ask for Sen. Pilkington-Jordan. They are only going to ask for certain specific people. If they get into trouble in Johannesburg they are not going to ask for those hon. members who are lawyers or advocates or for other lawyers or advocates; there is a certain specific panel of people for whom they will ask. They are going to ask for Wolpe and for Slovo and for Braham Fisher and others. I am perfectly honest with hon. members. If the Committee forces me, and from the nature of things I am in the hands of the Committee, to accept the amendment and let those people have access to those detainees I do not even want to detain them; in that case I shall be defeating the whole object of this clause and for that reason I am sorry I cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member. I do not want to hide those people and that is why I want to say very clearly that I am quite prepared to accept an amendment, if it should be moved, that these people should periodically be visited by a magistrate if hon. members are afraid that I shall tamper with them or hurt them. I am quite prepared to consider such an amendment and even if such an amendment is not moved across the floor of the House, I shall in any case give instructions administratively compelling magistrates to visit these people periodically. Depending on the time available, I may, if such an amendment is not moved, even move that in the Other Place. I regret, however, that in the circumstances I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister in dealing with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) has said that he will accept an amendment making it obligatory for a magistrate or additional magistrate to visit a detainee once a week. The Minister, of course, knew that I was going to move this amendment, because he has already had a copy of the amendment to consider.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>That is why I said it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>In the circumstances I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of sub-section (2):<br/>Provided that not less than once during each week such person shall be visited in private by the magistrate or an additional or assistant magistrate of the district in which he is detained.</block>

<p>The Minister has indicated, quite rightly, that he will accept that amendment but he still refuses to allow the detainee to have his own medical practitioner or his legal adviser. I submit that the fact that in terms of the prison regulations a doctor visits the jail&#x2014;I do not know how often; I believe it is once a week&#x2014; is not sufficient. After all, the detainee may be suffering from some peculiar malady and his own medical practitioner who knows the history of the man knows what is wrong with <span class="col_4873-4874" refersTo="page_1011"/>him. It may not be just the ordinary type of illness from which he is suffering&#x2014;influenza or something of that nature. The Minister himself has said that he has seen men break down in solitary confinement. He has seen men interned during the war. He admits that it is a terrible thing to experience and bearing all that in mind, I submit that surely the least that can be done is to allow the detainee to see his own medical practitioner if he wants to do so. After all, the Minister has not told us why the detainee should not be allowed to see his own medical practitioner. He has told us why he cannot see his own lawyer. I submit that he will not have the same trouble with medical practitioners which he expects to have with certain lawyers. As far as lawyers are concerned, I submit that because the Minister does not want certain lawyers to see detainees is no reason for making it a general rule that they shall see no lawyers. The Minister has the power to prevent certain lawyers from seeing these people and he has already done that. He mentioned the name of Mr. Arenstein; I do not want to mention names. I do not want to go into the other names which he mentioned and discuss the rights or wrongs of the attitude of those other lawyers, because I do not know what the Minister knows about them, but I will just deal with one case which he mentioned, that of Mr. Arenstein. He has already barred Mr. Arenstein; he can debar him from seeing certain people as he has in fact already done, but I submit it is quite wrong for a Minister to lay down as a general principle that he will allow no lawyer to see these detainees because it appears that certain lawyers may influence these detainees in a way contrary to the wishes of the Minister. It is not necessary for them to get Mr. Arenstein or any of these other lawyers mentioned by the Minister. Recently there was a case in Umtata where two people were detained and the Minister could certainly have no objection to the lawyers who were briefed in Umtata to go and see these two people, and yet they were not allowed to see any lawyer. The lawyers had to see the police. Everything was done through the police. I hope the Minister will reconsider this question of allowing legal advisers and medical practitioners to see these detainees, because the Minister has not given adequate reasons why the medical practitioner at any rate should not be allowed to see these detainees. The medical practitioner is not going to give the detainee legal advice.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I have already indicated that I shall accept it if such an amendment is moved. Hon. members have informed me about it but because the other amendments moved had already been put, I did not know whether the amendment would be moved. I am very pleased that it has been moved because I gladly accept it. The hon. member told me that he was going to move such an amendment. It is not an idea, therefore, which has emanated from me; it emanates from the hon. member. The question of medical practitioners visiting all detainees is in the hands of the medical practitioners of the Department of Social Welfare through their district surgeons or their full-time officials. If it should be necessary for such people to see their private medical practitioners I shall not hesitate for a moment to give the necessary permission and instructions. I want to assure the hon. member that as far as this aspect of the matter is concerned I can speak from experience to some extent. I shall not allow those people to undergo what I had to undergo. Under the most difficult circumstances I was not allowed to see a dentist. I shall not let that happen to these people. I readily give that assurance to the hon. member. As far as refusing to allow lawyers to see the detainees I just want to say this: I was a lawyer in those days. I know exactly what the effect of these regulations is. I was not even allowed to discuss pending court cases which I was handling with my partner. I know, therefore the disruption it can cause and I shall consequently issue the necessary instructions. I know exactly what the responsibility is which I am taking upon my shoulders in this connection and I do not want those reproaches to be levelled at me and that is why I shall see to it&#x2014;I am prepared to stake my reputation on this&#x2014;that these things do not happen. But if I open the door as hon. members want me to open it, the horse will be out of the stable before it can be of any service to me. The hon. member for Zululand says that I have not adequately motivated my allegation that Section 83 did not give me sufficient power. Can you motivate your experience, Sir, or can you only relate it to somebody else? I did that this morning. Let me just put this question to the hon. member who was a young boy in those days. I want to tell him in advance that he will be in a dilemma, irrespective of what his reply is going to be. Section 83 is either not the answer&#x2014;and I maintain it is not&#x2014;or if it is the answer, as he says it is, my question to him is this: Were people only detained in those days in order to torture them, if Section 83 is the answer? The question is very clear. The hon. member for Zululand says it is not necessary to detain people for such a long time&#x2014;note well, Sir, I am limiting the period to 90 days. It was absolutely unlimited in those days. I say it must be a lieutenant; it was any police official in those days; I say it must be the Commissioner of Police; that is a safety valve. That safety valve did not exist in those days. Let us accept that the principle is exactly the same as it was in those days. The idea was exactly the same in those days as it is to-day; it is exactly the same. There is no difference as far as the idea is concerned. If Section 83 is the answer to-day it should also have been the answer at that time.</p>

<p>Did it exist at that time?</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The relevant section has been in our law since before <span class="col_4875-4876" refersTo="page_1012"/>the rinderpest. To be quite honest it was applied in the case of a young lady, Elsa Nel, a case which was given great prominence in the newspapers. The hon. member can take it from me that that section has been in our laws since before the rinderpest.</p>

<p>My argument is this: If that was the answer&#x2014;where the idea was the same as to-day&#x2014; why was it not applied? In that case there are only two answers: It was either not the answer&#x2014;in which the argument of the hon. member falls away&#x2014;or if it was the answer at that time hon. members owe me a reply as to why people were detained at that time while the answer was there but was not used. Must we, in the interests of hon. members, simply draw a veil over it and forget about it?</p>

<p>I am grateful to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories for his amendment. I gladly accept that amendment but I regret I cannot accept the other amendments.</p>

<p>I shall not quibble. The hon. the Minister told us a few minutes ago how he would use this power.

He does not want anybody to share in this responsibility though this is the greatest burden anybody can possibly carry. He, the Minister, who has the greatest measure of courage, is the only one who should be burdened with it. That is the burden of 20 statements he has made. And that is worthy of examination. Even a courageous man must realize that under this Bill, regardless of whether the Minister, in a rush of generosity, is prepared to let a magistrate see the person concerned once a week, or his doctor or his legal adviser, he is confining somebody who may be suspected, according to what may be the view of a minor police official, of having information, not of having committed an offence.</p>

<p>I think in the light of what has happened in other countries, even here, the Minister must realize what this can mean to certain groups of professional men and in certain vocations. A newspaperman, for example, might quite fortuitously hear of something which could conceivably be related to the commission of an offence. And if a police officer with the rank of lieutenant and upwards desires to do so, he can immediately commit him for 90 days. What good does it do if a magistrate sees him once a week? What good does it do if his grandfather sees him once a week? If that police officer can hold him for 90 days until he gets, what he calls a &#x201C;satisfactory&#x201D; answer? I ask the hon. the Minister to put himself in that position. He has boasted of his personal courage. Supposing that man does not know anything about the matter, but the police officer says he believes that he does, and he says: &#x201C;What I call a satisfactory answer is that you say that you do know.&#x201D; That is an impossible position, Sir. [Interjections.] All the wise guys sit on that side, Sir, and I am happy not to be there. Mr. Chairman, I want to tell you something, and it is this: One of the things that makes them terribly sensitive in this House, in fact, one of the surest ways of bringing down on one&#x2019;s head the wrath of the Minister and anybody else on that side of the House, is the very suggestion that South Africa is a police state. I am not going to say that South Africa is a police state. But I wish the hon. the Minister will explain to me what the difference is between a police state and a state in which a policeman, a lieutenant, can pick anybody off the street and say &#x201C;You come with me&#x201D;&#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Under certain legislation. I said a policeman with the rank of lieutenant upwards. I realize it is a commissioned officer. Unlike some of those hon. gentlemen who say &#x201C;nonsense&#x201D;, I have read this Bill, unfortunately, six times. He can say to that man: &#x201C;You come with me and you will stay here for 90 days, at least, until I get a satisfactory answer from you.&#x201D; In other words, what is the difference between a state where a police official, not even the Minister of Justice acting indirectly or the Deputy Commissioner for the particular command, can commit a man to a place of incarceration for 90 days and recommit him at the end of that period, and what you would call a police state? Can somebody on that side of the House tell me? Can one of the interjectors in the north-east corner tell me? They know everything. They must tell me so that I can dispel the fears of many people outside of this House, and the fears of some of the people in this House.</p>

<p>In the limited time that I have, I want to deal with the issue of what happened during the war. First of all, Sir, there was a war on, whether those gentlemen want to admit it or not. History records there was a war on, in fact, the greatest war in the world. History does not record or will not record at any future stage that there was a war on in South Africa at this stage. Assuming there is a war on&#x2014;which hon. members opposite do not even believe, because the Prime Minister says there is peace and order, and how can you have peace and order during a war&#x2014;how can you argue that the legislation which may have been applied 20 years ago must be applied to South Africa to-day merely because it was applied 20 years ago? What kind of logic is there in that argument? We have just been told about something which happened before the &#x201C;rinderpest&#x201D;. Do you always want to go back 20, 30 or 50 years ago? With great respect to the Minister: I do not stand back for anybody in this country in admiration for his personal courage, but courage has nothing to do with liberty of the individual. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that apart from those few hundred people who may or who may not be affected by this clause, there are 16,000,000 people in South Africa who have nothing to do with this clause, and never will have. The liberty of the individual is far greater than the personal courage of any one of us.</p>

<p><span class="col_4879-4880" refersTo="page_1014"/>Mr. Chairman, if you were to consider the effects of this particular clause of the Bill, I think you would rightly come to the conclusion that the Minister should give every possible consideration to such amendments as have been moved and such amendments that may be moved from this side, for the very reason that he says he realizes the terrible responsibility that this puts on his shoulders. For that reason, Sir, he should say: &#x201C;If you can find a way of assuring me that those people who can reasonably be involved as regards the possession of information and the commission of an offence under these laws can be questioned, etc. I shall give way with my Clause 17.&#x201D; If he does that, then a different situation might possibly arise. But with every amendment, except one so far, the Minister has said in effect: &#x201C;I cannot accept that; I want to carry this on my own shoulders.&#x201D; Let me say in conclusion that I hope the Minister will explain, although he has been good enough to accept this one amendment, what the function of the magistrate &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

He told us that because a condition prevailed at the time which the then Government regarded as a crisis. The then Government then thought that there were people who wanted to overthrow the Government by force. [Interjections.] I say, in the opinion of the then Government.

<p>That is precisely what the position was. Because the then Government regarded the Minister as a danger to internal order the Government took certain steps and what were those steps: Those steps were to lock him up for an unlimited time without trial; without laying a charge against him. If the then Government argued at the time that that was the way they should treat such people, and if hon. members approve of it that that was the way in which the then Government should have acted with the hon. the Minister and other White people, why do they refuse to approve of it that that should happen to Sobukwe? Why do they refuse to approve of it that that should happen to Mandela? As long as they were their political opponents they were quite prepared to give all those powers to Jan Smuts. Now that it is Sobukwe and that type of person they refuse to give those powers to this Minister. That was the only reason why the Minister referred to what had happened to him during the war. The Opposition are adopting this illogical attitude: If they think our internal security is in danger they are prepared to give all the powers. The hon. member for Yeoville even went so far as to say that the Minister should not ask for these powers; he should do what General Smuts did namely he should do what he likes. He must lock up people and ban them from the country and the only thing he should then do is to ask Parliament for indemnification. That is how they want to deal with a crisis. That is how they want to deal with people who want to overthrow the <span class="col_4881-4882" refersTo="page_1015"/>Government by force. Now that the Minister is asking for far less powers they are making all this fuss; now they are trying to create all this suspicion against the country. We have the evidence, evidence which they have accepted, and that is the evidence of Judge Snyman to the effect that the position is serious. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) asked me whether a state of emergency existed. Of course there is not a state of emergency. What did Judge Snyman say? He said that there were certain people in the country, the Poqo movement and other movements, which were trying hard to create a state of emergency and that if the Minister did not act they would create that stage of emergency. The Opposition has no ground whatsoever, therefore, to oppose this clause.</p>

<p>Before I call upon the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) to address the Committee, I just wish to point out that I have allowed a very wide discussion on this clause, but hon. members must now advance new arguments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister, in reply to the point which I raised the last time I spoke, made play of the fact that there were certain legal practitioners who, according to his information, held views which were undesirable and conducted themselves in a manner which was undesirable. I have not the information which the hon. the Minister has in that regard. One hears stories, Sir, but I do not believe that one can rely simply on stories. Even accepting what the hon. the Minister says in that regard, it is difficult to see how, when one or other of these people, such as a doctor of a lawyer, is visiting a prisoner in a room together with a warden or a police constable and a conversation takes place in the presence of such a person, any damage can be done. It is very difficult to see that. To meet the situation which the hon. the Minister finds objectionable in that regard I wish to move a further amendment.</p>

<p>With leave of the Committee, the amendment proposed by Mr. Cadman was withdrawn.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I then move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 10, page 12, after &#x201C;person&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;save and except his medical or legal adviser not himself being a restricted person&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The effect of this amendment is as follows, that the detained person will have a right to see his doctor or his lawyer provided the doctor or lawyer is not a person restricted under one or other piece of legislation such as the Unlawful Organizations Act, the Suppression of Communism Act or any similar Act. It would specifically rule out the type of legal adviser to whom the Minister has an objection.</p>

<p>I have no doubt that when the hon. the Minister says that he has experienced the discomfort of not being able to see medical and legal advisers and that for that reason he will not allow it to take place under his administration, he means every word that he says. But, Sir, the hon. the Minister is the head of a vast organization. He cannot possibly know what is going on at all levels of that organization. It simply cannot be done. With all the experience that he has had, with all the good will in the world, he cannot ensure that what he desires should be done, will be done. That can only be safeguarded if the detained person has a right to see the persons of his choice with the limitation that he may not see banned persons. That is what it amounts to. So I do ask the hon. the Minister to accept this amendment because I believe that it removes the difficulty which he formerly had. It gives a right to a detained person to see his doctor or his lawyer provided neither of those people is a banned person.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister must realize, as he probably does, that you arc not dealing here with people who have committed an offence necessarily; you are dealing with people whom an official believes has knowledge; he has done nothing wrong; but whom an official believes has knowledge which may assist in the solving of a crime. Surely that man has a right to be entitled to see the persons I have mentioned, not that a privilege be granted him, not that regulations be made to accommodate him in that regard but that he has a right to see these people. Not only for the purpose <span class="col_4883-4884" refersTo="page_1016"/>that the relations, the wife and family of the person that may be detained, will be informed, but I can also not stress sufficiently that the person who may be detained may well have done nothing wrong at all. In those cicumstances surely there can be no objection to his seeing a doctor or a lawyer, provided that those persons are not banned, etc.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In regard to Section 83? I will be delighted to reply to that. The hon. Minister&#x2019;s reply was that Section 83 has been in the Act since 1917. Quite correct. He continued that the United Party Government during the war found that that was inadequate. Otherwise why would they have taken the additional powers which they did under the Emergency legislation? The Minister said that I was a small boy at the time. That is not quite correct, but we will let that pass. But what does the Minister&#x2019;s answer amount to? It amounts to this: The United Party Government was not satisfied with Section 83. They took additional powers. But the hon. Minister does not say why Section 83 was inadquate then and why it is inadequate now. His answer amounts to this that because the United Party Government 20 years ago took powers that were more than they needed, therefore he must take unnecessary powers now.</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I believe that Section 83 is adequate for the situation which we know now. I do not know what the difficulties were that faced a wartime government. I have not read the legislation of that time and I do not know the facts of that time, I have no knowledge of events at that time. But I will say this, that so far as I can judge: If the United Party Government then faced a situation such as the Minister faces now, then Section 83 would have been sufficient. But I must say this also that I believe, and I think it is accepted all round, that in time of war, as was then the case, problems cropped up far in excess of the problems with which we are faced now. It is accepted that we are not in a state of war. We have what is called a cold war. There are difficulties which require emergency legislation of some sort or another. But I present this squarely to the hon. Minister: He has not yet, in all fairness, told the House why Section 83 is not sufficient. He has quoted an example of where a previous government took further powers. But that may have been quite unnecessary. And certainly on the knowledge of the facts which we have now, and the knowledge which we have of the provisions of Section 83, it seems on what the Minister has told us, that those powers are at the present time perfectly sufficient, and I say again that the hon. Minister has not answered the question as to why those powers are not sufficient now.</p>

<ol>

<li>(5) No confession obtained from any person pursuant to the provisions of sub-section (1) shall be admissible in evidence against him.</li>

</ol>

<p>The amendment would prevent evidence obtained by questioning under this section to be used against a person interrogated should a trial of that person follow. That would give effect to the present position in regard to any questioning that may take place under our criminal code, because where in fact answers are elicited by question and answer, the courts will disallow that as evidence. We have got to ask whether there is any need for the change that is sought in this present position? In the first place I quote the fact that the powers under Section 83 are still there. But in addition the hon. Minister when he brought forward his arguments for justifying this particular clause made it clear what his purpose was, namely to obtain evidence from the lower ranks of subversive bodies in order to enable him to track down the higher ranks. Consequently there would be no need to use the evidence that he obtained from the lower <span class="col_4885-4886" refersTo="page_1017"/>ranks against such lower ranks, but only against the higher ranks. If the hon. Minister accepts the amendment of mine, it will leave him with the power which he has sought to justify and for which he has made a certain case, but it would eliminate the side-effect which he did not suggest was necessary, and which I suggest therefore he could dispense with. Consequently I move the amendment to that effect.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I want to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (4) and to substitute the following new sub-section:</block>

<ol>

<li>(4) The provisions of this section shall only be brought into operation by the State President by proclamation in the Gazette if he is satisfied that the security of the State requires such action on his part, and shall continue in operation only for  as long as the State President deems it necessary for the purpose of maintaining the security of the State: Provided that when the State President is satisfied that the provisions of this section are no longer required to maintain the security of the State he shall suspend the operation of any proclamation issued under this sub-section.</li>

</ol>

<p>I am asking that that sub-section be substituted for the present sub-section (4) which merely provides that the State President may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> suspend the operation of the provisions in sub-section (1) for a definite or indefinite period. Sub-section (1) is the particular sub-section in this clause which we are dealing with, the power of a commissioned officer of police to take a person into custody, to hold him for 90 days, in communicado, and to question him, until he answers to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of the S.A. Police. Now the hon. Minister in dealing with this particular matter said in reply to a question put by my Leader that he did not propose that this legislation should be permanent legislation. He was dealing with Clause 17 when he said that. He did not anticipate it being permanent legislation and that the State President could issue a proclamation suspending it from time to time and it could also be reimposed. But it was not to be permanent legislation. My amendment seeks merely to make clear what may be assumed from subsection (4) as printed, but may I say in that regard that I realize that when the state feels that it is threatened, any state, it will take extraordinary powers from time to time. I recognize that, and as to how far those powers should go may well be a matter of sincere argument. It is not a matter of throwing bricks at each other, but it could be a matter of sincere argument. The one side may say &#x201C;That is as far as you should go&#x201D;, and the other side may say &#x201C;That is not far enough, we think you should go thus far&#x201D;. That I accept. The point I want to make here is that that can be a legitimate cause of discussion and difference of opinion because the state is acting <i>bona fide</i> in regard to the safety of the state. Those are the words that I want to emphasize &#x201C;safety of the state&#x201D;. So in this amendment I lay emphasis on that particular point that the State President&#x2014; I take it that he would be advised by the Executive Council, or the Minister concerned&#x2014;nevertheless would apply his mind to the precise position as to whether the safety of the state was still endangered, and if he felt that the safety of the state was no longer endangered, he would withdraw by proclamation this particular Clause 17 that we are dealing with, and so long as the safety of the state was no longer endangered it would remain in abeyance, retaining the right, presumably, for a repro-clamation to take place if and when circum-stances should arise again when he felt that the state was in danger.</p>

<p>Without the slightest doubt the essence of what the hon. member wants us to accept now is contained <span class="col_4887-4888" refersTo="page_1018"/>in sub-section (4) of Clause 17. What does the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment say? It says that this clause shall only be brought into operation by the State President by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> if he is satisfied that the security of the State requires such action on his part. In other words, the hon. member now visualizes and wants us to accept this Bill but to post-pone it to a date to be announced by the State President.</p>

<p>This clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, this clause. The hon. member knows that constitutionally the State President can only act on the advice of the Cabinet, of the Executive and this is an Executive measure. It is not my measure, it is a Cabinet measure. In other words, looking at it from whatever angle one likes, whether one agrees with it or not makes no difference at all to the principle, namely, that the Cabinet under existing circumstances feels, rightly or wrongly that the security of the State requires such action. If the Cabinet was not satisfied about that, this Bill would not have come before the House because it is a Cabinet measure. So there the hon. member for South Coast and I are in full agreement, and this Bill naturally, can only become law if and when the State President approves of it. In other words, the only difference now between the hon. member for South Coast and myself is that he wants the Cabinet in another document, not in the Bill, to advise the State President that the security of the State demands that this measure should be applied, instead of letting Parliament say that to the State President and the State President then signing the Bill.</p>

<p>Where does Parliament say that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>By passing the Bill. Parliament says that there is such a state. The Cabinet has already decided, and the Cabinet&#x2019;s decision if the Bill is passed is endorsed by Parliament, and the State President signs the Bill. So there is no disagreement between the hon. member and myself whatsoever as far as the first part of his amendment is concerned.</p>

<p>Then as far as the second part is concerned, &#x201C;provided that when the State President is satisfied that the provisions of this section are no longer required to maintain the security of the State, he shall suspend the operation of any proclamation issued under this sub-section.&#x201D; That is exactly what the sub-section says: The State President may from time to time by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> suspend the operation of the provisions of sub-section (1) for a definite or indefinite period. In other words, frankly as I see it, if it were not for that provision, I would accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment because I know what his attitude is. But I say that sub-section (4) says exactly, although not in so many words, but in essence and in principle, what the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment tries to imply, and therefore if I do not accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, it is not because I disagree with him at all; I think he is perfectly right, but I say that it is already contained in sub-section (4).</p>

<p>As far as the amendment of the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) is concerned, viz. &#x201C;that no confession obtained from any person pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1), shall be admitted in evidence against him&#x201D;, I think the hon. member is conversant with the law regarding confessions, and I have every reason to think that it is perfectly clear that we can safely leave that for the courts to decide if and when it ever crops up. I do not think his amendment is necessary at all. This is a matter not for the Minister to decide or anybody else, but only for the courts whether or not any confession is admissible, and under those circumstances, I think it best to leave well alone and to leave it to the courts to decide.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I hesitate to participate in an argument between the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. Minister, but it does seem there have been cases when the next of kin have not known, particularly during the emergency, and I think not so long ago there was the case of a man alleged to have been kidnapped in Basutoland, and who was lost from the point of view of all countries for a considerable time, rightly or wrongly. I think perhaps the hon. the Minister might give this matter further consideration.</p>

<p>I want to speak first of all to the amendment put by the hon. member for South Coast. The hon. Minister has suggested that there is no difference between the Minister&#x2019;s point of view and the point of view of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I beg to differ, Sir. I think the question is: Which is the rule and which is the exception. Under the Minister&#x2019;s legislation the exception is that this clause will not be in operaton; under the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast the exception is that it will be in operation. That is a very fundamental difference from the point of view of the permanent law of our country. The Minister earlier on was at issue with me on what was a part of the permanent law of our country and what was not. Here the Minister makes it a part of the permanent law unless suspended by the State President in exceptoinal cases. The hon. member for South Coast wants to make it something that is only applied in exceptional cases. Quite frankly in the interest of the good name of this country&#x2014;and if the hon. Minister feels that there is no difference really between them (I think there is)&#x2014;I think he would be well advised to reconsider the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast. The big difference is between what is the normal law of the country and what will be applied in exceptional circumstances.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Looking at it from a practical point of view, is it not rather an academic difference?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not academic. Here Parliament is being asked to decide on very inadequate evidence from the hon. Minister that exceptional measures must be applied, not even recommended by the Commission. But the hon. Minister is prepared to take powers to advise the State President to suspend it from time to time. We wish to advise the State President that if he is satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances, then for a short period he can apply this law, but we expect him immediately these circumstances change to suspend its operaton and that then we should get back to normal law.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Surely the State President only acts on the advice of the Cabinet. It is purely academic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not. I do not know how I can put it to the Minister more plainly; one is the general rule of law and the other is the exception. The general rule is that there should not be powers of this kind, that they should only be applied in exceptional circumstances. That is what the hon. member for South Coast wants. What the Minister wants is that these rules should be applied as a general rule and they should only be suspended in exceptional circumstances. What he is saying to the world is that only in exceptional circumstances the law would not be applied. Surely that is not the impression he want to create or we want to see created.</p>

<p>The second point I want to raise concerns this question of confessions. The hon. Minister here also took the line that that was a purely academic argument and I was inclined to agree with him, but fortuitously, I was browsing through one of the measures the Minister has introduced into this House but which we have not yet had before us, the Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill, Bill No. 68 of 1963, and I refer the hon. Minister to Clause 26 and when I read that in view of what we are doing here, then, Mr. Chairman, I get frightened, because here is what this clause says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In determing the admissibility as evidence in any criminal proceedings of a statement made by the accused at any time to a peace officer, the fact that the peace officer did not caution the accused that he is not obliged to say anything, or to reply to any question, and that anything he may say, be used in evidence against him, shall not be taken into consideration by the court.</block>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I accept that, but we are worried because of the situation that may arise under this new legislation, read with the old legislation, quite apart from our worries under the old legislation. To come back to the amendment itself, I would like to ask the hon. Minister to consider that again. He has had some of the experiences I have had and he knows the dangers of accepting anything which is made by way of confession under circumstances of that kind. He has told us to-day that he did not want confessions. What he wanted were the facts. Well, Sir, if he is genuine in that (I think he is), if that is really what he wants, namely information and not confessions, then surely, he can accept this amendment without in any way damaging his Bill, or limiting the scope of what he wants. But it will give this security that when under pressure of that kind an accused person, or a suspect, makes what amounts to a confession, it cannot be used against him. That is a real safeguard. I think it is something worthwhile considering and it is something that the hon. Minister should consider in relation to this clause. You see. Sir, we don&#x2019;t like this clause and we made no bones about it. The Minister knows it, but at the same time in the interest of the country, we have tried to offer him amendments, we have tried to promote constructive discussions on this clause in an attempt to see if we could do away with its worst features even though it may not be acceptable to us in principle. I believe here is one of those respects in which the Minister could ameliorate the possible dangerous effects of this clause, in a manner which might do much to set the public mind at rest, to set public opinion at rest, both here and overseas. I should like the Minister to consider that carefully. If he says he is not asking for confessions but only for information, then surely he can rule that no confession made by a man who is under detention in this way should be admissible in any court.</p>

<p>The hon. member is the first and only man to doubt my personal integrity. I would have respected him if the hon. member had admitted having said this but he did not do so. I want to make it perfectly clear simply for the sake of the record&#x2014;so that it can be recorded in Hansard&#x2014;that I have no personal motives in connection with this matter and I take it that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will accept my statement on behalf of his party. As far as the hon. member for Hospital is concerned, he should not make accusations of that nature against anyone. That hon. member ought to regard the mere fact that he sits in this House as such a great privilege that he should never again make accusations against anyone.</p>

<p>As far as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, I cannot agree with him that the proposed legislation to which he referred affects the matter in any way. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is aware of the fact that the intention of this legislation is to bring the position into conformity with the position on the Continent and in Britain. This set of rules, the Judges&#x2019; rules, which do not have the force of law, have never been approved of by Parliament. They do not exist on the Continent of Europe, in Britain or in America.

I am pleased that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition agrees with me that although we have the same position in Britain that we will now have here if this legislation is passed&#x2014;and our law of evidence in respect of confessions is the same as the British law of evidence &#x2026;</p>

But up to the present we have been compelled to follow the British law of evidence.

<p>The composition of over population is different but a principle is not affected by the composition of the population. The courts will not admit any confession if there is the slightest suggestion that that confession was obtained by means of threats or violence. In that case no problem can arise. If the accused says: &#x201C;I did not make that confession voluntarily; these people detained me for 90 days and bullied me into making it&#x201D;, do hon. members think for one moment that the court will admit that confession? Certainly not. Then there is no problem at all. Because I do not see the dangers that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition sees, I am unfortunately unable to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Then there is the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I am prepared to keep an open mind in this regard and to reconsider it if great value is attached to it. I cannot accept it now and I cannot promise to accept it but because I respect the hon. member I am prepared to consider it. I still maintain that it is purely academic because the fact remains that the Government feels that the present position is one which justifies this course. That is why we are starting the ball rolling by way of an Act of Parliament. But like the hon. member the Government is also aware of the fact that a time may come when we may want to remove this Act from the Statute Book to show that it is not a permanent part of our legislation, and that is why provision is being made for it to be deproclaimed and if a similar position arises at some later stage, then it can again be proclaimed. We shall understand one another better once that is conceded. Let us imagine that the position changes and that the Act is deproclaimed and that another position arises which compels us to proclaim the Act once again, then the hon. member for South Coast and I will be in exactly the same position; we shall then start at the same place&#x2014;in other words the State President will issue a proclamation to the effect that a state of emergency exists&#x2014;because there will not have been one for some time&#x2014;and these regulations will then have to be put into operation again.

I appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s undertaking that he will reconsider his attitude to that amendment and I deal with it merely to refer to some of the points raised by the Minister in order to assist him in seeing the matter in the light in which we on this side of the House are trying to put it to him.</p>

<p>I think the difference between our point of view and that of the Minister is this: As the clause stands at present &#x2026;</p>

<p>What section are you referring to?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am referring to the whole of Clause 17. The amendment provides that the clause shall come into operation only when proclaimed by the State President, whereas sub-section (4) as it reads at present says that the State President may from time to time suspend its operation. The difference is this: If the clause is passed as it stands, with the present sub-section (4), the other subsections (1) to (3) will become part of the permanent law of the land and the operation of those sub-sections will continue as part of the permanent law of the land until suspended. If our amendment is accepted, the effect will be that sub-sections (1) to (3) will not come into operation and therefore will not become the law of the land until proclaimed by the State President in the <i>Gazette.</i> There is also another difference which is important, namely, that in terms of (4) as it reads now the State President is not obliged to suspend the operation of the clause. It says he may do so, whereas in terms of our amendment he is obliged to suspend the proclamation under certain circumstances, namely, if he is satisfied that the security of the State no longer requires it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<p>That is purely for constitutional reasons.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>From the practical point of view, the Minister may rightly say that it is purely for constitutional reasons, but quite apart from that consideration, there is <span class="col_4895-4896" refersTo="page_1022"/>the other consideration mentioned by the hon. member for South Coast and by my hon. leader, viz. the attitude of the public and of the outside world to this clause. I suggest that anything which may remove the emphasis from this clause becoming part of the permanent law of the land would assist in allaying the objections which people have to this clause. I do not need to emphasize this. The Minister has himself conceded that it is a very drastic clause. I hope the Minister will not take it amiss of me if I suggest that under those circumstances, when one is dealing with such a drastic provision, I would have thought that the approach towards amendments should be to accept such amendments as lessen the drastic nature of the clause or the outlook towards this clause provided that the teeth of the clause are not removed and that the object which the Minister wishes to achieve remains. I believe that by accepting the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast the Minister will not in any way tie his hands, while providing reasonable safeguards. While I am on my feet, I wish to move a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following new sub-section at the end of the clause:</block>

<ol>

<li>(5) The provisions of this section shall lapse on 30 June 1964.</li>

</ol>

<p>I do not wish to say much about it. It is similar to the amendment which the Minister accepted in regard to Clause 4, save that in regard to that amendment there was the further condition that the operation of the clause may from time to time by resolution of the House of Assembly be extended for a period not exceeding 12 months. This amendment is moved in this form because of the fact that this clause is so drastic. If this is going to be part of the law of the land, it ought to be for a limited period only.</p>

<p>Up to now this Bill has been discussed mostly by the legal men on this side of the House, and they did so very ably. I want to put another aspect to the Minister in all sincerity. We may accept the Bill as being fairly divided into two sections, on the one hand the clause we are dealing with now and certain other measures of that nature, and on the other the portions of the Bill which embody the recommendations of Judge Snyman. It is clear that in that last aspect there may be differences of opinion as to the particular methods adopted, but we are in agreement as to the necessity for those clauses. But Clause 17 falls outside the scope of the recommendations of Judge Snyman. The Minister, however, feels that powers of this nature are necessary in the circumstances. Sir, I want to make this suggestion. We have spent quite a lot of time debating whether or not there can be any relaxation of this Clause 17 and I believe that the House would make much more progress towards giving the Minister the authority he needs <i>(vide</i> the Commission&#x2019;s Interim Report), if it were not for this Clause 17. I want to make what might be an unusual suggestion. You, Sir, with the knowledge at your disposal, feel that it is imperative for the safety of the country that a measure of this sort should go on to the Statute Book as soon as possible. My leader has made it clear that, with the exceptions I have mentioned, we are prepared to support the Minister. An unusual situation exists in the country and I think sometimes unusual difficulties can be resolved by unusual methods. I want to suggest to the Minister to give serious consideration to the withdrawal of Clause 17 from this Bill, and to let us deal with the rest of the Bill, which gives the Minister the bulk of the powers he wants. Then if the Minister feels that Clause 17 is also vital for the successful carrying out of his functions, let him introduce that particular cause in the form of a separate Bill. At the moment that clause undoubtedly stands in the way of the passing of the Bill. I make that suggestion as one who has only one motive, and that is for us to do the best we can for our country. All of us have inherited a certain respect for the law and you cannot uproot those things in five minutes. Whilst this particular clause may be necessary, it is so fundamentally different, so foreign to what we have always accepted as being one of the basic principles of the law of the land that it is unacceptable to us. I ask the Minister to give consideration to this suggestion I have made.</p>

<p>I do not for one moment doubt the sincerity of the hon. member, and if this particular clause happened to be the first clause of a long Bill there would have been substance in his suggestion that I should reconsider it. But this happens to be the second-last clause of the Bill, and we have devoted practically the whole day to discussing this particular clause and, candidly, I see no point in taking it out now that we have practically arrived at the end of the discussion of the Bill, and then to have the whole discussion over again later. I want the hon. member to accept that I am equally sincere, but after all I can judge best as far as this problem is concerned because it is my baby and I have to work with it every day. So I can best judge whether in the circumstances it is necessary to have this clause, and the hon. member knows what I said about this clause myself. I need the clause at this stage, and I deliberately say it&#x2014;at this stage. It may not be necessary to have it next year, but I give the hon. member my personal assurance that it is necessary now. This is the psychological moment to have this power, as I see my problem, and that is why I incorporated it into the Bill, well knowing that if I had only come with the recommendations of the Snyman Commission the Bill would have had an easy passage and would probably have been passed by now. But I had to risk it because I have to have these powers now. Therefore I am afraid I cannot take it any further. I can only give the hon. member the assurance that that is the position.</p>

<p>I have pointed out to the hon. member that that principle was accepted by Parliament last year, and I therefore could not understand why in spite of that the hon. member moved that amendment again. He knows as well as I do that whereas his amendment now says that restricted persons cannot have access to this particular individual, there are others who are not necessarily restricted. Unfortunately the position is that we cannot allow people who cannot be trusted to have access to such a person.</p>

<p>Supposing you detained a man and questioned him; naturally when questioning him you must give him certain information, by implication if not directly. If you ask him a question concerning this book, for example, naturally at some stage or other he must know that this book is in question. You cannot ask him questions about the book without mentioning a book or books. Supposing he has an accomplice outside and he passes on the message to that accomplice, &#x201C;Beware of this, that, or the other thing&#x201D;. You would thereby be destroying the very evidence that you are trying to collect. I do not know whether I am making myself clear, but you can destroy the very thing that you do not want to have destroyed under any circumstances, by the mere passing of information, and that is the sole reason for this provision. Not only in this country but in Britain&#x2014;and I repeat in Britain&#x2014;that is the sole reason why people were held in communicado in Britain in spite of the fact that the <i>Times</i> pretends not to know anything about it. That is the reason why in this country on more than one occasion in the past people were held in communicado. Sir, I make no bones about it: I am not trying to steal a march on hon. members. I am putting my cards on the table. I want this information under the existing circumstances and judging from the experience of everybody concerned with this issue, this is the best way under the existing circumstances.

<p>There are one or two questions I would like to ask the Minister in regard to people who will be detained under this measure if it becomes law. The Minister has already indicated, and I am very happy to hear it, that the next-of-kin will be advised if a man is detained under this section. That is an important statement and we welcome it. What I want to know from the hon. the Minister is what is going to happen to the families of these people if they are married and what is going to happen to the pay which they would have received during the period of detention if they had not been detained? What provision will be made to ensure that the man&#x2019;s job will not be in jeopardy? What provision will be made to ensure that he will not be ejected from his house if he cagnot pay his rental? In other words, what compensation will there be for this man if it is proved to the Minister that he is in genuine employment; that he has been deprived of the opportunity of earning a livelihood? How is his family going to live? Will the Government see to it that his employer pays him or will the Government pay him?</p>

<p>In regard to the points raised by the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) at the time of the emergency in 1960 I happened to be as the hon. member knows, Deputy Minister of Social Welfare. Certain regulations were then promulgated by me to meet the conditions that then existed and to make provision for all sorts of possibilities and probabilities, and those regulations still exist to-day and will naturally be invoked to assist in matters of this kind.

<p>I am sorry. I should have replied to that. The reason why I cannot accept that amendment is because in essence provision is made in subsection (4) that this particular section may lapse before that date. I think it would certainly be in conflict with the amendment of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) should I consider accepting that amendment. But I am faced with a further difficulty. I am not making a point of it; I merely want to point out in passing that the Opposition has made it difficult for me, even if it was possible (and it is not possible) to accept that amendment because I accepted a similar amendment from the Opposition to Clause 4 and then the Opposition voted against the clause, as amended at their request. That makes it rather awkward for me, but apart from that it is not necessary in the circumstances to accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment because this section will lapse as soon as there is no need for it.</p>

As I understand it a person could, as a defence against a charge of being on a protected area, say that he was unaware of the fact that such an area was a protected area. I see no provision in this particular clause for that. I should also like the hon. the Minister to tell us whether he does not think he goes a little far in his indemnity in sub-section (8).</p>

<p>Unfortunately I cannot tell the hon. member whether this is similar to the war measures. I did not check whether there was such a war measure. So I have no idea. I can only tell the hon. member that in essence this is similar to the Rhodesian Act which was passed some months or weeks ago.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I moved an amendment during the Committee Stage which I want to move now in a slightly different form in pursuance of the objections of the hon. the Minister which I think are fairly well-founded. The amendment that I now want to move as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Clause 4, to add the followong provisos at the end of the proposed paragraph <i>(a)bis</i> inserted by paragraph (a):<br/>Provided that the Minister shall not exercise his powers under this paragraph unless he has first consulted with a committee to be appointed by the Minister consisting of a Judge of the Supreme Court, or a former Judge nominated by the Chief Justice, a magistrate of the district in which the prisoner in respect of whom the notice is to be issued lives and a senior police officer: Provided further that if the committee does not concur in any notice issued by the Minister under this paragraph, the committee shall forthwith draft a report setting out its reasons for such disagreement, and the Minister shall lay such report upon the Tables of the Senate and the House of Assembly within fourteen days of the receipt of the report if Parliament is then in session or, if Parliament is not in session, within fourteen days of the commencement of the next session of Parliament.</block>

<p>I moved a similar amendment during the Committee Stage and although the hon. the Minister said that he could understand the motive behind the amendment and was favourably disposed towards it he also said that there were certain practical difficulties. One of the difficulties he mentioned was the fact that he would have to discuss the matter with the Bench to ascertain whether a Judge would be available for this purpose. I am now making it possible for him to appoint an ex-judge and so that difficulty falls away.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to take up too much of the time of the House in regard to this amendment. It is quite clear that we want to give the hon. the Minister the power that he is asking for; he retains all the powers that are asked for in the original Bill.</p>

<p>How do you think that the Minister will be able to follow that procedure before Friday?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister will have no trouble if he has someone in mind, and I understand that he has. If the Minister wants to detain that person for a longer period, I think it will be easy for him to find some way to detain that person from next Friday until this committee is appointed. I think that the hon. the Minister will agree that there are ways in which he can detain such a person, in any case, for a reasonable period. I think the hon. the Minister of Transport must accept the fact that the hon. the Minister of Justice knows more about these matters than the hon. the Minister of Transport. I think that the hon. the Minister of Justice will find some way of detaining that person.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the responsibility for imprisoning a person for practically his entire life, without trial, is a tremendous responsibility for one Minister to bear. I do not think that this Minister or any other Minister will abuse these very far-reaching powers that can have such far-reaching results. This amendment is not intended to hamper the hon. the Minister in maintaining the security of the State. I want hon. members to understand well that this is an honest effort to assist the hon. the Minister but nevertheless to ensure that at the same time the matter is not left to the judgment of one single person. As the hon. the Minister said, it is true that in any case he always acts on the advice of his Department. But, Sir, human beings are fallible. The Minister is fallible. Let me indicate how easily things go wrong within a Department. A little while ago the hon. the Minister named a person a communist, a person who had never been a communist; in reality he was a member of the Nationalist Party. And what was more, that person was already dead!</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>But when the list was published for the first time, that person was no longer alive. It is possible that that sort of thing can happen. I am not blaming the hon. the Minister personally. I say again that this is a tremendous responsibility for only one Minister to bear. I want to make it easier for him and that is why I am moving this amendment. It does not deprive him of any of his powers. Why does the hon. the Minister now want to adopt the attitude that we are trying to hamper him through the medium of this amendment? Actually we want to help him. We must at least show the world that he is not a Minister who assumes powers by means of which he can detain a person for his entire lifetime simply upon his own judgment. Even if he does not agree with the committee he still has the right to imprison that person for life. All that he then has to do is to tell this House: &#x201C;The committee did not agree with me but nevertheless I considered it to be in the interests of the security of the State to imprison that person for life.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you will appreciate the reasonableness of this amendment. Even the hon. the Minister appreciated its <span class="col_4907-4908" refersTo="page_1028"/>reasonableness although he did have some practical objections to it. To my mind his most important objection was the fact that he had not consulted the Bench. That difficulty has now been eliminated.</p>

<p>My amendment is simply that the accused should not have to prove his innocence beyond any reasonable doubt. The onus is not on him to prove it, but on a balance of probability. I believe that that is the position in which the hon.

<p>The reply that I want to give the hon. member once again is the reply that I gave him during the second reading debate through the medium of the letter from Mr. Justice Snyman [Translation.]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another point that I want to mention is that of the onus of proof in cases where the safety of the State is at stake. It is an established and salutory requirement of our law of evidence under common law that in criminal cases no person can be found guilty of a crime unless the State is able to prove his guilt beyond all reasonable doubt.</block>

<p>He goes on to say [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The effect of this onus of proof under our criminal law may therefore be that no steps can be taken against persons who are in all probability involved in plots against the State, and yet such persons may in all likelihood be engaged in trying to overthrow the authority of the State and to jeopardize the lives of its citizens. In my opinion the law-giver must consider whether some procedure <span class="col_4909-4910" refersTo="page_1029"/>cannot be evolved to combat subversive activities of this nature outside of the ordinary criminal processes.</block>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Clause 17, to omit all the words after &#x201C;and&#x201D; in line 1, page 12, to the end of the clause and to substitute &#x201C;within 48 hours produce such person before a magistrate whereupon the provisions of Section 83 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1955 (Act No.56 of 1955), shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply as if such person had been brought before such magistrate in terms of that section&#x2026;</block>

<p>The effect of the amendment will be that the same class of persons can be detained for interrogation as is presently the position. They can be detained by the police, but from then on the provisions of the law already existing in relation to interrogations will have effect. The effect of this clause is merely to provide that interrogations will be safeguarded nevertheless if my amendment is accepted, and I want to say if this amendment is not accepted, the hon. Minister of Justice will be responsible&#x2014;and I use a phrase that is frequently used by him&#x2014;that South Africa will stink in the nostrils of the world.</p>

<p>This amendment will put this power on a basis acceptable in the Western World. I want to remind the hon. the Minister of Lands who was the first to shout very loudly at the time in Committee when a similar amendment was moved and rejected and leave was asked to have an instruction; and I would like to remind him of what he said about democracy. He was one of the stars of the Sabotage Film too, and the Minister said that it was a very fine instrument, a delicate instrument which had to be very finely played, and one had to know how to play it. I want to say that this is not the way he played that instrument, this is not the instrument he used, this is not the instrument he used to play that instrument, this is not the strumming he used to get any tones out of that instrument inasmuch as it is a democracy. Sir, I think not only will it play discords, but it will break the very cords which will make the noise of democracy in that instrument.</p>

<p>The effect of this is that a person who is mentioned in the clause as it stands and detained by a police officer, brought before the court, the magistrate, and dealt with under that section, provides that if he does not give the answers which I required of him in the interrogatory, he can be put in gaol for eight days at a time indefinitely until he answers the questions satisfactorily. If that is not what the hon. Minister wants, then I am afraid my suspicions in relations to this clause are even greater than they were before. If the hon. Minister won&#x2019;t accept this, then the hon. Minister has not told this House why he wants this clause, and no one in this House, I believe, should vote for this clause if the hon. Minister cannot say to this House why it is he wants them kept <i>in communicado</i> in a manner which, as I say, will create in the eyes of the world the worst possible image that South Africa can have.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with a clause which provides for interrogation, and the question arises as to who is best qualified in the interests both of the hon. the Minister and the police to conduct the interrogation. Now one of the tasks which is placed upon the police is to provide evidence which will solve the commission of an offence and bring the offender to justice. That is one of their tasks, and in circumstances such as pertain in South Africa at present, that is very often a particularly difficult task. Another of the duties of the police in cirsumstances such as presently pertain entails their dealing with difficult, violent and rough behaviour on the part of unlawful elements. Because of that from the nature of their task and its difficulties they must as human beings tend to develop a certain immunity to rough behaviour, they must tend to develop a certain immunity towards robust behaviour; otherwise they could not do the task properly in which they are employed.</p>

<p>I am insinuating nothing. I am saying that any of us placed in their position would develop a similar immunity to robust behaviour: otherwise we could not do it either. It stems from the difficulties of their task and naturally they must develop an immunity of one or other sort. Bearing in mind that they have to carry out their duty under such difficult circumstances it is certainly in the interest both of themselves and of the Minister and the public that if at all possible, somebody other than a person drawn from that <span class="col_4911-4912" refersTo="page_1030"/>body should undertake the work of interrogation. The amendment which I propose moving, Sir, provides for a magistrate, appointed by the Minister, to carry out the interrogation and to determine when the interrogation shall cease. The point which I should like to make in this regard to the Minister is that in that way he will achieve his objects under this clause and at the same time any dangers which might be inherent, not on account of any wrong motives but in the nature of things, in such an interrogation being carried out by a member of the police will be obviated through it being conducted by a magistrate. At the same time the Minister will achieve the same result.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Reading this clause, one sees first of all that a commissioned officer is given the power to arrest and detain a person. The detainee can then be held in custody for interrogation in connection with the commission or the intention to commit such an offence dealt with here. Now, Sir, there is nothing in this clause saying who shall do the interrogation and. therefore, there is nothing to indicate that such interrogation shall be conducted by a police officer. Therefore no principle has been embodied in this clause to the effect that only a police officer shall do the interrogation. Consequently, I ask you to allow this amendment which will have the effect of stating in the clause who shall do the interrogation. I admit that sub-section (2) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall, except with the consent of the Minister of Justice or a commissioned officer as aforesaid, have access to any person detained under sub-section (1).</block>

<p>This means that some other person can, with the approval of the Minister or of a commissioned officer, have access to the person detained and if a magistrate is to be the interrogating officer, he would have had permission to have access to the detainees. I want to stress the fact that in the whole of the clause there is nothing saying that only a commissioned officer shall have the right to interrogate. Consequently, it cannot be said that any such principle is being enshrined here, because, as I said, there is no provision in this clause to the affect that a commissioned officer only shall have access to the detainees for the purpose of interrogation.</p>

<p>I should like to follow up further what the hon. member for Transkeian Territories has said. Supposing it is desired to use an expert on explosives, for example, to acquire information from the detainee by means of interrogation. As a matter of fact, it might be an expert on any subject who is required to obtain information from the detainee. Now, such expert may not be a commissioned officer of the police. Is this clause intended to limit any interrogation to such a commissioned officer only? The police may, after all, require experts in any particular field to obtain information. In order, therefore, to allow of this being done, I support the argument advanced by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the interrogation mentioned in this clause undoubtedly deals with the investigation of a crime and that is why only the person who is entrusted with the investigation of that crime can do the interrogating. If this function is delegated to some other person, one must face the fact that that person will not have the knowledge necessary to enable him to ask the questions that should be asked. In my opinion, the whole object of the clause will be defeated if the persons engaged in the investigation do not also do the interrogating.</p>

<p>Order! The hon. member is not dealing with the point of order now but with the subject matter of the clause. He is arguing in favour of the amendment. As far as the point of order which was raised by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories, is concerned, I have listened to and have considered what other hon. members have had to say in this regard, but I am afraid I am still of the same opinion, namely that the amendment introduces a new principle which was not contemnlated at the second reading of the Bill. The work of interrogation is the responsibility of the Commissioner of the South African Police. If he desires any expert advice, it is for him to call such expert advice. Consequently, I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>
