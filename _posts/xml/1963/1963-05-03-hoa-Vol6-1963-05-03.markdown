<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) After consideration of all the circumstances in the case, it was decided to arraign the two accused before the Regional Court.</li>

<p>If the presiding magistrate, with due observance of all the facts, was of the opinion that a sentence of more than three years was justified, he could have converted the proceedings into a preparatory examination in terms of Section 93 (1) of Act 32 of 1944.</p>

</answer>

<question by="#mitchell" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>Mr. M. L. MITCHELL:</from>

<p>Arising out of the Minister&#x2019;s reply the question is really whether he or the Attorney-General acting on the Minister&#x2019;s behalf was satisfied that this was a matter which was not serious enough to send to the Supreme Court.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#mitchell">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<question by="#mitchell" to="#minister_of_justice">

<from>Mr. M. L. MITCHELL:</from>

<p>Arising out of the Minister&#x2019;s reply, the Minister can perhaps indicate to the House why if that instruction is in force that the police should not be used as traps in brothel cases, one was used as a trap in this particular case.</p>

</question>

<p>Further arising out of the Minister&#x2019;s reply is the reply then that a case in which a masseuse massages a male person with the object of having sexual intercourse with him in the premises where this takes place is not a brothel case?</p>

<p>Second Order read: House to go into Committee on Unit Trusts Control Amendment Bill.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>On Clause 2,</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I would draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to Clause 2 (a) where provision is made for the insertion of the following proviso&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the registrar may in his discretion, and on such conditions as he may deem fit, exempt any registered management company from compliance with the requirements of paragraph (b), for such a period, not exceeding six months, as he may determine.</block>

<p>What I want to know from the Minister is from what date the period of six months is calculated. Is it from the day on which the deficiency of capital is discovered or is it six months from the date on which notice was given by the registrar?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is from the date on which the extension is granted by the registrar. The period of six months runs from that date.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Does the Minister not think that the period of six months is too long? A period of three months is provided for in those cases where the company itself finds that there is a deficiency of capital. The company then has three months in which to put the matter right. Where, on the other hand, the registrar finds the deficiency, the registrar gives the company six months&#x2019; notice to put the matter right. It seems to me that there should be some explanation as to why in the one case the period is three months and in the other six months.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The position is that when the company finds out that there is a deficiency, it has to put the matter right within three months. But the registrar has a discretion. It may depend on certain things whether he will give three months&#x2019; notice or four months&#x2019; notice or two months&#x2019; notice, but he cannot allow the company longer than six months to put the matter right. I think in this case we must allow a certain amount of flexibility. One does not want to the down the registrar too much by laying down a fixed period. This is merely a maximum period, and one can well imagine circumstances in which the maximum of six months may be necessary to allow a management company, acting in perfectly good fa.th, to restore its position, but on the other hand one can also imagine circumstances in which the registrar will refuse to grant the full period of six months. It is difficult to envisage every possibility, and what we are doing now is to say that the registrar must satisfy himself what in all the circumstances, having regard to the presence or absence of good faith, the period should be, but he cannot give an extension for a longer period than six months.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 7,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>This clause provides that every management company shall furnish to the registrar a full list of all the underlying securities comprised in any unit portfolio managed by it and that such list shall be kept available at the registered office of the company for inspection during ordinary office hours by any unit certificate holder. I do suggest to the Minister that that might cause considerable inconvenience to unit holders who live a long way away, and I feel that this provision should be extended to provide that such list will be provided on written application from any unit holder. It will not put the company to any great inconvenience, but I do think that a unit holder should be entitled to that information on written application, especially if he lives far away.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I am prepared to put that to the registrar but if on application one has to supply the list to each individual unit holder who requires it, a fee will have to be charged. I think that is the usual arrangement. In fact in many similar cases an inspection fee has to be paid. We are not making provisions for that here, but if we have to send the list to each individual unit certificate holder on application, it may be necessary to make provision for a fee. However, that is a matter on which I cannot give an answer at the moment. I shall consider it and see whether it is practicable. At the moment, however, I envisage that if it is practicable, it will only be justifiable on payment of a certain fee.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, this is a bad clause and I have no doubt that if it were put to the free vote of the House it would be rejected. We know what troubles have arisen over the ages with regard to boundaries. We know that boundary disputes have led to controversies and even to wars. Under this clause there will be no static boundaries between the White areas and the Transkei. An area may be excised out of the Transkei at any time and compensated for by adding a White area to the Transkei. This question of boundaries will always be a source of controversy and bitterness. This Government claims that it wants to bring about peaceful conditions between the Bantu and the Whites. Sir, this clause will aggravate border difficulties and defeat the Government&#x2019;s object. The Minister knows that the farmers have repeatedly complained to him that if stock owned by Whites trespasses on to the released areas, the White farmer may be sent to prison, whereas the Native is only proceeded against for trespass if his stock trespasses on to the White area. I have a letter here from the Minister in which he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The law cannot be altered. The only Whites who can possibly be affected by the legislation concerned are traders who own stock in the White Bantu areas, or non-Bantu farmers whose farms adjoin the Bantu betterment areas.</block>

<p>We are not disturbed about farmers whose ground does not adjoin Government betterment areas. Regardless of whether these areas are fenced or not the law lays down that any farmer or trader, whose stock trespasses, can be proceeded against criminally and imprisoned. That is the law, and when we ask the Minister why there is discrimination between Whites and Blacks, his reply is that the law cannot be altered. I am only mentioning this because it is an instance of what is taking place at the present time. One can imagine how much worse the position will be once the boundaries become a subject of controversy. This Government up to now has not decided on any boundaries at all. The boundaries may be altered continually over the years. We know the history of Scotland and England. They had boundary warfare for a thousand years. What is going to happen to our White and Black relations in future when boundary disputes break out? We know how fences have been cut down by Natives and carried away.</p>

<p>Nobody knows what may happen in the future. I can mention cases of farmers who said that they were not going to sell any more land. After a few years they felt that they should move and go farming elsewhere, not that they had trouble with the Bantu or anything of that nature but simply because they wanted to go farming at some other place&#x2014;because they felt that that was what they wanted to do. Let me say&#x2014;and this is also in reply to the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker)&#x2014;that it appears to me as though the hon. member for Albany is no longer a good Englishman because one of the basic tenets of the Englishman&#x2019;s outlook on life is that nothing is static, that the community is always growing. That is the basic principle of the political philosophy of the British.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The basic concept of the British is an elastic approach. We must not forget that we are living in the Republic of South Africa under certain conditions peculiar to this country. In the first place we have a large number of black spots and in the second place there are certain outcrops of land which jut out into the Bantu areas. The declared policy of the Government is to follow a process of consolidation. It is also the desire on the part of many people that the Black spots should be removed and that this land should be exchanged for land abutting the Bantu areas. We have made very good progress over the past few months in <span class="col_5297-5298" refersTo="page_1223"/>this connection. To contend that the borders of the Bantu areas are completely static is, to say the least of it, being very unrealistic and very unpractical. This is something that can change from time to time. The borders are there to-day but a guarantee is given in this clause. I thought that hon. members of the Opposition would be particularly pleased and would say that even though they condemned the whole of this Bill they welcomed this clause. It is being provided here that such change can only be effected with the consent of the legislative council of the Transkei and the consent of this Parliament, the House of Assembly and the Senate. One cannot have a better guarantee than this. There is also a procedural approach and that is that the people of the area concerned are consulted. It has always been my policy to consult both the Whites and the Bantu. If both sections feel that they want to make a change then it is in the national interests for that change to be made. It is unreasonable to say that no change can be effected and that these areas are static.</p>

That principle cannot be attacked; particulars can be discussed. The moment a member attacks the principle I am going to rule him out of order.

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>May I address you on a point of order, Sir? The point of order is this that the rule says that the principle of a Bill shall not be attacked in committee, only the details. The principle of this Bill was ruled from the Chair yesterday as being the granting of self-government to the Transkei. That is the principle. That principle can be observed and in no way weakened whether Clause 3 is accepted or not. We can vote Clause 3 out of this Bill and the principle still remains. We could amend Clause 3, which we could not do if it were a principle of the Bill. You could not allow us to amend Clause 1 because that would have affected the principle. But Clause 3 could be omitted without affecting the principle; it would be altered and changed in a number of ways without affecting the principle of the Bill at all. That is why we have this difficulty in observing your ruling. It seems to us that there are various clauses in this Bill which could be omitted without affecting in any way the principle of the Bill. They could be altered, their entire import could be changed, without affecting the principle of the Bill. We could say in Clause 3 that there shall never be any change, there shall never be any excision of any property from the boundaries of the Transkei and it would not affect the principle of the Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I say in that regard that there are provisions in these clauses, and a provision of a Bill, as adopted at the second reading, does not become a principle of the Bill; it does not even become a principle of the clause. There seems to be a feeling that a provision of the Bill, passed at the second reading, become a principle in that clause. I submit that a provision of a Bill and the principle of a Bill are two entirely different things. All we are doing here is to deal with the provisions of Clause 3. The Rule is perfectly clear. Under the Rule the provisions of a Bill, as distinct from the principle (the provisions are the details), can be discussed. That is precisely what can be discussed. The principle cannot be discussed. But surely there is not a principle involved in regard to every clause of the Bill from the first to the last. There are provisions in the clauses from the first to the last. A provision is not a principle. I submit that we are not dealing here with a principle at all; we are dealing with the provisions of the clause in detail as we are permitted to do under the relevant Rule.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I am grateful for your ruling, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town was doubtful whether the area could be extended in an easterly direction. My reply is that the guarantee is here that this cannot easily be done. Last night the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) raised the question of Black Spots. It is our policy to consolidate and the Black spots may result in the fact that there may eventually be a change in the borders of that area. He also referred to Mount Currie. He wanted to know whether that White spot would perhaps disappear at a later stage and be added to the Transkei. I say again that these are possibilities in regard to which we have what is practically a tradition in South Africa of consulting the Whites and the Bantu concerned. I make so bold as to say that I was particularly concerned about introducing the principle of consulting the Bantu very thoroughly on a question of this nature. This cannot happen easily. It can only happen when there is the fullest measure of agreement. At the same time, Mr. Chairman, this Bill contains a guarantee for anyone who is in doubt that this can only happen&#x2014;and this is where hon. members are unfair&#x2014;with the approval of the legislative council of the Transkei and of this Parliament. One cannot have a better guarantee than that. It is only because hon. members have no faith in themselves that they say there is no guarantee in this. If some injustice is done&#x2014;as hon. members suggest does happen here and there&#x2014;they will realize what the reaction to this will be throughout the whole country. They know what the reaction will be. I do not think that any Government will be so stupid as to effect a change against the wishes and the desires of the majority of the people in connection with this matter. We are living in a country to-day where certain things are determined by historic processes with which to a certain extent we do not agree and in connection with which everyone feels that a change ought to be effected. Let me mention one example. There was a very strong feeling amongst the Whites in Natal that the catchment areas in the Drakensberg should be excised from the Bantu area and that a change should be effected in due course. This may happen in other places. This is a matter about which I feel very strongly myself. To say that these are the formal boundaries would really be very silly indeed. I emphasize the fact that this clause contains a guarantee to overcome any doubt that may exist on the part of hon. members. They need have no doubts about this clause at all; they ought to be satisfied with this clause.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister says that this clause is the safeguard to protect people from being absorbed willy nilly into the Transkei. But in saying so, he said clearly that it was not impossible that an area such as Mount Currie could one day be incorporated after discussion. I want to submit that that safeguard is a safeguard at the whim and wish of the Government. This Parliament is controlled in its decisions by the majority party, i.e. the Government party. The hon. the Prime Minister has indicated in an official statement that the White spots must disappear in the Transkei and that the White people in those White spots are there temporarily. This guarantee has, therefore, already been negated by an indication of Government policy. The Prime Minister has given it as Government policy and this Parliament is therefore no safeguard against a decision already taken by the Government. According to Government policy these spots will disappear. We may oppose it, but it is no safeguard for the minorities who are involved in those areas. Taking it further, the hon. the Minister stated that the Bantu in the Transkei were completely satisfied with this arrangement. He said they were satisfied with the boundaries as they existed and with this arrangement for the future.</p>

<p>Only last year the Transkeian Territorial Authority, which is about to become the Transkeian parliament, adopted two resolutions which were items of the report of the Select Committee on Land and Legal Matters. Item No. 18 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Government be respectfully requested to purchase the strip of European farms along the Mount Fletcher, Matatiele boundary for the settlement of Bantu farmers. Your committee supports the motion.</block>

<p>The next item: &#x201C;Acquisition of Land for Bantu Settlements&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Government be respectfully requested to purchase European farms between the Butterworth and Kentani districts for settlement as Bantu locations.</block>

<p>The motion was withdrawn. No. 20 &#x201C;Annexation&#x201D;&#x2014;not purchase, but annexation. I want to draw particular attention to the wording of this resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Annexation of certain districts to the Transkei: In view of the rapid growth of the Bantu population of the Transkei the Government be respectfully requested to make more land available by causing the district of Elliot, Maclear, Mount Currie, <span class="col_5301-5302" refersTo="page_1225"/>Indwe and Ugie to be annexed to the Transkeian Territory. Your Committee supports the motion.</block>

<p>Later on this report was debated and both items were unanimously adopted by the complete Territorial Authority on 8 May 1962, just a year ago.</p>

<p>This is the attitude and the view of the Transkeian Territorial Authority. They have already asked for the annexation of certain land. I want to ask the Minister, seeing that we are asked to approve a clause which deals with this particular case, to answer these specific requests. Here is a detailed request for specific areas of land. I ask the Minister to indicate to this House whether, in terms of the clause he wants us to pass, the Government accepts or rejects those specific requests? Because that will indicate to us how this clause is going to work and what its value is going to be as a protection to the inhabitants of those areas. The Minister must have seen this. He must know what the Government&#x2019;s attitude is. He must be able to say to us that the Government does not accept this demand thereby saying in advance to the Transkei that the Government rejects these specific demands. Then we will know of what value this safeguard is. It is the Government which has the power; it is the Government which decides. The Prime Minister has indicated in a recent statement this year that the White spots must disappear. I think we are entitled, before voting for this clause, to ask the Minister to answer specifically the question: Does the Government accede or reject the demands put to it by the Transkeian Territorial Authority?</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down tried to make us believe that he did not know the policy of the Government in connection with this particular matter. The Government has repeatedly stated that it adheres strictly to the 1936 legislation, nothing more, nothing less. We will not give the Bantu more land than that for which the 1936 legislation makes provision. To give effect to the 1936 legislation it is absolutely necessary that in regard to the Transkei this particular clause should form part of the Bill. We have to make provision for the land that may still possibly be added to the Transkei to make up the quota. I must point out that this clause is in conformity with the Act of 1936 because it states that if certain land is excised, land of an equal value must be given in exchange. That brings this clause into conformity with the 1936 legislation as far as excision is concerned, but provision must be made for the addition of land in terms of the 1936 legislation. Let me give an example. The hon. member spoke about the Mount Currie district. Mr. Chairman, let us imagine now that we want to purchase certain farms in terms of the 1936 legislation and we do so. Those farms will eventually form part of the Bantu area. Then this particular clause will apply&#x2014; to add those farms to the Transkei. This clause is absolutely necessary for the implementation of the 1936 policy and nothing more. The hon. the Prime Minister stated very clearly last year that there was no question of Maclear and those districts mentioned by the hon. member for Durban (Point) being annexed. He said this most emphatically. Those are simply wild stories by means of which the hon. members of the Opposition try to frighten the public. I do not know why they are trying to introduce this trend into the debate. I can only assume that they have not studied the Bill because if they had done so they would realize what the position was.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) made a statement in connection with the 1936 settlement and the intentions of the Department, a statement which one feels should come from the Minister himself so that it can be placed on record so that we can be satisfied that that is Government policy. In making that statement I think we should direct the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention particularly to the maintenance or otherwise of the Kei River as a future boundary. We should like to have a statement from him as to whether he anticipates any immediate encroachment across the Kei River in the direction of the Ciskei. I think it is of vital importance to the people in the area that we should have it not only from a member of the Native Affairs Commission but from the Minister himself and I think it should be stated in the fullest detail possible at this stage what the possible encroachments are to the west of the Kei River.</p>

<p>We are faced with a request for approval of Clause 3 which gives the Minister the power to excise certain areas from the Transkei. We know that in preparing the boundaries of the Transkei as they exist at the present time Port St. Johns has been left out. I think it would affect very really our attitude towards this clause if we knew whether the Minister was going to use this clause to excise coastal areas from the self-governing state in due course or not. To many of us there are real dangers in our coastal areas, the soft underbelly on our eastern seaboard, being controlled by what we feel may become an independent state one day. We wonder whether the Minister has any ideas under this clause, or can give us any assurance under this clause, of using those powers to excise coastal areas which could be used for those purposes. Port St. Johns is a harbour into which you cannot get at all tides. In fact, I believe, at very few tides indeed. The mouths of rivers are the access to the sea. I believe there is one river, the Umtamvuna River, which is the only one which can be navigated at all tides. I think we should know whether the Minister intends using this clause to excise areas of that kind or whether he intends to leave them under the control of what is now a self-governing area but which, we fear, may become an independent state.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The <span class="col_5303-5304" refersTo="page_1226"/>question of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition re-affirms the necessity for this clause. I want to say immediately in connection with the first question&#x2014;whether the Kei River will remain the boundary and whether we have immediate plans for going beyond the Kei River&#x2014;that it has always been my view that the Kei River is the traditional boundary and that we cannot lightly go beyond the Kei River. As far as I am concerned I do not want to go beyond this point at all but it is possible that there may be people just beyond the Kei River who in the course of time may want their land to be purchased and it may be felt in future that this should be done. I cannot control the future but I do not think that this will easily happen. The Kei River is the natural boundary and the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) knows that I feel very strongly about this.</p>

<p>As far as the area of Port St. Johns is concerned the hon. member knows that it is a White area. The hon. member also knows that I have publicly stated there and even in the Transkei that the Port St. Johns area will remain a White area. There must be no doubt on this score. The hon. member asked a question that must be considered, as to why one cannot make this an inflexible rule. Will it not perhaps be necessary in the future to exclude certain parts of the coastline of the Transkei with a view to defence? That is quite possible. If this happens negotiations will of course have to take place with the Transkeian Legislative Council and I can only tell hon. members that the discussions that I have had with them, particularly in regard to defence, have clearly shown that they feel far more strongly about the fact that we should undertake the entire defence of the Transkei than we feel about it. This therefore is a possibility that is not excluded&#x2014;that with a view to the security and defence of the Republic of South Africa, including the Transkei, one will have to exclude certain parts for military purposes. That is one of the reasons why this clause has been inserted. If such a position does arise, we will have this Bill. But at the same time there is also the guarantee that these things can only be done with their cooperation.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>With a view to the statement that the hon. the Minister has just made and with a view to the fact that he made it. it is not necessary to reply to what the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) had to say because the hon. the Minister has told us clearly that although he personally has no intention of purchasing land beyond the Kei River to be added to the Transkei at this stage, it can happen in the immediate or distant future that there may be people who want to sell their land and that that land can then be taken over and be added to the Transkei subject to the provisions of Clause 3 which states that the Senate and the House of Assembly and the Parliament of the Transkei must approve of that being done. I want to put this pertinent question to the hon. the Minister: Are we ever going to reach the stage within the next five, ten, 15 or 20 years when the citizens of the Republic will know what the borders of their country are? In terms of this Bill provision is being made for land to be added on and exchanged. The objection is not so much to the question of exchange but to the question of &#x201C;addition&#x201D;. We have lived in a country whose borders we have been able to pinpoint over the past 50 years. We have now reached the stage&#x2014; and we blame the Government for it&#x2014;that with the coming into being of independent Bantu states, we do not know where those borders are. I ask the hon. the Minister in all fairness, what certainty do we have? The people living in East London and those parts do not know how far beyond the Kei the Transkei will extend, even though this Parliament and the Parliament of the Transkei have first to decide. They do not know whether it is going to include a large part of the Ciskei; whether they will eventually become a corridor city; whether that corridor will also eventually disappear and whether they will become the capital of the Transkei. Is there any right-thinking person in this House who imagines that this House, the Senate and the legislative body in the Transkei will be able to prevent legislation being passed to add that land to the Transkei? Will the appeal of a small group of people in an isolated area, in a local area, carry sufficient weight with this Government to make them decide not to expropriate that land and add it to the Transkei? Must we not know where we are for the next heaven knows how many years? We do not know how many years it is going to take to bring the Bantu states into existence, one after the other, and to define the area of each one&#x2014; to have a provisional territorial determination in this regard. I say &#x201C;provisional&#x201D; because after that it will be like a concertina which can expand or contract; but it may not contract; it can only expand because the Act provides that no land can be taken away from them unless land of a similar value is given to them in exchange. But land can be added; land can be purchased. Does the hon. the Minister really expect the White people of this country to live like this for the next 15 or 20 years, not knowing where the borders of the Republic are? Must the farmers at Vryburg and Kuruman, where one of these days a Bantustan is going to be proclaimed, live in uncertainty for the next 15 years not knowing whether they will fall inside or outside of that Bantustan? Will the appeal of the farmers at Vryburg make any difference as far as this Parliament is concerned? Even though the provision is included in this legislation that this Parliament and the Legislative Council of the Transkei have to agree, it is unreasonable to allow this uncertainty to remain in regard to areas adjoining the Transkei, the areas of Vryburg or Kuruman that I mentioned or areas in the western Transvaal where Bantustans may possibly come into being. Can the people feel sufficiently safe when this Parliament and the legislative councils of the <span class="col_5305-5306" refersTo="page_1227"/>Bantustans concerned will be able to decide about additional purchases of land? I put this question pertinently to the hon. the Minister so that he will be able once and for all to explain the matter clearly to us, if he can, and to tell us for how many years the Republic has still to experience the uncertainty of not knowing where its borders are. If an independent state is set up it must have borders and if those borders are continually expanding, how is anyone to know where he is? When will we have stability? How is anyone in the Republic to know that he will not be swallowed up at some time or other? I hope that the hon. the Minister will reply to me in this regard.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member who has just spoken will read and properly study this clause to which he has objected and understand its meaning, his objections will immediately disappear because this is the only practicable way, the only method that one will be able to use to determine, on the highest possible authority, the boundaries about which the hon. member is so concerned. The hon. member is continually asking&#x2014;and he is supported by his colleagues: Where are the boundaries; where are the borders? He ought to know that for the time being the released areas give an indication of the borders. But now as practical people, as people who ought to know the difficulties that exist, it ought also to be clear to them and to everyone who has any knowledge of conditions that these cannot be regarded as the best boundaries in all respects. In other words, although the provisional boundaries are there, improvements, additions and excisions must take place in order to satisfy the interested parties there, the farmers, so that they will also be able to say that those borders were fixed with their cooperation and approval, borders which will not be determined in a high-handed manner but which will be fixed by way of consultation. The hon. gentlemen are very fond of consultation. That will take place in consultation with the interested persons there. When one has consultations one immediately realizes that one has to keep the way open on the highest possible level for negotiation, so that once all those borders have been determined, everyone will be satisfied and those borders will then have been fixed in the interests of all. Perhaps it will help hon. members if they try to imagine the complex in which these borders will have to be fixed. They ought not to have any difficulty because they will find that on the northern boundary of that area we have the Umtamvuna River, to the south the Great Kei River, to the east the ocean and to the west the Drakensberg. All the changes will take place in that complex. They certainly cannot go beyond that complex. The hon. member for Durban (Point) is also continually asking where the borders are. If he will just take a pencil and mark these borders that I have mentioned on a map. he will very clearly see the complex in which this operation which will take place under this clause will be put into effect. Then he will understand that the addition of land, having regard to the people living there, will only take place on the highest possible authority. When one has to deal pertinently with these matters one realizes that it is not possible merely to fix a boundary. One may find that a river forms an effective boundary in one case. At some other place one may find that the people living on both sides of the river will say that the river should not be made the boundary; in other cases again one will find people saying that the mountains form the best boundaries, but in other circumstances they will say that that is not correct because it is not in the best interests of the people living on both sides of those mountains. In other words, one cannot come along here, as the hon. member for Durban (Point) has done, and ask the hon. the Minister: Do you accept this or that suggestion of this or that committee or this or that interested person? These things have to be done on the highest possible authority and with the largest measure of consultation. In other words, the process of consolidation can only satisfy everyone, with a view to the future, if it is done on this high level so that after investigation, after hearing evidence and having regard to the interests of the people on both sides. Parliament will decide in such a way that if a boundary has to be drawn at some place or other, it will not be necessary to come to Parliament in the next year and say that a mistake was made in the previous year. No. We will then have what hon. members on the other side want, something that we on this side are striving for far more than they are. But under the circumstances one cannot ask the Minister whether he accepts this or that suggestion. It is physically impossible and it is unfair to expect him to reply and to say that he approves of particular suggestions. If he were to do so they would say the next day that the Minister had stated in the House of Assembly that he approved of certain proposals. That would be very unfair. He can only do so after an investigation has taken place and after Parliament has given its approval. Then we will obviate changes having to be made in the future. Once they have been laid down by Parliament it is obvious that those boundaries will not be changed continually but will be as permanent as possible.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reference to the Kei River as the boundary and to his very na&#x00EF;ve but also incorrect statement that the Kei River is regarded as the natural boundary by the Bantu living there, the Pondos, the Gcalekas, the Xhosas, the Tembus and the other tribes. Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Minister knows just as well as I do that the Kei River is not the natural boundary of those parts. And may I say with all respect that Matanzima understands this position far better than the hon. the Minister judging by the explanation he has now given to us. Matanzima knows that <span class="col_5307-5308" refersTo="page_1228"/>it was in 1750 that the farmers who were trekking to the north-east met the Bantu at the fish River, not at the Kei River, and thereafter it was the Fish River, as Matanzima also says, which became the natural boundary of that area. It is for that reason that this side of the House is so perturbed because we do not know where the border will be after this &#x201C;consultation&#x201D;, and after having been &#x201C;tentative And if that consultation takes place as it took place with the Whites in the Transkei, then I feel sorry for the White? of the Ciskei; then I feel sorry for the Whites at Cradock.</p>

My appeal to the hon. the Minister is this: Do not let us hesitate to say precisely what we want, precisely what the position is going to be. Do not run away from it. This is an important matter. Let us know precisely where we stand in connection with this matter. Do not try to evade the issue.

<p>The hon. member knows just as well as the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) that in the past the Kei River has been the traditional border of the Transkei. I do not know whether the hon. member knows that the territory which will now receive self-government is called the &#x201C;trans-Kei&#x201D;. Does the hon. member know what &#x201C;trans&#x201D; means? I am sorry that I do not have a blackboard here. &#x201C;Trans&#x201D; means &#x201C;across&#x201D;. It means across the Kei.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The fact is simply that the whole Territorial Authority of the Transkei, including Matanzima, accepted this legislation and recognized that boundary. Matanzima himself said that the great fuss that was being made in the newspapers was based on an incorrect interpretation of his statement. Any person who reads it will see that a completely erroneous conclusion was drawn from his words. It is therefore not fair to exploit those statements in dealing with this Bill. The fact is that this Bill was unanimously adopted not only by the Recess Committee but also, with few exceptions, by the entire Territorial Authority. Our officials there have explained the position very clearly. The hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) quoted yesterday what one of our officials is supposed to have said&#x2014;that there was a possibility of other areas being included at a later stage&#x2014;but if the hon. member had read the whole speech of that official he would have seen that that was not the case. They were told very clearly that these were the boundaries. The same reply holds good for the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) who asked what the position was with regard to the request which was made <span class="col_5309-5310" refersTo="page_1229"/>some time ago that certain areas should be incorporated in the Transkei. Hon. members know that that request was not acceded to. But every person in the world is at liberty to put forward a request. There is this interesting saying amongst the Bantu that the child who never cries while it is on its mother&#x2019;s back eventually dies of thirst. This is a very interesting saying but there is no malice behind it. When we discuss these matters with them it is perfectly clear to us that they accept this position. Now the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) says that his difficulty is that boundaries can never be determined with any finality during the next 15 or 20 years. I was surprised to hear a farmer say this. Indeed, there is one thing that has surprised me in this discussion and that is the great ignorance that some hon. members have revealed in their statements. I say this with due deference. In the first place they do not know the history of the past and how the position has developed. Secondly, they are completely out of touch with what is happening in South Africa to-day. The hon. member for East London (City) knows, I am sure, that we have a number of problems in South Africa that have to be solved; that we are going through a period of adjustment and that this period of adjustment may still continue for some years. The hon. member also knows that one of the basic principles of our policy is to consolidate, a fact that is welcomed by all economists of repute, a fact that is welcomed by the Bantu and a fact that is welcomed by every thinking Afrikaner. But we realize that one cannot say categorically, &#x201C;These are the boundaries and those of you who fall outside of these boundaries will be kicked back into the boundaries&#x201D;. The hon. member now wants to do what India did when the boundaries between India and Pakistan were laid down. Forceful action was taken at that time. But what was the result? More than 19,000,000 Indians lost their lives in what was one of the greatest scandals in the world, a scandal that is concealed to-day. We do not act in that way. Some time ago we had the case of a tribe that had to move to its own area. The tribe was willing to go but subsequently refused to go as a result of the agitation of a certain ex-Senator. I said then that we would not quarrel about it. Not three years later they themselves came along and asked me to allow them to go because they were dying of hunger. One cannot determine boundaries with an iron hand because these are all citizens of South Africa, subjects of South Africa. We believe that this matter can be resolved by means of consultation and co-operation and that is how it is being resolved. In the nature of things in South Africa hon. members must admit that it has also been the experience of previous Governments that one cannot tackle this matter as a short-term policy. It is a long-term policy. The hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) will agree with me here because he had to i deal with these matters and had to make certain adjustments. I am sure that he will never contend that one can draw a definite line and say that that will be the boundary for all time to come. It will only be by means of mutual consultation and adjustment that we will eventually finalize these boundaries. But the important point in this clause is that it gives a guarantee to every member opposite that these steps will never be taken in a reckless fashion. They will be taken in such a way that they will have the approval of the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei and of this House.</p>

<p>On Clause 4,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 4 is one of the series of clauses in the Bill designed to undermine the loyalty to the Republic and to develop instead a separate loyalty to the Transkei. That is not necessary for the grant of self-government. Even if the ultimate objective is the grant of sovereign independence, it is not necessary at this stage. It is in no way part of the principle of the Bill, or essential to the Bill at this time. Its object is to provide for a Transkeian flag, the design of which is to be approved by the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei, and which is to be flown side by side with the national flag of the Republic in certain areas indicated by the Government of the Transkei and certain other places set out in the clause. Why this clause is important is because it forms part of a pattern, with the same object as other clauses, and in order to evaluate and understand it you have to see it against the background of the pattern of the other clauses.</p>

<p>These other clauses provide in the first place for a separate national anthem for the Transkei, and secondly, for a separate oath to be taken by the members of the Transkeian Legislature, which differs from that taken by our Provincial Councillors and the members of the Legislative Assembly in South West Africa. The third provision is for the making of laws by the Transkeian Legislature in certain matters, and it permits them to amend our Acts of Parliament and to pass Acts repugnant to our Acts. That is a power not given to any Provincial Council or even to the Legislative Assembly of South West. There is another provision which provides for a separate citizenship to be enjoyed by the Xhosa- and Sotho-speaking peoples, even though at the same time they will enjoy Republican citizenship in some respects.</p>

<p>I have said that this clause is part of a pattern and must be evaluated against that background. I think when it is evaluated in that way, there is no need for us to rely on statements made by the hon. the Prime Minister to indicate that although it is not the professed object of this Bill, or the principle of the Bill, as stated in the legislation itself, there is a hidden motive, an ulterior motive, behind this legislation, which is nowhere stated even in the Preamble; and that hidden motive is to lay the foundation for a sovereign, independent state, for the dismemberment of the Republic as we know it at present and for the ultimate destruction of Western standards and Western civilization as they exist in South Africa to-day. This clause and the other clauses which form part of the pattern are designed for that object. They could all be excised from this Bill and you would still have self-government in the Transkei, but it would not satisfy the hon. the Minister, because it would not be laying the foundations for future sovereign independence. He knows just as well as we do that if you give people symbols of independence and nationhood which they accept in that sense, then sooner or later there will develop the desire to translate those symbols into a significant reality. We have had experience in this House of how important members on both sides, and particularly on that side, have regarded symbols of nationhood and of independence and of sovereignty to be.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I always know when I am making a good speech, if the Chief Whip rises. But this is premature. At what stage did we get our separate flag? Was it when we got self-government? Did we not have to wait until after there was the acceptance of Dominion status through the Balfour Declaration, before our Government, which had had the power for many years, first thought it necessary to have its own national flag as a symbol of nationhood and sovereignty and independence? But here it is being presented to a people who are in the first stage <span class="col_5313-5314" refersTo="page_1231"/>of self-government and who have nowhere near reached the stage of development which we in the Republic had reached at the time when we first sought a symbol of our own for nationhood. Why is it being done? Why is it included in this Bill? It is not necessary for self-government. You could give them all the powers in this Bill without having these clauses. What is it put there for? I believe this clause is a deliberate attempt by the Minister and the Government to hasten development, not towards self-government but towards something well beyond it, to sovereign independence and the dismemberment of the Republic. I wonder why they are in such a hurry to hand over these symbols. If they believe that it will have an effect upon world opinion, I can say that I believe their attempt in that respect has failed already. I would have thought that a wise Government, in the face of the threats of Pan-Africanism and the dangers it holds for both Whites and non-Whites in South Africa, would have been keen to sponsor, instead of a separatism, a common patriotism to the Republic and a common loyalty and a common allegiance to the Republic, which could have been put against the forces of Pan-Africanism. But we know what the objectives of Pan-Africanism are, and how dangerous they are. We know they want one man, one vote, to exploit their numerical majority to the full and to establish a Black dictatorship which would be fatal, I believe, for both White and Black in South Africa. Yet. by putting in a clause of this kind, by giving a separate symbol to these people, here is an attempt to hurry the establishment of a separate nationhood and to hurry them along the road of sovereign independence in which there will be no allegiance to this Republic, no common loyalty to the Republic we all inhabit at present, but rather a separate loyalty which may very naturally tend to tie itself up with other Pan-African states unless we are very careful indeed. I would have thought that every point of contact which was common would have been cherished and maintained by a wise Government. But here we have in this clause the establishment of a separate flag, the first symbol of nationhood at this early stage, an invitation to range themselves alongside the embryo states of Africa. If ever there was a clause which played into the hands of Pan-Africanism, it is this clause.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition makes three fundamental errors in his approach to this matter. In the first place he draws a parallel between the former relationship between South Africa and England and the relationship between South Africa and the Transkei. That parallel, as I shall explain in a moment, cannot be drawn as far as the Transkei is concerned. But in the second place he makes a fundamental error in regard to the views and the basic psychological outlook of the Bantu themselves in regard to this matter. I am quite convinced that a person who knows the basic views of the Bantu in regard to this matter would not adopt such an attitude. Let me refer the hon. member to the opinion of one of the greatest experts in the world in this sphere, Dr. Albert Schweizer, but I could also mention the views of a number of anthropologists. I shall come back to this matter a little later on. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition makes a further fundamental error in saying that he believes that there is no necessity to give them their own flag. He overlooks the fact that this is a spontaneous request from the Bantu in the Transkei and that this idea was in no way inspired by this Government. I say that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition makes a fundamental mistake in drawing this parallel with England. Our relationship with England was completely different. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also forgets that there are a few basic things for which the people of South Africa asked and for which they had asked for a long time. The first was the recognition of their language. We know what a great struggle this unleashed, particularly under the unfortunate policy of Milner, because the request was not acceded to. There are experts who hold the view that if this request had been acceded to at the time a very large part of South Africa would have become anglicized.</p>

<p>I want to point out to hon. members that the British Administration made quite a few concessions after the war in the Free State and that was followed by a fairly strong progress of anglicization. Why? Because it did not create hatred in the hearts of those people. They felt that recognition was at least being given to their language. I adopt the attitude that language is such a basic requirement of a nation that it must eventually win its struggle, but this also applies to a national flag. Look what a bitter struggle we had over our flag! If that struggle had not been waged many things might have been different to-day. If right at the start, just after the Boer War, we had had another flag in the Union, as most people wanted at the time&#x2014;a small group refused because they said that the flag of the conqueror should fly here&#x2014;things would perhaps have been different. But that started a flag controversy that was not in the interests of South Africa at all. If that mistake had not been made at the time we would have been spared a great deal of race hatred. The same applies to all these symbols. Let us not forget that those symbols are things to which people attach very great value.</p>

<p>We come now to the position of the Transkei itself. I say that the two cases are not parallel. The position of the Transkei to-day is that it forms an integral part of the Republic of South Africa, geographically, economically and otherwise. There is a big difference therefore. The position is that a large section of the population of South Africa were under the impression for years that England was using South Africa as a milch cow. That frame of mind does not exist in the Transkei and I can say that in all honesty. On the <span class="col_5315-5316" refersTo="page_1232"/>contrary, we find a growing feeling in the Transkei that the White population there has protected the riches of the Transkei. Because of this we find a completely different spirit in the Transkei. Moreover, with the development of the Transkei those people realize more and more that we are not exploiting this part of the country; on the contrary, we are helping them to progress and to become rich. That is why we see, even in some of the Protectorates, that already there are parties today who say in their constitution that their aim is to seek an immediate link-up with the Republic of South Africa as soon as they come into power. [Interjection.] The hon. the Leader of the Opposition asks how large that party is. They have already won seats. In spite of everything that is said, we find that that is the frame of mind of the people there. We can say, therefore, that the frame of mind of the Bantu in the Transkei is not the same as the frame of mind of the White population here was in respect of England, and this applies not only to the Afrikaans-speaking people but to a large number of English-speaking people, who felt just as a large number of English-speaking people in Rhodesia and Kenya today feel about England. That feeling does not exist in the Transkei. I can make this emphatic statement to-day. That parallel does not hold water therefore.</p>

<p>I come now to the second fundamental mistake made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and that is this. The fact of the matter is that the mentality of the Bantu is such that he is deeply attached to his own area, spiritually and otherwise. He attaches, particularly, great value to his own homelands. That is one of the things that hon. members may perhaps not be able to grasp unless they make a study of this matter. I am convinced in my own mind that the Bantu as a whole attach more value to their own area than the Whites do to theirs. That is one of the characteristics of the Bantu and that is why we have noticed throughout history that in their despair, when they have faced the threat that their territory might be annexed, they have asked the White powers to occupy that territory and preserve it for them. That was the case in the Transkei. When they faced the danger that their territory might be taken over as a White area, they went out of their way to ask the British Government to annex that territory so that it could be preserved as a Bantu area. That is one of the reasons why the Protectorates came into being&#x2014;because they attain a great deal of value to and have great affection for their own territory. They attach a great deal of value to their land. We know that the Bantu are very fond of their children and the love that they have for their land is equal to the love that they have for their children. There is no race in the world that has as much affection for its children as the Bantu. That love is inherent in the makeup of the Bantu but so is his love for his land. It is because of this that we find that the Bantu, with the exception perhaps of the completely civilized Bantu, also attach great value to their land because it is the home of the spirits of their forefathers and so forth. But the fact is that there are numbers of factors that bind the Bantu to his land. I want to advance this proposition here to-day and I do so with the utmost sincerity; this is a matter to which I have devoted a great deal of study over the years; I even stayed in the Bantu areas for two years to investigate this matter. The statement that I want to make is that most Bantu never lose the ties that they have with their homeland. The contention that the urban Bantu has been weaned from his own areas is the most arrant nonsense that I have ever heard. I just want to refer hon. members to the inquiry which was made some time ago in the East London location, the oldest location in South Africa, a location where the process of integration was very clearly followed. It was found there that the vast majority of the people in that location, almost all of them, continued to have some link or other with their homeland. It is something to which they attach a great deal of value. I have often stated here that we will never have peace throughout the whole of Africa until the boundaries are reviewed on a national basis. Fortunately, there are numbers of experts today who more and more share my views. I say that we must not lose sight of the mentality of the Bantu.</p>

<p>Now we come to the symbol of the Bantu&#x2019;s love for his homeland, namely his flag. It is one of the basic desires of the Bantu to have his own flag. [Interjection.] That hon. member does not know what he is talking about. Let the cobbler stick to his last. The fact is that the Bantu attaches great value to a flag because it symbolizes his love for his homeland. I want to emphasize the fact that this is not merely a veneer on the part of the Bantu. The desire to have a symbol of their attachment to their homeland is really an integral part of their outlook on life and that is why they have asked for their own flag. Would we be sensible in saying &#x201C;No, only the flag of the Republic will fly in your territory; you will not get your own flag?&#x201D; What would be the result of that in the light of the history of every nation in the world? Do hon. members think that they would be satisfied with that? No; we would quite unnecessarily unleash a struggle. If one wants co-operation the obvious way to obtain it is not to ignore this deep desire on the part of those people. I admit quite honestly that I personally am very pleased about this, not for the reason mentioned by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition but because we have proof throughout Africa to-day that the approach that we are following is the only sound approach to create good relationships between White and non-White. We find that in various spheres of life. I just want to mention the example of the churches. One of the great mistakes that was made in Africa was not to develop a church indigenous to the Bantu. No other factor has dealt Christianity a greater <span class="col_5317-5318" refersTo="page_1233"/>blow than the failure to do so. One of the desires that is being expressed throughout South Africa is that they should have their own indigenous church. When Christianity is spread in that way then Africa will be christianized; I have no doubt about it. What applies to the Bantu church also applies to this matter. It is the policy of this Government, and it is my great ideal, to develop a feeling of partriotism towards their homeland in the mind of the Bantu, even stronger than it is to-day. They already have it. One dare not smother that feeling. If one smothers that feeling, one is going to unleash a struggle. The best method is to develop that partriotism and then sound co-operation will become possible. Then we can build bridges between White and non-White because then they will not be inferior. I am not in the least concerned about the important principle on which the world harps so much to-day but I am concerned about it in this respect that the dignity of the Bantu as a national group must be fully acknowledged. I am not in the least concerned about what the world has to say in this regard because the world is sick; in many respects it is a dying world. Therefore, I pay no attention at all to world opinion in this respect but I am concerned about the effect that this has on the mentality of the Bantu. That is why it is the policy of this Government to encourage this very fine feeling on the part of the Bantu, which is a good thing in the life of any nation, instead of following a policy that must result in conflict. The argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is that the effect of giving the Bantu their own flag will be to weaken the loyalty of the Bantu in the Transkei towards the Republic; that it will not create one common patriotism. In this regard the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is making a great mistake. I say again that the mentality of the Bantu is such that he is bound to his own area by a deep affection and that is something that we cannot ignore. He wants to see this affection symbolized in his own flag, and we cannot ignore that desire. If we do ignore it, Mr. Chairman, will they have any more affection then for the Republic of South Africa? On the contrary, what will happen then is what has been proved so clearly in other parts of Africa. Hatred will grow and not affection. I see the position in this light: The Bantu will have Transkeian citizenship and a feeling of patriotism to the Transkei; but that patriotism will spread through goodwill and through the recognition of the spiritual values of the Bantu. I wish I could impress upon hon. members the fact that there are few things in the world that make such a contribution towards good co-operation as the recognition of the spiritual values of another nation. There are few things that create as much race-hatred as the fact that one does not recognize the spiritual values of another nation. What does it profit a man&#x2014;if I may quote the Bible&#x2014;if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul? This applies not only to religious values but to all the spiritual possessions of a nation.</p>

<p>That is why I recognize the culture and language and so forth of the Bantu. Our view is that we can only do good to South Africa by this means. Those people are being given a stronger attachment to their own area through the medium of symbols for which they themselves have asked but at the same time that feeling of patriotism spreads because of the fact that we recognize their spiritual values, because of the fact that we give them the right to have their own symbols, which every nation in the world wants, and because of the fact that we give them the right to develop on natural lines. I say that this creates a relationship which will lead to a greater loyalty towards the Republic. It has always been my view that we must recognize the spiritual values of the Bantu. In other words, they must be firmly bound, as they are to-day, to their own homeland. We are quite convinced that the granting of their own flag, which symbolizes some of the finest qualities to be found in the people in the Transkei, can only result in the spiritual upliftment of the Transkei; that it can only result in a greater friendship with the White man in South Africa because here the White man is giving them a place in the sun in South Africa; it can only result in greater loyalty towards the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>Since we are dealing here with the first of a series of clauses which I can only describe as the dual loyalty clauses in this Bill, one finds it very difficult to discuss this matter with the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development because it is perfectly clear, having listened to him to-day, that he has lost touch with the realities of the situation. When I listened to him I really believed that the Xhosa-speaking Natives of South Africa were so attached to the Transkeian territory as a territory that it ought to be unnecessary to have a measure such as influx control in South Africa; that it ought to be unnecessary in South Africa to endorse these people, practically by force, out of the White man&#x2019;s cities and the White man&#x2019;s area in order to compel them to go back to the Transkei. The facts as we see them in South Africa contradict the hon. the Minister. The Natives of the Transkei may be attached to their territory in the same way that I am attached to the Witwatersrand, but they have a greater attachment, a greater need. It is South Africa to which they are attached, and what they need are the benefits that South Africa can offer them. These clauses which have been added to the Bill as an afterthought have nothing to do with the principle of self-government. They were added as an afterthought by the hon. the Minister. This clause does nothing to symbolize the interdependence of the Native and the White man in South Africa for their survival; it deliberately places a stumbling-block in the way. In advancing the arguments which the hon. the Minister does, he contradicts the undeniable facts as they exist in South Africa. His arguments are in conflict with the history and the tradition <span class="col_5319-5320" refersTo="page_1234"/>of the party which the hon. the Minister represents.</p>

<p>It may be their own affair, but why should they make their affair the basis of a policy that must spell disaster for the whole of South Africa? The disaster for which we are heading is not their affair; it is the affair of everybody in South Africa. Sir, the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) who made an interjection a moment ago, has so often proved that this discussion is beyond his comprehension, that I think he should rather remain silent. This clause is in conflict with the whole tradition and attitude of the Nationalist Party as we have learnt to know it over the years. For years we were told by them that two flags and two national anthems were impossible in one country because it gave rise to a dual loyalty. We had to listen to that story for years. Surely it is nonsense for the hon. the Minister to say that the situation to-day is different; that the relationship between the Transkei and South Africa differs from the former relationship between South Africa and Britain. The hon. the Minister expects the Native of the Transkei to regard him as the father of their freedom;, that is his argument; that they will regard him and the Whites as the father of their freedom, and that they will always therefore be very favourably disposed towards the Whites of South Africa. But what does history teach us? In 1928 a Minister of the Interior, who subsequently became a Nationalist Party Prime Minister, stood up in this House on the occasion of the introduction of the Flag Bill and exclaimed that the Union Jack would always fly over South Africa as a symbol of our harmonious relationship with Britain; that Britain was the father of our freedom, just as the Natives will be expected to say that this hon. Minister and the Whites are the father of their freedom. But how long will it be before political and economic conflicts with the Republic destroy that frame of mind and before they regard those symbols as symbols of secession, as symbols of hostility and as symbols of the fact that they are different? The hon. the Minister knows that; the whole of his own political history shouts from the rooftops that this provision is a mistake; that it means the creation of a dual loyalty, which will hasten the building up of discord in the Republic of South Africa. Another thing that I cannot understand in this clause is this: I notice that the flag is to be approved by the Legislative Assembly of the Transkei. Will this Parliament have no say in that regard? I find no reference here to any control by this Parliament over the design of the flag. This is probably one of the matters then in connection with which the Transkei will be able to pass legislation, even if it is in conflict with laws enacted by this Parliament. We know what difficulties the Minister may create for himself. We know, for example, that the Natives of the Transkei were not in favour of a Republic; we all know that. What is the Minister going to do if they design a flag of which the main component is the Union Jack?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, then we are back again before 1960. The Minister shrugs his shoulders; he says that he will accept it. In other words, he wants to give the Transkei privileges which he is not willing to give to 40 per cent of the Whites in South Africa. What is he going to do if the Transkei, while that territory is still an integral part of South Africa, adopts a flag, the design of which includes the hammer and sickle? Are we in the Republic of South Africa prepared to allow the Union Jack to fly again over large areas of our country? Are we prepared to visualize the possibility that the hammer and the sickle may become one of the flags of the Republic? Even the Minister realizes how utterly ridiculous and dangerous this clause is. That is not all. In the half-hour which he devoted to this matter, the Minister based his whole argument on the fact that this is going to be a flag for the Transkeian Territory, but this same Bill provides that this separate flag will also be the flag of the Xhosa-speaking Natives outside of the Transkei, and there are hundreds of thousands of them who will never have any physical ties with the Transkei; I am not talking now about the spiritual ties to which the Minister referred. This flag will not be confined to the Transkeian Territory because the people of the Transkei cannot be confined to that territory. It is a dual flag for the whole of South Africa. I say again that if the Minister tells us that his whole argument is based on the love of the Natives for the Transkei, then he is misjudging the facts because those Natives are not bound to the Transkei. In the matter of their citizenship, according to the Act, they are not bound to the Transkei. Under this measure we have the ridiculous position that people who were born in South Africa will be subjects of another country; that people who will spend their whole lives in the Republic of South Africa cannot even be naturalized in the Republic of South Africa; they will be forced, for the whole of their lives, to be citizens of a country which they do not know at all, and they will have to honour the symbols, the flag and the national anthem of that country. It means that we will have a double set of symbols outside of the Transkei, within the Republic of South Africa. Does the Minister believe that such a thing can be sound? It is a complete rejection of the tradition of the Nationalist Party.</p>

The fact that there used to be a dual citizenship is no justification, as he suggests, for introducing a dual citizenship through the Transkei. Sir, I just want to put three questions to the hon. the Minister: He says that this is something which spontaneously sprang up in the hearts of the population of the Transkei. I should like the hon. the Minister to mention one example to me where the Natives of the Transkei, either in the Bungha or in the Transkei Territorial Authority, before this Bill was drawn up in Pretoria, adopted a motion in which they asked for a national anthem or a flag of their own&#x2014;just one example please.</p>

<p>No, they never had a flag of their own, but the Minister says that this is something that sprang up spontaneously; that it is the desire of every nation to have its own flag. Where did they ask for this before this Bill was conceived in the imagination of the hon. the Prime Minister and of the hon. the Minister? Give me one example where they asked for this. My second question is this: What assurance can the Minister give us that the Pondos and the Tembu&#x2019;s are satisfied with the same flag? What assurance can the Minister give us that in the future the Tembu&#x2019;s and the Pondos will really want one flag, that they will want the same symbol, if we accept, according to the Minister&#x2019;s arguments, that they want to lead a separate existence? Sir, if they want to lead a separate existence from the Whites, then the main tribes of the Transkei would ten times rather lead a separate existence from each other. Where is this going to end? Is this Parliament going to be asked within a few years to pass another six or seven measures of this kind, with six or seven sets of flags and national anthems for the Repubic of South Africa? What sort of country are we creating? I want to conclude on this note: I do not believe that any Prime Minister who was born in South Africa would ever have agreed to accept the responsibility for a policy which will dismember South Africa in this way.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what is so strange in having Xhosa-speaking people in this country who will have a different flag? We have tens of thousands of Southern Rhodesian Blacks here; we have tens of thousands of Bantu from Basutoland here, and they have a different flag. Do we have any trouble with them? Have we any trouble with the Bantu of any of the British Protectorates? Have we any trouble with the Bantu of Mozambique who have a different flag and a different national anthem? Have the Basuto&#x2019;s not got a flag of their own; is their flag at the moment not the Union Jack? The Basuto&#x2019;s in Basutoland have a flag at the moment and that flag is the Union Jack and thousands, tens of thousands, of them work here. Have we any trouble in that connection? The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) says that because large numbers of Xhosas work here we are going to have two flags here. Where does he get that from? They may possibly fly the Basutoland flag on national occasions, but what about it? The Basutos can do so at the moment; the Bantu of any other part of Africa who are here in their tens of thousands can do so at the moment. There is nothing strange about it. The hon. member asks&#x2014;and he pretends to be terribly surprised&#x2014;whether we are going to have the position eventually that there will be six or seven sets of flags and national anthems here. That is quite possible, but what about it? Basutoland is also going to become independent; Swaziland is going to become independent; Bechuanaland is going to become independent; Southern Rhodesia is to become independent, and then we are going to have not six or seven sets of flags and national anthems but 20 sets of flags and national anthems. But that has nothing to do with this Government; that will be the historical development, and the hon. member for Yeoville, whether he likes it or not, will have to put up with it. Mr. Chairman, no debate has ever revealed so clearly as this debate has done the basic difference between ourselves and the Opposition. They imagine that they can maintain the White man&#x2019;s position here by always keeping the Black man in a state of subordination&#x2014;according to them a permanent state of subordination, for internal consumption, and in a state of subordination &#x201C;for the foreseeable future&#x201D; for external consumption. We say that that simply cannot be done. We say that it cannot even be done for the foreseeable future, and that is why we are following this policy. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition suggests that giving them a flag and a national anthem of their own is &#x201C;a deliberate attempt to encourage sovereign independence&#x201D;. Sir, to refuse to give it might possibly have that effect. Why would it encourage sovereign independence? If we withheld it from them, then they might agitate for it, and that is much more likely to encourage sovereign independence than this step is likely to do. I shall tell the Leader of the Opposition what this symbolizes; it is not a symbol to encourage the rapid attainment of sovereign independence; this act of giving a flag and a national anthem to the Transkei is the symbol of the sincerity of this Government towards the Bantu; it is a symbol of what Dr. Verwoerd said at Cradock, and that is that this party is not a deceitful party. It is a symbol of our goodwill towards the <span class="col_5323-5324" refersTo="page_1236"/>Xhosa; it is a symbol of our goodwill towards all the other Bantu in South Africa. I present this as a gift to the Opposition: Let them try to exploit this as much as they like; it will get them nowhere. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that this will encourage a loyalty on the part of the Xhosa to the Transkei. Mr. Chairman, nothing better can happen than that the inhabitants of the Transkei and the Xhosa should develop a strong loyalty towards the Transkei. What is wrong with it?</p>

<p>Is there any reason why there should be a conflict between these two loyalties? We have been living here for many years surrounded by independent countries. The inhabitants of Mozambique owe loyalty to Mozambique. Have they ever come into conflict with us? The inhabitants of Rhodesia owe loyalty to Rhodesia. Have they ever clashed with us? Why should we not be able to co-operate with these people in the Transkei? The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that we should develop as one great entity on the same lines as the European community. Does the existence of the European community derogate from the loyalty of those people? Does it remove the flags of those people? History has taught us that if people have their own flag, their own national anthem and their own loyalty and they wish to build up common interests with others, they co-operate much better when they have those things than they would if those things were broken down. The only possible way in which we and the Bantu can co-exist in this country is on the basis of that loyalty on their part. We are expecting a loyalty from them to-day which it is almost impossible to give. The Opposition want those people to give their loyalty to a system which practically means their everlasting suppression. Who would give his loyalty to such a system? Let the hon. member for Pinelands be honest with himself. His policy amounts to one thing and that is to say to those people that they will forever be in a position of inferiority in South Africa. They want the Xhosa to give their loyalty to a flag, to a symbol, which symbolizes their everlasting inferiority.</p>

Australia has that right; Australia says that no Japanese who lives in Australia has the right to become an Australian. In the same way we have the right to say that no Xhosa will become a citizen of South Africa. Hon. members of the Opposition are prepared to give all these things to the whole world except to the public of South Africa.

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) now puts forward the plea that we should not give the Xhosa in the Transkei the opportunity to have his own flag, but that the Xhosa in the Transkei and every Black man in South Africa should develop a love for the symbol of independence in the Republic, namely our flag. Once he has developed that love and has accepted that symbol of independence, is the hon. member for Hillbrow then prepared to give the Black man a seat in this Parliament? [Interjections.] Then he is not prepared to do so. Every person in the world should have the right to sit in his own parliament and to represent his people. We are prepared to give the Bantu the right to sit in the Transkeian Parliament and to represent his people. In which Parliament does that hon. member want to give him a seat? <span class="col_5327-5328" refersTo="page_1238"/>That is the farcical part of the attitude of the United Party.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to refer to the speech of the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp). I should like to express my astonishment that a man such as he can say it was a great mistake on the part of the Government to give the Xhosas of the Transkei their own flag in terms of Clause 4. He says they never had or knew a flag. He ought to know that the Bantu are receptive to symbolic institutions. Although they have not had a flag, because nobody could design a flag for them, they had symbols, as he himself has rightly admitted, in which they recognized certain colour schemes.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<p>Yes, for their regiments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly, for their regiments, but that was the beginning, the embryo, of what could later be a flag. For instance, they had the symbol of the white ox, the symbol of peace; the red ox, the symbol of war and blood. It is typical of their thinking processes that they associate certain conceptions with symbols. What is more, when he gave a definition of a flag, he told us what a flag means, namely a &#x201C;symbol of nationhood&#x201D;. It is the symbol of national awareness. He said that this is really their great objection to this clause, namely because by establishing a flag, it would bring about and strengthen national awareness. Then he said this: &#x201C;We on this side are concerned about that very thing, because we want to make everything equal; we want to foster national awareness in those people for the whole Republic; we are concerned about the land of our fathers.&#x201D; If now we were to analyse that concern for the lands of the fathers, what does it mean, Mr. Chairman? It means that they are concerned not only about the lands of the White ancestors, but also the lands of the Black ancestors of this country; it means that the Black man should share equally with us the lands of our fathers. That is a most disturbing admission to me. It is the basic difference between their ideas and our ideas. We wish to bring about a national consciousness in the Black man for what has always been the land of his fathers. We wish to retain the other part of the country as the lands of our fathers. We do not wish to share that with them equally. We cannot do that because of the numerical proportion. If we do that, it will mean that they ultimately will also possess the lands of the White fathers and the Whites will go under. I believe the statement of the hon. member for Hillbrow is the best and the clearest admission of the basic difference between the point of view of the United Party and that of the National Party.</p>

<p>He objects to us wanting to make the Xhosa of the Transkei national conscious by the institution of this symbol, and detaching them from our own symbols, wanting to release them from the lands of our fathers, and wanting to anchor them to their own areas, to the real lands of their fathers. He says: &#x201C;Your intentions are in fact our concern; we are concerned that the lands of the fathers will be lost.&#x201D; In other words, he includes the non-Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Xhosas on an equal basis in respect of the testators of the heritage of the fathers. That is the great difference between us and the Opposition. That is why I cannot see in the least how we could accept any amendment in respect of the omission of a clause that is fundamental to the establishment of a future self-governing state such as the Transkei.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) is very right when he says that is the crucial difference between hon. members opposite and ourselves. They say there are lands of their fathers and lands of the fathers of the non-Whites; obviously there must be lands of the Coloureds and lands of the Indians. This side of the House says that the Republic of South Africa is the heritage of all the people living in it.</p>

<p>I do not know whether hon. members opposite are so out of touch with the people that they do not know that as far as it concerns the people of South Africa, &#x201C;Die Stem&#x201D; is sufficient for us. We are not desirous of having another national anthem. I should still like to hear the reason why somebody who earns his bread and butter in this country, someone who is a subject of the country, as the Minister has said, cannot sing &#x201C;Die Stem&#x201D; with me.</p>

<p>Then I return to the flag, Mr. Chairman. The same applies in regard to the flag. If a citizen of the Republic is not satisfied with the Republican flag, he is welcome to go and five in another country, but not in a country that forms part of the Republic.</p>

<p>There is yet another crucial difference between the other side of the House and this side. Early in the debate they argued that this Bill grants partial self-rule. Is there a greater symbol of the independence of a nation than its flag? The hon. the Minister became lyrical about the views of the Bantu, whereas it seems to me that he is completely out of touch with the views of the White people. He became lyrical on the viewpoint of the Bantu in regard to his flag, in regard to his language and in regard to his national anthem. The viewpoint of this side of the <span class="col_5329-5330" refersTo="page_1239"/>House, as regards the flag, is that the flag of the Republic is good enough for everybody. There is no need to have other flags. Least of all it is necessary to establish these symbols of sovereignty to encourage a national group to develop to that state of nationhood to which the hon. the Minister has referred. He said it is necessary firstly to create that nationhood and then thereafter the State. There is no greater encouragement for the independence of a nation than to give them these symbols about which the Minister became lyrical. The Minister even went so far as to quote from the Bible. He said that even if you possess the whole world, and you suffer damage to your soul, it will not profit you. I should like to ask the Minister this: What good is it to give away the whole world and still suffer damage to your soul? I shall quote the Psalmist and say the deeper we try to dig, the more iniquity we shall meet with. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, loyalty to the flag of the Republic is expected not only from the Whites, but also from the Coloured community. Now I ask the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark to explain to us at what stage he is going to get the Coloureds to show loyalty in our country to our flag, and also the Indians, while the Bantu will now be having their own flag? I repeat that as regards this clause it is one of the greatest dangers to us in this legislation that we want to give this symbolism to people who in terms of this legislation will be getting partial self-government, but still form a part of the Republic. that we want to give them the encouragement, the injection, to demand full sovereignty as soon as possible. Because if one gives a community the things that symbolize complete sovereignty, one encourages them to demand full sovereignty. Now I ask whether it is the intention of the Government to encourage these people to obtain full sovereignty in the shortest possible time. Now I should like to ask where in the world it has happened already that a country has given a colour group of a language group within its borders, a separate flag, or an encouragement in that direction while it still has only partial self-government? Where have you ever seen that at that stage he is given the greatest encouragement to clamour for complete independence? It is the view of this side of the House that as regards this clause, it is not only premature and untimely, but it cannot effect anything but evil, and that it creates nationalism among the people at such a speed that they will clamour for sovereign independence long before they are ripe for it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Justice at least realizes that if one refuses to give a person who wants it a flag, one causes bitterness. That is where the United Party makes the mistake.

I recall the flag conflict of 1926-7, and the bitterness it caused in South Africa because the Government and the Government supporters of those days wished to have an own flag for South Africa.

<p>Every club to which hon. members belong&#x2014;all of them are members of clubs&#x2014;has its own symbols and its own flag. They are not sovereign bodies. And hon. members should not forget that this flag does not hang there alone; it will hang there alongside the flag of the Republic. It is a flag for the smaller community within the bigger community. The Republican flag is the flag of the country as a whole. But that does not prevent sub-divisions of the Republic also having their flags, without symbolizing sovereignty. It is there only to satisfy the national sentiment, so that they can say: &#x201C;There is my symbol; I have something I can look at with pride, apart from the greater unity I can look at&#x201D;. You will recall, Sir, that when the Flag Bill was before this Parliament in 1957, the United Party urged that the Union Jack should remain one of the flags, not as the symbol of the Republic of South Africa, but as the symbol of the greater unity of the Commonwealth. That was for them the greater unity, perhaps with less stringent constitutional bonds.</p>

<p>Now they ask what was wrong with that. We were a completely sovereign independent country, and we had no further connection with the Commonwealth, save only lip service. But even there they wanted to have the symbol of foreign country. Here we are concerned with a symbol to be used within a smaller area, in the Transkei, but they will not permit that. They do not wish to give these people a symbol of which they can be proud. And it is not a question of one-sided pride, but it will be hanging there alongside the flag of the Republic symbolizing the greater sovereignty as a whole. I should like to appeal to hon. members to reflect, that if they wish to unleash a conflict in South Africa that will cause bitterness between the Bantu and the White people, they should unleash this conflict and say: &#x201C;we refuse to give the various Bantu areas which came into existence their own symbols.&#x201D; As White people we have waged a grim battle in South Africa on that issue, but we shall cause a greater conflict between White and non-White if we refuse that. If any community with its own sense of pride does not insist upon having its own symbols and its own flag and its own anthem it can sing, it is not worth being a separate community, and we hope the Transkei Bantu are not so weak that they cannot claim that.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister a few questions in connection with this Clause. Before doing so, however, I want to say that I do not think hon. members opposite have grasped the crux of the objection of this side. Obviously when a country becomes sovereign it is fully entitled to its own flag and it would be unreasonable on the part of anybody to deny such a sovereign community their own flag. As the Bill reads at the moment there is clearly a confusion of concepts. The basis of the objection of this side of the House is not a refusal to give a flag to the Transkei when it becomes sovereign but the objection is solely that we are dealing here with an area which will only be self-governing in part, only self-governing in the elementary sense of the word. The question which we consequently put to the hon. the Minister is whether he thinks, in these circumstances, the time and the occasion are opportune to give the symbol of sovereignty to the Transkei. It cannot be argued away that a national flag (I am not talking about a club flag) is a symbol of sovereignty. I am only raising these points to outline the nature of the objection of this side. The objection is not to the Transkei, when it becomes sovereign, having its own flag.</p>

<p>The question which I really want to put to the hon. the Minister is this: It has repeatedly been said that the Transkei has asked for a flag. I do not deny that but I am merely asking for our own edification whether the Minister can tell us who asked for it, how and when that was asked for and who the leading spirits were in that request for a flag of their own.</p>

<p>I should also like to know from the hon. the Minister whether the flag has already been designed, whether he has any idea what form the flag will take. I take it that when you insert a clause such as this in a Bill you have some idea of what is going to happen. One of the reasons why I ask the Minister that is that people are under the impression that because the Transkei is getting a national anthem which was the song of the A.N.C. in this case too the colours of the A.N.C., namely black, green and gold, will perhaps be the colours of the flag&#x2014;black denoting the people, green denoting the land and gold denoting the country&#x2019;s mineral wealth? I am not making a statement in this regard but I am only asking for information. Then I should also like to know from the hon. the Minister whether together with this flag, the idea is that there should also be a coat of arms and a motto and whether any design in that regard has been submitted to him.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member who has just spoken was about the most sensible of the members opposite who have participated in this debate. He took the best line by merely asking questions, for the attacks coming from over there absolutely exposed them; they exposed themselves, their own past, in such a way that the public outside will have to reject them on the attitude they have adopted here.</p>

<p>As we deal with the various clauses, we are indeed repudiating the things about which the Opposition have besmirched us throughout the world, particularly in regards to this clause. We have always been painted as the political party in our country, and the Government, that oppressed the Black man in South Africa <span class="col_5333-5334" refersTo="page_1241"/>and begrudges him the sunshine. And now the hon. gentlemen are disconcerted because they see that the one stage after the after refutes every charge they have made against us in the past. Now they are expecting that we should wait until their own flag is given to those Bantu homelands some day after a conflict has just developed. We say: No, in view of what we ourselves have gone through, and with a view to the future that we should like to meet in a spirit of good neighbourliness, we do not want to wait until our neighbour will have dragged it out of us after a struggle, but we wish to give it to him out of respect for him as a nationality. Hon. members opposite do not wish to allow that because they realize very well that in this way all those charges made by them against us in the past are being exposed to the contempt of the public one after another. If the hon. gentlemen were to do what the hon. member to whom I have referred has done and were merely to ask questions, they would not be exposing themselves so much from the point of view of the debate. The hon. member asked quite innocent questions and he now expects the Minister to reply to them. Let those innocent little questions then take up the time of the debate. If they are of no other use, then it still is useful to teach hon. members things they should have known a long time ago. You will see that when we come to the next clause, it is further positive proof that the Government, and in particular the doctrines of the National Party, are aimed at showing the world that this story of oppression and inhumanity with which we are being charged, has never been true. If you tell a lie in Court, and your lie is subsequently exposed, you are liable to punishment. And although in this case it is not liable to punishment, hon. members over there know beforehand that the public and even the outside world eventually will punish them for the falsehoods they have been spreading about us for so many years.</p>

<p>I am trying to visualize what the position would be in this Bill if the clause were deleted altogether. What would happen then? I should imagine that when they get their form of government and they meet, various proposals will come forward, and in the course of time they will probably amongst themselves, and later in this House, give us a definite proposal of the kind of flag they would like to have. I presume the hon. Minister, in the mood he is in, would be prepared to accept that. But I think this clause is now premature. A flag for a country is not a thing that is evolved on the day they obtain their constitution. It is something that is created over a period, as happened in all the Transvaal Republics, as it has happened in the Union of South Africa, and in the Republic we have today. Therefore I think that if this clause were deleted altogether, nothing would be lost to the Transkei; in the course of time these proposals would come along, and we could be spared all this kind of discussion. I think it is premature and unnecessary, and I think the hon. Minister should exercise patience, if he wishes to bring them to full nationhood.</p>

<p>I should just like to reply briefly to a few small points. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has asked whether the Bunga resolved in the past to have their own Flag. I cannot recall that they ever passed such a resolution, but the fact of the matter is that the Territorial Authority came along unanimously and took such a decision on their own there in the Transkei, and they directed a very earnest appeal to us. It came spontaneously on their part. He asked whether the Tembu and the Pondo would be content to be under one Flag. But the hon. member ought to know that the <span class="col_5335-5336" refersTo="page_1242"/>Tembu, the Pondo and the Gcaleka and others unanimously passed this resolution. A further question by the hon. member was this: What now if the other territories were also to have self-government? Will we then have a number of flags in South Africa? Of course, if they want their own flag, it is the policy of this Government to permit them to have it. I have said that frequently and very clearly. The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) submitted that no Bantu tribe has ever had its own flag. Quite correct. But the hon. member as an historian ought to know that certain Bantu tribes and nations had certain symbols that really took the place of a flag. And he ought to know what a mighty role the Nkata Kazulu played in their lives. That was really a flag in the fullest sense of the term. Unfortunately it was removed and destroyed during the Cetzewayo war, and those things are right up to the present day a holy thing in the life of the entire Zulu nation. I shall never forget how a number of Zulu came to see me a few years ago about a piece of land where that Nkata in question had always been kept, and they made this submission: Unless this land belongs to Zululand the Zulus will not have a soul; if you give this land back to Zululand, it means that you are giving the soul of the Zulu nation back to it. So much value is attached to it by the Zulu nation, and it virtually symbolized a flag.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London City (Dr. Moolman) again submitted that there should be only one flag for the sake of the heritage of our fathers. But then the hon. member should be consistent. It is a matter of principle. If you wish to bind together the love of all your national communities around the same symbol, it only means that you have to give them the same rights and the same equality as that bond of love binding you together to that one symbol. Then hon. members surely cannot come along and say: &#x201C;No, but for the foreseeable future we are not in favour of equality for them&#x201D;. Surely that is immoral when people are bound together by a symbol, and you treat one group in one way, while another group is treated in another way. Surely that is immoral! Surely this is a dangerous proposition that is being propounded here.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout asked a few questions. He said we do not understand the crux of their objection as yet. That is my difficulty with that hon. member, that he is always looking for the crux, but he never seems to find the crux. He is forever searching. For instance, he pointed out how the flag really is the symbol of loyalty.</p>

<p>Sovereignty, and of course loyalty, together with it. But if we were to take the hon. member and he were to bind all his loyalties to a flag, and if we were to put him on a bicycle, then honestly I must say he would look much worse than a Xhosa. Then you will really see flags flying front and rear! No, the hon. member is making a mistake. The crux is that the Bantu of the Transkei have expressed the desire to have their own flag, and in order not to unleash a conflict and because it is their birthright, it was granted and we think it will have a good effect. They are entitled to the symbols that represent their spiritual riches. That is where we recognize the dignity of mankind, not a cheap palsy-walsy game, but by the recognition of their culture and of those rights. That is where we differ from the Opposition. The hon. member asked who asked for it. I have repeatedly said that they unanimously asked for it. The representatives of those people, the members of the Territorial Authority, unanimously asked for it, and not a single Xhosa objected to it. What is more, it is one of the things to which they are looking forward. It grips their imagination. The hon. member asked whether a design has been drafted. As far as I know, no. Of course it is a matter that has to emanate from them. But we are giving them guidance. I have already made them understand that the establishment of a flag is a complicated matter, and that it should conform to the heraldic laws. We shall have to see to it that the flag is submitted to experts in the heraldic art, and that once it has been approved, it will conform to all the laws of heraldry. That is the important guidance we shall be giving them in this respect. The hon. member asks now what the colours are going to be. whether they are going to be the A.N.C. colours, and whether &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika!&#x201D; was the song of the A.N.C. etc. Mr. Chairman, if a baboon were to emerge from the mountain and were to sing &#x2026;</p>

<p>As regards the Flag too, I repeat that, the people have asked for it and we considered it to be in the interests of the whole pattern that they should have it. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has said the time is not ripe for it and the procedure is really wrong. They should first of all bring the flag, and then this Section could be inserted in the Act. The fact of the matter is merely that they asked for the clause to be inserted now because they want to work on that flag in the interim, and we think it is more than right and fair to give effect to that.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>Just a few questions. When the hon. the Minister spoke a moment ago he made certain statements which I did not quite understand. Before coming to those, <span class="col_5337-5338" refersTo="page_1243"/>however, I want to refer to the symbols which he said the Bantu already had and he referred to the Zulu. That is, of course, where his trouble lies. They did not have a flag and he admits that but he says they had certain symbols. That is my main objection to giving a flag to a large number of tribes which differ from one another and whose symbols have been and still are totally different from one another. Just think of the symbol of the Fingos, Sir. It is totally different from the symbols of the Pondo or the Gcaleka or the Tembu because their origin is totally different. The dangers inherent in this, therefore, are far greater than those which beset South Africa when we had to decide on our own flag. I think we shall find that by placing those symbols, symbols which they never knew in the form of a flag, in their hands at this stage already, it will give rise to trouble with dire results to us.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister advanced a series of arguments which I did not understand. He derived the one argument from the saying that the language of the conqueror in the mouth of the conquered is the language of slaves. The hon. the Minister spoke about the flag of the conqueror. In other words, he said that the Bantu regarded the flag of the Whites as the flag of the conqueror and that they would consequently not accept it. I now want to ask him why he still has the dual flag? Why is he still foisting the flag of the White man on to them?</p>

<p>Surely in that case the argument about the language, or the flag, of the conqueror is totally inappropriate?</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also advanced the argument that we should not forget that we were dealing here with an area which formed an integral part of the Republic of South Africa and at the same time he concluded his speech by saying that surely they were entitled to their own state and that their flag would be the symbol of their own state. I should like to know how you can have a state within a state. Why is my hon. friend creating a state within the Republic of South Africa, because he knows that nowhere in the world has it been possible for a state to exist within a state. Just as little is it possible for a state like Basutoland, if ever it becomes a state, to exist within another big state. Just as little will the state which my hon. friend wishes to establish be able to exist within a state of which it forms part. I just wanted to point out that the hon. the Minister contradicted himself when in the one breath he referred to an integral part of the Republic and in the other breath to a separate state.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) has become so confused that he has lost himself. He asks how the various Bantu groups can be governed under one flag, but does he forget what this House looks like? What do the Whites in South Africa look like under one flag? There are various different nations in this country, and we have not yet fought about the flag, except that one group wanted to have a flag while another group did not want it. The hon. member says there is danger involved in it. That is impossible. If you look at the Bantu, as regards his symbols, he stands out above all the nations I know. When his football team runs on to the field, they carry a flag, and they sing their song and they give their war-cry. The Bantu is known for being so attached to his symbols that his entire speech is full of metaphors and symbols that are peculiar to them. I do not think there is a nation that is so attached to what is his own as the Bantu is. The best-dressed Bantu in the White area is so deeply attached to his own principles and what is his own that when he gets back to his hut, he takes off his trousers and dons his kaross. That is proof that he never changes, but adheres to his own customs.</p>

[Interjections.] The hon. member for East London (Dr. Moolman) is in the same boat, if a genuine Englishman were to rise here now, one who has not become an Afrikaner, and he had objected to the flag, I would have put my arm around his shoulder, and given him a little squeeze and said I was sorry he had been hurt. But I cannot sympathize with people who begrudge the Bantu the thing no man on earth wants to live without. There is no nation that wants to live without its own symbols, and here the hon. members who wish to win the friendship of the Bantu come along and they are out to deprive him of his symbols, and a great historian over there in the front bench, the hon. member for Hillbrow, who ought to know the sentiments of a human being, Black or White, agrees with that. I think it is shameful that a lot of privileged people want to deprive an unprivileged group of the things the Government wishes to give them in order to do justice to them. I think it is the greatest injustice that they want to take away the flag, the symbol of the Bantu.</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>This is one of the shortest clauses in the Bill. In contrast to the one we have just passed, where provision is made for two flags, provision is made in this clause for only &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; to be the national anthem of the Transkei. Provision is made in the previous clause for a flag which will hang alongside the flag of the Republic, but provision is made here for only one national anthem. When you consider the trend of this debate I find that peculiar, because this legislation has been explained to us in different ways. The hon. member for Standerton said it meant that a governmental mechanism was being created. Another member spoke about an embryo state and said it would be under the guidance of the Central Government. The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) spoke about two concepts and said it meant that we were giving maximum or minimum self-government.</p>

<p>All those things created the impression that there was no need for a national anthem and that this clause was entirely redundant judging from what happened on a previous occasion when the question of a flag and a national anthem was discussed in 1957, and when a former Prime Minister said the following in that connection: Particularly in time of distress or in times of celebration, or of great joy, few things instill in a nation such a feeling of unity and love for its fatherland than to see its own country&#x2019;s flag and to listen to its own country&#x2019;s national anthem.</p>

<p>My difficulty is this, that if we are not establishing an independent state here why the necessity for a national anthem? That is, however, not my only difficulty. The Minister said that if a monkey jumped from a tree he shouted &#x201C;b&#x00F4;gom&#x201D;, but this is a case where there are many monkeys shouting &#x201C;b&#x00F4;gom&#x201D; and this &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; is a song which is sung by many nations in South Africa and which is generally known in different parts of Africa.</p>

<p>I found it very difficult to accept at the second reading that we were providing for this song to be the national anthem without including the words. That is the difficulty which I have with various clauses of this Bill. Surely it can be expected that the words of this song should be included in this Act, just as it was argued in respect of the previous clause that the design of the flag should be incorporated in this legislation. Where the hon. the Minister has remained silent on this song, and where we know that it is sung all over, not only in the Transkei, but in Zululand and in the Transvaal <span class="col_5341-5342" refersTo="page_1245"/>and in Rhodesia and Kenya, wherever there are Ndebele or their descendants throughout the whole of Africa, I cannot understand why it is necessary, because one thing is as clear as a pikestaff to me, and it is this that what we are doing here is to arouse a nationalism, a Pan-Africanism. The Minister cannot tell me, as he has done, that the Transkei want a symbol of their own. This national anthem is not something peculiar to the Transkei, it is peculiar to everybody in Africa south of the Equator. [Interjections.] Hon. members treat this as a joke, but I do not think it is a joke to arouse something which we already know is fatal to the White man in Africa. We are providing here for one national anthem and hon. members opposite can no longer advance the argument that it will remain a part of the Republic, because the national anthem of the Republic does not come into the picture here. It is only one national anthem. It is the thin edge of the wedge. This is clearly the beginning of the process of a breakaway from the rest of South Africa. I said on a previous occasion, and I want to repeat it, that I think this Bill has been drafted without proper consultation. I am not saying that the Transkei did not ask for this national anthem. I admit that they perhaps asked for it, but I want to say to the Minister that more tribes will ask for this song and that will arouse nationalism in South Africa which we have never known before, and that we are paving the way for Pan-Africanism to arouse a feeling of nationalism here in South Africa which can only be of great danger to this country.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) says that &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; must inevitably be dangerous to the White man in South Africa. Why do hon. members opposite regard everything that is peculiar to the Bantu as a danger to the White man? They apparently want to deprive the Bantu of everything that is his own and then they think he will no longer be a danger to the White man. They want to continue to Westernize and to liberalize them, and having deprived them of everything that is their own think that the small number of rebellious Natives who are the agitators in the country represent the Bantu.</p>

<p>I wish to return, however, to this clause which provides that &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; will be the national anthem of the Transkei. Hamel, who was the secretary of the Republic of the Orange Free State at the time, tells us in his diary how the national anthem of the Free State was born. He says that on 23 February 1866 the Free State Parliament decided to accept as the national anthem the anthem which we know to-day as the national anthem of the Free State. They, however, did not only have the words before them but the music as well. Parliament refused to accept the motion until it had heard the music as well. A mixed choir of men and women then appeared before Parliament; they sang the national anthem and thereupon the Free State Parliament accepted it. How can I be expected to vote for this Clause without having heard the music of this national anthem? I want to ask you in all seriousness, Mr. Chairman, whether you will agree to the hon. member for Drakensberg singing this song to us so that we can decide whether this is a suitable song which we are being asked to accept as the national anthem of the Transkei. I am sure after they have sung it she will no longer be known as the Member of Parliament for Danskraal but as the Nightingale of Parliament.</p>

The hon. member for Vereeniging missed the whole point of the speech of the hon. member for Drakensberg, so I want to make it quite clear. We are going to vote against this clause because this clause abolishes the South African National Anthem as the anthem of the Transkei. We take the same line in regard to the anthem that we took with regard to the language question when that side of the House wished to abolish English and Afrikaans as official languages of the Transkei. We are opposed to this clause; it is another symbol of sovereignty because we are denying the use of our national anthem in that area.</p>

It is only a fact that certain African National Congress leaders wanted to appropriate the song and tried to introduce it into Rhodesia and elsewhere.

<p>Let me give an example. The hon. member knows or ought to know that the Tswana, for example, have their own national anthem and that they are proud of their national anthem. Many of them will only sing &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; out of respect for the Xhosa but they will not sing it as their national anthem. Another objection of the hon. member for Drakensberg is that we are creating a feeling of Pan-African nationalism here. No, the opposite is true. Men who have made a study of these matters subscribe to the point of view that the best counter-measure to Pan-Africanism is nationalism&#x2014;the preservation of that which is a nation&#x2019;s own. What the hon. member read about what a former Prime Minister had said about a national anthem is true but it is also true in respect of the Bantu in the Transkei. A national anthem of their own will only assist in developing a national pride amongst them because the danger which threatens Africa is that certain elements are doing away with the national barriers and introducing a process of equality, in other words, the Creator was a great proletariat. If you create a national pride in any group, the most noble characteristics of that group come to the fore. We ourselves have experienced that. This happened in the case of our athletes, for example, when they went to the Olympic Games. As the athletes came marching out the first day the national anthem of the country concerned is sung by its athletes. When our athletes came marching out, however, they did not have a national anthem to sing and that was the time when &#x201C;Die Stem van South-Afrika&#x201D; really became the national anthem of South Africa. That happened at the first Olympic Games but what was the reaction when our athletes sang &#x201C;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&#x201D; for the first time? What was the reaction not only in the hearts of the South Africans but on the part of the whole world? It made better people of those South Africans; they carried the name of South Africa high. Few things inspire you more to carry the name of your country high, to honour and to develop your cultural wealth than a national anthem. You will allow me, Mr. Chairman, to give an example. A certain Tswana tribe is in the habit of singing their national anthem in season and out of season. In the course of time that national anthem has inspired them to such an extent that it has become an unwritten law amongst that Tswana tribe that a member of the tribe must never make himself guilty of any crime in the White area and if he does he naturally gets punished for it in the White area but when he returns to his own area he is again punished and much more severely. It was an inspiration to me to see how the national anthem of the Tswana tribe has bound them together and that they have developed a pride which is not a danger to South Africa but which should really act as a spur to South Africa. That is why I am convinced that, also as far as this matter is concerned, we are on the right road because this song is the song of the Xhosas. They have first claim to that song. Except for the first verse it was written by a Xhosa. Not one of the other national groups contest their claim to this song. The recognition of this national anthem can assist not only in enriching the culture of South Africa but in enhancing the status of the Bantu in the Transkei in the eyes of other national groups.</p>

<p>I shall appreciate it, Sir, if you will not allow that joke to be made again. The whole argument of the hon. the Minister was that when the South African athletes could sing our own National Anthem at the Olympic Games it made an impression, not only on the South Africans, but on the whole world. Mr. Chairman, what is the National Anthem of South Africa? It is &#x201C;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&#x201D;. What is this song? It is the National Anthem of the whole of Africa, not only of the Transkei. It is not &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Transkei&#x201D;, no matter what interpretation the hon. the Minister may place on it. I noticed that the hon. the Minister did not try to refute what I said during the second-reading debate in connection with this Bill. He did not try to refute my interpretation of the verses. He admitted that the first verse was written by a Zulu, and he said that the remaining seven were written by a Xhosa. He says that the Xhosa have now claimed it for themselves. But this song is called &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; not &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i South Africa&#x201D; or &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Transkei&#x201D;. The hon. the Minister argued that, in order to prevent barriers from being broken down, you have to develop a national pride amongst national groups. What he is doing here is to develop a national pride amongst a large group of people, a national pride in Africa, not in the Transkei, because we are dealing here, not with a national anthem for the Transkei, this is a song which applies to Africa. Mr. Chairman, I am not going to read the translation of this song; I have already done so. Somebody <span class="col_5345-5346" refersTo="page_1247"/>wrote in the <i>Burger</i> and said my translation was wrong. He said, for example&#x2014;</p>

<p>How can the hon. the Minister say he has refuted what I said when the title of this national anthem is &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; and not &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Transkei&#x201D; or &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i South Africa Our National Anthem says clearly that it is &#x201C;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&#x201D;. We are now doing away with &#x201C;Die Stem van SouthAfrika&#x201D; in the Transkei, and the hon. the Minister was careful not to refer to that. We are doing away with &#x201C;Die Stem van SuidAfrika&#x201D; and we are replacing it with &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D;. We are doing away with those barriers to which the hon. the Minister has referred. He said it was important to develop a national pride amongst a national group so as to prevent the barriers from being removed. What we are doing here is to break down those barriers; we are giving the Transkei the song of the A.N.C. and the P.A.C., a song which refers to Africa. The hon. the Minister alleged that the song was not sung throughout South Africa. There are members here who have been mayors and councillors of various towns; there are members here who have been provincial councillors. I. for example, am also a former member of a provincial council, and I have visited Native schools throughout Natal and the Transvaal where they sing it. There are members here who have even heard that song sung in schools in Rhodesia. The hon. the Minister, however, says this song is not sung throughout Southern Africa south of the Equator, but there are members here who can testify that that is, indeed, the position. The hon. the Minister says that the P.A.C. and the A.N.C. wanted to accept it as their national anthem, but that it turned out to be a fiasco. Mr. Chairman, it was not a fiasco. It is the one tune which every Black man south of the Equator knows. When he sings that tune he puts his whole heart and soul into it. The hon. the Minister has probably often beard this song sung, in spite of what he says here. He has heard it sung in the Transvaal, in Natal and in the Transkei and throughout South Africa, if he did not hear it beyond the borders of South Africa. He must realize that it is an inspiring tune, so much so that you cannot ignore it. It is such an inspiring tune that you fall under its spell whether you are a White man or a Black man. That is now being laid down as the national anthem of the Transkei. The hon. member made a stupid speech and said how wonderful it was for any race or tribe to have a national anthem of its own. He said that was the way in which to prevent barriers from being broken down. My argument is that that is the very way in which to break down barriers. It practically amounts to this: that we are saying to the Bantu: Your ambition should not be only to remain in the Transkei; your ambition should be to follow this song wherever it is sung and to break down the barriers in between.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to put this to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) that her argument has no significance at all; it is neither here nor there. She refers to the fact that ex-mayors of cities such as Pretoria and Johannesburg heard this national anthem being sung. That obviously is in consequence of the fact that there are large numbers of Xhosa and Zulu who are employed in the industrial areas, and accordingly have children at school. The fact that they sing the song is therefore quite natural. The fact that it is now laid down in this clause that &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; shall be the Transkeian national anthem will debar the other states that are established in our own country, and possibly also outside our country, from the right to use it, for this Act now provides that it shall be the national anthem of a particular unit, a particular state-to-be. It could have the effect that other states or future states may not adopt it as their national anthem. The Transkei Government may refuse to have their national anthem claimed as their own by others. Surely that is very clear. The hon. member says it is a song this that moves Whites and non-Whites all over the whole of Africa. I should like to know from her now whether she has an antidote to a song that has been born so spontaneously from the soul of the Black man; whether she could smother such a song within the borders of the Transkei. Is she suggesting that it is a good reason why the Minister and the Government should deprive the Xhosa of a song that has taken root so deeply in the soul of the Xhosa, and say to them &#x201C;We do not grant you that&#x201D;? Her very admission that that song sends a thrill through the body of the Black man is proof that we are doing the right thing by now choosing that song for the first future state as its future national anthem, and as the symbol of their national awareness. Mr. Chairman, I do not have particular knowledge of the Xhosa language, but because there has already been so much discussion here about the meaning of this song, I am going to give the House a rough translation of it. &#x201C;&#x2019;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D; means &#x201C;Lord, bless Africa&#x201D;. The hon. member for Drakensberg says because the first line contains the word &#x201C;Africa&#x201D; it is Africa inclusive, from Egypt and from Nigeria to here in South Africa. Surely that is nonsense. Those northern countries will not accept it as their national anthem. We, the Whites in South Africa, quite rightly claim that we can talk about our African soil, African language and other African symbols, and by that we do not mean that we include the whole of Africa. The word, when used in a certain sense, can surely also have a restrictive meaning. Why should it <span class="col_5347-5348" refersTo="page_1248"/>include the whole of Africa only in this song? &#x201C;Maluphaken ise upondo lwayo&#x201D; means &#x201C;may his horn become higher&#x201D;. That has a symbolic meaning. It is a prayer that the status of the nation for whom the song has been written shall be increased. That also is the Biblical meaning. In the Bible too you read about a horn that will become higher e.g. in Ps. 112. That is the correct meaning, and that is the meaning it will have for the Xhosa nation, and surely not necessarily for all the Black nations of Africa. Then the song continues &#x201C;yiva imithandazo yethu&#x201D; (listen to our prayers). Then follows &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel&#x201D; (Lord Bless). The next lines read &#x201C;yisa moya, yisa moya! Yisa moya oyincwele Nkosi Sikelel&#x2019; tina lusapho lwayo&#x201D; and that means &#x201C;come Spirit, come Spirit&#x201D;, &#x201C;come Spirit that is holy; Lord bless our children&#x201D; or &#x201C;we the generation that also belong to you, to God&#x201D;. It is a fitting national anthem and in this Bill we have the opportunity to be ahead of all other states or future states, and to secure this touching national anthem, which is a prayer, for the Transkei. I can see no danger in it. In fact, we are merely giving the Transkeian government in so far as it will be constituted now, the opportunity to prevent other states or future states also claiming this as their national anthem. Other states could otherwise possibly adopt it as a Pan-African national anthem. Now it does not become a Pan-African national anthem, but only the Transkeian National anthem. So the underlying aim of the insertion of this clause in the Constitution is very clear and understandable.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) has used an argument that has convinced me that it will be better if the Committee does not accept the clause. But before I go into that, I should like to say that I do not feel quite satisfied with the reply the Minister has given me to a previous question, also in connection with the matter. I asked him whether and when there had been requests for a flag and a national anthem. I quite appreciate that the draft constitution as we have it here before us, has been approved by the Transkeian Council, but I should like to know whether before that time there was a spontaneous indication that they would like to have a national anthem of their own. Have any resolutions to that effect been taken which the hon. the Minister could quote us? I am asking that purely to get information. I wish to know whether there were indications of the desire to have a national anthem, and that it should be &#x201C;N&#x2019;kosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D;. I think the hon. the Minister is wrong on one specific point, and that is where he says that it is not a national anthem. So far as I know the A.N.C., which is a very widespread organization in South Africa, actually always had two songs they sang at their meetings. The one was called &#x201C;Jan van Riebeeck has stolen our freedom&#x201D;. I hope none of the other Bantu states will get it into their heads to adopt that song as their national anthem. But the other one that was always sung was &#x201C;Nkosi Sikelel &#x2019;i Afrika&#x201D;. I do not deny that it is a mighty song; it is a moving song and I think it satisfies the requirements of a national anthem. Its inspiration probably is on the same level as the Marseilles. But the hon. member for Marico has now used the argument that for the very reason that it is such a mighty, wide-spread, moving song&#x2014;I may tell the hon. the Minister that I have heard it sung in Bantu schools in South West Africa; the song is much wider than a national anthem&#x2014; the argument has been used by the hon. member for Marico that here there is an attempt to restrict a national song to the Transkei &#x2026;</p>

<p>I think it is a pity he made that statement. He now gives the impression that that side regards this thing as a song that you should rather try to restrict, and this definitely then is an attempt to restrict it to the Transkei. Mr. Chairman, we have now passed several clauses here. I have asked the hon. the Minister a question about a capital, and he rightly stated that the Transkei may decide upon that. We have approved a clause that gives the Transkei the right to decide upon its own flag. This White Parliament is not going to foist it upon them. Now, in the light of the argument used by that hon. member, does the hon. the Minister not think it will be much better to amend the clause in such a way as to give the Transkei the right to decide upon its own national anthem so that it will then come from the Transkei &#x2026;</p>

<p>I merely wish to explain that it has never been our intention to attempt to do by means of this Bill what the hon. member suggests. I have said, with reference to the statement of the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) that if it is such a wonderful song and it is so moving that it is the song of the whole of Africa, then it follows logically that if then the Government were to make this striking song about which she became so lyrical the national anthem of the Transkei by means of this Bill, it will also have an exclusionary effect, because now other States may not in future claim the official national anthem of the Transkei as their own. It is not an attempt, but a positive step. That is what I meant.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) that it has long since been customary for the Xhosa of the Transkei to sing this song on important public occasions, particularly festive occasions. It is really something which has grown from amongst themselves. This was one of the important things raised at the first meeting of the Recess Committee. Thereafter it was accepted with <span class="col_5349-5350" refersTo="page_1249"/>acclamation by the Territorial Authority. It does not, therefore, emanate from a White Parliament; it emanates from the Bantu themselves. There is no doubt about that.</p>

<p>I just want to point out to the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) that I reacted to her interpretation of the national anthem during the second reading debate. I dealt thoroughly with the matter on that occasion and said what it really was. I can only say this that the Bantu who wrote the first verse, Enoch Satonga, gave a wonderful description of the feeling which inspired him to write this song. He said it was a deep yearning for the Transkei which inspired him to write this song. I admit that this song is sung in many schools in many parts of Africa. I have heard it myself. What I say is this: On public occasions in Africa&#x00B7;&#x2014;I am not talking about agitator meetings&#x2014;they do not sing this sons. Because it is sung in schools it cannot be maintained that it is the song of the whole of Africa. When I visited East Africa and other places I found it very remarkable that the one song which was sung at practically every school was Sweet Susan. Does the hon. member maintain that because they sing Sweet Susan in schools it is really the national anthem of Africa? You cannot say that. A national anthem comes spontaneously. Take Die Stem van Suid Afrika as an example. More and more people are to-day spontaneously singing Die Stem. I have even heard Die Stem sung in one of the big Bantu schools in Rhodesia. Your yardstick is whether it is sung spontaneously on festive occasions by the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has told us time and again in regard to various things which are granted in this Bill that the Bantu have asked for it.

Bill No. 17 of 1963. it is clearly stated in Clause 6, the language clause&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That subject to the provisions of this Act, Xhosa shall be the official language of the Transkei &#x2026;</block>

<p>We now have a clause which provides that it shall be an additional official language of the Transkei. I should like to hear from the hon. the Minister whether in fact that was asked for. I have a firm belief that the Government made this vital change entirely off their own bat and without any reference to the Transkei. I want to know from the Minister whether the Transkei has agreed to this change? I believe that the whole principle of Government policy is that language rights should be linked with the homeland. Consequently it would be consistent to have Xhosa as the official language, just as their national anthem is the national anthem of the Transkei. I suggest that this represents a complete somersault within the space of a fortnight in Government policy. I hope very much the hon. the Minister would be good enough to shed some light upon this for us.</p>

That is the desire of a large section of the people. At the same time they always felt that the other two official languages should also be recognized. It was practically generally accepted that the one important thing was to recognize the language of the area. Everyone was quite convinced that the Bantu would not object to changing it the way it was changed by both Houses of Parliament. I did not therefore think <span class="col_5351-5352" refersTo="page_1250"/>it necessary to delay the proceedings, to call a meeting of the Territorial Authority and to consult them. They also want the other two official languages for many other purposes. We are only giving effect, therefore, to the desire of a great section of those people. I can only say that even the legal advisers have brought this matter to my notice. There is no difficulty, therefore, in connection with this matter.</p>

I want to point out that even in this very Bill, as it stands now, it talks about &#x201C;Flag, Anthem and Official Language&#x201D; in Part II. It does not talk about official languages. I want to know how that can be, because I suggest that that is probably a left-over, a relic from the first Bill in which Xhosa was the sole official language.

<p>On Clause 7,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>The factors and principle underlying Clause 7 are the same as those underlying the previous Clauses Nos. 4, 5 and 6. I think, however, that this clause goes much further than the others because citizenship is pre-eminently the symbol of autonomy, of sovereignty of independence or of the status of a state. An ordinary province, for example, has not got the status of having a citizenship of its own. The inhabitants of a province are citizens of the Republic of South Africa. That is why I say it goes further. This separate citizenship which is being conferred upon the Bantu of the Transkei carries with it, as the clause says: &#x201C;all the other rights, privileges and benefits and be subject to all the duties, obligations and responsibilities of citizenship in the Transkei.&#x201D; In other words, not only has he to shoulder those obligations and may he enjoy those privileges in the Transkei because in a later clause it is provided that he still remains a citizen of the Republic of South Africa. In other words all those obligations and privileges which he will in future enjoy in the Transkei he retains in the Republic. The Republic will, for example, protect him if he finds himself in another country and requires protection. In that case the Republic will look after his rights and privileges and give him the protection which a citizen of any state enjoys when he finds himself in another state. In other words, not only does he retain the rights of citizenship which he presently enjoys in the Republic but citizenship rights are also conferred upon him in another state, his own. He is therefore entitled to a dual citizenship, that dual citizenship about which we have quarrelled so much in South Africa. My hon. friends are once again introducing that principle in South Africa. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) will remember what a great fuss he himself made about the dual citizenship we had at the time. As the hon. the Minister knows it even led to internal friction between the races in South Africa. These citizenship rights are in spirit and in reality the basis of the sovereignty and independence of any country. One would expect to be a citizen only of a state which was independent. Where we spoke of an &#x201C;area&#x201D; in Clause 1 yesterday we were therefore using the wrong word.</p>

<p>What I want to say is this: The fact that we are conferring citizenship on the inhabitants of the Transkei means that we are giving them more than self-government. We are giving them more than self-government as we know it in South Africa. We are giving them greater powers; we are giving them a higher status than the status we give to an ordinary area which enjoys self-government. What I find peculiar is this: By conferring these citizenship rights on the inhabitants of the Transkei we are not only giving them greater power but we are also giving them a higher status than we give to the provinces; greater powers and a higher status than we give to the inhabitants of South West Africa for example. It therefore goes beyond the concept of self-government. The concept in this clause is very much closer to that of a sovereign state. Has anything in the history of South Africa or of the world contributed more to a feeling of independence, to a feeling of autonomy, to the feeling of sovereignty than citizenship? Viewed in this light I think we can ask ourselves, seeing that these Transkei Bantu are going to have their own citizenship, whether they will not now gain admission to UNO. Will UNO not regard the fact that they have their own citizenship as a right on their part to have direct access to UNO in order to submit their complaints, if any, to UNO? Before I say anything further <span class="col_5353-5354" refersTo="page_1251"/>about this matter, I shall be grateful if the hon. the Minister would first reply.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has referred to dual citizenship. I am rising to clear up the confusion which exists in his mind in regard to that concept. It is not a question of dual citizenship in the sense in which he uses it. In the sense in which he talks about dual citizenship he means two citizenships in terms of international law or national law. In other words, you are a citizen of two states both of which have international status. He referred to the former position where we were citizens of two states but when that question arose we already had international status. South Africa and the other dominions had international status conferred upon them at the Treaty of Versailles because separate states were already recognized in that Treaty. At that time we only had British citizenship and we gradually developed until we obtained our own citizenship because we had been recognized internationally. We should rather talk about nationality when we deal with international law. We are not dealing here with nationality. We are only dealing with citizenship and that has to do with constitutional law. It is a constitutional concept. According to constitutional law you can confer citizenship upon a person for various purposes. In terms of constitutional law you can confer citizenship upon him to vote for a city council or a provincial council, for example. That is the constitutional concept of citizenship as against the international concept of nationality. The hon. member must not confuse these two concepts. If you look at sub-section (3) you will see that that is very clearly stated there. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Republic shall not regard a citizen of the Transkei as an alien in the Republic and shall by virtue of his citizenship of a territory forming part of the Republic of South Africa regard him, for all external purposes in terms of international law as a citizen of the Republic and afford him full protection according to international law.</block>

<p>He therefore retains his nationality according to international law under our law, but citizenship is conferred upon him to vote for governmental bodies within the Republic and the Transkei in particular. I just want to clear up this confusion because I know it will greatly facilitate the discussions if we do not confuse these two concepts.</p>

<p>I can quote many decisions by the International Court to him. In the case of international law you can only talk about &#x201C;nationality&#x201D; when that state is sovereign as well. Let me give another example. The inhabitants of British Bechuanaland are not British subjects; for the purposes of international law they are regarded as British protected citizens but they are not British citizens. Because they are not sovereign they have no nationality but for constitutional purposes they are indeed citizens of Bechuanaland and they can vote for governmental bodies. That is the position in many other areas. You have South West Africa; the position there is the same. You do not have the international status of international law but you are a citizen in terms of the constitutional concept. We must make a clear distinction between these two concepts.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Heilbron that the attitude of this side of the House in regard to dual citizenship can easily be explained. Persons in the Transkei under our citizenship laws are South African citizens. Under this law they are declared to be citizens of the Transkei. It is quite true that there may be certain limitations and that there are other provisions that deal with the matter, but in the simple mind of the Xhosa people I think it is inevitable that there will arise the implication in their mind that they are citizens of South Africa to an extent that their principal loyalty lies to the Transkei. In other words, this is something which will create tremendous confusion for the future. We must remember that not only is it intended that there will be one sub-body under a constitution of this sort, but there will be a number, and according to previous statements by the hon. the Minister there will be probably eight or seven of these areas. At that time we will have brought about this situation that persons who at the present time owe loyalty to one State, South Africa, and who in terms of our own laws are citizens of South Africa, and of no other country in the world, will have been given an additional dual citizenship. It is no good the hon. member for Heilbron trying to tell us that it is not so. They are not given citizenship in the fullest sense, but this Bill says in the clearest terms that they shall be citizens in the Transkei, and our citizenship law says equally clearly that they shall be citizens of South Africa. A situation of this sort, naturally. Sir. is one that leads to a divided loyalty, which leads to confusion, even if at this stage it might have no implications in the international field. But I would like to warn the hon. Minister that he is going to create confusion in the international field if he proceeds with legislation of this sort and uses terms such as these, even if it is to give a citizenship which is at this stage of a limited character. Because the hon. Minister will be the first to admit that the intention is that as time goes on these persons will gradually take over into their Transkeian citizenship all the elements of citizenship, and that at a certain stage, which the hon. the Minister and the Prime Minister referred, as the stage when these are separate territories, they will have one citizenship, viz. the citizenship of the Transkei. The complications which can arise during this process can be endless. This Government is recklessly throwing away the loyalty of the people of the Transkei to the South African State, by deliberately introducing an element which can only confuse that issue, and something which holds great danger for the future of this country. I do wish that instead of the hon. member for Heilbron trying to bring forward a technical argument on this subject, he would look at what just citizenship <span class="col_5355-5356" refersTo="page_1252"/>means in the lives of the people. It is the soul of the people, and great dangers are being introduced by dividing loyalty as this clause clearly divides the loyalty of the people of the Transkei. We should be seeking to keeping loyalty to one State in South Africa, in the interest of our children. This Government is recklessly introducing complications, the eventual results of which no man can foresee.</p>

Does the hon. member deny that it is the object of the Government to allow the citizens of the Transkei to develop gradually, as has been said over and over again by that side of the House, until they may eventually develop into an independent state and when that happens does it not mean that their South African citizenship will disappear and that they will be citizens of the Transkei?</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>We are not dealing here at all with the objects of the Government. We are dealing here with the specific provision and it very clearly says that when an inhabitant of the Transkei who is a citizen there for international purposes needs protection&#x2014;if he wants to so overseas, for example, he needs a passport&#x2014;he obviously goes overseas in terms of Clause 3 as a citizen enjoying the protection of the Republic of South Africa and not otherwise. Or do hon. gentlemen contradict the very thing against which they objected at the second reading, namely, that we were creating a position where there will be citizens who will have their own channels whereby to approach UNO? They cannot do that here. Here they have to go through the channels available to them as protected citizens of the Republic of South Africa. The position is not as hon. members kept on saying during the second reading debate, namely, that we were now creating an opening and a channel whereby they could go to UNO and that they could even conclude other international agreements. If we do not have this provision what hon. members said at the second reading would be true. But this provision does away with the objections which they raised <i>ad nauseam</i> during the second reading debate.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>I consider that Clause &#x201C;7&#x201D; is one of the most important in the Bill. When we were dealing with Clause 1, members on the Government side tried to tell us how this territory was going to be governed. Now they are trying to interpret what type of citizenship is going to be given to the inhabitants of the Transkei. According to the hon. member for Heilbron, the position would be this: the new citizenship will convey franchise rights on those Bantu resident in the Transkei, and with certain qualifications, will also convey citizenship to Bantu living within the Republic. In other words, all Transkeian Bantu, whether resident in the Transkei or out, will enjoy citizenship rights within the Transkei. They will have the advantage that they will have citizenship of the Republic as well, but according to the hon. member for Heilbron and other members it will be for external purposes only. The citizenship of the Transkei will give them franchise rights only.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister in his speech also referred to this and said that this citizenship conveyed to the citizens of the Transkei will not be recognised internationalty. We know that that is just not so. One can imagine that the day will dawn when the Transkei will be proclaimed as a self-governing country, the flag will be raised, they will sing their &#x201C;National Anthem&#x201D; (I don&#x2019;t know what words they will use), &#x201C;what is going to be the position then? Do you think the countries overseas are not going to recognise this particular country? Do you think the African-Asian group is just going to sit by? What is going to be the position of this Government when they get recognition internationally as a separate country? This Government is trying to give a second-class citizenship to these people which means nothing but internationally the Transkei with the symbols contained in this Bill, their flag, their anthem, will be recognised internationally, whether our Government likes it or not. I would like to hear the hon. Minister on that. I can go further. The future Prime Minister of the Transkei when he was interviewed&#x2014;and I find this in Fact Paper 102&#x2014;when asked &#x201C;whether in the event of an independent Transkei having a seat on the United Nations Organization, would his country&#x2019;s sympathies be with Afro-Asian countries&#x201D;, declared: &#x201C;We cannot be bound to people tied to Moscow.&#x201D; So at the back of his mind he looks forward to the day when the Transkei is a separate independent country with its citizenship recognized internationally. Asked about his views on Pan-Africanism, Chief Matanzima said that the Black states should not come together artificially. &#x201C;We must develop ourselves at home first. After we have built up our own community. we can go and announce ourselves proudly, not with cap in hand asking for help. In the thoughts of these residents of the Transkei this will be a completely sovereign independent state.</p>

<p>You cannot help Sir, but think of a few incidents in the history of South Africa when you listen to the <span class="col_5357-5358" refersTo="page_1253"/>discussion on the Clauses of this Bill. As I understand the position citizenship as such is valueless when it comes to overseas relationships, unless the area concerned is sovereign as far as its external affairs are concerned and this Bill specifically provides that the legislative assembly of the Transkei shall not control external affairs without a specific law being passed by this Parliament. I do not know why hon. members are worried about that aspect. What does surprise me is that of all people the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) should object in principle to dual citizenship, no matter in whose case. Because I remember how he and other members on that side of the House pleaded for dual citizenship in 1949. When we were dealing with the Citizenship Act in this House he fought for dual citizenship. In 1927 his party in the first instance fought against a dual citizenship because it would have conferred a semi-citizenship upon us.</p>

<p>This Bill provides for citizenship as defined here for one purpose and it means in practice that you are defining who will have the franchise in the Transkei. That is the practical effect in spite of the pretty constitutional stories we are old, and the only thing that should be placed alongside it is its spiritual value and in that regard we are giving them that which the hon. member for Germiston (District) claims for himself to-day, something which he did not claim for himself in 1949, namely, a soul.</p>

<p>In the first place I just want to say to the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) that this is, of course, a complicated matter fraught with complicated legal aspects. In this case you have to take national law and constitutional law into account. These things are interwoven. It is not quite fair, therefore, to make general statements in connection with this matter. You first of all have to take into account those facts which are to-day recognized in the world before you make general statements. What I want to say is this: that one of the interesting things which has developed during the past decade in the world has developed in this very connection, namely, the process of liberation which has been going on in recent times.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Wait a minute. As a result of that process of liberation throughout the world a new outlook has developed in respect of this matter and if hon. members had just taken that into account they would not have made many of the statements which they did make. This applies particularly to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker).</p>

<p>In connection with this matter we should make two distinctions in particular. In the first place there is the question of citizenship. That is a question that relates more in particular to the internal aspect of the matter. In international law it is known as municipal law. The hon. member knows that the term &#x201C;municipal law&#x201D; is used not in the narrow sense of the word. Secondly, of course, we have &#x201C;nationality&#x201D; and that relates to external matters in this connection; that views the matter more in the light of your international law. We must therefore make a distinction. Fortunately we have developed so far in this respect to-day that it is recognized in the world to-day, and in this regard I think we are more or less keeping pace with modern world opinion and concepts and development, namely, that you can have internal citizenship but that you can have &#x201C;nationality&#x201D; at the same time. That is recognized even in America. If you study the 1952 Act, Sir, you will find that that is recognized, and that it is recognized in all the South American States and throughout the whole world. The International Court has given a number of judgments in this respect so that as far as this matter is concerned there is not the slightest measure of doubt in the world, and one of the interesting things is just this, that we are paving the way here for a nation to develop to ultimate independence without doing any harm to the country itself. That is also how the world looks at it to-day. That is why I say we are keeping pace with world opinion to-day where we are giving the Transkei their own citizenship. They are citizens of the Transkei but at the same time they have the constitutional nationality of the Republic of South Africa. As far as international law is concerned we are not departing from it at all; there is no doubt about that. In other words, internally they are being bound to their own area as far as patriotism and so forth is concerned, and as far as their obligations towards that area are concerned. Because of their internal citizenship they have certain rights but they also have certain obligations. That is not in conflict with international law at all.</p>

<p>I can refer the hon. member to a judgment by the International Court in this regard; I am quite prepared to give him the details. I can refer to the Immigration Act of America of 1952. It is even recognized there. But that was the position in America even prior to 1952 in respect of people from the Philippines; they were citizens of America but they were not recognized as constitutional citizens of America. We are, of course, giving them South African nationality in terms of international law. They are South African nationals. We control them completely but they have rights and privileges at the same time. In other words the allegation that because of that they are being deprived of rights in the Republic of South Africa is not quite correct.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, a citizen. I only used that term because &#x201C;national&#x201D; is used in English. We call him &#x201C;Staatsb&#x00FC;rger&#x201D; (citizen). I understand it better that way and hon. members will also understand it better that way, that was why I used it, there is no difference of opinion in that regard. It is &#x201C;Staatsb&#x00FC;rger&#x201D; (citizen). But it is incorrect to say that all sorts of concessions are being made and that all sorts of rights are being curtailed. This is customary throughout the world; this binds the Xhosa in the first place to the country of which they are citizens. But, at the same, time, as citizens of South Africa, they do not lose any rights nor are any obligations placed upon them. We have full control there. Until such time as the Transkei develops into an independent state no change can come about in the position. I repeat that this is recognized in terms of international law. I must honestly admit that I am very proud of this development, because we are setting a good example at least to many African states. I am convinced that this will be to the benefit of South Africa. In the first place, it places obligations on them towards their own fatherland, obligations which they are instinctively aware of. But at the same time it also binds the Bantu outside the Transkei to their own fatherland. It, therefore, also has a beneficial effect as far as that is concerned. Nothing has a more beneficial effect than to tie a group of people to their own homeland. The world recognizes that to-day. Hence the reason that it is encouraged the way it is. But it even has its benefits as far as South Africa is concerned in as much that the people learn systematically that they must serve their own fatherland and that they must seek their political rights in their own fatherland in particular. That is the big difference and we are doing South Africa a great service here. They must seek their political rights there and not demand them in the Republic of South Africa. Hon. members have often in,the past said we were wrong when we said in the past that this was possible; they said that constitutionally it was simply impossible. I think, however, that the hon. member for Germiston District will grant me this that it is internationally recognized to-day that it is indeed constitutionally possible to-day. What is more, that is one of the things which is internationally encouraged to-day, so that as far as this is concerned we are really on very sound ground.</p>

I do not want to labour the point. But I put this to the hon. Minister: Assuming his interpretation of international law&#x2014;and Sir. he may regulate the affairs of the Bantu of South Africa, but he cannot claim to regulate international law or the views of other countries&#x2014;is proved to be wrong, about what recognition other nations will give to the so-called nationhood of this &#x201C;staat in wording&#x201D;; what will be his position then, when he comes to this House and has to report e.g. that there has been a difference of opinion between this Government and that of the Transkei, of which the citizens of the Transkei obviously will be proud according to the hon. Minister and which they will wish to support morally, politically and in any other way&#x2014;what will be the position if he will have to report to this House that despite his ideas about the attitude of the nations and his interpretation of international law, other nations do not see it in that light, and are prepared to recognize a certain degree of independence because of the citizenship of the people of the Transkei as bound up in Clause 7, and therefore to admit this country to their own countries, <span class="col_5361-5362" refersTo="page_1255"/>by way of embassies for example? If such an invitation comes to the Transkei, what will be his attitude, for instance if it comes from Mr. Nasser, the gentleman who was mentioned a moment ago, and about whom a letter was read here the other day, a description of how he feels about South Africa?

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately the hon. the Minister did not give an example of the new type of citizenship which he says has been recognized by international law. He spoke about the new freedoms which are being given to certain undeveloped countries. I am sorry he cannot tell us whether it applies to any of these new independencies. I wonder what example he can give which is similar to the Transkei. My difficulty is this, that sub-sec. (3) of Clause 7 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Republic shall not regard a citizen of the Transkei as an alien in the Republic and shall by virtue of his citizenship of a territory forming part of the Republic of South Africa regard him for all external purposes in terms of international law as a citizen of the Republic and afford him full protection according to international law.</block>

<p>As far as his position internationally is concerned he is all right and we can give him protection, whether he wants it or not. but we are worried about his position in this country. He must either be a citizen now, or he is not. Forget about the Xhosa and take the Zulu or the Tswana who will not be given a different citizenship in their own territory. What is their position? They are citizens of South Africa. They must be, because they are not stateless. The Minister tries to distinguish between a citizen and a national, and I do not see the difference. I can understand that where you have the Commonwealth, the British Government gave protection to British subjects although those subjects were not necessarily citizens of Britain. Is the Minister trying to tell us now that the position of the Xhosas will be the same as a British subject is in the Commonwealth? Then I have the right to point out that a British subject has a loyalty towards the country of which he is a citizen. Now I can see a conflict here, that the Transkeian citizen may owe more loyalty to the Transkei than to the Republic, or must he show the same loyalty to the Republic as to the Transkei? According to the oath, these people only swear to be loyal to the Transkei. Is it going to be expected of all citizens of the Transkei that their first loyalty is to the Transkei, and not to the Republic? Because if we look at sub-section (4) it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person who is a citizen of the Transkei shall by reason only of the provisions of this section be relieved of any duties, obligations or responsibilities or forfeit any existing rights, privileges or benefits which, but for the said provisions, would have been applicable in his case.</block>

<p>What if these two obligations conflict? To whom must his first loyalty be, to the Government of the Transkei or to that of the Republic? Which Government will try him for high treason if his loyalties conflict? What worries me is the wording of sub-section (3), which says that the Republic shall not regard a citizen of the Transkei as an alien in the Republic. Why is it worded in that negative form, and not in a positive form, to say that he still remains a citizen of the Republic? What are his responsibilities? Has he the responsibilities of any other citizen of the Republic? He is entitled to know what his responsibilities are to the Republic. If he is not going to be regarded as an alien, what are his responsibilities to the Republic? I think the Minister should tell us. especially in view of the fact that the majority of the new citizens have not been consulted in any way about this change in citizenship. They are now being given citizenship in terms of this clause for which they have not asked, because the definition in sub-section (3) of Clause 2 includes every Xhosa-speaking person in the Republic or any Bantu person belonging to any associated linguistic group, provided he does not have same other homeland. This is a very wide definition, and many people will be included under it who know nothing about the Transkei and who were not even born there, and with no homeland. Just think of all th&#x00E9; illegitimate children who do not know where their parents came from, but they talk Xhosa and now they will all be given a new citizenship. I think the Minister should explain to <span class="col_5363-5364" refersTo="page_1256"/>the House and to the country exactly what the obligations of these people will be.</p>

<p>I was merely going to say that the Minister is well supported by learned members of the Civil Service who could in a flash inform the Minister of the answer the hon. member for Transkeian Territories wants, and I hope that before the matter goes out of our minds he will be informed of the answer so that we can see what the position is.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Had hon. members done their homework they would not have asked these questions. I just want to refer to this article in the publication &#x201C;Hedendaagse Romeins-Hollandse Reg&#x201D; Roman Dutch Law. Briefly the position is this that we are creating a Transkeian citizenship, an internal citizenship, or a municipal citizenship as it is called internationally. That is the term used. In terms of that citizenship they are bound to the Transkei as citizens and in terms of that they can exercise all their political and other rights. In other words, there are two citizenships. On the other hand you have the White citizenship whereby the Whites enjoy their rights but as far as the world outside is concerned we have the constitutional citizenship where everybody falls in the same category. That was one of the matters which was considered by the International Court, which investigated those problems which gave rise to these things. If hon. members would only read this book they would not ask these questions. It was published in February. 1963. As far as the world outside is concerned you have constitutional citizenship. In other words, as far as the world outside is concerned a Transkeian citizen is recognized only as a citizen of the Republic of South Africa; there can be no doubt about that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Is there any difference between the constitutional citizenship, as it is called, of a Zulu or a Xhosa in respect of his citizenship of the Republic?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Constitutionally there is no difference; but as far as internal citizenship is concerned there is this difference that in future the Transkei will be the fatherland of the Xhosa and the Zulu cannot claim any rights in the Transkei.</p>
