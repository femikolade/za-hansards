<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>Before I ask the Secretary to read the first Order of the Day I want to refer to something which happened yesterday. While the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) was speaking he referred to a book called &#x201C;Guerilla Warfare &#x201D;. He made the following remark and I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now what is the Minister doing about this? This book is not banned, I might say. It might have been left over from the days when the hon. the Minister had charge of sabotage.</block>

<p>I call upon the hon. member to withdraw those words.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I withdraw those remarks. May I add. Sir, that I intended no personal affront to the hon. the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended last night I was busy replying to the argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in which he blamed this side of the House and me in particular for a certain opinion which existed about us overseas. I told the hon. member that that propaganda against South Africa emanated from his own ranks, not only from his own ranks in the sense that it was a member of his party, but in the particular sense that it was a legally trained lady who till recently was a front-bencher of that party in this House. In order to link up I wish to repeat the first and essential paragraph of the relevant letter which I received from the lady. She wrote the following to me in reply to my letter to her in connection with that article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I have turned up the article you mentioned and have had a look at the Act which was not available to me when I wrote.</block>

<p>It is surprising, Mr. Speaker, if that can happen to the green wood what can happen to the dead wood like the hon. member for Durban (North)? The relevant letter then goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You are quite right. The newspaper reports I used misled me especially as to the <i>&#x201C; shall</i>&#x201D; and I am sorry about that.</block>

<p>The letter then goes on to deal with other matters which are not relevant for the purposes of this argument.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition referred to it that on one occasion I had warned against pink Liberalism which was not only a danger in South Africa but which was a danger throughout the entire world. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition held it against me for having made that reference and for having pointed out the relative dangers inherent in it. With due respect to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if I wish to turn to an authority in that regard, in spite of the fact that the hon. member read a great deal during the recess&#x2014;I readily concede that&#x2014;I shall not turn to the hon. member but I shall of necessity turn to the person who is the greatest authority in the Western world on Communism and the combating of it. I refer to Mr. Hoover, the chief of the F.B.I. in America. I am very sorry that while the hon. member found time to read a great deal he did not read the two latest books of Mr. Hoover about Communism and related matters. Had he done so he would, for example, have come across the following passage which I want to read to the hon. member so that he can think about it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To me one of the most unbelievable and unexplainable phenomena in the fight on Communism is the manner in which otherwise respectable, seemingly intelligent persons &#x2026;</block>

<p>These words &#x201C;seemingly intelligent persons&#x201D; are quite important&#x2014;</p>

<p>&#x2026; perhaps unknowingly &#x2026;</p>

<p>I emphasize that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">and the communist cause more effectively than the communists themselves. The pseudo liberal can be more destructive than the known communist because of the esteem which his cloak of respectability invites.</block>

<p>That was what an authority on Communism, Mr. Edgar Hoover, said in this connection. If the hon. member attacks me for having made <span class="col_81-82" refersTo="page_0055"/>a similar statement I am at any rate in good company and I prefer to be seen in that company. If time permits, Mr. Speaker, I shall again deal with the hon. member&#x2019;s statements and if time does not permit it we shall have many other opportunities in the course of this Session to discuss them.</p>

<p>I must of necessity turn to the hon. member for Durban (North). In the normal course of events I would prefer to advise that hon. member than to admonish him. On this occasion I want to do both. In the first instance I wish to direct a word of advice to the hon. member for Durban (North). After all, the hon. member does know something about the world. He knows that there are people in the world who spend a great deal of energy and who go out of their way to be rude. It is not necessary for them to do that; they can simply be natural and they will attain the same result. During the course of this debate the hon. member for Durban (North) has shown himself to be a person with little respect for the truth. During the course of my speech I wish to refer to certain untruths which he has uttered. What did the hon. member say? I went to the trouble of checking the correctness of the notes which I had made and found them correct. The hon. member pointed out that many acts of sabotage had been committed and added: &#x201C;But no one has been arrested in this regard.&#x201D; But that is not true. Not only have many people been arrested but many are already serving sentences in the prisons of South Africa in terms of the Sabotage Act which was passed last year, sentences which vary from anything up to 20 years. The hon. member is a legally trained person and one would have expected a greater measure of respect for the truth from him. Had he adhered to the truth he would not have harmed his case in the least. The hon. member made the blatant statement that nobody had been arrested while he ought to know better and indeed knows better; he does indeed know that not only have people been arrested but they have been found guilty and punished very severely. I go further. The hon. member quoted from a speech which I made at Pretoria on the occasion of the passing out of policemen on 8 December 1962. The hon. member has a very good report of my speech in his possession and amongst others he quoted from it. Once again, Mr. Speaker. I wish to show you what respect the hon. member has for the truth. The hon. member said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said that the common criminal was a novice compared with these criminals&#x2014;communist liberals.</block>

<p>I never used the words &#x201C;communist liberals &#x201D;. Nor do they appear in the speech which the hon. member has in front of him. The hon. member comes here and makes that blatant statement that I had said that. I now come to the most serious instance in the speech of the member. The hon. member is an advocate; he is as well acquainted with the etiquette of the profession as I am. If you were to act in a court of law as the hon. member acted in this House yesterday, Sir, it would be regarded as extremely unprofessional conduct and a Judge would regard it as such. Not only would a Judge regard it as extremely unprofessional conduct but he would regard it in such a serious light that he would refer the matter to the Bar Council for action against such an advocate. Had the hon. member made himself guilty of such conduct in a court of law, a very strong word which exists in the law, would have been applied to him. I do not want to use it here to-day but that word would have been used in regard to him and his conduct would have been referred to the Bar Council with very serious consequences to the hon. member because what did he do? He quoted from the second half of my speech and he read these words (and this is quite correct)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These enemies of the safety of the State had 101 appearances and the apostles were to be found in the garb of the cleric, in the gown of a lawyer, in the office of the business executive as well as in the change house of the factory hand.</block>

<p>That is quite correct. I did say that and I repeat it. But I said that, unfortunately for the hon. member, in the second half of my speech which he has in front of him and had in front of him when he spoke yesterday. In the first half of my speech I dealt with the prevention of crime and I gave certain tips to the young recruits in that connection. I used the following words in the first half of my speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To-day the policeman knows that the solution is not so much in man&#x2019;s environment as in man himself. To change a man&#x2019;s circumstances does and can help but the lasting solution lies in the changing of man&#x2019;s soul.</block>

<p>I said that in the first half of my speech in connection with the prevention of crime. When I had disposed of that aspect of the matter completely I came to the question of undermining. I repeat Mr. Speaker: The hon. member has my speech in front of him and that was how it was reported. But what does the hon. member do? The hon. member quoted what I said about &#x201C;the enemies of the safety of the State&#x201D; and which forms part of the second half and he then continued and said &#x201C;then the Minister goes on to say &#x2026;&#x201D; and he quoted from the first half of my speech. If an advocate acts like that in a supreme court he would be most severely admonished by the Judge. Furthermore, he will in future always be under suspicion in the supreme court because nobody will believe him if after that he quotes passages from court decisions. My attitude is simply this and I am saying this bluntly to the hon. member: In future I shall no longer be prepared to take notice of anything which he quotes and I shall not believe him if he quotes anything. There are <span class="col_83-84" refersTo="page_0056"/>not many legally trained men in this House and many of the laymen sometimes look askance at us as legally trained men. It is fitting, therefore, that we should be careful not to act in that way. Whether we sit on the Government side or on the Opposition side, we as legally trained persons must in heaven&#x2019;s name not act in such a way that we have to be ashamed of one another in this House. I think having said that I have for the time being disposed of that point raised by the hon. member for Durban (North).</p>

<p>However, I wish to accuse the hon. member for having done something else. The hon. member will remember very clearly that when we discussed this legislation last year the question cropped up of reports of court cases and related matters in which persons could not be quoted. The hon. member will remember very clearly that on that occasion I said that I was not very happy about the relevant clause as it stood but that I could not present him with a better formula and that during the recess I would rectify those matters administratively. Knowing that the hon. member repeatedly reverted to it and quoted from Hansard what he had said in that regard. In those circumstances the hon. member will understand it when I say that I do not consider it worth my while replying to the other matters raised by him on this occasion. There will be other opportunities later in the Session for the hon. member to raise those matters in a proper way and when they will be discussed further.</p>

<p>Once again the hon. the Leader of the Opposition let an opportunity slip by to step into the breach for South Africa in connection with the very difficult struggle she is waging against Communism. Instead of our getting his co-operation in this regard the hon. member saw fit to make the attack upon me which he did in fact make. It was not a particularly vehement attack. In any case, that was the impression which I gained. Apparently the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> gained a different impression because somebody told me this morning that their placards appeared all over Johannesburg with the words &#x201C;Graaff smashes Vorster &#x201D;. I do not blame the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for smiling. Surely he and I know that he is not capable of doing that. It is quite interesting to note the exact origin of the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition. Why does the Leader of the Opposition not avail himself of the opportunity to fight Communism? Why does he fight me? Let me say this with all modesty about the Leader of the Opposition: There was a time during the recess when he did indeed want to do so. Not only did he want to do so but he did indeed do so once and that was in a speech he made at King William&#x2019;s Town. Immediately after he had made that speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition received an order from the newspaper which supports him, namely the <i>Star</i> of Saturday 30 November 1962. An article by their political correspondent appeared in the <i>Star</i> the last paragraph of which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Sir de Villiers Graaff is such an upright personality and so honest that when he takes a political line he is obviously doing so from conviction.</block>

<p>I wholeheartdly agree with that. I do not always agree with the &#x201C;conviction&#x201D; of the hon. member, but I agree with that. The <i>Star</i> then continues and gives orders to the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But one wonders whether it was necessary or for that matter wise for him to mount the anti-communist band wagon as he did in a speech in King William&#x2019;s Town this week.</block>

<p>Hardly had they posed the question whether he had acted wisely to mount the band wagon when the hon. member got off it. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that he never read that article. In other words, he never received the order but that merely shows you, Sir, the extent of the telepathy which exists between him and his masters, because without having received the order he got off the band wagon. The <i>Star</i> continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What he said was doubtless true. But there are wise men who believe that as long as Nationalism rules South Africa Communism will continue to have fertile soil to till.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] I am very grateful to hon. members for reacting like that because it confirms a suspicion of mine to which I shall return later on. I go on to read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Target No. 1, therefore, would seem to be unbridled White Nationalism, the fruits of whose labours are there for all to see.</block>

<p>I wonder whether the hon. the member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) will agree with that as wholeheartdly. Not only does the <i>Star</i> make an appeal to the Opposition, but it is an order that they should not fight Communism&#x2014;they should let it lie aside; they may not even speak against it&#x2014;but that they should exterminate White Nationalism. That is the order which is being given in the <i>Star.</i> I agree with the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) in all humility that if the catastrophe should ever befall South Africa that the Leader of the Opposition and his party come into power that that would perhaps be the road which we would follow here. That danger does in fact await us if ever the Opposition should come into power. The writer of the article concludes by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By joining in the anti-communist race at this stage Sir de Villiers runs the danger of making his genuine anti-Communism seem to some at least as being in the same category as that of the Nationalists.</block>

<p>That is the order which is given to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party. If there is one appeal which I should like to <span class="col_85-86" refersTo="page_0057"/>make to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to-day before I sit down it is, firstly, this that the hon. member should appeal to his fellow members who reveal the spirit of Mrs. Bertha Solomon to refrain from besmirching South Africa on false facts and, secondly, that the hon. member should not miss the golden opportunity which we have&#x2014;whether or not we differ as far as our political views and approach are concerned&#x2014;to show a common front to the communist danger of which he is as aware as I am. When the hon. member spoke about Roberto Holden&#x2019;s invasion of Angola he accused us of not having friends and said that we were standing alone. He asked what would become of us if something similar happened here. I do not want to discuss the merits of that attitude with the hon. member at this stage. I want to deal with his attitude as he stated it to us here. If what he says is true, is that not all the more reason why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should throw in his weight with us? If he is correct, then surely it is not for the continued existence of the National Party for which we are fighting here in South Africa; surely it is not for the continuation of file Prime Ministership of the hon. Dr. Verwoerd for which we are fighting; but surely it is for South Africa and for our children who will follow us for whom we are fighting.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has made a very serious charge against the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). I want to say immediately that I would have expected that a Minister, and especially a Minister of Justice, would have taken the trouble to check the facts before he came before this House with a charge such as that he has made and in the language which he has used.</p>

<p>I have here in my hand the Press report which was used by the hon. member for Durban (North). The date is 8 December 1962. The first reference to the Minister in that report is the following words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The common criminal is a novice compared with these criminals &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, these are the Minister&#x2019;s words which are being quoted. And then there appears a section which apparently was uttered by the Minister before that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To-day the policeman knows that the solution is not so much in man&#x2019;s environment as in man himself. To change a man&#x2019;s circumstances does and can help but the lasting solution lies in changing man&#x2019;s soul.</block>

<p>The charge, Sir, is a very serious one, and it is this that the hon. member for Durban (North), knowing the order in which these statements were made, reversed them in this House in order to mislead this hon. House. In actual fact, Sir, I believe that anybody who read this Press report would have read it exactly as the hon. member for Durban (North) did namely that the statement first quoted was the statement first made and that the statement which appears lower in the report is the second statement. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to apologize to the hon. member for Durban (North) in this house. I have little doubt that the Minister had reports on these Press reports and if he had been incorrectly reported it was his duty to the public to have taken the matter up with that newspaper and not to have launched an attack on a young and brilliant member of this House.</p>

<p>I leave this matter there. I leave it to the conscience of the hon. the Minister. I do sincerely hope that he will do the right thing by the hon. member for Durban (North) and by this House.</p>

<p>This has been a remarkable debate. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has come before this House with a reasoned case and has in my submission amply justified proposing the motion which stands before the House that this House has no confidence in the Government. Sir, what have we seen? We have seen three hon. members now on the other side of the House, the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet), and now the hon. Minister of Justice not even attempting to challenge the case made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. They have not attempted in any way to attack that case. They have come here with an attempt to try and distract the attention of this House and of the country from the charges made by the Leader of the Opposition and which stand completely unchallenged on the records of this House in the debate which took place yesterday.</p>

<p>Sir, I will try and deal with the case which has been put. I do not believe it gets us anywhere to come and to try and distract the attention of the country from the charges which have been made and which are of a serious nature.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. member?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make my own speech. The hon. member put something like 50 questions in the course of his speech yesterday.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_nierop">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN NIEROP</person>:</from>

<p>Are you going to reply to them?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite unnecessary. The challenge in this debate is the challenge to the Government. It is not a question of debating points in an attempt to distract attention from the state in which this country finds world opinion and finds opinion mounting against this country.</p>

<p>The Minister of Justice has referred to Communism, and it will be my charge against this Government in the course of my further remarks that the Government is not fighting <span class="col_87-88" refersTo="page_0058"/>Communism in the most effective way and that the measures which are on the Statute Book at the present time are not the most effective measures. Moreover I believe that in the exercise of the powers which he has, the hon. the Minister of Justice has all too often used very wide powers given to him by this House for the safety of the state, without taking account of the necessity of acting in accord with the rule of law. Sir, this is a very serious statement to make and I make it in all seriousness, because I believe that in fighting Communism, while there may be occasions where the Government may find it necessary to resort to extraordinary measures, a Government should be as careful as it possibly can to avoid the methods of Communism in seeking to uproot Communism in this country.</p>

<p>The charge which has been made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition deals partly with the creation of these Bantustans, and one point that was made by an hon. member on the opposite side in reply was to say that the policy which this Government follows in respect of the political rights of the Native peoples in South Africa is exactly the same as the policy which is followed by the Government of Britain in respect of Basutoland as provided for in the Basutoland Constitution. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark amongst others made that statement.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>That is not quite correct.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the hon. member will deny that he made the statement that the political rights vested by the Basutoland Constitution in the Basutos outside Basutoland were exactly the same as those contemplated by this Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>No.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>But that is what the hon. member said. That is certainly how I understood him. And that statement has been made again and again by hon. ministers and others on the other side of this House. I have here the Basutoland Constitution and its provisions are perfectly clear. For the sake of the record I think I should read them. Section V of Proclamation No. 53 of 1959, which is to be found on page 660 of the Official Gazette of Basutoland, provides as follows under the heading &#x201C;The Franchise &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Subject to the provisions of Section VI, a person is entitled to be an elector under the provisions of this proclamation if such person (a) is a British subject or a British-protected person and (b) has passed his 21st birthday on the date of his application for registration as an elector and (c) has paid tax at any time during the five years immediately preceding the date of his registration as an elector, and (d) has lawfully been resident in Basutoland for the continuous period of six months immediately before registration as an elector, absences for short temporary visits elsewhere being disregarded.</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that where any person who possesses the qualifications set out in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this sub-section is engaged in work or labour outside Basutoland, he shall nevertheless be deemed to have residential qualifications as described in this paragraph if he satisfies the registration officer that either (i) he has returned periodically to Basutoland to live there or has lived there for a period or periods which in the aggregate amount to not less than 12 months during the five years immediately preceding registration, or (ii) he has continuously maintained a home in Basutoland for five years immediately preceding registration.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>Exactly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>It is perfectly clear what that provision means. It is perfectly clear that if a Basuto has broken contact with his homeland and is working outside and if he has not the other qualifications or has not returned to Basutoland to live there for a period of 12 months in the aggregate during the five years immediately preceding registration, or alternatively that he has maintained a home there&#x2014; and quite obviously a very, very big proportion, running no doubt into millions of the Natives in this country, if they were Basutos, would not have the qualification to vote, even if they are of the Basuto people. Certainly if drawn from the tribes of South Africa &#x2026; would not under a similar constitution be entitled to vote in the areas from which their ancestors originally came. This entirely demolishes the only excuse this Government has found for seeking to provide that persons who belong to a particular tribe should be entitled to vote there even if all contacts with that tribe has been broken. It is obvious from this that persons who may have moved from Basutoland to the Free State and who have broken all their contact with the homeland have no right to be registered in Basutoland unless they have lived there and return there for the requisite period or alternatively have a home there. It is obvious that this destroys the whole basis upon which the hon. the Minister of Bantu Development has sought through the years to justify the system of franchise as providing a real solution for the problem of Native Representation. Sir, this Government would never, I believe, be able to get the good will of the outside world back for South Africa so long as it founds it policy on fallacies of this sort. Sir, if ever there was a responsibility on the Government in respect of this matter, it is this responsibility. They are making an experiment for which there is no precedent. I do not say that that necessarily means that it is wrong. But I say that to make this experiment on the basis of a complete fallacy as to what is the law in respect of territories adjoining us and to seek to justify their policy on the basis of that, should no longer mislead anybody and it certainly is no basis at all to support the case which the Government makes.</p>

<p><span class="col_89-90" refersTo="page_0059"/>I would like to go further into the question of these Bantustans and I would like, if I may to add a few thoughts to what my hon. Leader has said in this regard. It is perfectly obvious that this policy is one which brings South Africa into the greatest possible danger. It is the belief of this side of the House that South Africa as it is must maintain its present boundaries. We are utterly opposed to the creation of what on the admission of the Government would eventually become independent states, some wholly within the boundaries of South Africa and some of which occupy a very considerable portion of the sea borders of this country. We believe that this is a most dangerous policy. But even worse than that, it is this policy of the Government among other things which is bringing down the ire of the outside world on South Africa. I would like to say that South Africa can&#x2019;t go on to live in this state. Not for a moment would I suggest that we should bow down before the behests of black Africa. Hon. members there know as well as we know on this side of the House that we are determined to maintain a home for the European in this country and that we are not prepared to take part in any steps which will lead to the downfall of the European in South Africa. That is a common responsibility which we share with hon. members on the other side, and by that we stand. But we say that this Government is setting about this in the wrong way and one of the reasons why I believe that this country should be losing confidence in this Government and is, I am convinced losing confidence in this Government, is the fact that it is imposing this policy against the wish of I believe the majority of the Europeans of South Africa. There are tens of thousands of supporters of this Government who are utterly opposed to this policy of the hon. the Prime Minister, just as are the people we represent on this side of the House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I had the pleasure during the recess to go overseas, and I am glad to be able to tell this House, and I do it in all sincerity, that wherever I went (and I went to many countries, including America), I found that there is an enormously strong under-current of sympathy and understanding towards South Africa. It is realized that we have one of the most difficult tasks of history. I go further and say that I found that there was a great deal, and there is to this day a great deal of latent support for South Africa in all those countries, and I believe that a good government in South Africa could get back to the position that South Africa occupied at the time when the present Government took over in South Africa. If there is one thing that I as a member on this side of the House am proud of it is that I found that overwhelmingly that latent sympathy and concern for South Africa which I found in those countries, was based very largely on what happened before the present Government came into power; it was based on the performances of that great South African, General Smuts, and I believe the common man contributed even more than that for it is based primarily on the tremendous admiration of these various free countries of the world for the performances of the soldiers and the sailors and the airmen of South Africa in World War I and World War II. That has not been forgotten. That sympathy is there. For my part I came back encouraged to know that in the event of there being a change of government in South Africa&#x2014;and it is just a question of time&#x2014;the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will have no difficulty whatsoever in finding a way in which we can meet not only the criticism in the outside world, but can put South Africa once more on the road to greatness on which its feet were set at the time that this Government took over.</p>

Of course, I made it clear that I was <span class="col_91-92" refersTo="page_0060"/>speaking as a member of the Opposition. But I must say that I tried to put the position fairly. I put forward the Government&#x2019;s policy in such a way that it was placed in a most favourable light, and let me say that I did not mention many of the petty pin-pricks which are part of the Government&#x2019;s policy and which are doing so much damage to this country.</p>

<p>I did not quote Bertha Solomon. I only heard in the debate yesterday from the hon. the Minister of Justice of the very serious blunder made by that lady. I did not know about it and there was no need to quote it. But I tried to place South Africa in a most favourable light, and I think no one can ask more than that from us when we are overseas. It may interest the hon. the Leader of the House that one person came to me afterwards and he said &#x201C;You know, I was very interested in that policy. We could do with Dr. Verwoerd down our way. I asked him where he came from and he said &#x201C;From Georgia!&#x201D;</p>

<p>I wish to pass on to other matters and the matter I wish to deal with first is a reason which has not been advanced so far, I believe, in relation as to why this House and this country should have no confidence in this Government and in the Nationalist Party as it exists. I believe that if there is one thing that is necessary if South Africa is to surmount what we all admit is a tremendous challenge which faces us all, whatever our political convictions might be. It is the necessity not of political unity in this country, but for the general underlying unity of the South African people. It is my confirmed belief. Mr. Speaker, that that is most essential. I had the privilege of spending my early years in a school where the majority of the children were Afrikaans, and I am convinced that the sooner we get back in this country to the position where we have our children together in the schools, where they can learn to understand each other, where they can learn each other&#x2019;s language the better it will be for South Africa. I believe that there is no more urgent problem for the people of this country and the responsibility rests squarely on the shoulders of this Government and the provincial councils controlled by the Nationalist Party to take steps to take the children, Afrikaans-speaking and English-speaking, to get to know each other, to go to school together, and thereby to become better South Africans. I believe that it is a crime against the children of this country that they should not have the opportunity many of us in this House had many years ago in getting to know the other section of the people of South Africa, thereby qualifying ourselves very much better for life in South Africa, and I believe meeting the problems which we have to face, problems which, whether we like it or not, have to be faced by us, whether we are Afrikaans-speaking or English-speaking, whether we come from the great cities or whether we come from the rural areas.</p>

It is a matter of great seriousness in this country, not a matter for political debating.

<p>The party sitting on this side of the House. There is an alternative Government which can bring about a better state of affairs for South Africa. I believe that on the policy of this side of the House there would be a far better opportunity of winning back the support that has been lost among the free countries of the world. We obviously cannot get the support of the communist countries of the world. We are simply not prepared to pay the price. But among the free countries of the world this Government has been utterly careless in regard to the great support which South Africa has had and which should have been maintained in all circumstances. Secondly, so far as the problem of race relations is concerned, I say that it is perfectly clear to anyone, including hon. members opposite who are prepared to face the true facts, that this <span class="col_93-94" refersTo="page_0061"/>Government&#x2019;s colour policy has failed utterly. It is not providing a solution for the problems of this country and it is continuing to do South Africa more and more harm, losing the goodwill of countries who should be our friends. There is an alternative way which was put by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. It is not necessary to go into it in any further detail. There is no question whatsoever that there is an alternative to the policy of this Government. It might not satisfy the whole of the world, but I believe that we could regain the support of those countries who have stood by South Africa in the past.</p>

The claim that I have made, Sir, and I challenge any other hon. member on the other side to seek to disprove it, is that if the policies of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition were followed in this country, as they will be when this side of the House gets into power, there will be a great difference in the attitude of the outside world to this country. Often it was not big things which have brought about this attitude in the outside world; very often they were smaller things, petty things, things often which are not at all important in regard to preserving the position of a future for the Europeans in this country.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members know perfectly well what I am referring to. One piece of legislation after another through the years has been opposed by this side of the House&#x2014; certain aspects of the Sabotage Act last year, the Group Areas Act, the Separate Universities Act. There are many enactments which were forced through by applying a time limit and the guillotine. If we had been successful in our opposition, there is no question that South Africa would have stood in a very different relation to the outside world compared with the position as it is to-day. I don&#x2019;t believe that a single hon. member on the other side of the House will deny that.</p>

<p>In spite of the immense difficulties through which this country is passing at the present time I am an optimist as far as South Africa is concerned. The first reason for that optimism I have already given. It is quite clear that this Government is not going to remain in power for ever. It will be replaced by a Government which will place a different policy before this country. Secondly, I believe that the South African people will not allow themselves to continue to be led by the nose as many of them have been led by the nose in the past 15 years but that they will revolt against these policies. In growing numbers they will come back to the support of the true road for South Africa, the policy followed by the United Party, the policy which was followed by General Botha, General Hertzog and General Smuts. Hon. members opposite believe that they are there for ever. I would just like to close with this remark. No Government is in power for ever. We have seen in recent times case after case in the free world where in election after election there have been unexpected results and governments which thought that they would remain in power for a long time suddenly found themselves ousted. For my part, I have no quarrel with the efforts which are being made from this side of the House to change the Government's policies whenever we think they are wrong. I am convinced that in the end this will lead to a change in the Government of this country, will lead to sensible government for South Africa, government in the interests of South Africa and in the interest of all the peoples of South Africa. If we do that there is no question that we will once again get that support which the former leaders on this side of the House got for South Africa in the outside world and which was carelessly tossed away by those who have led the Nationalist Party and South Africa to the parlous position in which we find ourselves now.</p>

<p>After all I gave the hon. member the opportunity to correct me. He cannot accuse me of having misquoted him. When he objected I immediately gave him the opportunity to correct me. The hon. member went on to say that this was one of the laws which was harming us abroad. Surely then it stands to reason that either the United Party does not care if our reputation is harmed in the eyes of our friends or they do care, and if they do care then surely they will do away with these things which they believe are harming us. Then hon. member cannot say therefore that I am misquoting him. As an individual I have a very great respect for the hon. member for Germiston (District), and for his integrity. But I cannot have the same degree of respect for the political views which the hon. member holds in many respects and for his arguments. The hon. member makes the accusation against this Government that our actions are not conducive to national unity in this country because we are segregating the children at school into separate groups. In reply to an interjection he then stated that we must not talk about private schools because what counts is the example that this Government sets to the people of South Africa.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. J. FOUCH&#x00C9; (Jnr.)</person>:</from>

<p>But that is precisely what I said. My point is that it is not only this Government that should be called upon to set the example, because this Government. the National Party Government, has not always been in power in South Africa. After all, before the National Party Government came into power, there were United Party governments in power. Did those United Party governments do anything in connection with the private schools which then existed? Which party is in power in Natal? Is there a United Party Provincial Council or not? Has that Provincial Council ever made the slightest efforts to do anything about the numerous English-medium private schools in Natal? I do not think hon. members opposite, in a debate on a motion of no-confidence, should make accusations against the Government, accusations which are groundless. The hon. member for Germiston (District) began his speech by saying that the Leader of the Opposition had come along with a reasoned case in support of the motion before the House and that not one of the members on this side had tried to reply to the motion. In the first place I just want to point out to the hon. member that the moment the Leader of the Opposition sat down one member after another stood up on this side and stated the case of this side of the House. Not only did they state the case of this side but in fact they also did their very best to elicit statements from the other side in connection with the policy which the Leader of the Opposition had announced on behalf of that side, and not a single reply was forthcoming.</p>

<p>Then I just want to deal hurriedly with this point. The hon. member says that in fighting Communism, this Government must guard against using the methods of the communists. I want to point out that it has been stated repeatedly that when one takes steps against the communists and against the diabolical doctrines that they propagate, then in the first place one does not treat them as one would treat any normal person. Furthermore, I say that I do not concede any rights at all to the communists. But in the second place I want to say, as I have stated repeatedly in this House, that there is also another side of the picture, and this is the dangerous side, and that is that it has been proved times out of number that the method that is in fact used by the communists throughout the world is to make use of the freedoms and the privileges of democracy to destroy democracy. No government which has the future of this country at heart would dare to allow the communists to follow that pattern of theirs in our fatherland and this Government is not willing to allow the communists the privileges and freedoms of democracy or to destroy democracy itself.</p>

<speech by="#tompson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Will the hon. member tell me how the Government knows whether a person is a communist until such time as he has been tried?</p>

<p>*Mr. J. J. FOUCH&#x00C9; (Jnr.): The question as to who is a communist has been resolved time and again. It is laid down in one Act after another. It is not necessary for me to explain it to my hon. friend who is also an advocate.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. The hon. member <span class="col_97-98" refersTo="page_0063"/>for Germiston (District) quoted from the Basutoland Constitution and said that the whole reason for the introduction by this Government of the Bantu homelands policy and the franchise disappears when one looks at the provisions of the Basutoland Constitution. The hon. member then went on to read out certain provisions of that Constitution. I do not want to quarrel with him in that regard. Firstly I just want to say that the fact remains that according to the documents quoted by the hon. member it is quite possible for Basuto who are not resident in Basutoland to obtain the franchise there. In other words, that possibility does exist in the case of Basutoland. But. secondly, I want to say that this Government&#x2019;s Bantu homelands policy is very definitely not based on the example of the Basutoland Constitution. The Basutoland Constitution did not give rise to this Government&#x2019;s policy of Bantu homelands. In other words, whatever the Basutoland Constitution may provide, it has nothing at all to do with the success or failure of this Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development and of Bantu homelands.</p>

<p>Let me go further. The United Party comes along with this motion of no-confidence and it seeks to justify it on the basis of petty objections and trivial problems which it tries to pose as against the policy of separate development, but it is unable to suggest anything else in its place.</p>

<p>I listened very attentively and the explanation of his policy by the Leader of the Opposition was such that question upon question had to be put to him about it and those questions were not replied to either by him or by hon. members on his side. We are living in times in which we as Whites and as parties must not simply level destructive criticism at one another without putting forward alternative suggestions. We dare not give the world just a negative picture in connection with the efforts which are being made to solve our difficult racial problems. I have no objection to the Opposition&#x2019;s criticizing the Government&#x2019;s policy but then at least they must be prepared to put forward an alternative. Let us have an end to this story that it is not necessary for them to suggest an alternative policy because the motion is not one of no-confidence in them. Apart from the amendment, the fact remains that the Opposition&#x2019;s policy and that of the Government in this connection are so divergent that nobody in this House or outside can have confidence both in our policy and in their policy. They have moved a motion of no-confidence in this Government&#x2019;s policy. That implies that if there is a lack of confidence in this Government&#x2019;s policy, there must necessarily be confidence in their policy. If therefore they move a motion of no-confidence in this Government then they must be prepared to say why there is lack of confidence and they must be prepared to say why they should be trusted to govern this country. They can only move a motion of no-confidence in us therefore if they have something better to put forward in place of our policy.</p>

<p>I have already said that yesterday the hon. Leader of the Opposition gave us an unclear picture of his race federation plan.

Nobody would allege for a single moment that any plan which is designed to solve our racial problems is without problems and without difficulties. Nobody in his right mind would suggest that. While every policy that can be put forward has its problems it is very easy just to criticize; anybody can do that. The Leader of the Opposition says that this Government&#x2019;s policy is antagonizing the world against us. That statement has also been made by the hon. member for Germiston (District), and they make that statement in spite of the fact that what we are presenting to the world is a picture of a policy which makes it possible for the non-Whites eventually to develop fully in their own areas and to obtain their full rights there. That policy, the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Germiston (District) say, antagonizes the world against us. My question to them is this: What do they think would be the effect of their policy under which, within the same state structure, they want to give the non-Whites political rights which according to them, however, will always be subordinate, within the forseeable future, to those of the Whites? Having regard to what is happening in the world, let me ask the Opposition how on earth they think they will win the affection of the world with their type of policy. The Leader of the Opposition goes on to talk about &#x201C;petty apartheid&#x201D; and amongst other things he mentions the Church clause. Surely we can have no clearer proof of the weakness of the Opposition&#x2019;s case than the fact that a man like the Leader of the Opposition, whom I know as a reasonable and decent person, has to conjure up arguments of that kind to support a motion of no-confidence. Surely he knows what the position is in connection with the so-called Church clause. After all, it has been explained repeatedly in the past. He knows that the Church clause contains no such terrible provisions. He knows that the Minister cannot take steps until certain things have happened&#x2014;in the first place until such time as such church attendance causes a disturbance <span class="col_99-100" refersTo="page_0064"/>in the area. The local authority may then ask that steps be taken and then only the Minister may act. Why does he tell the world this sort of thing?</p>

<p>If the hon. member reads the Act he will see that it is perfectly true. What good do the Opposition think they can do this country by advancing this sort of argument? The Leader of the Opposition then goes on to ask why the Government is so slow in learning the lessons of Africa. I almost despair, and in my despair I want to ask them why they are so slow in learning these lessons. They want to know in connection with the Bantu homelands whether we are not going to learn the lessons that we can learn in Africa, but my counter-question is this: Where in Africa and where in the world has any attempt ever been made to apply a policy of separate development? Some kind of attempt, however, has been made everywhere else in Africa and in the world to build up a multi-racial community within the same state structure, with destructive consequences for the White race. Are they not going to learn the lessons of Africa? To begin with, in every state where an attempt has been made to set up, within the same state structure a multi-racial community enjoying full rights, they have gone much further than the Opposition is willing to go here with its race federation plan, and if they have been unable to satisfy the world and if the experiment culminated in the end of the Whites, then I ask the Leader of the Opposition whether they are not going to learn the lessons of Africa? How long do the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. members opposite think they are going to succeed in retaining power in the hands of the Whites if political rights are given, within the same state structure, to the non-Whites with their superior numbers, and which country&#x2019;s sympathy are they going to gain for South Africa with their policy? I cannot accept that they believe that they will be able to retain that power. The Leader of the Opposition talks about &#x201C;some representation&#x201D; for the non-Whites in this Parliament. How long does he think they are going to be satisfied with &#x201C;some representation &#x201D;? If they are given political rights in the same state, they are not going to be satisfied with &#x201C;some representation &#x201D;. Won&#x2019;t the Opposition also please learn the lessons of Africa? They hold themselves out as the alternative government. It is these same hon. members who talk so mirthfully about this Government&#x2019;s policy of dismembering this country, and yet they are the people who are also willing to develop the reserves for the non-Whites. In other words, they too want to create a country in which the non-Whites alone will reign supreme in one part of the country; in the rest of the country, however, there will be a place not for the Whites only, because there White and non-White will be living together, whereas at least we on this side also want to give the Whites their own area. Why do hon. members opposite say this sort of thing?</p>

<p>Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition painted the dangers of threatening Communism to us. I agree with him that it is a great threat not only to our country but to Africa and to the world. But then a follower of his, the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant)&#x2014;I am sorry he is not here at the moment&#x2014;holds a meeting at Thaba &#x2019;Nchu and tells the public about the bogey of Communism. In other words, the danger with which this side of the House is trying to frighten the electorate is apparently an unreal danger. Can this House have any confidence in the Opposition having regard to the spectacle that we are now witnessing? I say that this Government is worthy not only of the confidence of this House but of the electorate because in the first place the policy of this Government is one which is fair towards every person in this country, whatever his race or colour may be. It is a policy which is honest and fair, and it is a policy which is gradually beginning to find favour with thinking people. I want to read out a few quotations. An American Senator, who recently toured this country, said that South Africa was on the right road. I quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An American Senator stated in Durban yesterday that he personally thought that the South African Government was on the right road and that most of South Africa&#x2019;s critics did not know what they were talking about and that he was convinced that the American Government would still have to change its attitude towards South Africa&#x2019;s policy. He is 72-year-old Senator Allen J. Ellender who in the course of an official tour is visiting all the American missions in Africa. He is a member of the American Senate&#x2019;s Committee and chairman of the Forestry and Agricultural Committee &#x2026; Sapa reports from Durban that he stated in an interview there yesterday that the contrast between the situation in South Africa and that in other states in Africa was so sharp that since his arrival in South Africa he had found it difficult to believe that he was in Africa. &#x201C;I was in South Africa in 1953 and on my present visit I was surprised to see how much progress had been made in your country since then. I was also in Leopoldville in 1953. It was then a fine, lively city. When I was there again recently, I felt as though I was walking through a graveyard &#x2026;.&#x201D; The Senator stated that the trouble was that most of South Africa&#x2019;s critics did not know what they were talking about. &#x201C;In spite of my Government&#x2019;s attitude I personally have the greatest sympathy with your problems. I think your Government is on the right road and I am convinced that the time will come when my Government will have to change its attitude towards your policy.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This comes from a prominent politician in America. But this is not the opinion of politicians <span class="col_101-102" refersTo="page_0065"/>only. A businessman also toured this country recently and when he returned to his own country he spoke of South Africa in laudatory terms. I refer to Clarence B. Randall, a prominent American businessman, who recently visited South Africa. Let me quote again&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He also stated that much of the American criticism of South Africa was based on a lack of understanding. Randall stated in this interview in Chicago that he had been allowed in the course of his visit to South Africa extending over a month to talk to anybody &#x2026;" The Negro was brought to the U.S.A. against his will. It is our responsibility therefore to see that there is equality between the Whites and the Negroes. In South Africa that is not the case. I do not know whether the policy of separate development will succeed or fail, but the South Africans are entitled to an opportunity to demonstrate their good faith. The people in power are men of honour.&#x201D; He made an appeal to the Americans to tone down their language when discussing contentious problems such as those of South Africa. Much of the criticism of South Africa is based on a lack of understanding.</block>

<p>I say that the thinking politicians and businessmen are gradually beginning to change their minds about our policy. But that does not apply to the Whites only. Our non-White neighbours too are beginning to see things in a different light. A new party was recently established in Basutoland, and in a statement issued by them the leader and secretary of the party say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party will endeavour to have Basutoland placed in the same relationship to the Republic as the Transkei and other Bantu homelands. The party cannot see what useful purpose can be served by overlooking the Republic, which lies on the borders of Basutoland, and seeking guidance and assistance from other countries. Africa belongs to everybody&#x2014;White and Black&#x2014;living on this Continent. We stand for an honest and realistic approach to our national and international problems and follow a policy of good neighbourliness.</block>

<p>That is the attitude which this new party adopts and they specifically declare that they are anti-communist. I say that at the election of 1961 and again at all the by-elections of 1962 the electorate of the Republic of South Africa showed that it had confidence in this Government. Responsible Whites abroad are beginning to show more and more signs of confidence in the policy of this Government as well as in our economy. Our non-White neighbours are beginning to have confidence in our policy. That is why this House cannot but express its confidence in the Government and lack of confidence in the Opposition, and I shall gladly vote therefore for the amendment moved by the hon. member for Vereeniging.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Smithfield (Mr. J. J. Fouch&#x00E9;, Jnr.) appeared to be most impressed by the fact that an American Senator has announced himself to be in favour of the racial policies of this Government, but the hon. member is deceiving himself if he believes that the Senator expressed the official policy of the Government of the U.S.A. He said he was an outstanding Senator and representative of the thinking of his country, but he is not representative of the thinking of the people of the U.S.A. The pronounced policy of the U.S.A, is away from racial discrimination. In fact the U.S.A, has an official Civil Rights Commission, which sits constantly evolving ways and means of applying the pronounced policy of removing discrimination on the grounds of race, colour or creed in the field of housing, employment, the franchise, etc. So the hon. member must not think that because a stray Senator visits this country from the U.S.A., his Government here has the approval of the outside world. He said also that to use the Church clause as an example of the image presented abroad gives an untrue picture. This may very well be so, but can the hon. member tell us whether it is or is not true that thousands of Africans are being endorsed out of the urban areas and their home-lives broken up, that thousands of Africans who have lived in the Western Cape for 20 years or more are being sent away with no alternative livelihood provided for them, with much human suffering being caused? Can he tell us whether it is true or not that Indians are being uprooted from their homes and businesses and being put out on the veld, and that Coloureds are dispossessed of their homes, and that a thousand people per day for the last three years were arrested for pass offences and that people are languishing in banishment without trial, some of whom have been there for seven or more years? Is it not true that there are people under house-arrest in this country, without trial, and is it not true that in South Africa we have mediaeval spectacles such as trials for blasphemy and trials for heresy. Sir, these are the things which create the image of South Africa abroad. Is it not true that in South Africa normal rights and freedoms which are inherent in democratic countries have indeed been taken over as the property of the State, to be handed out to citizens like licences subject to renewal, subject to withdrawal and all dependent, not on the responsibility of the citizen to enjoy or exercise those rights but dependent merely on the colour of the skin of the citizen. These are the things that have created the South African image abroad&#x2014;that and speeches such as those made by the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs at the Day of the Covenant celebrations&#x2014;a racially inciting speech if ever I heard one&#x2014;and speeches such as those made by the Minister of Education, Arts and Science when he congratulated the South African Library Association on not having held a mixed meeting since 1948 and where he stated that it was the declared policy of the Government that there shall be no mixed <span class="col_103-104" refersTo="page_0066"/>membership whatever of scientific or professional organizations, and even speeches like the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s speech on New Year&#x2019;s day when he found it necessary to deliver a special separate speech to the Bantu people since they could not be considered as part and parcel of the ordinary population of this country and must have a message suitable to their own status in life which, of course, as far as he is concerned, is to be for ever the drawers of water and the hewers of wood. These are the things that breed the image abroad for South Africa, not the thousands of rand spent by the Minister of Information in his offices, putting out glossy pamphlets in New York and in London. Sir, before I leave this subject of our image abroad, I want to suggest to the Government that it should set up a little school for coaching the television &#x201C;stars&#x201D; who appear on its behalf on the overseas screens. For instance, the hon. the Minister of Justice, who is so fond of complaining of the inaccurate statements which have caused so much damage overseas, should realize that some of the half-truths that he puts across, cause just as much damage. I refer to a report of an appearance he made on television in New York not so long ago&#x2014; in fact throughout America because it was a C.B.S. television programme which was viewed by millions of people throughout the United States&#x2014;in which I understand the hon. the Minister, when asked about passes, produced his identity card and said that he too, a White man. has to carry his identity card, which is quite half-true, not quite true, because the hon. the Minister forgot to add that he does not get arrested if he does not produce his identity card on demand. This information, of course, was filled in by the interviewer who happened to know more about South Africa than perhaps the hon. Minister knew. I might say that a comment on this programme in the <i>New York Times</i> read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The producer skilfully allowed officials of the Government to return the most devastating indictment of their own policy. He merely let them talk.</block>

<p>Apparently the most devastating indictment of the Government&#x2019;s own policies is to let Government spokesman talk on television.</p>

<p>Then there is the hon. Commissioner General of the Transkei who also recently made a television appearance in Britain, I understand. The interviewer had just shown a map of South Africa depicting the Bantustans as scattered spots thereon. He then asked Mr. Hans Abraham whether he thought that these scattered spots could function as a unit, and this was the answer: &#x201C;Well, you know, a leopard has unconnected spots scattered over his skin. This does not make him any less of a leopard.&#x201D; Well, this sort of absurd spectacle of representatives of the Government appear on television, I can assure hon. members opposite, does far more harm to South Africa&#x2019;s image abroad than anything else I can think of.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has presented again the idea of Bantustan as the ethical background to apartheid, as something which would placate opinions throughout the world. I must say that to me it is astonishing that we should spend so much time discussing this imaginary South Africa consisting of Bantustan on the one hand and White South Africa on the other. The real South Africa is what we should be discussing, and the real South Africa is, always has been and always will be a multi-racial country. If all the apartheid legislation which has been put on the Statute Book over the past 14 years can only achieve these things, that there are nearly 1,000,000 more Africans in the urban areas than Whites, more than three times as many Africans in the urban areas than there were ten years ago, and three times as many Africans as Whites employed in all the major industries in our urban areas, and in only three of our principal cities do Whites outnumber Blacks, then I say we are wasting our time on pipe dreams discussing a South Africa consisting on the one hand of Bantustans and of White South Africa on the other. Nothing, but nothing, can possibly happen in the next 15 years which can alter this.</p>

<p>Because of our great natural resources, because of the imagination and the intelligence of our entrepreneurs and perhaps mainly because members opposite also like to enjoy a high standard of living&#x2014; because of all these factors the economic development of South Africa will proceed apace, because economics is stronger than politics and, Sir, the prerequisite for economic development in South Africa is an adequate supply of African labour. That is the prerequisite, and this applies whether the development is taking place in the private sector or in the government sector or in the semi-state sector such as Sasol or Foscor or Iscor. An adequate supply of African labour is what is necessary. I know that hon. members take comfort from their belief that the labour coming into the so called White areas will be migrant labour. I want to assure them that they are wrong here because the trend will be away from the use of migrant labour and not towards it. The reason for this is that the whole complexion of South African industry is changing and in fact has already changed. It is no longer the type of industry which require unskilled workers. It is industry that requires semi-skilled and skilled workers, people who can work machines in this country. and that sort of labour cannot be migratory labour.</p>

<p>It has to be trained labour and it has to be stabilized and therefore the tendency will be for migratory labour to decrease and not increase, and I want to warn <span class="col_105-106" refersTo="page_0067"/>hon. members too that if they think they will find Africans who are migratory workers easier to deal with, in any way, than stabilized labour, they are wrong there too, because if there is anything that is difficult to deal with it is the thousands upon thousands of rootless men, divorced from their home life in the reserves but nevertheless physically with us in the White area.</p>

<p>What do the mines say about it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member talks about mine labour. First of all, I do not in any case approve of compound labour of any description; let me make that perfectly clear. There is one distinction, however, that South Africa is not responsible for the families of those particular mine workers since the majority of them come from outside our borders. But it is bad labour and it will be increasingly difficult to use this sort of labour. The mines themselves realize this, and if they were given the opportunity they would stabilize the mine worker just as they have done on the Rhodesian copper belt and just as they wanted to do in the Orange Free State gold mines. I want to say that no plans for the development of border industries or for the development inside the reserves will stop labourers coming into the White areas. Hon. members opposite are constantly telling us that we have 1,000,000 foreign Africans coming into South Africa to work despite the oppressive conditions in this country and despite the relative freedom that Africans enjoy in their own areas. Does it not strike them that exactly the same thing is going to happen with Bantustans? Even if &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; or complete political autonomy were given to Africans living in our reserves, nevertheless, the full factor of the high wages paid in the White areas and the push factor of poverty in those areas is still going to drive them into White South Africa to work here, to be physically amongst us. Sir, the crux of the problem is the same. It remains what it always has been. The fact is that we have to cater economically politically and socially and in every single way for two-thirds of the African population who will always live and will always work outside the Bantustans and in the so-called White Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>I do not want to repeat that this is a multiracial country and that the problem, as I have said, is going to remain the same. I do not want to repeat over and over again in this House the policy of the Party that I represent. I think it is fairly well-known. I simply want to say that in short we accept the fact that South Africa is multi-racial, and we realize that adaptations on a great scale have to be made in South Africa. We accept that the 12,000,000 non-Whites are with us and will always be with us&#x2014;in fact in increasing numbers&#x2014;will have a great deal to say not only about the economic future of this country, with which they are already inextricably bound up, but also in the political future of this country. Quite ineluctably they will have a great deal of say in the political future of this country, and it is silly for us to bluff ourselves to talk of isolation, to pretend that we can work out our own destiny. We cannot do so to-day. The world is one great interdependent unit, and not only will the Africans, the Coloureds and the Indians within our borders determine the political future of the country, but what the outside world wants, will also have a determining effect on this country. It is ridiculous to ignore this fact.</p>

<p>A great deal of time has been spent in this debate on a discussion of the United Nations. We have heard the United Nations called a bunch of Afro-Asian states and that the Afro-Asian states together with the communist bloc rule the United Nations.</p>

<p>That is true.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not true. If the hon. member would simply bother to examine the votes on different subjects at the United Nations, he would find that the so-called Afro-Asian bloc does not often act as a bloc at all. On many occasions it splits. There is the Monrovian bloc, there is the Casablanca bloc, and they vote differently on different issues. Many of them vote completely differently from the communist countries. [Interjections.] I can quote examples. Hon. members do not know what they are talking about when they say that the Afro-Asian bloc always vote together and that they always vote together with the communist bloc in order to dominate the Assembly. Sir, I could mention various measures before the United Nations where there was a complete split in the voting. But one thing which I will say is that there is one subject on which there is complete solidarity, where the Afro-Asian and the communist and the Western nations show a complete solidarity, and that is on the question of racial discrimination. In that regard there is no differentiation. It is a seriously deceptive half-truth to tell this country, as the Government does and as Radio South Africa does and as our Information Services do, unfortunately, as even members of the official Opposition sometimes do, that our only enemies are the Afro-Asian, and the communists. This is not so. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) quoted a speech of Mr. Patrick Wall yesterday at the United Nations where he referred to the &#x201C;abomination of apartheid &#x201D;. He said a great deal more. Sir, the United Kingdom and the United States have expressed their feeling about racial discrimination over and over again in very strong terms. I do not agree with the statement made in the Opening Speech that &#x201C;thoughtful people abroad are beginning to show an increasing appreciation of the Republic&#x2019;s firmness of purpose and its determination to solve its problems in its own way and with fairness to all&#x201D;, nor do I agree that thoughtful people are beginning to consider us as the great bulwark against Communism on the African continent. Quite the contrary. The Western nations fear that the racially discriminatory policy practiced by the <span class="col_107-108" refersTo="page_0068"/>White race in South Africa is going to be the very factor that is going to drive the as yet uncommitted African nations into the arms of the communists. This is one of the great fears that they are constantly voicing. My experience abroad differs considerably from that of other members who have also been globe-trotting in the recess. [Interjections.] Well, we did not flock together and in fact we had different experiences entirely. Most of the people to whom I spoke&#x2014;and I spoke to people in all walks of life, people in official positions, ordinary citizens like teachers and taxi drivers and anybody who was willing to discuss things with me&#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, especially liberals. Astonishingly enough I found thousands of liberals. In fact, it is the accepted creed of civilized countries as the hon. member should know. I found that most people did not consider as a bulwark against Communism, and they did not express growing appreciation and approval of our policy, as Senator Ellender allegedly did. What they did was to express surprise that South Africa is as peaceful as it is, given the conditions that operate in this country. It is true that a few people, since I visited the Southern States as well, did express some agreement with the Government&#x2019;s racial policy&#x2014;people like Senator Ellender. I did not see him but I saw many people in the Southern States who agreed with him. There were people, for instance, who belonged to the White Citizens&#x2019; Council who bought Negroes one-way tickets to President Kennedy&#x2019;s summer home, telling these people that there were lots of jobs waiting for them there. So they sent them off to park themselves outside President Kennedy&#x2019;s home. These are the sort of people who naturally agree with the racial policies of the government. [Interjection.] &#x201C;A good idea.&#x201D; says the hon. member behind me. I am surprised that he himself has not thought of that before. I can only tell him that the thoughtful people to whom I spoke did not regard the White Citizens&#x2019; Council very highly in America, and as I said earlier, the whole pronounced policy in the United States is against racial discrimination. Efforts are being made in every field in the country&#x2014; housing, employment, franchise and education &#x2014;to do away with racial discrimination as fast as possible. That is the official policy of the United States of America.</p>

<p>Sir. no country can afford to have racial discrimination because racial discrimination breeds frustration and frustration breeds bitterness and eventually it will breed a blood-bath in this country. Sir, there were also people who expressed the view that it would be foolish to hand this country over to illiterate non-Whites, but that is very different from saying that they condone racial discrimination. There is a tremendous difference between saying on the one hand that you do not believe that the government of the country should be handed over to illiterate people and saying on the other hand that you approve of racial discrimination, and this, I believe, is where the Government makes its mistake, it does not realize that when people say that they approve of retaining control in the hands of responsible people, as against illiterates, it does not mean that they approve of racial discrimination. Very often too I find that members on the Government side mistake politeness for approval. People abroad are often very polite to visitors, but this does not necessarily mean that they approve of the Government&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite have constantly said &#x201C;what about Rhodesia?&#x201D; They are taking comfort in the thought that White Rhodesians have joined them in the laager. They gloat about the fact that Black Rhodesians have turned their backs on the concept of partnership. Sir, are people so foolish in this country as to believe that the recent elections in Rhodesia mark a closing chapter in the history of that country? Do they not realize that the whole of the continent of Africa is in a period of transition and that a great deal is going to happen on this continent before the closing chapters are in fact written? If there is anything that we should learn from the lesson of Rhodesia, it is that it is no good offering concessions too late, to offer them when the Black man has lost all confidence in the assurances and promises of the White man. That is the one lesson that we should have learnt from Rhodesia and I say that members of this House are stupid if they believe that the closing chapters have been written in Rhodesia. The whole of this continent is in a state of transition, and none of these temporary factors as a totalitarian government in Ghana or chaos in the Congo or the elections in Rhodesia are going to spell the closing chapters on the continent of Africa. A great deal is going to happen in this country and on the continent of Africa before the closing chapters are written, and one thing is absolutely certain and that is that there is one known and noticeable trend and that is in the direction of the removal of racial discrimination. No longer can you consider the African an alien illiterate mass. We must realize that to-day he is an individual who is demanding his individual rights and who is demanding a share in the destiny of whatever country happens to be his birthplace. There is no doubt whatever in my mind that the same thing will be realized here as has been and will be realized elsewhere on the continent, no matter what steps the Government takes to try to stop it. The present Government, of course, is determined to do everything in its power to halt that trend, to pass one piece of oppressive legislation after another, but I think we should be under no illusion. As long as there are people who are denied rights of political expression, who are denied equal opportunities <span class="col_109-110" refersTo="page_0069"/>in the economic field, who live the barrack like sort of life that the Africans live in this country who are denied normal family life, so long will individuals and groups of individuals continue to find some means of expressing their frustration. The Government to-day have left such people with few measures other than violent means of expressing their frustrations. It refuses to understand that if non-violent protests are not allowed, if peaceful meetings are not allowed, then the non-violent protests will be replaced by violent protests. If moderate leaders are silenced, they will be replaced by extremist leaders. This is what the Government fails to realize. It does not realize that house-arrest, commissions of inquiry and sabotage acts will not help in the long run. It is quite possible, I agree, to govern by force for a very long time, but in the long run consent must be obtained; coercion cannot work forever.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by quoting remarks that were made in a court of law by Mandela before he was sentenced. I want to quote from his defence in his own trial. This is what he said. I think members of this House should know what is being said by African leaders in this country&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Always we have been conscious of our obligations as citizens to avoid breaches of the law, where such breaches can be avoided to prevent clash between the authorities and our people, where such a clash can be prevented, but nevertheless we have been driven to speak up for what we believe is right and work for it and try to bring about changes which will satisfy our human conscience &#x2026; Government violence can do only one thing and that is to breed counter-violence. We have warned repeatedly that the Government by resorting continually to violence will breed, in this country counter violence amongst the people, till ultimately if there is no dawning of sanity on the part of the Government, ultimately the dispute between the Government and my people will finish up by being settled in violence and by force. Already there are indications in the country that people. my people, Africans, are turning to deliberate acts of violence and of force against the Government in order to persuade the Government in the only language which this Government shows by its own behaviour, that it understands.</block>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) on her new leader, Mandela. She came along here with a quotation from Mandela who, as we know, does not even speak on behalf of his own people but accuses the Government of itself being an oppressor because he wants to blame the Government for the results of his violence or the agitation which he provokes. If she wants to make Mandela her leader that is up to her.</p>

<p>I want to go further. I want to start with a remark made by the hon. member for Houghton to the effect that the whole of Europe was amazed, as she was, that there was so much peace in South Africa and not more violence. She probably spoke to the committees overseas which all collected money for the users of force and the agitators and the people who want to commit sabotage here. Perhaps she connived with them. However, let me tell her that she lost a golden opportunity to explain to those people why there is so much peace prevailing in this country. Apparently she was not able to do so because she belongs to the group in South Africa whom I shall call the levellers; that is, a process of the destruction of the West, namely, to try and bring everything in the world down to the same level. However, let me tell her this: because she belongs to that group it has not yet penetrated her mind that the only reason why there is peace in South Africa, more than in other parts of Africa, is because we have a policy here which recognizes the identity of each separate race. We recognize each race by a policy which has become a curse in the world because it has been misrepresented. We recognize the particular attributes of every race in this country and we are the only country in the world to do so. When we come to an analysis of the community in South Africa we find that it is not a &#x201C;multi-racial society &#x201D;. [Laughter.] The hon. member laughs because she is a know-all. She cannot put it higher than to say that we have &#x201C;racially plural societies &#x201D;. We have the society of the Whites and we have the society of the Blacks but we know that the society of the Blacks is not homogeneous; we know that that society itself consists of a group of people who want to have nothing to do with one another and who cannot tolerate one another. Besides having <span class="col_111-112" refersTo="page_0070"/>the Whites and the Blacks we also have the Brown people who are the closest to the Whites and then we also have the Yellow people who have their own civilization of which they boast and which according to them is far better than ours or that of the Brown people. Mr. Speaker, when we make that analysis and when our point of departure is that each of these groups has the right to be what it is and that each of them has the right to be so without being maligned by others, and where we in our legislation deal with each as a separate group, we then remove points of friction. It is of course obvious that in a similar society one has all sorts of adaptations, reconciliations and compromises which one will find nowhere else in the world because this is the only place in the world where we have this sort of society, namely four communities within the same political borders.</p>

<p>However, that is beyond the comprehension of the hon. member; and it is beyond the comprehension of the people with whom the hon. member associates. It is beyond the comprehension of the people who seek to level everything. If they see differences they pretend that they do not exist although they know that they are important differences. However, those differences are important differences, Mr. Speaker. As soon as the economic laws take effect and as soon as people are fed and clothed, they look around and say: Who are our people? The Whites do it; the Blacks do it because they are also human beings; the Yellow people do it and the Brown people do it. If we do not afford people in South Africa an opportunity of giving expression to their own particular attributes, it will be the finish of the whole world. If she has her way she will have nothing in this country but disturbances; not disturbances dealing with strikes and economic matters but disturbances between men belonging to different groups. That is what she will have.</p>

<p>The hon. member is going in one direction to level everything that there is to level. However, because she herself belongs to a group which has applied apartheid strictly over the centuries, she does not need it because she is in no danger. She ought to know that. She merely places it on another level; she says that it is a religious level and we may not talk about it. She enjoys the benefit of the apartheid applied by her own group; she is in a safe bastion in that regard but those who do not have such a religious apartheid of that nature have to practice equality. I have a relative who is married to a Jew. At the moment she is a teacher of Hebrew in Israel but she had to become a Jewess. If she had not done so her husband&#x2019;s parents would have gone into mourning for him for more than a year. However, that has nothing to do with politics. Those are simply the facts and they explain the background of the hon. member for Houghton. They also explain her attitude in connection with the racial composition and the racial legislation of South Africa. I think that I can leave the hon. member for Houghton to her own conscience. She can think about it and revise her analysis of the South African society.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) revealed an approach which I would like to analyse. The hon. member for Germiston (District) accused us of not replying to the attack of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He said that we did not try to refute the case which his leader made out. Let me tell him this: The fault does not lie with us. The fault lies with the case. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition did nothing but generalize. Now the hon. member for Germiston (District) says that we must reply to those generalities. Generalities are only academic. If we have to reply to similar generalities they become academic. The hon. member for Orange Grove made certain wild allegations although he added a few things to which I want to reply if time permits. I want to pay the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a compliment by saying that I must take him seriously and not as an academic. He accused us of all sorts of things. He accused us of not wanting to seek friends at a hostile UN. He also accused us of not seeking friends in connection with our problems in regard to South West Africa.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>Then I was mistaken and the <i>Burger</i> was also mistaken. I am very pleased to hear that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not talk about South West Africa because I think that the less we talk about it the better. Nevertheless the accusation was that we do not want to seek friends in a hostile UN and a hostile West.</p>

<p>When somebody makes such accusations it presupposes that he has some way of removing that hostility if he is given the opportunity of doing so. He also said towards the end of his speech that when this Government accepts the race federation plan of the United Party it is possible that the West, and it is highly probable that UN, will have a different opinion of us.</p>

<p>It is particularly difficult for me to adopt a standpoint against the benefits which, in his view, will flow from his federation plan because nobody actually knows what it really contains. I have tried to understand it. In it I see a number of ideas which were borrowed from the National Party. It presupposes apartheid: it presupposes certain Bantustans; it presupposes geographical units&#x2014;for example, like Xhosaland; it also presupposes entities completely separate from the White community. I will produce proof in this regard in a moment. He borrowed this from the National Party. However, because in his own view he is now in bad company he has to borrow further and he brings a political concept into it, namely, that of a federation between the <span class="col_113-114" refersTo="page_0071"/>races. That is to make the plan more attractive. Then he goes further and he tries to frame a constitution as the Progressive Party does, a constitution which will be stable and which will be inflexible and which will entrench the rights of the various groups. Therefore, he borrows from all the parties. He has made a political camel for himself in this way. It must obviously be a camel because he will have to stay with it in the desert for a long time.</p>

<p>1 want to tell the hon. Leader of the Opposition that there is one member of his party who has more courage than he has, the courage to place on record what he thinks his leader considers to be the meaning of race federation. This is the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) who is not here now. In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 3rd December 1961&#x2014; this was shortly after the last election&#x2014;he recorded what he believed to be the United Party&#x2019;s interpretation of race federation. This is the only document which I can use to ask the hon. Leader of the Opposition whether he thinks that in this way he will find peace and friendship at UN. I want to read to you, Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member for Yeoville wrote. He said that as far as their race federation plan was concerned there were three phases. The second phase was that they would effect certain very important and urgent reforms very soon. The reforms are the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To restore the century-old rights of the Coloured people in the Cape and in Natal and to extend rights to those in other provinces: to give the African people up to eight White representatives in Parliament; to give our Indian population representation and other privileges as permanent citizens of South Africa.</block>

<p>I want to ask him this: Does the hon. Leader of the Opposition think that if this is the second instalment&#x2014;I am not even mentioning the first instalment because that is merely the repealing of a few laws&#x2014;that if they place the Coloureds on the Common Roll, if they give all the Natives in South Africa eight representatives either in this House or in the Senate, if they give some measure of representation to the Indians, in that way they will gain favour at UN? Does he still remember how General Smuts could achieve nothing when he gave representation to the Indians? That was in 1945. Does he think that he will do better than General Smuts did in 1946 when he told that story to UN? That is the first point I want to make. This is the race federation plan which he hails as the panacea which will provide us with friends.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The third phase will be the introduction and development of a federation of the races in South Africa. Its final details will be determined after full discussion and consultation between the Government and the various race groups in our country. As far as possible it will be developed and implemented as a result of such consultation.</block>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether he thinks that he will do better at UN than Mr. Whitehead who went there and said: Look here, I am going to do this and I promise you that in 15 years time there will be a Black man&#x2019;s Government in Southern Rhodesia. They sent him home with a flea in his ear. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition think that he will do better if he says: We will talk with Luthuli. we will talk with Mandela and we will still have an <i>entre nous</i> with one or more of the people who are at the moment perhaps, or ought to be. behind bars? Does he think that he will do better than General Smuts and the gentlemen from Southern Rhodesia did? I ask this of all the hon. members opposite and I ask it of the hon. member for Orange Grove who like a faithful echo actually tried to sing his own chorus on this subject. There is a third point which is contained in this race federation proposal of the hon. Leader of the Opposition and the United Party. You will remember. Sir, that the great grievance of the world against us is in regard to discrimination. They cannot understand that we are not a group of levellers: that we draw a distinction between race and race. The hon. member for Yeoville goes further and says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Separate residential areas are a feature of urban life. These separate urban complexes can be given developing powers of self-determination. They can then combine in higher authorities to control matters of peculiar interest to them.</block>

<p>Does he think that when he tells UN he is going to continue with separate residential areas he will make any impression upon them? Does he think that he will make any impression on the United States where they have sent an entire army to keep one Black man at a White university and where they regard Little Rock as a sort of historical occurrence? I am not even talking about the Afro-Asian group which wants to know nothing about any differentiation between White and non-White.</p>

<p>I must say that it could only be a person with boundless optimism&#x2014;a fool, if you will allow me to say so. Mr. Speaker&#x2014;who believes that he will make any impression upon a spoilt, obsession and prejudiced world by means of that proposal and that argument.</p>

<p>I want to quote further from this race federation plan, the plan which is now held up to be the sound plan which we must accept for the sake of the friendship of the world. In this question of race federation, the great problem is who must have the franchise and how many of which group there must be. The hon. member for Yeoville says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The answer to this has not yet been found.</block>

<p><span class="col_115-116" refersTo="page_0072"/>Nor does that amaze me, Sir. In a later speech which was reported in a Port Elizabeth newspaper he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Several interesting suggestions are being considered. One, for example, is that representation in the Assembly should be related to the contribution a particular group makes to the national income.</block>

<p>If ever anyone made a ridiculous statement then it was the hon. member for Yeoville. I read an article by Desmond Buckle, a West-African Negro writing for the <i>Daily Worker,</i> and he argues that the Blacks of this country subsidize the White people to an amount of &#x00A3;300,000,000 per annum. He says that as the national income rises that subsidy will rise. In other words, they have money to subsidize us with and still contribute towards the economy of the country. I challenge any economist, any statistician within or outside the United Party to make an analysis of the contribution of each of us to the national economy. That is simply not possible because the wages earned by the individual is nowhere near his contribution; the tax which he pays is not proportionate to his contribution. It is possible that we may have an industrial leader who is a very unassuming man and receives a very modest wage but who through his initiative and his organization makes a very large contribution towards the growth of our economy and towards our national income. I would like to see how the United Party are going to make that analysis.</p>

<p>Does the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) think that he will ever be able to make an analysis of. for example, what the Xhosas. the Zulus, the Basutos&#x2014;to mention three of the groups whom they will have to consider&#x2014;contribute to the national income so that he can say how many representatives they are entitled to?</p>

<p>We have another strange remark. When UN asks them when they are going to introduce this wonderful federation plan the hon. member for Yeoville says that it is obvious that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; for the foreseeable future the power will remain in the hands of the White group, not because they are White, but because they are in fact as a group the vehicle of our civilization and guardians of Western standards.</block>

<p>Will he be able to say that to Ghana? Will they accent the fact that the White people are more civilized than the Blacks? It will simply be adding fuel to the flames if somebody tries to tell those people that the bearers of civilization are not the Black people of Africa but the White people, not because they are White but because they are more civilized. There is an English proverb which says that comparisons are odious. However, in this particular case that English proverb did not penetrate at all to the writer of this article. So much then for the excellence of the race federation plan to bring us peace and friendship with the West.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition accused us, and particularly the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs, of not having made prior plans to combat the assumed disadvantages&#x2014;&#x201C; assumed&#x201D; is my own word&#x2014; which will follow upon Britain joining the European Economic Community. Britain is not yet a member of that community but he is already starting to accuse us of not taking steps to combat the disadvantages if Britain does become a member. In other words, we must not only be prophets but after we have used our gift of prophesy we must take steps long before the time arrives to combat the prophesied disadvantages. However, he did not mention one single fact to prove that things would go worse with us afterwards than they did before. I can well understand that the British Government would prefer to see us treated differently from members of the Commonwealth. If we receive the same rights as the members of the British Commonwealth then of course the fact that a state is a member will not help much. Accordingly, they will try to give us something less than they demand for their own people. That is on the cards. However, it is not for him to accuse the hon. Minister and say that this will happen. The most he can say that it is the policy of the National Party which has led to the fact that we have been kicked out of the Commonwealth, as they put it, although we withdrew. He can perhaps say that it was a wrong policy but that matter has already been settled. He now accuses us in a vague way without saying anything in regard to what actually can go wrong. We ourselves know that we may lose our preferences, but our reply to that is that England will suffer just as much harm if the preferences which we enjoy in England are terminated when we in turn suspend the preferences which England enjoys here.</p>

<p>Then he reproaches us and says that we are pickling a rod for our own backs with our policy of the Bantustans. He says that we already have so many borders around our country that we cannot even guard all of them. The hon. member for Orange Grove went further and said that stock theft would increase so much that we would not even be able to catch the thieves in their places of refuge. I wonder whether the hon. member for Orange Grove considered what he said. Let us accept the fact that they are going to become independent states. Surely we will have extradition treaties. Say for example a thief escapes from here to Portuguese East Africa. Will we not have him extradited? That is surely the easiest thing in the world. In any case, it is so ridiculous that one really cannot reply to it.</p>

<p>Do you want to tell me, Mr. Speaker, that we will then be in a different position from the one in which we were previously? Imagine, for example, that the revolution in Angola is a success. What will become of Bechuanaland? <span class="col_117-118" refersTo="page_0073"/>Let us imagine that Bechuanaland receives her independence as Basutoland will receive it. What is to prevent their concluding alliances with foreign powers? But, there is no reason to make that assumption. It is an insult to the Natives themselves because where are their friends? Who are their friends? Their friends are their neighbours. Hon. members opposite have insulted the educated and the decent Native by what they have said and they have fouled their own nest. As far as I am concerned I believe in the Afrikaans proverb which states: &#x201C;Dit is &#x2019;n slegte vo&#x00EB;l wat sy eie nes bevuil.&#x201D; (It is a bad bird which fouls its own nest.)</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) who has just sat down did not make use of his opportunity this afternoon to tell us what the advantages will be if the Government follows its declared policy. On the contrary, he prefered to tell us what will happen if the United Party comes into power. He again asked all sorts of questions about the race federation plan of the United Party. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other leading members on this side of the House have already explained it repeatedly to the people and to members on the other side. The hon. member for Standerton did that deliberately. I predict that just as each member who spoke before him did. every member who speaks after him will try to tell the people what they think the race federation plan of the United Party is.</p>

<p>This House is not to-day engaged in the year 1963 in discussing the federation plan of the United Party; it is not discussing the apartheid policy of 1948. No, Mr. Speaker, this House and the people outside are discussing the 1963 apartheid policy of this Government. The apartheid policy of the Government on that side differs very widely to-day from the policy which they submitted to the people of South Africa in 1948. South Africa stands at the cross-roads of her history. South Africa is on the point of departing from the traditional policy which she has followed for 300 years. The policy followed by this Government to-day is taking an entirely new direction. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) and other members on the other side have said repeatedly that this Government is not fragmenting South Africa; according to them the history of South Africa has already fragmented the country. But that is not so. Where in the history of South Africa over the past 150 years have we had independent Bantu areas, independent areas which were divorced from South Africa? [Interjections.] Of course we have had areas in South Africa which by tradition were mainly Black. Nobody denies that, but they have always formed an integral part of South Africa. That is the history of South Africa. It was not fragmented into a Kaizer Mantanzima area or a Tswana area, each one having its own independence. Since the end of the last Bantu wars which we had in South Africa there has not been one Native area which has been independent of South Africa.</p>

I want to ask the hon. member for Brits whether he does not think that the race federation plan of the United Party is a continuation of that policy. Let the hon. member for Brits tell me if any great leader, even the late Dr. Malan, ever said that it was his policy to create separate states in South Africa, or &#x201C;afgeskeie state&#x201D;, as the hon. the Prime Minister is fond of calling them. No, if there is a party which is continuing to follow the traditional pattern which has been followed here for more than 300 years, it is the party on this side of the House and its leader. The Native areas, the so-called Native reserves, have undeniably become part of South Africa, but the apartheid which we are discussing in 1963 is not the same apartheid on which this Government came into power in 1948. From 1948 to 1963 this Government has been concerned mainly with laying down the conventions, the traditions of South Africa in legislation. It has simply laid down in legislation its traditional way of life, that of segregation in the social and residential sphere.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that point. The accusation from my side of the House against the Nationalist Party over the past 15 years has been that the Nationalist Party has sought to follow a policy of total territorial segregation in South Africa, and that apartheid is only assuming its form now in 1963. Territorial and total apartheid is only being started in South Africa now, in 1963. It has only been since the hon. the Prime Minister has taken over the Nationalist Party, and particularly since 1959 and since his new visionary speech of that year that we have had this new idea of full self-determination for the Bantu, and it is particularly since last year <span class="col_119-120" refersTo="page_0074"/>that the hon. the Prime Minister has started with the idea of the development of separate states. I want to point out to the House that on 23 January 1962 the hon. the Prime Minister said the following (Hansard, col. 70-71)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; separate states must be developed. Ultimately separate states must be created for the groups which originally settled here and the greatest possible degree of governmental separation must be given to the groups which have grown up in our midst.</block>

<p>That is the direction which he definitely indicated last year. It is a radical change and we on this side of the House are entitled to put a number of questions to the other side of the House. The first question that we have to ask is this: Are the people of South Africa aware of this tremendous change which has come about? Have the people given their decision?</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister dealt with that in a speech in 1959 when we had his new vision, but the year before last, prior to the election, we had this statement from him, and at that time nothing was said. Let me put it this way: At every election since 1948 the Government has asked the people for a mandate&#x2014;I admit that&#x2014;to keep South Africa White and to keep the White man in control. Is that not true? They asked for mastery (baaskap). Who can forget &#x2014;can the people of South Africa forget&#x2014; these words which were uttered by the late J. G. Strydom: &#x201C;Vote for South Africa; vote for the National Party to Keep South Africa White.&#x201D; We experienced that in every election. Even the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the hon. the Minister of Education&#x2014;all of them&#x2014;said: &#x201C;Vote for the National Party to keep South Africa White.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that normally I am always prepared to answer questions but I think hon. members on the other side are rather abusing my willingness to answer questions.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, not one word was said at the election of 1961 that we would have separate states in our country. You will agree with me that a prerequisite for the success of any policy is that the policy must be understood, and I say that this policy of the hon. the Prime Minister has never been explained to the people of South Africa. When I say this I do not want to quote the United Party; I want to quote the nationalists. If that policy was submitted to the people in 1961, would it not have been known to a man like ex-Senator Smit? Listen to what Mr. H. J. Smit has to say, according to the <i>Burger</i> of 17 August of last year. [Translation.]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We hoped up to a short while ago that the statements of the Government regarding Bantu homelands were merely fabrications&#x2014;we were certainly not told about the Transkei plan prior to the election in 1961&#x2014;but that hope has now been dashed.</block>

<p>Hon. members on the other side can no longer tell me that it was we who kept the people in the dark, that we were wrong. Here you have the speech of a leading member of the Nationalist Party, an ex-Senator who states that this Government did not fully inform the people of South Africa before the election in 1961.</p>

<p>When we told the people that the policy of this Government would result in territorial separation and total apartheid eventually becoming the policy of the National Party we were told that the United Party was wrong. We <span class="col_121-122" refersTo="page_0075"/>know how they ridiculed the maps of the United Party which we published to show how the Black states in South Africa would develop. I contend that it was the reaction of the people in 1959 which shook the Government. You must not forget that in the provincial election in 1959 the United Party reduced Nationalist majorities and even took back the Boksburg seat from them. When the Nationalist Party noticed this, they realized that there was one thing which they had to keep away from the people and that was their Bantustan policy. I contend that it was for that reason that we did not hear a word about it prior to the election in 1961. But the House of Assembly had scarcely met when the hon. the Prime Minister and the Nationalist Party announced the policy with a flourish. I want to say, on the basis of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own words on 23 January 1962 that in 1961 when the election was held the Government must already have known of all the plans and that those plans must all have been cut and dried. It was impossible for them to get those plans ready in the period between the election in October in 1961 and the Session in January 1962. What did the hon. the Prime Minister tell us? (Hansard, col. 75)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is to say. the Government implements its plans from stage to stage as the Bantu progress. The granting of responsibilities will not be separate, unrelated steps but will form part of a progressive development&#x2014;not progressive in the Houghton sense of the word!.</block>

<p>If the hon. the Prime Minister wants to apply it step by step in this way. I contend that the Nationalist Party and the whole of the Cabinet knew of the plan before the election of 1961 but left the people of South Africa in the dark.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to make a further accusation, namely, that to make a success of this policy of separate states the Government is now seeking to bring about complete territorial segregation. No longer are we dealing merely with 6, 500,000 Natives within our own White areas as mentioned in the Tomlinson Report. I contend that this House under the guidance of this Government wishes to go further than Tomlinson envisaged for the year 2.000. In other words, I contend that it is now the policy of this Government to effect complete separation between White and Black in South Africa. I say this too in pursuance of what the hon. the Prime Minister said last year and I want to quote from col. 71 of Hansard of 23 January 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But, thirdly, we have the example of how, throughout history, the creation of states has brought with it contentment, not only in the present age but right throughout history.</block>

<block name="quote">Africa has been given satisfaction through the creation of states, and where there is conflict that is as a result of the fact that these new states are not states which embrace national entities but which have state boundaries cutting right across national entities. There they have trouble. Difficulties arise where the founders try to throw together in one state more than one national community.</block>

<p>Lest anyone should say that I am quoting the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s words out of their context, I just want to say that I have omitted a paragraph or two which have nothing to do with the final point which the hon. the Prime Minister made. I want to quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When, however, people of different nationalities were forced together into one state, the result was an ever-present canker until the whole body disintegrated. We must realize that here we are in a similar position. In those instances national entities with the same degree of civilization and the same colour could not be held together &#x2026;</block>

<p>Are we still not going to have the position where we will have 6, 500,000 Natives forced together in our cities&#x2014;foreign national units?</p>

<p>My point is this: According to the hon. the Prime Minister and according to the political philosophy of the Nationalist Party itself, are we not going to experience difficulty with the 6, 500,000 Natives within our own areas? If we do not want any trouble, according to the philosophy of the Nationalist Party, then those people must leave. Are you surprised therefore if the hon. Leader of the Opposition says that this policy of the Government&#x2019;s will lead to trouble and planned poverty throughout the entire country? Let me mention one example&#x2014; the 800,000 economically active Natives on our farms. If we remove them, where are the people to take their places? Together with their families, there are nearly 2, 500,000 people on our farms alone, not to mention our industries.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow must consult the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) who wants all the Natives removed from the Western Province. The hon. member for Moorreesburg told us a few months ago that the spirit which prevails in Cape Town must also prevail in the north; in other words, since the Nationalist Party seeks to remove the Natives from our European areas here, the same thing must also be applied in the Transvaal and other northern provinces. Was it not the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) who also told us that our entire Orange River scheme should be based on White labour; that there should be no place for the Native?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park. If we are to carry out what the hon. Prime Minister said on 23 January 1962, namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When, however, people of different nationalities were forced together into one state, the result was an ever-present canker until the whole body disintegrated.</block>

<p>then the 6, 500,000 Natives must be removed from our White areas. Does the hon. member for Moorreesburg want our entire life to disintegrate like a canker? If the hon. member does not agree with the hon. Prime Minister, let him say so. But if he does agree with the hon. the Prime Minister he must be in favour of a policy to remove all the Natives from the White areas. Let him say this to the people too. The people are entitled to know it. and we have the right to ask it. The policy of the Government is very clear. The Western Province is to be treated as some sort of guinea pig. They want to start here and they want to continue the process in other parts of South Africa.</p>

<p>There is another matter that I want to mention. We know that the people of South Africa are morally bound to abide by the settlement of 1936. the promise which was made to the Natives that they would receive more land. But I contend that if this Government continues with its policy of territorial segregation and of creating separate states in South Africa, we will not only have to purchase the balance of the land from the Natives but the people of South Africa will have to be asked to make very much greater sacrifices. Very much more land will then have to be provided than was envisaged in 1936.</p>

<p>If, according to the Tomlinson report, there are 6, 500,000 Natives in the White areas and one wants to follow a policy of removing those people who are there in too large numbers, one will certainly have to have more land. If one wants to go further than the Tomlinson report and remove more Natives, one will need more land. All these things simply prove to us and to the electorate how revolutionary this policy is which they started in 1962 and what tremendous sacrifices the Whites will be asked to make. After the Whites have made all these sacrifices, the White man in South Africa will still not know whether this policy of the present Government will retain South Africa for him. This Government came into power in 1948 by exploiting the feeling of solidarity of the Whites and by exploiting the position of the Whites in South Africa. This policy of the Government must now be subjected to that test. If the Government keeps its word which it gave in 1948 and in successive elections that it wants to retain South Africa for the White man &#x2026;</p>

<p>I want to remind the hon. member of a speech by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration which was quoted here last year. What did the hon. the Minister say in 1956? He said that it was quite wrong to think that they wanted separate states because the man who said that, spoke without having a knowledge of the Native. In 1959 the hon. the Minister addressed the congress of the Nasionale Jeugbond of his party at Bloemfontein and said that he did not believe that the Natives wanted independent states. But, the hon. the Minister knows that the Natives do expect it to-day. He knows that the son of Victor Poto wants it. Has a promise not been made to those people? Then the hon. member for Brits comes along and wants to tell us that there has been no departure from the policy! The hon. the Ministers of Bantu Administration and Bantu Education go so far as to say that the people can go along and say so if they want &#x201C;one man one vote &#x201D;. The Ministers are bending over backwards to help the Natives. The hon. the Minister even goes so far as to say that to his mind the Zulu language is a more beautiful language than Afrikaans.</p>

<p>All these things are happening so that the Government can explain to the Natives that the policy which they are advocating is that every opportunity must be given to those people to develop. But, in the meantime what are they doing to the White man in South Africa? As the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked: Will what is happening to the north of us not also happen here if we create those Bantustans? I want to draw your attention to what Mr. J. J. Scholtz wrote. I think he is the foreign editor of the <i>Burger.</i> This is what he said on the 21st December last <span class="col_125-126" refersTo="page_0077"/>year.

<p>He states (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Black nationalists to whom I referred just now, because they are Black nationalists, are now working together to implement the Transkei plan.</block>

<p>The article states that it is fundamentally the same as Black nationalism in the rest of Africa and because they are Black nationalists they are now working together to implement the Transkei plan, but that we must not be surprised if, because they are Black nationalists, they begin to insist on equal human rights in a year or two when the Transkei does perhaps have self-government. What does equality of human rights mean? It means equality of human rights at the national level as well. It means that in every respect those people can be precisely what the White man is; and in spite of all this the Government is still provoking the severest criticism at UN. The Government is now seeking to provoke even more severe criticism within our own borders. The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) and other members have already mentioned it. I do not want to elaborate on all the dangers which face South Africa if that policy of the Government is implemented. I want to confine myself to criticizing the Nationalists themselves. I have before me a cutting from the <i>Oosterlig</i> of the 13 th September 1961. This is a report on the Nationalist Party Congress which was held in Bloemfontein where the Nationalists expressed criticism, expressed their hesitancy and suspicion in regard to the position which exists to-day between themselves and Basutoland&#x2014;the border troubles that they have. What did the representatives say? Representatives from the area bordering on Basutoland described the position on the border as a powder-keg. Others said that a feeling of revenge was growing in the hearts of the border farmers and that there was going to be trouble. Mr. Pretorius of Bethlehem said that the agitators in Basutoland made it very difficult for the border farmers. Mr. Olivier of Wepener said that even weapons were being smuggled across the border and that smuggling was an everyday occurrence because the police of Basutoland were easily bribed. Mr. Speaker, these are the troubles which we have to-day with a Bantustan our own borders, a Bantustan which at one time it was the policy of this Government to incorporate in the Republic. I wish hon. members on the other side would peruse all the speeches made in this House in 1954 on a motion introduced by the late Dr. Malan and then they will find that this (border troubles) was one of the reasons which were mentioned as to why those territories should be incorporated. But, the Government has departed from its policy to-day. Nationalists have indicated at their own congress that they are dissatisfied with the position and alarmed at the trouble which will come. But, the Government tells us that that is not enough and that there will not only be one but possibly seven or eight Bantustans, independent states on the borders of South Africa. There is not only one place which will become a powder-keg for South Africa, but if one includes the Protectorates the number is closer to 10. I want to ask hon. members on the other side why they departed from the policy of incorporating the Protectorates.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member who has just sat down tried to make out a case in support of his contention that the National Party has departed from its traditional colour policy, and he tried to produce proof in this regard. If we analyse the proof which he tried to produce, we find that in reality he could have passed no greater judgment upon the United Party&#x2019;s own race federation policy then he in fact did by adducing the proof which he tried to produce to show that we have departed from the traditional colour policy. He accused the Government and the hon. the Prime Minister of having tricked the people; of not having informed the electorate about the development of the Bantu policy as it has developed over the past years. That is untrue. He himself gave the answer and contradicted that statement when he contended that they drew up maps prior to the 1955 provincial election and distributed them throughout the whole country to prove that we were going to fragment South Africa. That is a clear proof that it was already known at that time.</p>

<p>We went from platform to platform and put this policy to the voters. [Interjections.] In March, 1961, during the Commonwealth Conference in London the hon. the Prime Minister in his speech at the South African Club put this question very <span class="col_127-128" refersTo="page_0078"/>clearly and pertinently and I am sure even the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) had his radio turned on that day. I think that there were very few people in South Africa who did not hear that speech and everyone, including the members of the Opposition, listened tensely to the message of the hon. the Prime Minister. In that speech the hon. the Prime Minister made the position very clear, even before the 1961 election. Prior to the election the hon. the Prime Minister put that policy very pertinently and clearly in this House. It seems strange to my mind that a member of this House could be guilty of the type of misrepresentation which we have just heard. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) made statements here which appear strange coming from a member of a party which propounds a policy of race federation. He quoted what Mr. J. J. Scholtz had apparently said&#x2014;that Black nationalism would sweep everything before it. Those same Black people whose nationalism is now being canalized and who are now finding expressions for their nationalism in their own areas, are those to whom they seek to give political rights together with the Whites in South Africa under their federation policy. If our policy constitutes such a deadly danger, how deadly then is the danger which they are creating for the White man in South Africa? If Black nationalism is such a great danger in its own area and in the rest of Africa, will that Black nationalism then become so tame and diluted if the Bantu obtains political rights in this country together with the White man and sits in this House together with the White man? Does he not think they are creating a platform by means of which the Black man will receive even greater power and have more opportunity to agitate for more and more rights and for non-White supremacy as we see it in all the African countries? Can he not realize that they are creating a platform for the agitators? Who will be the people who will sit in this Parliament together with the White man? Will it be the Black man who is taking the lead in the Transkei to-day, or will it be those people who, inspired by White agitators, agitate &#x201C;for one man one vote &#x201D;? Is that not exactly the danger which they are creating?</p>

<p>The hon. member has tried to show that the Transkei or the other non-White homelands will constitute a great danger to the White man in South Africa and that under their policy that danger will be avoided. The hon. Leader of the Opposition has also emphasized this point very strongly, that there will be no stopping them; that things will be taken completely out of the hands of the Government of the Republic once they take the first step towards independence in the Transkei. and that demands will then be made at an increasing tempo. I want to ask the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) this question: Under his federation scheme, if it does become of application and the same people whom he quoted here in order to attack us. who are already demanding their independence, receive independence under their system of race federation, what are they going to do? Are they going to compel those people by force of arms to remain dependent upon the White man? Are they going to force them not to become independent? In what way can they contain those national aspirations of the Black man in the Transkei if they constitute such a deadly danger? Are they not going to give them independence if they ask for it? They are already asking for it. He says that this is the danger which threatens us as Whites&#x2014;that they are already demanding their independence. Will those people not ask for independence under their policy? Do they not realize that that will create a far greater danger? They dare not say it because it is not in conformity with their policy. They simply cannot agree to it, and they will most certainly have to use force in order to compel them to remain dependent. No, I think that the arguments of the hon. member are futile.</p>

<p>Happenings in this country and throughout the whole world give the lie to the arguments used by the Opposition in this debate. They contend that the apartheid policy of the Government, the policy which the hon. member tried to show was a departure from our traditional colour policy, the policy which is a continuation of General Hertzog&#x2019;s policy, the segregation policy started by him, is one which is alienating our friends and isolating us. Or does the hon. member now contend that the federation plan is a continuation of the segregation policy of General Hertzog?</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member this: If the late General Hertzog was so much in favour of independent states in South Africa for the Black people, why was he prepared then to have White people as Natives&#x2019; Representatives in this Parliament?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#sadie">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SADIE</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member not know that that was a compromise with General Smuts at that time? Does the hon. member not know that you have to adapt things to the changing circumstances of the times? No, the hon. member tried to make out a case and I say again that he condemned himself. He condemned his own policy with the arguments he used in trying to attack our policy. I repeat that the arguments that were used to the effect that the colour policy of the Government was isolating South Africa and alienating her friends, are refuted by the facts. Is the opposite not true? In comparison with all the other parts of the world where White and non-White have to live together, is South Africa not the one country in which there is the largest measure of peace and quiet? Is it not here in South Africa where racial harmony is increasing and improving all the while? I say that in contrast to what is happening in other parts of Africa and the world it is precisely the policy of separate development of this Government which is directly responsible for the fact that the relationship between the Whites and non-Whites <span class="col_129-130" refersTo="page_0079"/>in South Africa is improving. Is it not this maligned policy of separate development which has brought about stability in South Africa? Is it not this policy which has been responsible for renewed confidence being shown in South Africa abroad? Is ft not precisely at this stage when the apartheid policy is starting to develop and when the implications of it can be understood, that things are going very much better here in the economic sphere than in comparable countries in the rest of the world? Is it not in South Africa that money is being invested by foreign investors? Foreign investors, particularly at the present time, are shrewd political observers. They will not invest their millions in a country where there is any danger of the Government being overthrown or ousted by a Black Government? Why are the investors withdrawing their money from other African countries? Because there is no stability there. It is in those countries where the Black man is taking over the Government more and more&#x2014;and the Black men who hold the reins of Government in their hands in any case comprise a small clique which is communistically inclined&#x2014;that there is a lack of confidence that there is no confidence abroad in those countries. But more and more confidence is steadily being shown in South Africa by foreign investors who invest their money here. Is it not precisely the policy of separate development which is responsible for the fact that South Africa is gaining more and more friends abroad? Is it not this development which is responsible for the fact that there is a better idea of our problems in the world? Surely it is perfectly clear that in all Western countries, and also in some Asiatic countries, a far better idea of and a larger measure of friendship for South Africa is developing. But it is precisely this policy which the Opposition is trying to attack, which is aimed at allowing the White man to retain his rights in this country, also for generations to come, and it is the only policy which has that aim. I hope that hon. members will not contradict me. I hope that not one hon. member will say that the race federation policy will guarantee the survival of the White man in South Africa, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) contended this afternoon. It is precisely the opposite. Was it not the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself who stated very emphatically at De Aar in May last year that the Black man could not be kept out of this House for ever? He spoke about the &#x201C;foreseeable future&#x201D;, which is of very short duration when we study the political insight of those hon. members. I am not even talking about the other parties; the United Party is still the most conservative party of all the opposition parties in the country and even they admit that the right of the Black man to take his place in this House will be determined by his measure of development and by his contributions to the Treasury, no matter how impossible this may be to determine, as the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) has tried to show. I say again that it is precisely this policy of separate development which is responsible for the fact that this measure of peace and quiet and friendship has been obtained abroad, and at this stage when conditions in Africa are developing as they are developing, the policy followed by this Government is becoming so much clearer and more understandable to the world. We have already heard the death-knell of the Federation. Why? Because the Black man is not interested in a partnership. He is only interested in mastery, in complete supremacy. Give him the opportunity to govern or to rule and give him the opportunity to develop to the highest degree, but why should that entail the ruin of the White man? I say that it is as a result of this policy that things are going very well with South Africa. We see what is going on in the economic sphere. From the speeches of various leaders in various spheres we see that things are going particularly well with South Africa. We had a group of professors from America visiting this country under the leadership of a Professor Gilbert, and according to the <i>Friend</i> of 26 July had the following to say, amongst other things, in Cape Town&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The performance of the South African economy was one of the miracles of modern science. It is a miracle and it is important that the message be carried back to the United States.</block>

<p>These are people who are certainly not supporters of apartheid. The people who make these remarks are certainly not Nationalists, but unprejudiced economic leaders in the</p>

<p>U.S.A, where friendly feelings are not always shown towards South Africa. We find that the vice-president of the Newmont Mining Corporation stated at the annual meeting of the American Institute of Mines in New York that South Africa offered excellent opportunities for investment and excellent rates of interest. He pointed out. <i>inter alia,</i> that the national income <i>per capita</i> was as follows: South Africa. R254: India. R248; Nigeria R60 and Ghana R100. We would not have these statements if there was not an increasing measure of confidence in the Republic and if these people were not prepared to an increasing extent to invest their capital here. We find that the periodical <i>Southern Africa,</i> which is published in Britain, stated that the Republic was the richest country in Africa and one of the countries which had the finest development amongst the younger countries of the world. All this proves that things are going particularly well with South Africa and they are going well simply because the outside world has confidence in this Government. If that were not so, that capital would have flowed to other countries in Africa. But it is precisely as a result of that fact that it is being invested in the Republic and not in other countries, because South Africa offers practically the best investment possibilities in the world. We find that the British firm, the British Titan Product Co. Ltd., is investing an <span class="col_131-132" refersTo="page_0080"/>amount of between R6,000,000 and R8,000,000 in a new factory which they are erecting in Natal. We find that the British textile millionaire, Mr. Cyril Lord, has come here to invest an amount of R 1, 500,000. We have received a report to-day that South Africa is becoming independent in respect of her textile production as a result of investment capital and the erection of factories by foreign industrialists in South Africa. These things would never occur if there was no confidence in the Republic and the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also expressed criticism of the agricultural policy of the Government. Let me just say this: During the past year, when we had surpluses and when large areas of the northern provinces particularly had to face severe droughts, Opposition speakers streamed into the northern provinces and particularly into the Free State in large numbers to try to make capital out of the difficulties of the farmers. We know to-day what the results of that campaign were. We know that the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), who is regarded as the best Opposition speaker, was only able to attract small audiences of 100 people or fewer in the Free State.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SADIE</person>:</from>

<p>That is not true. What is the position? They tried to make capital out of the difficulties of the farmers because of the drought but even under those emergency conditions the farmers in the Free State were not prepared to even consider the United Party because they know the promises which the United Party made to the farmers of the Free State. The farmers know that all those promises are completely impracticable. But they know more. They also know that those promises are simply the sugar-coating of this federation plan which has to be swallowed, and the farmers of the Free State are not prepared to sell their birth right for a mess of pottage. [Interjections.] The hon. leader of the National Party in the Free State points out that the hon. member for Kroonstad was returned unopposed and that is precisely one of the constituencies where there was a tremendous amount of agitation, where conditions were acute, and yet the hon. member was returned to this House unopposed. The United Party do at least have some common sense in that they know when they have a weak case and when they are retrogressing and not progressing. They are not prepared to test their strength. Mr. Speaker, things are going well in the agricultural sphere in spite of the fact that individual farmers are retrogressing. Let me mention one single figure to you. In 1952-53. if we take 100 as the index figure for 1936-39, the agricultural products&#x2019; index figure was 147, and in 1960-61 it was 206. Therefore, the total increase as far as agricultural products were concerned was 45 points during that period. Progress has been made in all spheres of agriculture. The total yield of the agricultural industry continues to increase in spite of the fact that there are difficulties, in spite of the fact that there are surpluses. Things are going well and the farmers of the Free State and of South Africa know to whom they can turn for assistance if they find themselves in difficulty.</p>

<p>I do not propose to follow the line of thought of the hon. member who has just sat down but I must say that I listened with a great deal of interest to the narration he gave us of the wonderful prosperity that South Africa is enjoying. But is that a fair way to put it&#x2014;that overseas people have renewed confidence in us, that money is pouring into the country, that people of wonderful financial standing overseas are expressing confidence in us and that we have prosperity abounding? Sir, I wonder if the hon. member has asked himself where that prosperity comes from? Does he not think it comes from the joint efforts of the Whites and the non-Whites in this country and that without our labour force we would not be in this position? But his Government is the Government that is proposing to take our labour force and send it back, when it is so-called foreign labour, to the territories outside our borders, and if it is not foreign labour, then to put them in their own enclaves which will be foreign countries in the near future. So the prosperity which has been created, the position of which he is able to boast, is the very position which his Government is now proposing to upset and to undermine. It proposes to change the very basis upon which our prosperity has come to us&#x2014; the product of the brain and the hands of the White and the non-White in this country working together in harmony to build up prosperity in a country which has one common economy, which his Government is going to destroy. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) said last year that it would be a good thing to have a number of economies, that it would lead to a healthy kind of competition in this country. Sir, time is running on and I would like to move&#x2014;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>On behalf of the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and myself I should like, with your leave, Mr. Speaker, to read out the following statement to the House:</p>

<p>After the debate on 23 January 1963, the hon. member for Durban (North) came to see me and after a discussion, the hon. member advised me&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>1. That he is satisfied quotation B in fact appeared before quotation A in my speech of 8 December 1962.</li>

<li>2. That in fact quotation B had nothing to do with quotation A in that A deals with subversive activities, whereas B deals with the prevention of ordinary crime.</li>

<li>3. That quotation A was used out of its context as a caption by the newspaper <i>Daily News.</i></li>

<li>4. That quotation B was printed as the fifth (5th) paragraph of the quotation A in the <i>Daily News</i> report from which he quoted.</li>

<li>5. That on closer study of the report and speech it is apparent that A and B is not connected.</li>

<li>6. That he was, however, misled by the way the said newspaper reported the statement.</li>

<li>7. That he did not think it necessary to inform the House of or to quote the intervening paragraphs which would have made the position more clear.</li>

<li>8. That he concedes that it appears from the way he framed his speech that in the report from which he quoted B followed immediately upon A.</li>

<li>9. That he had no intention to mislead hon. members or anybody.</li>

</ol>

<p>I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s explanation and understand the dilemma in which he was placed by the said report and which led to my remarks as to his conduct as a barrister.</p>

<p>In view of the hon. member&#x2019;s statement accept that he did not intend to act unprofessionally or to mislead the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to come back to the motion moved by my hon. Leader because it seems to me that there has been an attempt on the part of recent speakers to get away from it. Before doing that, however, I should like to deal for a moment or two with the procedure which is in conformity with the tradition of Parliament and with the practice of the hon. the Prime Minister in past debates of this character. The Government, in putting up speakers to oppose the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, has put up a number of back benchers from their side of the House. Only one Minister has spoken so far and he. I think I am entitled to say. was more concerned with matters of a rather personal character and matters affecting his own particular portfolio arising from people who are no longer members of this House. There has been no effort whatever, Sir, to answer the case put up by my hon. Leader. In some quarters it is being felt that the procedure adopted by the Government on this occasion is a procedure which has been approved by the Prime Minister himself and that it stems from a desire to cast a deliberate slight on my Leader. Sir, I am not one of those who believe that that is the case. I want to say this, and I hope the Prime Minister will accept this, that in my experience the hon. the Prime Minister is a courteous man and I do not believe he would do that. So I ask myself how it is that whereas in the past, particularly during the last two sessions, the Prime Minister has rushed in to defend his policy, on this occasion he seems to be completely hamstrung, unable to find any grounds whatsoever to oppose the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Let me say that we on this side of the House welcome this. We believe that we know the answer and I am going to voice it in a moment. The answer is this: It is obvious that the hon. the Prime Minister could not find a champion in <span class="col_135-136" refersTo="page_0082"/>his own front benches to put up a case against the motion of my hon. Leader. We are now at the beginning of the third day&#x2019;s debate and we know why he could not get that champion. The reason is this: Past debates on this question of Bantustans have shown that the front benchers, the middle benchers and the back benchers of the Nationalist Party do not understand it and cannot put up a defence. If there were to be just three speakers of the Nationalist Party and make a speech in support of Bantustans as they understand the concept, we would have precisely that difference of opinion expressed, for example, from time to time by the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development and the Prime Minister himself. Not only does the Minister of Bantu Administration differ from the hon. the Prime Minister, but he differs from himself. He is a divided personality. I want to quote something in a moment or two to show why I come to that conclusion. [Interjections.] May I suggest to the hon. Minister of Water Affairs that he should not allow this excessive water in South West Africa and in his Department to so colour his verbiage. Let him water it down.</p>

<p>With regard then to the position in which we find ourselves of not a single member on the Government side attempting to answer the Leader of the Opposition it is because the Prime Minister himself and his advisers have realized that when in the past he came into the fray immediately after my Leader, he had made himself the target of the criticism of Government policy that had followed. [Laughter.] It is true, Sir. Whenever the Prime Minister has put the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to any matter involved in the motion of no confidence, he, as head of the Government, has become the target of hon. members on this side of the House. His own people have told him that he should not do it this time; that he should come in at the end of the debate so that he could not be criticized; that he should wait till the eleventh hour, until there are no more speakers on this side, before he put their defence. I am being quite serious. Sir. [Interjections.] Hon. members opposite have seen the criticism from this side of the House over the past two sessions driving home point after point. As soon as the hon. the Prime Minister had entered the debate the criticism followed from this side and they could not take it, Sir. I repeat that they are incapable of answering it. I defy any hon. member opposite to point to a speech in Hansard where he has set out their policy of apartheid, their policy of separate development. their policy of Bantustans, other than the Prime Minister and&#x2014;with due respect&#x2014; the laboured efforts of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. That is precisely the position. Where do we stand with regard to this matter of Bantustans? I am not going to deal with a particular situation in a particular territory. I want to deal with the matter in general principle because I am representing a province which is affected. I live in a province, Sir, in respect of which the Government&#x2019;s plans, as we know them, will lead to the fragmentation of that province until it will cease to be habitable by White people. I say that advisedly. What sort of sympathy do we get from the Prime Minister? The only statement we can get from him is that he is very sorry but, of course, he did not do it; history placed the Black man in Natal; history divided the country up like that. History did nothing of the kind, Sir. We have lived in harmony with the Bantu in Natal since the rebellion in 1906. The discord and the trouble which have arisen at the present moment flow exactly from the Government&#x2019;s present policy and from no other source. There are things which are sometimes just talked about quietly over a cup of tea and there are matters in respect of which one's political opponents are inclined to say: Look, you must not bring these matters into the open too much because it may harm South Africa. Mr. Speaker, I intend no harm to South Africa and I am going to watch my language accordingly. [Interjections.] I hope hon. members will be equally enthusiastic about the other sentiments which I am about to voice. In regard to those matters where my province is concerned I propose to speak out and to speak out in the place where I took the oath and that is here in Parliament. Here I face the Prime Minister as a man to man across the floor of the House. I repeat that what he is doing is to place the Bantu in Natal in a position where they will take over the whole of the province in the fullness of time. That is what his Bantustan policy will lead to. The carving up and the fragmentation of my province, under these circumstances, is a scandalous thing. The information which we get from the Government in regard to their plans comes to us in bits and pieces and dribs and drabs, for the simple reason that this concept is the concept of a single man, the hon. the Prime Minister. It is his idea. He has foisted it on to his party and let me say at once: party discipline, as far as the Nationalists are concerned, is still holding them together and it will make them vote for the amendment moved by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) to my hon. Leader&#x2019;s motion. But that is not the issue. Mr. Speaker. The destiny of South Africa is not going to be decided by the majority vote of this side or that side of the House. The destiny of South Africa is going to be decided by what happens outside these four walls. What we have been asking the Government all these years&#x2014;and we cannot get an answer &#x2014;is this: What precisely is the Government&#x2019;s intention in regard to this Bantustan concept? Not in regard to a particular area such as the Transkei, for example, but their whole concept. We have been told that eight of these areas will be set up in the main. That is as far as we have got, but in the main on the question of boundaries we have got no further. The Government, however, goes on acquiring more and more land. In this regard I want to come to the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration <span class="col_137-138" refersTo="page_0083"/>and Development. Where will the acquisition of land stop? The hon. Minister of Bantu Administration, speaking on the third reading of the Promotion of Bantu Self Government Bill, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">She reproached us for the fact &#x2026;</block>

<p>He was referring to the hon. member for Cape Eastern (Mrs. Ballinger) who is no longer with us&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that 2, 250,000 morgen of land still had to be purchased. I can give her the assurance to-day that I will be one of the main reasons why that land will be purchased as soon as possible. But I want to say this: That during the ten years of the United Party regime it bought almost no land at all. It was the National Party which fulfilled the solemn promise made to the Bantu. It was the National Party who systematically set aside a sum of money every year to buy that land and I want to say that the National Party will keep its word of honour. That 2.250.000 morgen of land will be purchased. Then the hon. member says that the Natives will have to buy it themselves and pay for it themselves. Where does the hon. member get the right to make that statement? She ought to know that this Government has put its hand deeper into its pocket than any other Government in order to purchase that land. That is a fact. I repeat that that word of honour will be adhered to. She need not be afraid that the Native population will have to buy that land.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, what did the hon. Minister have to say in 1944 about the purchase of land for the Bantu? I see that smile on the face of the Minister of Bantu Administration; he knows what is coming. To-day he talks about a word of honour to purchase that land but what did he say in 1944 when his Government was in Opposition? He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From 1936 1.568,000 morgen have been purchased for the Natives with the White taxpayers&#x2019; money for an amount of &#x00A3;4, 753,000. Yes, there is money for them but there is no money for our Oudstryders and their widows and families. There is no money for our old people, there is no money for our poor people, flesh of our flesh and blood of our blood.</block>

<p>That sounds like a pre-election speech and it was. It was the same man, the same Minister, who now comes along and makes that speech in Hansard which I quoted first to the effect that it is a matter of honour for this Government to buy land, that the United Party Government had bought so little, that they were the first Government to buy land for the Bantu. Sir, we are in this position that the Government continues to buy land. Where it will stop no man knows. The Government goes on with the development it has undertaken towards self-government and independence. They have come with their proposals with regard to the constitutions. Many Natives are asking about the constitutions. Sir, I do not want to magnify my difficulties but I doubt whether any hon. member has more difficulties than I have in regard to this matter. I shall come back to this presently, Sir. I speak the Zulu language. Many Natives come to me with their troubles. It is a cardinal principle with me. Sir, that when dealing with Natives, I do not criticize the Government. Under those circumstances where do I as a Member of Parliament stand in the matter. I represent the Bantu as much as I represent the Coloureds and the Asiatics and the Whites in my constituency. Everyone of us who is representing a constituency represents the Bantu. They have no representatives in this House. Many Natives come to me and I take up their case &#x2014;the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development knows that. I have gone to him from time to time with a case and I usually get his sympathetic understanding, even if it takes a very long time to get it through to his Department. Where do we stand in this matter when the Bantu themselves are seeking enlightenment? There is no more confused group of people in the Republic to-day than the Bantu. They are utterly and completely confused. The Government consults only with a very small number of people in a particular area where they propose to establish a Bantustan. Only that small number have a vague idea of the basic principles of what the Government is proposing. What do the other 12,000,000 know about it? This system of Parliament is something completely new to them. I have said this in this House before, Sir, and I repeat it: The system of counting of votes to get a majority decision has been completely foreign to the social life of the Bantu. You can go back to the days of the immigrant Bantu tribes and you will find that not one of them ever used the vote as a basis for decisions. In these circumstances the mass of the people. in the main uneducated or not sufficiently educated to be able to follow our form of government, are left completely bewildered and wondering what is happening. My hon. friend, the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) repeated here what we have so often said that the Bantu did not ask for this. This is something which was foisted on them by the Prime Minister. This never came out of the cooking oven to the Nationalist Party; this comes out of the domestic oven of the Prime Minister. He cooked it up, nobody else. If hon. members opposite cannot defend their own policy and cannot make an intelligent speech, giving chapter and verse, how then, Sir, can those millions of people outside these walls understand and appreciate it and come to worthwhile decisions? Worth-while decisions in a matter of this kind can only be come to if you know the facts, when you have knowledge. when you are in a position to study the facts. I want to ask the hon. the Prime Minister a question which has repeatedly been asked: What form of government does he propose to give the Bantu in these various Bantustans? <span class="col_139-140" refersTo="page_0084"/>Is it to be based on the democratic principle of the vote? Is it to be a sort of a hotch-potch of people who have been partly appointed and partly voted into position? Or is it to be a form of government where the Government says: We are going to appoint your rulers, we are going to appoint your Ministers and your Parliament. We are going to have the people that we want in the same way that they are doing in the case of the Bantu Authorities.</p>

<p>Let me quote, Sir, from an official booklet &#x201C;The Transkei&#x201D;, Fact Paper 102 of June 1962. This booklet quotes the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is quoted as explaining the kind of government which the Bantustans will have&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moreover, said the Prime Minister, their Parliament would have to have an executive body, perhaps consisting of a Prime Minister and Ministers.</block>

<p>Let me interpolate here, Sir, and say that I do not know whether the hon. the Minister of Bantu Education was wrongly reported to have said in reply to a question that the Bantu governments would, for example, have a Minister of Education.</p>

<p>I accept that, Mr. Speaker. I did not see the denial that is why I put it to the Minister. The Prime Minister then goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This would all be established as soon as an indigenous constitution had been approved by the Territorial Authority &#x2026;</block>

<p>What is an indigenous constitution, Sir? Is it one coming from the people themselves? In the same booklet, on page 5, we have the speech of the Secretary for Bantu Administration and Development. He is a down-to-earth sort of a man. He is a practical man; he has to deal with this job every day, for about 20 hours out of the 24, and what does he say on the same point? He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that talk about a multi-racial Parliament was a waste of time as the Government would not agree to it. Members should be thankful for what the Government was offering and not bite off more than they could chew. They should remember that their Recess Committee had spent many hours discussing their constitution which was a compromise between the traditional form of Government and a democratic system based on Western ideas.</block>

<block name="quote">It would be foolish at this stage to wipe out a system of Government which most Bantu had known and lived under for so long. Members should be sensible and practical. Moreover the constitution would not have to remain unaltered forever. It would probably be amended and changed in future years.</block>

<p>He says quite clearly that they had better keep the form of government which they had because that was the way they would have to go any way. Is that an indigenous form of government? Was that what the Minister of Bantu Administration had in mind when he said this (Hansard 101. Col. 7187)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They (the Bantu), are at liberty to prefer the system which lies nearest to their hearts and which they feel will serve their interests best and which will serve the interests of South Africa best.</block>

<p>That will serve their interests best; an indigenous form of government and then we have the Secretary for Bantu Administration saying: You better take the form which is given to you, which is a hotch-potch; it is a hybrid; something of democracy and something of your tribal system. The Secretary for Bantu Administration said it would not be forever and I want to point at once to one of the points which has already been hammered and hammered by Bantu statesmen and Bantu educated men that they should take what the Government is giving them and then immediately agitate for a different constitution. I want to ask the Government, in regard to the constitutions which they propose for these Bantu states, will they allow these Parliaments to amend their own constitutions? The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration was questioned from this side of the House in regard to the powers which those Parliaments would have. The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) asked him whether they would control their own army in their own area and the Minister said: &#x201C;Of course not.&#x201D; I am trying to get a clear picture because the Government will not give it to us. We have to build it up. We have to collect bits and pieces of information from various sources and try to build up a composite picture to find out what the Government is getting at. I want to ask the Minister of Bantu Administration this: Is the intention that our Defence Force in South Africa should defend the whole of South Africa, including those independent States? Is that the policy of the Government? Will they not be allowed to defend themselves? Will they have no defence force of their own?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I think it is a fair assumption that the Minister is unable to answer. When he said &#x201C;of course not; the Bantu states will not have the right to defend themselves&#x201D; he must have meant that South Africa will be defending the whole country. I want to take it a step further. We have heard a great deal about the 6, 500,000 who are to remain in the White area in terms of the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s report. Various speakers have dealt with those 6, 500,000 Bantu. That calculation may be a million out either way. What I want to ask the Prime Minister is this: Does he envisage 6, 500,000 Bantu remaining in the White areas? Under his policy as he has <span class="col_141-142" refersTo="page_0085"/>seen it developing, with his hand on the steering wheel steering it where he wants it to go, does he envisage that? There is not a member in this House who can guide him or steer him or qualify his views. I know the Prime Minister. Where does the Prime Minister see this 6, 500,000 Bantu in their final destiny? In spite of the criticism which has been voiced about keeping those 6, 500,000 Bantu in the White areas, does he really see them remaining here? Is he prepared to stand up and say: I accept it that there will be 6, 500,000, plus minus, Bantu people in the White area, in all these housing schemes which we are producing for them, in all the transport schemes which the hon. Minister of Railways is providing for them. He is building new railways to carry the Bantu people. That is to remain; it is a permanent part of our economy; we cannot do without the Bantu, they must stay. Or is he going to say: sooner or later the 6, 500,000 Bantu must leave the White areas and those areas must remain white? Except for the Coloureds and the Asiatics. We want answers to these questions because these are the questions which are worrying the Bantu.</p>

<p>I now want to come back to this question of my own attitude. The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration recently, with the Commissioner for Zululand, attended a meeting in my area where they instituted an &#x201C;ukukanyakufikile &#x201D;&#x2014;Regional authority. Both the hon. the Minister and the Commissioner for Zululand spoke. He spoke in Zulu. And the Commissioner criticized me for a speech I had made. The main portion of the Commissioner&#x2019;s speech was published in this Government document called &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D; No. 1 of 1963. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Nel &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the Commissioner and not the hon. the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; referred to a public meeting which had been held in Natal, where a certain speaker had said that the policy of separate development would result in suicide for the Whites. &#x201C;It is arrant nonsense to say that about the Government&#x2019;s policy&#x201D; Mr. Nel concluded. &#x201C;We believe in giving others their due and we are going to give the Zulus their rightful inheritance &#x201D;.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister sat there. He subsequently spoke and according to newspaper reports, in which I was named, because I made that speech, the Minister sat there and he subsequently spoke and he referred once more to the wolves that were trying to eat up the Bantu inheritance. It is a favourite expression of his. He sat there and he listened to the Commissioner-General for Zululand making that speech, a civil servant, a public servant, a man who has been in the precincts of Parliament, and who knows parliamentary procedure and usage and who knows as a civil servant he has no right whatever to criticize a public representative for views expressed in regard to political matters, even if they clash with those of the Government. What right had he at a public meeting attended by 10,000 Zulus to criticize me in that manner. They knew precisely who was being criticized and 20 or 30 came to me during the next 24 hours to ask: What must we do now under these circumstances? What has happened between you and the Government? Sir, what right has a man in that position to criticize in that way. I say he should be cashiered on the turn. The Government of course can appoint whom they will from time to time as commissioners-general. That is entirely for the Prime Minister and his Cabinet to decide. Surely they can find people who are qualified and who are satisfactory in that position. I can show them one who is entirely unsuited and unqualified. No man should stand up in front of a gathering of Natives and make such a speech about another White man at a time like this. The position is dangerously balanced and we are, living in very critical times when the utmost tact is required. The whole Bantustan question is at issue and there a man in the position of Commissioner-General, who is greeted by this concourse of Bantu with their loyal greeting of &#x201C;Bayete&#x201D;, comes along and makes a speech before this gathering in which that particular sentence was used. I think it is absolutely disgraceful. And the Minister sat there and allowed it to happen. I think he understands sufficient of the Zulu language to appreciate what was happening. And there was much more than that. There were fluent Zulu linguists there apart from the Zulus themselves who spoke about it afterwards. Of course neither the newspapers nor this paper here printed what was said by the Commissioner-General in fact at that gathering. I repeat that when it comes to the relationship between Black and White, hon. members opposite have no right to criticize hon. members on this side for their utterances.</p>

<p>I am prepared to stand on my record against any other hon. member on the other side. I say that these are the things that are creating discord in this country, uncertainty at every point where you touch on this question of Bantustans, uncertainty for a White man and uncertainty for the Bantu. Here we have millions of these people who to-day do not know where they stand. How can we guide them, those of us who wish to do so. even if we disagree entirely with the Government&#x2019;s policy but when we wish to see law and order maintained and who wish to see the Republic go forward on an even keel? The Government is taking a course which is pushing ahead the constitutional development of the Bantu in a manner which was undreamt of even five years ago; they are forcing the pace; they are forcing it on a people who understand nothing of the responsibilities they are asked to bear.</p>

<p><span class="col_143-144" refersTo="page_0086"/>Coming to my last point, I want to say that one of the greatest difficulties is in regard to this question of land, I say that if the Government leads the Bantu to self-government in an area where the land is held by the community, they are asking for trouble. There is no country in the world except the communist countries where land is held in communal holding, because under the capitalistic system it is the basis of the foundation of security for our money, and if we are going to get the Bantu with us, we must give them a stake in and a title to their own land. Give the Bantu a stake in his own country, give him a chance to become a land-owner. I know that this also creates difficulties, but the Government should see that that is done before self-government is granted. Let the Bantu be a home-owner and a land-owner in his own territory. If that is not done, the Government is going to be faced by a perpetual pressure of the new Bantustans for a revision of the constitution under which they are being created, and trouble will eventually flow from this as certain as night follows day.</p>

<p>If anything more was needed to show up the bankruptcy of the Opposition, it is the fact that one of their prominent front-benchers commenced his speech to-day by complaining that the hon. the Prime Minister had not immediately replied to the speech made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He worked himself into a state of excitement over that matter.</p>

<p>Mr. Sneaker, this is something quite new that the Prime Minister is to be told when he has to participate in a debate! It is for the Prime Minister to decide when he wishes to do so, and I think if the hon. member would go back into the records of Hansard, he will find that General Smuts the previous Prime Minister of the United Party did not always reply immediately to motions of no-confidence. No, he hided his time. This is something entirely new to attack the Prime Minister because he did not reply immediately. It shows the state of bankruptcy of the Opposition. I take it that the hon. the Prime Minister was waiting for something to reply to. He was waiting for a member of the Opposition to make a statement, into which he could get his teeth. The speech made by the hon. Leader of the Opposition on Tuesday last, was a long and discursive statement, but it contained very little that was new. He said very little that he has not said before: he told the House very little that is not well known. In those circumstances I quite appreciate that the Prime Minister preferred to bide his time and to wait for something to which he could reply.</p>

<p>Coming back to the statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, it was a lengthy and discursive statement. A large part of it was devoted to telling the Government and members of the Government that they had not learned certain lessons. That was the main theme of his statement. Coming from the Leader of the Opposition it is very amusing! Sir, there is one important lesson the United Party and its Leader has never learned and which they should learn&#x2014;his predecessor never learned it&#x2014;namely that a political party without a clear policy on a national issue cannot hope to gain the confidence of the country. [Laughter.] The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is trying to laugh it off. I will prove to him just now that they do not have a clear policy&#x2014;they never have had a clear policy. A party without a clear policy must stagnate and it must lose its adherence. That is exactly what has happened to the United Party to-day, and is still happening. I want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that if I am to judge by the very large number of letters, stacks of letters I have been receiving from English-speaking people, some of them admitting that they are adherents of the United Party, it is clear that the United Party is losing support every day. Only a few days ago I had such a letter from a very prominent English-speaking businessman in Johannesburg. The United Party is losing support, particularly of English-speaking South Africans. For the benefit of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) I can tell him that I have received a number of such letters from Natal. And what about the voting that recently took place at Michael House and at another school? [Laughter.] They are trying to laugh it off. I know for a fact that that is a serious affair and not a schoolboy prank. They cannot laugh it off.</p>

<p>What has happened is that first of all there was the breaking away of the Conservatives of the United Party. That was the first step. Mr. Bailey Bekker, Mr. Blaar Coetzee, Mr. Waring and the others. That was followed by the split in the United Party, when the Progressives broke away. It was an even more serious matter for that party, because some of their best men left the party.</p>

<p>The United Party could not satisfy both wings of that party, the Conservative as well as the Liberal wing. At present the United Party still has two wings, a Conservative and a Liberal wing. Hon. members over there know that it is so. It is not even the middle-of-the-road party. It has no road, and it has no direction.</p>

<p>Returning to the United Party&#x2019;s lack of policy which seems to amuse the hon. the Leader of the Opposition so much, I must remind the House that this has been going on for more than ten years&#x2014;this condition of, shall I say, political anaemia, from which the United Party is suffering. Let us go back a bit.</p>

<p>In 1952, ten years ago, Mr. Anthony Delius, Gallery Reporter of the <i>Cape Times,</i> wrote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a canard that the United Party lacks any policy. But it is unfortunate that its <span class="col_145-146" refersTo="page_0087"/>details are deficient. The trouble with the United Party doctrine is that it seems to be continually getting out of date.</block>

<p>In 1953, the correspondent of the London <i>Times</i> sent a despatch from here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The way is now open for a statesman of calibre to arise. The United Party should develop a clear policy.</block>

<p>These warnings were not heeded. In 1954 the <i>Cape Argus</i> in large headlines proclaimed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">United Party Dilemma. Clear Policy Essential. U.P. Congress must end its egg dancing.</block>

<p>That hon. member must remember that I showed him up once and I will do so again.</p>

<p>The speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on Tuesday was an egg-dance.</p>

<p>Older hon. members will recall that about five years ago I told this House about a meeting of the Eastern Province General Council of the United Party. From the report in the <i>Eastern Province Herald</i> it appeared that there were clear differences of opinion at that meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. George Hayward expressed the doubts of the Conservative section when he said &#x201C;Our policy must be clearly stated. The United Party has opened its doors to right and to left. What is our policy?&#x201D;</p>

<p>Then there was Mr. Frielinghaus, a Member of Parliament for Port Elizabeth, who said: &#x201C;Everybody wants to know what our policy is. Has the party the pluck to state its policy for the future?&#x201D;</p>

<p>And then the hon. member for Albany came along, honest Tom Bowker, who very naively said: &#x201C;But we already have a policy. The only difference is that we call ours &#x2018;segregation &#x2019; and the Nationalists call theirs &#x2018;apartheid &#x2019;.&#x201D; To-day, he probably would say that the policy of the Nationalist Party is still apartheid, but the United Party policy cannot but lead to political integration of Black and White.</p>

<p>This lack of policy continued for some time. The then Leader of the United Party, Mr. Strauss, started to look round for a policy. There was his &#x201C;six-point&#x201D; plan; there was the &#x201C;twenty-one-point&#x201D; plan, and later there was the hundred-and-twenty-one-point plan. Meetings had been held in the different provinces to try and work out a plan. Nobody was any the wiser as to what the United Party&#x2019;s policy was, just as they are none the wiser to-day. Then the unfortunate Mr. Strauss was dropped as leader and the present Leader of the Opposition took over. He started looking round for <i>a</i> policy and then his &#x201C;Senate plan&#x201D; was born&#x2014;or rather, it was still-born. That was the last we heard of it. Then after a number of party meetings in different parts of the country, he came with their race federation plan, and that is still the plan of the United Party.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No, my time is limited. The hon. member belong to the Conservative wing of the United Party.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition explained his race federation plan at Kimberley and elsewhere, and the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) wrote articles in the papers in an attempt to try and explain. And now on Tuesday, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wound up his speech by setting out his race federation plan as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a carefully planned advance in constitutional and economic reform to meet the legitimate aspirations of the non-White races, and the gradual development in South Africa of a race federation.</block>

<p>As Mr. Delius pointed out nine or ten years ago, it is unfortunate that the details are deficient. In the same speech on Tuesday he went further to explain this policy and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each race will be represented in Parliament in accordance with the state of civilization it has reached, so that the most advanced group would retain political power &#x2026;</block>

<p>And then as a sop to the non-Whites in the country, he added that that political power &#x201C;would be shared with the less advanced &#x201D;. Is the hon. Leader of the Opposition really serious? How does he reconcile the declared policy as stated on Tuesday with what he said earlier in his speech when he said that &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; is the aim of the Africans? In his race federation plan, who is going to decide as to the &#x201C;state of civilization&#x201D; which each of the races has reached? My experience at the United Nations, is that every African state regards itself as fully civilized. True, often it is only a thin veneer of civilization, but they regard themselves as fully civilized. Who will decide according to this plan whether the Bantu have reached a particular &#x201C;stage of civilization &#x201D;? Who according to this plan, will decide what &#x201C;the legitimate aspirations&#x201D; of each of the races are? Sir, the hon. Prime Minister&#x2019;s experience at the Imperial Conference and my experience at the United Nations, showed that the aspiration of every African politician is &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;, as was admitted by the hon. Leader of the Opposition <span class="col_147-148" refersTo="page_0088"/>in his statement. Incidentally &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; is the basis of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Bantustan policy, i.e. &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; in their own areas. But according to the plan of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, it will lead to " one man one vote&#x201D;, with a big majority of non-Whites gaining political control in this country. If he does not realize that, then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is blind to realities. What happened in Kenya will happen here. What happened in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland will then happen here, if his policy of &#x201C;race federation&#x201D; is to be applied. A book was recently written by a very well-known Conservative member of the British Parliament. Unfortunately I left the book in Pretoria, but I think it is called &#x201C;The Shadow of the Spear&#x201D;, in which he makes this very significant remark, when dealing with the granting of concessions to the Blacks in Kenya. He says&#x2014;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>No. Unfortunately I left the book in Pretoria, but I made a note of that phrase.</p>

<p>As regards the hon. Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s references to the United Nations, we are at the present moment busy preparing a report on the last session of the United Nations. He will see that 90 per cent of the attacks on South Africa came from the African states. The hon. member does not seem to realize&#x2014; it is an important point&#x2014;that the attacks on South Africa at the United Nations, and also at conferences held in Africa, are not so much directed against the regime in South Africa, against the present Government, as that they are directed against the White man in Africa. I have here a periodical issued in Ghana. It has appeared for the past three years, and is entitled &#x201C;The Voice of Africa &#x201D;. Various articles in this book regularly refer to &#x201C;White domination&#x201D;, There is an article here headed &#x201C;Slothful, Sinister Duncan Sandys &#x201D;. There is also a reference to &#x201C;the White man&#x201D;, There is an article by Peter Malotsi, who is a member of the P.A.C., in which he refers to the &#x201C;Welensky-Salazar-Verwoerd axis&#x201D;, but it is not directed only against us. Here also he refers to &#x201C;the minority of the 3,000,000 Whites&#x201D; in South Africa. He talks of a change in the heart of &#x201C;White South Africa&#x201D;, not a change in the heart of the Government. There are other articles, also one by the friend of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), namely Nelson Mandela in the concluding paragraph of which he foreshadows a sabotage campaign in South Africa. There are other articles which refer to &#x201C;White supremacy&#x201D; in South Africa&#x2014;no reference to the Government. but to the Whites. The same happens at the United Nations. The attacks are against &#x201C;the White man&#x201D; in Africa and in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has moved a motion of no-confidence. Such a motion presupposes that he hopes the time will come when as the alternative government they will be able to take over the government of this country. But except for his statement about his race federation policy, he told us very little that we do not know. He says that he agrees to a very great extent with an article on the United Nations by a certain Mr. James Burnham. He calls it a &#x201C;satirical sketch &#x201D;. I do not know why he calls it &#x201C;satirical&#x201D;, because much of what Mr. Burnham says in that criticism of the United Nations is perfectly correct. But in the same breath the hon. Leader of the Opposition told us of the important role played at the United Nations particularly by the Western powers who, he said, still regard the United Nations as an important organization, and he warned that we should not build upon the hope of the United Nations disintegrating.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to indulge in any prophecies, but I want to say here to-day that I have no hesitation in stating that the United Nations is rapidly losing the confidence of a very large number of the Western countries; I have no hesitation in saying that in recent years the prestige of the United Nations has very considerably dropped. It has shown that it is ineffective in maintaining international peace; it was unable to deter aggression on Goa; then there was the Congo mess and, which should never have happened, it was interference in the internal affairs of another country. And then there is the important fact that the United Nations is insolvent, literally insolvent. How long it will be able to keep going, I do not know, but it is experiencing very great financial difficulties. President Kennedy had difficulty in getting Congress to buy the UN bonds which the Secretary-General asked for, but how long can that go on? I say that that is the general feeling. In discussions and talks with delegates around the tea tables and so on, I gathered that there are many Western delegates who have very serious doubts as to the future of the United Nations.</p>

<p>May I point out that also the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom, Lord Home, referred to what he called &#x201C;the crisis of confidence in the United Nations&#x201D;, That was in the speech he made last year, and he also very strongly criticized the United Nations for not taking action in connection with Goa. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If this Assembly is not to take action, it is a case of the application of the double standard.</block>

<p><span class="col_149-150" refersTo="page_0089"/>He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the course which the United Nations has been following during recent years, and also during the past year, is it a wonder that statesmen and other prominent persons in Western countries are losing faith in the United Nations and are saying so quite frankly?</block>

<p>On another occasion he said, referring to Goa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When, therefore, we have reached a stage where a large part of the organization which is dedicated to peace, openly condones aggression. it is an understatement to say that there is cause for anxiety regarding the future of the United Nations.</block>

<p>I have here the statement issued by his office, which he made to the United Nations Association in London and in which he very strongly criticized the United Nations&#x2019; inaction. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To-day there are two tendencies abroad in world society which if they are imported into the United Nations will kill it. The first is racialism; the second is aggressive nationalism. Both are aggravated and exploited by Communism.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say that the fact that the United Nations compromised on essential principles &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The statement Lord Home made at the United Nations Society in London.</p>

<p>He went on to say that if the United Nations compromises on essential principles and if it allows the use of force for the expansion of national ends, then it is finished, and that the members of the Association should understand that. So, in spite of what the Leader of the Opposition says, it is clear that there are serious doubts, also in the British Government, as to the future of UN. He also referred to other imperfections of the United Nations and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Grave doubts are beginning to be felt by many as to whether the United Nations Assembly can ever be impartial.</block>

<p>Sir, it was not only Lord Home. Also in America very serious doubts have been expressed, amongst others, by ex-President Hoover, who said last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The time has come in our national life when we must make a new appraisal of this organization. Now we must realize that the United Nations has failed to give us even a remote hope of lasting peace. Instead it adds to the dangers of wars that now surround us. The time is here when, if the free nations are to survive, they must have a new and a stronger world organization.</block>

<p>Then there were the speeches made by certain other prominent Americans. Senator Ulbright, a leading American politician, who is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in an article in the Foreign Affairs Quarterly, described UN as &#x201C;a cold war battle-ground&#x201D;,</p>

<p>Senator Henry Jackson, in an address to the National Press Club at Washington, said that the United States attached too much importance to UN. He expressed the opinion that the best hope for peace does not lie in UN, but in the unity of the Atlantic community. At every UN session the State Department appoints two members of Congress to serve on their delegation. This also happened in 1960. The Congressmen in turn made a report to Congress, which was reported by the Government Printing Office in Washington. This section of their report opens with the following paragraph&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The statesmen who drafted the United Nations charter had a noble dream. Those who would now rely on UN as the cornerstone of our foreign policy are not awake to reality. It can no longer be considered a union of peace-loving nations.</block>

<p>And then they put two questions.</p>

<block name="quote">Can the United Nations, without a change in its present constitution, ever reach its original goal; and, secondly, do the policies and activities of UN at this time further the best interests of the United States?</block>

<p>They proceed to give their reply and state that &#x201C;reluctantly and regretfully our answer to these questions is * No &#x2019; &#x201D;.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the statement of the Leader of the Opposition that all the Western nations are still strongly supporting UN.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, one of the main contributing factors towards the feeling of lack of confidence in UN by the Western nations is the growth of the Afro-Asian bloc. They are to-day in full control of UN. In 1946. when General Smuts represented South Africa at the first sitting, there were three African states, apart from South Africa, eight Asian and near Eastern and one Caribbean state, plus six communist states, making altogether 18. To-day, where there were 12 African, Asian and Caribbean states in 1946, there are 32 African states. Together with the Asians there are to-day 57 of them, as against 12 in 1946. There are ten communist states to-day as against six. In other words, there are 67 Afro-Asian and communist states to-day as against only 18 in 1946.</p>

<p>Something which came as a shock to the Western delegation and which made them realize the power of the Afro-Asian bloc, was the sanctions resolution passed against South Africa, <span class="col_151-152" refersTo="page_0090"/> at the 1962 session. Newspapers which are no friends of South Africa&#x2019;s, such as the <i>New York Times,</i> the <i>Washington Post,</i> the London <i>Times</i> and others, all expressed their concern about that resolution and said that UN had no power to pass such a resolution, and that the sanctions resolution had contributed very greatly to the feeling amongst the Western nations as to the UN&#x2019;s loss of prestige.</p>

<p>As regards South Africa&#x2019;s position <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> UN. I will say no more at this stage than that we will bide our time and watch the position. But I would also say this, that it is unlikely that the South African Government will permit its representatives&#x2014;will put its representatives in the position of being insulted there, as happened during the last two sessions. Mr. Speaker, this seems to amuse the hon. member over there that the South African representative was jeered at by the Blacks in UN&#x2014;but I want to say that insults hurled at the representative of a nation at an international conference are insults hurled also at the country they represent.</p>

<p>You said it was not wrong reporting, false images, Press attacks, that had made South Africa so unpopular amongst the nations of the world, the Western world. I want to know from the Leader of the Opposition on what grounds he bases that statement? How much knowledge has he of what appears in the Press, on the radio and on television, particularly the U.S.A. and in Britain? I can testify from personal experience as to what is happening there. The South Africa Information Offices can testify, and our Embassies and Consulates can testify as to what is happening there. I am satisfied that no other country has in time of peace been so vilified and slandered abroad as has South Africa during recent years. I have here one of the most recent cases. A television team of the Columbia Broadcasting System, one of the two leading American concerns, whose television broadcasts are watched by about 15,000,000 people every night, came to South Africa. It is unbelievable what was put over on television by this team.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>There were two teams here. Which one was that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_foreign_affairs">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The Columbia Broadcasting System which came here last year.</p>

<p>Our office in New York was obliged to lodge a very strong protest. Let me add this: When we were asked for a visa, the representative of the Columbia Broadcasting System told our Consul-General in New York that they wished to come to South Africa, because they felt it was time that &#x201C;the other side of the picture should be shown.&#x201D; I want to say that the man who made that statement told a deliberate falsehood.</p>

<p>The television presentation commenced by showing the Black Sash women in Johannesburg and said that &#x201C;these White women protested the tyranny of a minority of 3,000,000 Whites &#x201D;&#x2014;not 3,000,000 Nationalists&#x2014;&#x201C; over 12,000,000 non-Whites.&#x201D; Then it showed a demonstration which was held by the students and professors of the Witwatersrand University against the Sabotage Bill, and it was stated that under this Bill</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;it is made a crime against the State for anyone to seek to encourage any political aims, and that he can be arrested and denied a free trial. This peaceful parade ended in disorder and violence &#x2026; While our cameras were there, voices were willing to be heard. Some of the people on this programme spoke up at the risk of their lives. One of them said: &#x201C;We bow our heads in shame for our country&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The broadcast continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Early in November, when America&#x2019;s eyes were rivetted on those missile bases in Cuba, a bitter debate raged in UN, the issue being the projected boycott of the Republic of South Africa. The delegate from South Africa rose in a hostile Chamber and <span class="col_153-154" refersTo="page_0091"/>declared that the Whites in their country had over the past three centuries built up the most advanced and industrialized nation on the entire African continent, but in the vote that followed, few disputed the reigning condemnation of his country&#x2019;s racial policy.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in view of the reference to the missile bases in Cuba, I would mention that the South African Government was one of the first to assure the American Government of its support.</p>

<p>The Columbia Broadcasting System&#x2019;s presentation referred to a statement by Victor Hugo and then said:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;With freedom exploding all over Africa and Asia, this trend has been dramatically reversed in the Republic of South Africa. The idea of freedom has not yet come to this last remaining bastion of White supremacy in Africa.&#x201D;</block>

<p>This presentation was shown to about 15,000,000 people. The narrator said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;This vastly endowed land is determined that White domination shall prevail, no matter what the cost to 12,000,000 non-Whites may be. As South Africa&#x2019;s wild game is contained in a special reserve, the Kruger Park, so are most of its people.&#x201D;</block>

<p>It said that &#x201C;all the millions of Blacks and 1.500,000 Coloureds of mixed blood and 500.000 Asians are in reservations and compounds &#x201D;. There was much more. It was a really shocking presentation, and then the Leader of the Opposition tells us that it is wrong to say that the ill feeling produced abroad is due to false Press and other reports. My experience has been that if we do correct a false report it is not published, not even by a leading paper like the <i>New York Times.</i> There was the case where the United Nations representative in Katanga, Gardiner of Ghana, accused South Africa of having sold aircraft to Katanga. I immediately cabled to South Africa and got the facts, which I reported to U Thant, the Secretary-General of UN. My denial was issued in a statement issued by the Secretariat. The original complaint had been fully reported in the <i>New York Times</i> under a big headline on the second page. My denial much abbreviated, was sandwiched in between two other reports on Katanga. I was obliged to write to the <i>New York Times</i> and to insist that the full denial be published. That sort of thing is continually happening. Our Information Office has the same experience. When they ask for a false report to be denied, it is either not published or put where it is not easily seen.</p>

<p>Another point made by the hon. member is that we should re-establish contacts and build un friendships and break down hostilities with other countries. I presume, in view of what he said just before that, that he was referring to contacts with the African states.</p>

<p>Then he included the African states. Mr. Speaker, in spite of insults and vituperation, South Africa has during past years continually shown a willingness to co-operate, but there has been no response or reaction from the African states. On the contrary, co-operation has been made impossible. South Africa can no longer attend conferences on the Continent of Africa. We are denied visas for our delegates. South Africa is a founder member of the C.C.T.A., but at its last meeting we were formally kicked out. There have been statements of African leaders also at the last session of the UN Assembly. The delegate of Nigeria boasted that he was proud of the fact that Nigeria had played an important part&#x2014; these are his words&#x2014;&#x201C; in kicking South Africa out of the Commonwealth &#x201D;. When Uganda recently received its freedom, the Prime Minister went out of his way to say that they were not prepared to have any relations with South Africa, Tanganyika did the same.</p>

<p>The desire to co-operate, is a two-way traffic; it has to come from both sides. Last year, through the French Embassy and on the decision of the Cabinet, I requested that the Republic of Madagascar be approached asking whether they would be prepared to exchange diplomatic representatives with South Africa. The suggestion was duly conveyed and we were later informed that the Malagasy Government felt that the time was not opportune in exchanging diplomatic representatives. As hon. members know, the United Arab Republic for no reason whatever&#x2014;there had been no trouble&#x2014;simply advised us that they were withdrawing their Minister from South Africa. Last year we invited the Minister of Transport of Congo (Brazzaville) to visit South Africa. We thought everything had been arranged, but then we were informed that the present was not an opportune time for such a visit. South Africa has done everything in its power to try to foster good relations with the African countries and it is through no fault of ours that it has not been achieved.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition in the course of his speech said: &#x201C;I believe I am not incorrect in saying that there are certain countries that are not willing to sell arms to South Africa.&#x201D; May I ask on what grounds he made that statement? I would hate to think that his words were intended as an encouragement to other countries not to sell arms to us. [Time limit.]</p>

When I received my Hansard for revision this morning, I saw that I had used the following words in respect of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). I said that she had probably spoken to the Committees overseas which all collect funds for those who commit violence and the agitators and those who seek to commit sabotage here. I then added words which I should rather not have used, namely that she had <span class="col_155-156" refersTo="page_0092"/>perhaps connived with them.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the object of this debate is to have a discussion as to whether the country can trust the Government to guide it through the dark days that lie ahead. I must say that one could not have gathered that from the speech of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs who has just sat down. He started off his speech by accusing the hon. the Leader of the Opposition of having said nothing new. Sir, he is the last one to talk. He was still talking when his time expired. but he said nothing new whatever. The first part of his speech sounded rather as if he were rehearsing for the not far distant day when he will be sitting on the Opposition benches attacking the United Party Government. The second part of his speech was a continuation of his severe criticism of UN, which he ended by saying that he and his Government were going to watch the position very closely. Well, that does not really get us very far in considering whether or not this Government can be trusted to govern this country any longer. If the House is satisfied with the hon. the Minister's announcement that the Government will continue to watch the position, then I suppose that is all right. But in considering this question, we have to take the Government&#x2019;s programme to judge what to expect, and we have had two main statements on which to judge. The one was the New Year message to the country by the hon. the Prime Minister and the other was the speech we listened to from the State President last Friday. Of course the two speeches resembled each other very much, both in form and in substance. I suppose it is a case of great minds thinking alike, but perhaps it was only one great mind thinking alike. But in any case, taking those two speeches together, they form, in my opinion, full justification for a vote of no-confidence in the Government in this House. But that justification has been further bolstered by the speeches we have had from the Government benches, because not one of them, including the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, has really attempted to satisfy the country that this Government is well apprised and capable of dealing with the problems that lie before it.</p>

<p>The statements to which I am referring contain two main points. The one was that vast economic expansion was just around the corner. and the other theme was criticism of UN. It was also noticeable, as the Leader of the Opposition pointed out, that in neither of the statements was any reference made to the agricultural industry, or hardly any. In one speech certain doubts were expressed, but the other paragraph said that the outlook for the farming industry was bright. I hope the agricultural industry can take comfort from that. But as far as the economic boom is concerned, we all know that there are possibilities for vast economic expansion. We all know that something like an economic boom is just around the corner, but it has been round the corner for years now.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Our trouble is that this Government cannot get us round the comer. Why, we do not know. We know, but the Government does not seem to know. What we cannot understand is that if this vast expansion is on the way. while this unheard of prosperity is approaching, why it is necessary for the Government continually to offer artificial stimulants to bring about the state of affairs which according to them and the hon. member for Vereeniging is with us already. The Prime Minister, in his New Year pep talk to the country, was in a very cheerful mood indeed. My reaction, on reading his cheering message to the country, was that the fishing at Betty&#x2019;s Bay must have been very good indeed. But in any case he was in an optimistic mood and he was full of confidence for the future, and when he came to industrial development he was particularly optimistic. He spoke about industrial development and said that amongst the industrialists there was more than confidence; there was enthusiasm, and not only amongst local entrepreneurs but also amongst those overseas, and he expressed his pleasure at the favourable comments and the delight expressed by visitors from overseas in the future of the country, which I take it means that he welcomed their interest and looked forward to overseas finance to assist our local entrepreneurs in bringing about the expansion which we all desire. But two days before the hon. the Prime Minister made that speech, the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs made another one. He said, according to the report in the <i>Cape Times&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">international financiers were using church officials and missionaries to force the European out of Africa. &#x201C;Is the Michael Scotts, Huddlestons and Collins that are used by the international financiers to direct the hate of the world on South Africa and thus to force the Whites to become the lackeys of the Blacks.&#x201D; It is because the financiers know that they can use the Black states for their profit. The financiers know that a nation that is poor cannot defend itself. Just as they tried to impoverish the Voortrekkers so will they now try to break South Africa financially and contrive to bring about the suicide of White civilization in South Africa. As in the case of Salome &#x2026;</block>

<p>I understand Salome was a very prominent strip-tease artist in the time of King Herod&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">as in the case of Salome, the financiers now wanted to give the head of the White man <span class="col_157-158" refersTo="page_0093"/>in Africa to the Black man. &#x201C;Foreign missionaries and church officials are trying to destroy White civilization in South Africa for the sake of the financiers.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Sir. does that breathe optimism for the future; can that be construed as an invitation to capital to come to this country, issued by a mouthpiece of the Government? Who are we to believe&#x2014;the hon. the Prime Minister or this melancholy anachronism, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs? Quite seriously I wonder whether the Prime Minister cannot do something to curb the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs &#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, I do not speak about the rest but I do think that the hon. the Prime Minister ought to insist that the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs should never make a public speech before first submitting it to him for his censorship. But there was another voice as well; there was the voice of the hon. the Minister of Finance. He was not wildly optimistic and he was not issuing words of warning against the wicked overseas capitalists either. He made what I would regard as a sensible and a responsible statement: He said that the country&#x2019;s economy and financial position had remained steady since last year and that sound progress had been maintained in 1962. Well, that is three voices from the Government but there was a fourth; there was the Minister of Economic Affairs. In addition to the 46.000,000 odd rand with which he promised to subsidize industries within the next five years, he made an impassioned, almost hysterical plea to the ordinary man in the street to help boost the economy by spending more. Sir, some of us can remember one of his predecessors prescribing &#x201C;spare diet and castor oil&#x201D; for the residents of this country. Now we have the present Minister calling upon an overtaxed and hard-pressed people to put their hands in their pockets and to go on a spending spree to help the Government to get round the corner to prosperity which they think this country ought to enjoy. Sir, I ask you. what confidence can the country have in a Government which speaks with so many contradictory voices as to how really to achieve the degree of expansion which we all want to see.</p>

<p>The other leg of the speeches to which I am referring is the criticisms levelled at UNO, to which the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs added a few more this afternoon. As my Leader pointed out we have serious differences of opinion with UNO, and those differences of opinion are not confined to ourselves. As the hon. the Minister has pointed out the criticism is widespread. Dissatisfaction with the present functioning of UNO is general and the feeling is undoubtedly growing that UNO, in its present state, is not fulfilling its functions. But, as my Leader has pointed out, surely we have to accept the fact that UNO is there and that UNO for the foreseeable future is going to stay there, and calling it names won&#x2019;t remove it. Competition between the Prime Minister and Dr. Castro for epithets to fling at the General Assembly or the Security Council will do absolutely nothing to resolve the differences or to bring any nearer a state of affairs where we might have a better opinion of the United Nations Organization. Indeed I would go so far as to say that language such as has been used by the Prime Minister in regard to UNO simply creates the impression that he is scared stiff of the situation in which his party&#x2014;because it is not only he; it goes back to his predecessors has landed South Africa <i>vis-a-vis</i> the world and the world organization and simply confirms the opinion which is very widely held already that this Government may be expert professional politicians but when it comes to statecraft they are not even promising amateurs. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s attitude seems to me to be based on at least one fallacy. He points to the fact that a couple of minor politicians have hitched their wagon to his star as proof that to an increasing degree he has the support of the whole White electorate in his race policies. His State Information Office in their advertisements overseas has claimed that basically there is little difference between the two main parties in the matter of racial policies, and I notice that the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) in her journeys abroad has been assisting the State Information Office and the Prime Minister in spreading the impression that there is not much significant difference basically between the United Party and the Nationalist Party and as a result, that on the whole the Prime Minister can claim that he has the support of both. I do not suggest that the hon. member for Houghton used those words but she certainly gave the impression that as far as she is concerned there is nothing to choose between the Nationalist Party and the United Party and that they are equally bad as far as racial policies are concerned. Of course, both the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. member for Houghton are quite wrong and so is the State Information Office, but that is by the way. One can only shake one&#x2019;s head and simply say that politics sometimes makes for strange bedfellows. I think the Prime Minister is wrong in two respects. In the first place he is wrong in saying that he has the support of all the people of the country, and I think he is wrong in refusing to admit that at the present time at any rate&#x2014; what may happen in the future none of us knows&#x2014;the main attack of the world organization is not against South Africa or the South African people but against the race policies <span class="col_159-160" refersTo="page_0094"/>of the present Government, and unless the Prime Minister can grasp that fact, then inevitably we must be on the wrong lines in dealing with the situation.</p>

<p>Turning to the question of confidence, the hon. member for Vereeniging in moving what appeared to me to be a direct negative to our motion, moved a motion of full confidence in the Government. Well, I wonder what kind of confidence he wants. As far as we are concerned what is required is not blind confidence but confidence based on sound reason, and we for three days have been asking for sound reasons from that side of the House as to why that confidence in the Government should exist. We have not been given those sound reasons, least of all by the hon. member for Vereeniging.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<p>Sound, but no reasons.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the people of this country are not to be treated like the light Brigade at the battle of Balaclava&#x2014;&#x201C;theirs not to reason why&#x2014;theirs but to do and die &#x201D;&#x2014;or perhaps I should say &#x201C;pay or die&#x201D; as far as the taxpayers are concerned. That is not the kind of confidence that the people of this country want or that we are looking for. We want good reasons for that confidence. Now, when we look for reasons for confidence we naturally tend to look back a bit to see what reassurance we can get from what has happened in the past. This Government has had plenty of problems in the last 15 years. How have they dealt with them? Take the question of manpower for example. We all know that this economic expansion which the Prime Minister ardently desires depends on adequate manpower. We have been telling him that for many years, and yet for 15 years this Government denied it and refused to allow immigration into the country, and at the same time not only did they not allow immigration but they rigidly refused to allow the non-White people to develop what skills they could in order to supplement our skilled labour force. It is true that now they have seen the light and that they are attempting to get some immigrants, but after all for 12 to 14 years they did nothing about it. In fact they denied that there was any need for immigration.</p>

<p>Take the question of transport development. For some years after this Government took over nothing was done to meet the needs of railway development. We remember the previous Minister of Railways telling us when he took over that the honeymoon period was over and that many of the schemes which were on the Table ready to be carried out might never be needed and that he was not going to go on with them and goodness knows how many tens of millions of pounds it has cost us all to enable the present Minister of Railways to make up the backlog which was left to him when he took over from that dynamic bundle of energy who preceded him.</p>

<p>Take the question of the oil pipeline. That was under favourable examination in 1947, but it is only a few months ago that the Minister of Transport had a vision and announced that he accepted in principle what had been on the cards for 15 years. We look forward to hearing what he is going to tell us about the pipeline &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>We have been waiting for 15 years for a positive decision on that subject.</p>

<p>Then there is the Orange River scheme. That was actively being pursued before this Government came into office and for 15 years this Government would not look at it. They had deputations from farmers from all over the country and they refused to look at it. Now a ray of light has been shed and it is being heralded as a great inspiration on the part of this Government. Fifteen wasted years!</p>

<p>The same applies to budgeting. For years we have begged this Government to be more careful with their budgeting. We have accused them of consistently and systematically overtaxing the people and we have asked them to have some kind of a plan for their budgeting for the years to come but nothing has happened; the country has been overtaxed year after year, and now, at the end of last September, the Prime Minister had a bright idea. He arrived at the Economic Planning Council&#x2019;s session and he announced that we should now undertake a system of economic planned budgeting, and he went on to say that he thought that the budget last year was probably wrong. I could not expect him to say that we were right. But it is something to get the Prime Minister to admit that his Government was wrong. Well, we shall look forward with great interest to the reaction of the Minister of Finance in his Budget to this vote of censure that he has had from his boss on his method of budgeting.</p>

<p>Take the Republican question. There is not the slightest doubt that this country went to the polls at the referendum in the firm belief that they were voting either for or against a republic in the Commonwealth, thinking that they could rely on the Government&#x2019;s statement, and the Government was completely wrong. Sir, so one can go on and in fact one can say that in every major issue over the last 15 years this Government has been wrong. Why should they be right now? I think it is very cold comfort looking back on the last 15 years when it comes to the question of confidence in the Government. Goodness knows we have plenty of problems ahead of us now. We have for instance, the agricultural industry, financing, marketing, export markets. There is no reference to any of those problems at all either in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s New Year statement or in the Opening Speech by the State President. In fact the farmers by inference have been shown very plainly what the Minister of Lands told them some years ago that they are no longer the backbone of <span class="col_161-162" refersTo="page_0095"/>the country, and as far as this Government is concerned they can now take a back seat with no cushions on it to soften the bumps over a bad road. The farmers were not even mentioned in the Speech from the Throne at the Opening of Parliament. It is quite true that the Government has made efforts to get a certain number of immigrants but we have to get a great many more to make up the backlog of 12 years, and I think we have to do much more to incorporate these people into the South African nation. I think a period of five years is much too long under our conditions here to keep people waiting for citizenship once they have decided to stay and shown that they are going to make good South Africans. I think they should be allowed to become South African citizens much sooner than that. How the Government is going to make up this backlog heaven only knows. At the same time the Government should take active steps to encourage greater skills for our non-Whites. Job reservation should be done away with to-morrow if the Government is really serious in wanting to expand the economy of the country as it should be expanded.</p>

<p>We had hoped this afternoon to hear from the hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs some information as to how he viewed the problem of our relations with the United Nations. Well, we have heard what he had to say. It is quite clear that he has no idea at all and no information to give us. It is the same with our relations with the rest of Africa. The Prime Minister always says that his policy is friendly co-operation with the rest of Africa, but his policy of friendly co-operation with the rest of Africa seems to depend on the rest of Africa staying as far away as possible from him. It is no good saying &#x201C;I want to be friends with you&#x201D; and then refusing to have them in your country. The isolated refusal to which the hon. Minister referred is understandable in view of the definite refusal of the hon. the Prime Minister to accept any kind of officials from any state in Africa in this country. There is no reference to any of these things in the programme outlined to us by the State President, or by the Prime Minister in his New Year address.</p>

<p>I notice, Sir, that the Other Place has a number of Bills coming before it and one of them deals with the export of ostriches, so perhaps I should not say that the agricultural industry has been entirely overlooked. Of course. I would like to see a clause put in there providing for the compulsory export of the whole Cabinet together with the sand in which their heads are so firmly buried.</p>

<p>The picture drawn by Government speakers when they draw a picture that is intelligible at all, is that all is well, that there is a spirit of optimism abroad, that vast economic expansion is around the corner, that the corner is about to be turned, that prosperity awaits all of us. that we should all put our hands in our pockets, that racial peace exists&#x2014;they do not say that it is racial peace maintained very firmly by the Minister of Justice&#x2014;that the rest of the world is modifying its hard views about us and that in any case we should not take any notice of the rest of the world in view of the happy future awaiting us here and that we should just feel pity for the outside world which does not appreciate with what a marvellous Government South Africa has been blessed. Sir, I wish that were a true picture. Unfortunately it is quite a false one. The true picture, as I see it, is that South Africa is facing a year or two of the most fateful years in its history. Agriculture is crying out for drastic reorganization; we are about to be asked to hand over a large portion of our eastern seaboard to what will be an independent foreign country, a jumping-off ground for our enemies against what is left of a dismembered Republic, whilst on the west we are threatened with the loss of South West Africa. Nothing that has been said yet indicates that the Government has any policy holding out any promise of successful implementation in dealing with our vital, urgent and possibly deadly problems for this country. This Session will be largely taken up by discussing these questions in greater detail, but I say that meanwhile, based on the evidence before us, on our experience over the last 15 years, on the failure of the Government to take the country in its confidence it is painfully clear that the present Government is a menace to the continued well-being of our country, a grave digger of the future of the Republic and as a matter of urgency it should be repudiated by every responsible citizen of the country irrespective of the political party he may favour.</p>

We have heard it too long. The hon. member talks about this Government being a menace. He talks about the failure to turn the corner of the economic boom that lies ahead of us. Sir. it is not so long ago that this honoured gentleman was telling us that South Africa was bankrupt, that the banks and the factories would close. He used that language when South Africa became a Republic and when South Africa was out of the Commonwealth.</p>

All the prophecies made by him about the economic future of this country have been proved false. But the hon. member still gets up and in a slow deliberate way he tries to create fears in this House about the future of South Africa.

<p>Sir, I never interrupted the hon. member when he was speaking. He must not squeal now. He talked about an antediluvian Minister and about the Government&#x2019;s having gained a few minor politicians. He was no doubt referring to the Minister of Immigration and myself. All I can say is, judging by the sentiments on this side of the House is that they are very pleased that they have not been joined by minor politicians of the type of the hon. member for Constantia. He talked about an &#x201C;antediluvian Minister &#x201D;. He does not even represent a true South African anymore. He represents something that does not fit into this House, something that is a relic of the colonial system. That is why the hon. member feels so bitter and that is why he is such a Jeremiah when he talks about this Government.</p>

<p>I want to refer to this no-confidence motion. The hon. members of South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and Constantia are very upset because it would appear that the motion is not being treated realistically by this side of the House. I know that this is a formal motion that is put before Parliament at the beginning of a session. This is a most unrealistic motion. It is no good trying to create vigour where there is no vigour. There is no vigour even in those benches that there is no confidence in this Government. I know and I appreciate the efforts which the hon. members make, especially the hon. the Leader of the Opposition for whom I have the greatest respect. I know it is up to him to try to keep the spirit going. I want to read a report just to show how unrealistic it is. This is a report which appeared in the <i>Star</i> of 11 September&#x2014;</p>

<p>Oh no, Sir. Listen to this. This is from the member for South Coast&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The result of the recent Provincial election at Weenen was the writing on the wall. It could spell the beginning and the end of the Nationalist Party.</block>

<p>At that time there were by-elections in Britain. A by-election is always an election where the government is in a more difficult position. It is not a general election&#x2014;it is a by-election. In the by-elections in Britain the Conservative Party lost two or three of them. A by-election shows the people of the country what the trend of events is. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) admits that the Government increased its majority at Vryheid and yet it is supposed to be a moral victory over the Nationalists. Take Florida and here, I do not think the hon. member can correct me, the Nationalist Party reduced the United Party majority by 45 votes. But it was a by-election. We are talking about the results of only a year ago, not those of four years ago. The majority was reduced by 45&#x2014;another moral victory. The hon. member for Germiston (District) made a calculation. He said: What about the percentages? I remember reading about the percentages and it shook me because one of the papers said that the United Party could say that it had increased its percentage more or it had lost less votes than the Nationalist Party did by .3 per cent or .03 per cent.</p>

<p>Let us look at the agricultural position in this country. We had an opportunity to have an election at Kroonstad. That is a farming, a mealie, district. We have so much talk about the mealie farmers. Why did the United Party not go to Kroonstad and fight the election? It has no confidence in the Government; the people outside have no confidence in the Government! There was their opportunity. But they decided that the seat could go unopposed. I must say that I regard the position of the United Party with a certain amount of understanding and a feeling of sorrow &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, I am not homesick. I feel sorry for them because you hear so many views expressed by <span class="col_165-166" refersTo="page_0097"/>United Party members. I remember when they kicked us out the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) got up in this House and he said: &#x201C;Now we have got rid of the element which has been undermining the United Party. We now stand united behind Mr. Strauss as a party with one policy.&#x201D; Very soon they were no longer standing united behind Mr. Strauss but they were standing united behind the present Leader of the Opposition. The next minute the Progressives were out but two of them stayed in; they are still in the party. There are more than two, Sir. The hon. member for Constantia was right in the forefront and then there is the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell). That is why I say I have a great feeling of sorrow for them.</p>

<p>I want to refer to the speech of the hon. member for South Coast on the Bantustan policy. I am not afraid to discuss the aspects of that policy. I want to refer in the first instance to a cutting which I have here from the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 17 January 1963. The <i>Natal Mercury</i> is not a supporter of the present Government. It comes from their representative in Lusaka. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the new Northern Rhodesia Legislative Council only one day old a demand for a one-man-one-vote constitution drawn up by Mr. Kenneth Kuanda and his legal advisers will be presented to Mr. Butler.</block>

<p>You know what the position is in Northern Rhodesia, Sir. They have control of the the Northern Rhodesia Executive. But that does not satisfy them. That is not their object. Their immediate call is for one-man-one-vote. It is no good closing your eyes to it. Throughout the whole of Africa that is ultimately the demand. Mr. Speaker. I can show you how that has come from Dr. Hastings Banda; how it started in Kenya. It is no good saying that they will accept a qualified vote, that they will accept the basis of federation which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has expounded. The Leader of the Opposition was even anxious that they should accept it but they will not accept it. They may use it as the thin end of the wedge but they will not accept it. That is the history which we have right throughout the African Continent. We have that situation right on our borders in Northern Rhodesia. The hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) who has relations in Rhodesia, knows the situation. It amounts to this that the hon. members of the Opposition have learned nothing from the history in Africa. The position has developed in that direction and nobody is going to stop it. I can quote African leaders who have said in the past: &#x201C;It is no good telling us that human dignity is that there must be no discrimination, that we must be allowed to go to hotels, to go to cinemas, to swimming baths. That is not the human dignity that we want. Our determination is to get the ultimate human dignity which is one man one vote.&#x201D; [Interjections.] All I want to show hon. members is that this is the situation and this has been African history during the last few years. Hon. members sneer at the Bantustan policy but there is a clear-cut policy in that policy and that clear-cut principle is this: There is a division; there has always been a geographical division. There is a clear-cut political division. As far as the White man in South Africa is concerned, excluding the reserves, this is the area in which the White man will exercise his vote, and nobody else but the White man. That is a clear-cut issue. We say to the Bantu: If you want a system of one man one vote you can have it in your Bantustan area. That is where you must exercise your political rights. Hon. members want to know to what it will lead. It can lead to all sorts of things. But I want to ask them this: Look what the other system has led to. I was in Kenya when they thought of giving about a quarter of the Kenya Legislature over to the Africans. That was the maximum they thought of and what happened in the end? It is controlled by the Africans. It was reported to me when I was in Northern Rhodesia&#x2014;and I am not talking out of turn in saying this&#x2014;that a question was put to Lord Malvern about their partnership policy. He explained that it would be a partnership like a horse and a rider and he left it to the questioner to decide who would be the jockey. That was not so long ago, and to-day in Northern Rhodesia the complete control of the Executive Council is in the hands of Kuanda and his allies. He fought the election under an arrangement with Sir Roy Welensky and he got in under Welensky&#x2019;s support. The leader of the United Federal Party, Mr. Roberts, appealed to them and said: &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t do this to us; surely we are entitled to half the seats in the Executive Council; we are a strong minority.&#x201D; Kuanda&#x2019;s immediate reply was: &#x201C;As far as we are concerned you must understand, the majority in this country are now ruling; they have the power and the minority is in the opposition and you get no member on the Executive Council and no member in the Cabinet.&#x201D; That is the language of Africa. I am convinced that there must be this clear-cut issue. It is no good bluffing yourself that you can get away with some other system. They also thought that they would be able to hold the position in Northern Rhodesia.</p>

He must not be made to think that he has some qualified right in what we call our homeland, if you want to call it that. Because once you accept that principle that <span class="col_167-168" refersTo="page_0098"/>he has a qualified right in the White area he will not be satisfied with that right, he will demand one-man-one-vote.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INFORMATION</person>:</from>

<p>The whole world is demanding more land, Mr. Speaker. Throughout the history of the whole world people have been demanding political rights in other countries either in the form of pressure or otherwise. If there is an attempt or a demand for political rights in what we call the White homelands, then that will become an act of political aggression. The same as it would be an act of political aggression if the Germans demanded political rights in Holland. I am not drawing a comparison between the pattern in Europe and the pattern which we have here but I am trying to create principles which we must follow.</p>

<p>Who knows what the future of the world is going to be? All we can do is to see what has happened to the other attempts which have been made to satisfy Black Africa. All that has happened has been that the White man has been pushed out of the country politically and otherwise. When you speak to people from Rhodesia or from Kenya they say to you straight out: Look, there is no argument about it; unless you make that a clear-cut policy, unless you follow that policy, you have not got a hope in South Africa. You may withhold it for ten to 20 years, but your children and their children will never be able to hold on to South Africa as you want it with fairness and justice to everybody. That is why I say that should be the principle which we should apply. We are not afraid to talk about the Bantustans. I am only too glad to talk about the Bantustans. I am proud to know that at any rate I am moving in a direction in which I can see a future. Not only a future for myself but a future for those to follow. The history of Africa with regard to the White man has shown that the other system does not give any stability whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not say that there will not be problems. Of course there will be problems. I want to say this to the South Africans: Why is it that the Kenya man or the Rhodesian must be a better South African than the South Africans who sit in the On-position? Why do they say: Yes, you must do that. They have lived under a system which has meant the end of everything which they hold dear. That is why I say that this issue is much broader and much bigger than just an ordinary party argument. I feel that surely in regard to this issue there should be a feeling of South Africanism which should make us pull together. Surely this undermining, this creating of an atmosphere of suspicion, this saying that we are creating Bantustans for cheap labour, is un-South African. I read a speech of the hon. member for South Coast in which he said we were going to spend R20,000,000 on the Transkei and what about the poor and the widows and the pensioners. Is that the language to use in regard to an issue of this sort?</p>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is one of the most queer speeches I have listened to during the few years I have sat in this House. To start off with, an ex-member of the United Party spends the first quarter of an hour of his speech on a subject which is hardly relevant to this debate, namely the prospects of the United Party getting into power. I ask myself: Why this speculation? Is it possible that the hon. member is beginning to doubt that the ship which he left is really sinking? Then he <span class="col_169-170" refersTo="page_0099"/>went on to make one analogy after the other, analogies which have been made over and over again by hon. members opposite&#x2014;look what happened to Kenya; look what happened to Rhodesia; look how the Rhodesians are now supporting our policy here! Surely the test is this: Does the hon. the Minister of Information think that apartheid would have solved the problems of the Whites in Kenya? There are only 80,000 Whites out of a population of 3,000,000 in Northern Rhodesia and does he think that apartheid would have solved their problems? If we have more security and more peace in South Africa to-day it is simply due to the fact that the Western community is stronger here than anywhere else in Africa and despite the Nationalists&#x2019; policy over the past 14 years we are still much stronger than anywhere else in Africa. Other policies would have led to an even more stable and peaceful situation than that which we have to-day.</p>

<p>My Leader made a charge against the Government, namely that their policy was creating this bad image overseas. He admitted at the outset that there was a tremendous amount of distortion of what was happening in South Africa. He referred to the misrepresentations that were taking place. The gravamen of my Leader&#x2019;s charge was that if some of the Acts of this Government were published in their entirety, if you published the Sabotage Act, for instance, in any Western country, it would be totally rejected because it went against all concepts of Western civilization and democracy as seen by most of the Western countries. That was the charge, but the Minister of Information made no attempt to meet that charge. I am afraid, Sir, what we have had from the Minister of Information in this respect is what we have had from most of the speakers on the other side. They made no attempt to meet the very serious charges which my Leader has made against the policies of this Government. I will therefore try to shift the debate to a slightly different ground, to the economic ground, and see if we cannot get an answer from hon. gentlemen on the other side on the economic consequences of their policies. According to what I have listened to in this debate the attitude of hon. members opposite is that thanks to the Nationalist Government we have had tremendous economic development over the past 14 years. They admit that over the past two years there has been consolidation but they say the boom is just round the corner. I cannot illustrate that attitude better than to quote what the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs said in the <i>South African Patriot.</i> In the <i>Patriot</i> of November/December 1962 the hon. Deputy Minister wrote this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">After the first 12 post-war years of exceptionally rapid economic, and particularly industrial, growth, we experienced a brief spell of economic consolidation which afforded us a welcome opportunity of catching up with the expansion of the basic services sector of the economy, which has tended to lag behind the unprecedented growth of the productive sectors. Towards the end of the nineteen-fifties this process of consolidation had been largely completed and the stage was once more set for further economic development at an improved rate of progress.</block>

<p>This is the sort of propaganda that is put out, namely that South Africa has had exceptionally rapid economic and particularly rapid industrial growth. Now, Sir, I intend testing that by the facts. I do not intend letting those statements go. There is really only one indicator if you want to measure whether the welfare of a nation is improving under a particular government or not and that indicator is your average real income per head of the population because that measures your standard of living, it measures your purchasing power and it discounts such things as price increases and population increases. I say that is the best and the truest measure where you want to determine whether the welfare of the country is expanding and progressing rapidly or not. What are the facts in this respect? <i>Commercial Opinion</i> of November 1962 has gone to the trouble of calculating, on the basis of official statistics, how rapidly the economic growth and the standard of living were rising in this country since the first figures became available. We find in a table on page 30 of this publication that they calculate that between 1915 and 1925 (that is right at the beginning of the Union) the standard of living as represented by the real income <i>per capita</i> was increasing to 0.4 per cent, not quite &#x00BD; per cent. We all know that the growth was very slow then because South Africa was still predominantly an agricultural country. Then we find that in the next phase, from 1925 to 1929, the growth increased to 1.6 per cent per annum; from 1929 to 1938 (the period just before the war) it increased further to 2.3 per cent per annum. From 1938 to 1948, which includes the war period when a large percentage of our manpower was non-productively employed outside the country, the standard of living rose even further by 2.6 per cent per annum. At that rate it does not take a very long period before you double your standard of living in the country as a whole. Then we find that in the period from 1948 to 1953, the first five years when this Government was in power, and they were still verly largely riding on the investments made before they came into power, the standard of living increased at a rate of 3.2 per cent per year. Then we come to the last period and find that from 1953 to 1960 the rate of increase in the standard of living for the people of South Africa dropped from 3.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent. And in the last two years, according to calculations of Hupkes and Van den Berg in their &#x201C;Economic Survey&#x201D;, that rate has not been much more than 1 per cent. In other words, Mr. Speaker, in the past decade of Nationalist government our growth has been slower than it has been since 1925. You have to go back to 1925 to get a slower rate of growth of the improvement <span class="col_171-172" refersTo="page_0100"/>in welfare in this country. In the past ten years it has been lower than in any period since 1925. Now this is the fabulous growth that we have been told about by the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs.</p>

<p>What are the consequences of this? Sir, this Government came into power at a period when the country was fairly highly industrialized already, just after the development of new gold fields. With proper government that expansion of 3.2 per cent per year could have been kept up and could have been increased. For a society of the nature of South Africa there is no reason whatsoever why we should not increase our standard of living at the rate of 3 per cent per year, which would in a very short time wipe out the most stringent poverty amongst our lowest income groups and would afford all our workers Western standards of living. But far from that happening, far from maintaining the rate of growth of about 3&#x00BD; per cent per year, we find that it has dropped to 1&#x00BD; per cent a year. What does this mean? It means that in the past ten years if we had kept up our rate of growth at 31 per cent our standards of living in South Africa would already have been 20 per cent higher than they are to-day. That means that extreme poverty would to a very large extent have been wiped out already. Put in figures, it would have meant that our national income would have been R1,000,000,000 higher than it is to-day. That is the price we are paying for a Government that follows such unreal and impractical policies. Of necessity it must slow down the rate of economic growth of a country like South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also said that South Africa was growing phenomenally industrially. I have gone to the trouble to compare the rate at which we have become industrialized in the past ten years compared with the previous ten years before this Government came into power, that is between 1938 and 1948, and it is not even two-thirds of that period.</p>

<p>We have not industrialized nearly as fast during the past ten years as we did during the period 1938-48, and one must take into account that South Africa was involved in a war for six years of that period, when it was very difficult to get equipment and to get investment and to industrialize rapidly. On what basis, then, can hon. gentlemen on the other side claim that South Africa is growing so rapidly, that our economic growth is so rapid and that our standards of living are rising so rapidly? The hon. the Minister writing in the <i>S.A. Patriot</i> tried to justify the Government. On what basis? It is rather amusing. He picks the five slowest growing countries in the whole of the Western world and then he compares the growth of our national income, and he then comes to the conclusion that three of them were growing slightly slower than we did. Had he gone to the trouble of calculating the real income per head, he would have found that even in the five slowest growing countries in the Western world, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were growing faster than South Africa. He does not make any attempt to measure the growth of South Africa by comparing it with continental Europe. Had he gone into that, he would have found that Common Market countries alone were growing three times as fast as South Africa&#x2014;the standards of living there were growing three times as fast as here. Had he gone to the trouble of looking at Japan, he would have found that they were growing five times as rapidly. And whether we like it or not, on what available evidence there is, it would appear that even in the communistic bloc they are growing very nearly as fast economically as the Common Market countries. In other words, even in the communistic countries standards of living are rising a lot faster than here in South Africa. Mr. Speaker, that is the real picture as shown by our own statistics, that far from being a country which is growing exceptionally fast and industrializing exceptionally fast, we are one of the slowest growing countries in the whole Western world.</p>

<p>What are the consequences of this? Apart from the fact that your standards of living are not rising fast enough, this slow rate of growth is gradually leading to a very serious problem of unemployment. I must here also say that never before in the history of South Africa had conditions been so favourable for economic growth as in the period when this Government had been in power. Because what has happened in the world since 1948? What has happened since 1953? We have seen the most phenomenal growth of industry all over the world. The demand for our export products has increased from year to year, and our exports in fact have increased many times over. Not only that, but this Government came in at a fortuitous moment, just after the discovery and development of vast new gold fields, and the result is that since 1953 the value of gold production alone doubled in this country. External conditions have never been so favourable to economic growth as they have been in the past decade in this country. Yet we have this miserable performance, this miserable growth compared with other countries in the Western world.</p>

<p>And what is it going to lead to? Apart from the fact that our standards of living are rising very slowly, there is also the danger of the unemployment problem, particularly as far as the non-Whites are concerned in our country. In this respect I would like to point to the serious problem of unemployment that already exists amongst the Bantu in South Africa, as set out in an article by the chairman of the Wage Board in the <i>Economic Journal</i> of June</p>

<p>1962. On page 111 he writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our knowledge of the number of the idle and under-employed among the Bantu is fragmentary and highly uncertain. The Report of the Viljoen Commission cites the Tomlinson Commission finding that only about half of the population of the reserves &#x2014;now probably about 4, 200,000 not counting <span class="col_173-174" refersTo="page_0101"/>the 400,000 to 500,000 migratory labourers&#x2014;could be absorbed in agriculture on an economic basis.</block>

<p>In other words, there is a potential surplus population of nearly 2.000,000, who all, of course, are not workers, but at least 500,000 are workers. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition, officials of the then Department of Native Affairs are stated to have estimated the number of unemployed Native male squatters of working age in rural areas at 200,000 and of unemployed Native adult and juvenile males in urban areas at 160,000 in 1958. Finally, there is the very large number of unemployed and under-employed Bantu females.</block>

<p>So the chairman of the Wage Board finds that at this present moment there are hundreds of thousands of unemployed male Natives and female Natives in this country who cannot get employment. In addition to that he calculates that whereas about 75,000 new Bantu workers come onto the labour market every year, at the rate at which we have been growing in the recent past employment opportunity is only created for about 42,000. In other words, for two-thirds of the Bantu work-seekers coming onto the market yearly there is no work. It is easy to see, Mr. Speaker, how this may lead to a very dangerous and very explosive situation if unemployment amongst the Bantu i, going to rise steadily. There is only one answer to that, namely that we must grow far more rapidly economically.</p>

<p>Why did we have this very slow rate of growth in this favourable period, economically speaking? There is little doubt that the main factors which have led to this slowing down in the rate of our economic growth has been the lack of an immigration policy of this Government until quite recently. We were still growing at a rate where we did not get by way of immigrants the necessary technical skill we required. The second main factor of course is the drying up of the flow of foreign capital, which gradually reduced and finally in 1955 virtually dried up completely, and in recent years we have had an outflow of foreign capital. We can well realize what effect that had on the growth of our economy. All these policies combined and the inherent military and political dangers as a result of the policies of the Nationalist Party have destroyed the confidence of investors. That cannot be shown better than by the fact that in the last decade the rate of private net capital investment, which indicates the rate at which a country is growing, has fallen from 13.6 per cent to 6 per cent in the last few years. It has very nearly become halved in the last decade, and yet that is the most productive sector of your investment. That is the type of investment that established new factories and new businesses, creating additional employment. I do not know why the hon. Minister shakes his head, because these are official figures. There is this great reduction in private net capital investment. Then of course lastly, in addition to all the other factors, we cannot have that economic growth as long as the Government follows their restrictive policy in respect of labour, setting limits to the acquirement of skills by the non-European people and neglecting the training of all the people, White, non-White, in acquiring skill&#x2014;neglecting the education of our people as a whole. I am sure that most educationists will admit to-day that South Africa is falling behind in the Western world in the rate of educational development. Economists are coming more and more to the realization that the question of economic development is not only a matter of investment of capital but it is also investment of capital in education, in the training of your people, training them in new skills in this technological age, training them in science. There we are falling behind in the world.</p>

<p>We are told that there is a big boom around the corner. Surely we can only have that economic growth in the future if those restrictions are removed. I admit that after the period of stagnation that we have had during the past two years and the development of surplus capacity, economic conditions will probably improve in the next year or two. But there will soon be a limit to that improvement, unless we reverse these fatal policies that have slowed down the rate of economic development so tremendously. For what earthly reason should we grow faster in the future than we have in the past ten years? It is most unlikely that external conditions will become more favourable for economic growth. On what basis can we possibly then grow faster? As I see it, that can only be achieved if we reverse many of these policies that I have cited, and probably the only practical way to bring that about would be a change of government. Unless we reverse some of these policies, we will not get this sustained boom that we are now being promised. Already the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own economic advisers tell him that a limit would quickly be set to any boom that develops by the bottle-neck of a shortage of skilled manpower. What has caused that bottle-neck of a shortage of manpower? The fact that we have cut down immigration for 14 years to such a tremendous extent, apart from the neglect in the training of our own people. What are the signs that a reversal of these policies will take place? I see no sign at all at the moment. In fact, what we are being promised is an intensification of apartheid, an intensification of these policies that have already slowed down the rate of economic growth in South Africa despite its large potential. I cannot elaborate too much on this, but in particular let me point out two serious economic consequences for particular areas that the Government&#x2019;s policies will have. In the first place we are told that border development is now going to be expedited, that the Government is going to divert industrial development as far as possible to the border areas. The fact that that is not an economic operation is self-evident from the fact that the Government finds that they have <span class="col_175-176" refersTo="page_0102"/>to give a lot of special concessions to those industries. So those industries will obviously not be economic, their development will not be as economic as in other areas. Otherwise special assistance would not be necessary. Of course I know that the fashion to-day is to say that this is only decentralization, and it so happens by good chance that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy of border development also accords with the idea of the decentralization of industry. But there is no objective evidence whatsoever that our industries in this country have become already over-centralized. It is just simply a statement from time to time, because if you compare our big centres of industry, you can compare them in two ways. Firstly, by taking the percentage of people living in those four or five big centres of industry in South Africa and comparing that percentage with for instance the percentage in Australia or Canada. Then we find that the concentration in South Africa is no worse than in those countries. You can also make a comparison in other ways. You can compare the actual physical size of our big urban centres, our industrialized centres, with those in the leading industrial countries in the world like the United Kingdom, Germany, France, America, Japan, and our big centres are small compared to theirs. The fact of the matter is that of course ultimately when a city gets to the size of London or Tokyo or New York, you reach certain limits where it becomes uneconomic to expand further, but none of our cities have come near that stage yet. It is an excuse, not a reason.</p>

<p>If one had a sensible Government in this country, surely the highest priority for diverting industrialization at the moment should not be to the border areas but for many reasons already given by speakers on this side of the House the Government should stimulate industrial development for instance on the Witwatersrand. This shifting to the border areas does not solve any of our problems at all. All that it does is to shift the so-called integration of Black and White from existing areas to new areas. It solves nothing. At this stage in our history, surely the Government should give special attention to the stimulation of industrial development not in the border areas but on the Witwatersrand. Do they realize what is going to happen on the Witwatersrand in the next decade? In the most recent issue of the <i>Financial Mail</i> estimates are made of the probable exhaustion dates of the 35 gold mines on the Witwatersrand and according to the <i>Financial Mail</i> of 11 January 1963, they say that in 1961, the 35 gold mines of the Witwatersrand produced 34 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s gold (R198.000,000). In ten years&#x2019; time all but eight of them will have closed. That means that 27 mines are going to close in the next decade. The <i>Financial Mail</i> makes a further estimate and says that at present the area&#x2019;s gold production is about 7,000,000 oz. a year, one-third of the Republic&#x2019;s total. In 15 years, unless fortune smiles again, it is likely to have sunk below 1,000,000 oz. If the Government does not take steps now, this is going to be one of the distressed areas of South Africa in the next decade. It is most amazing that hon. gentlemen should sit here representing those constituencies on the Government side without in any way using their influence on the Government to direct its attention to those areas. If we want a big surge of industrial development in the next decade, surely that is the area where it can be done most economically&#x2014;where you already have the public services, where you already have the houses, and where you have your commercial buildings. Surely that should be the area. The whole scheme of the Government becomes so illogical. You have vast permanent urban Native populations in the locations, but because technically they do not fall within Bantustans, those towns cannot even qualify for border development. And then you have got a city like Pretoria, only 36 miles removed from the same centres, and because as a result of historical reasons they happen to have a Native reserve within 30 miles, they can qualify for border development. It makes no sense at all. Even taking the argument that this border development even if it is not economic is there to safeguard the existence of the White man, will the White man&#x2019;s existence be safeguarded any better by industrial development in Pretoria than in Roodepoort or in Krugersdorp or in Boksburg, or Benoni? That is only one of the consequences of the policy of Bantustan development. But there is another aspect of it, the attempt to remove Native workers from the Western Cape. If you look at the economic history of the Western Cape in the last decade, you find that despite the large influx of Natives in industry here in the Western Cape, the Western Cape has not become industrialized any faster than the rest of South Africa. As a matter of fact it lagged behind in industrial development. Now what is going to happen in the Western Cape if instead of that inflow of Natives to industry you are going to reverse that trend and you are going to move Natives away from the Western Cape? Surely there can be only one consequence, and that is that the Western Cape will grow even slower comparative to the rest of South Africa than has been the case in the past ten years. That is the only deduction one can make. But what will the consequences be? The Whiter the Cape becomes, surely it will only mean the Blacker Port Elizabeth and East London and Kimberley will become. What do you solve by this sort of moving pawns about from one part of the country to the other? It does not make the White area of South Africa any Whiter over-all. All you are doing is that you pick out one certain island in the whole of South Africa that might possibly get Whiter at the expense of much slower economic growth. Hon. gentlemen on the other side should begin to realize how very difficult these problems are and that our racial problems cannot be solved by a political trick like apartheid. There is no sudden solution for our problems. The problems are far too complex. <span class="col_177-178" refersTo="page_0103"/>They are not only political problems but also economic problems and social problems. Surely the only sensible way is to advance not only on the political level but also to advance on the economic and social level. The proper priority should be to develop economically first and socially and politically last&#x2014;reversing the order and not pushing political development in this way. As hon. members have already pointed out many of the Bantu have not even asked for this development. Surely the more sensible way to tackle our problems is to advance on all levels. At least everyone in this House must be agreed that the more rapidly you grow economically and the more rapidly our standards of living rise, the easier it will become to solve our very complex problems. That should be the highest priority. If you start the other way round, as this Government does, by starting an unreal, impractical political solution, you solve nothing. You also retard and restrict your rate of economic development, surely in the long run making the solution of your problem impossible.</p>

<p>That is the main difference between us on this side and hon. members on the other side, that we have not got such a simple solution for the problems of South Africa, thinking that if only you can find the right political formula, our problems will be solved. We realize on this side of the House that advance to greater racial harmony must proceed on all levels of life, on the economic level, on the social level&#x2014;better education&#x2014;and lastly on the political level.</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down gave us a very interesting dissertation on the economic position in South Africa. Amongst others, he also coupled apartheid to the economic position. In that connection I just want to ask him one single question: Where he alleges that apartheid or. shall we say, the policy which is being followed in South Africa by this Government, is hampering the economic development of South Africa, I want to ask him to compare for a moment the economic stability of South Africa with that of other countries in Africa, countries in which you found the White man and where you still find him to some extent to-day but countries which he is leaving fast and where apartheid was not practiced. I think that is the only test which we can apply in that connection inasmuch as he alleges that apartheid is to a lesser or greater extent the reason for the slackness in our economic development. At a later stage in my speech I want to express a few views on our financial and economic position and I shall then read a few quotations. Sir. to refute certain allegations made by the hon. member as well as certain allegations we had from the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson).</p>

<p>Firstly, I wish to confine myself to the motion of no-confidence as moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I realize that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues on that side of the House have a very unenviable task to fulfil. They state that this House has no confidence in the Government. You particularly realize that that is, as it were, a statement which cannot be proved if you look at the history of South Africa over the past months and years. I also think that hon. members opposite realize that as well as we do. Last year, two or three months after the general election when the Opposition suffered the most crushing defeat in the history of the United Party, the Leader of the Opposition was wise enough not to come forward with a motion of no-confidence. On that occasion he came forward with a motion of censure and he said that if the Government did not do this or that the people of South Africa would lose confidence in the Government. That was what he did last year. In other words, he admitted by implication last year that the people of South Africa did indeed have confidence in the Government. But if it did not do this or that, it would lose that confidence. Up to the present we have heard nothing about this or that which the Government had failed to do since last year. This year he musters up courage, after his position has worsened since the general election in 1961 and after the position of the Government and the National Party has improved, and while he is aware of the fact that the people outside have greater confidence in the Government to-day than ever before. He now tries to prove to this House that statement which cannot be proved. I say that since the general election in 1961 the Government has continued to grow in strength. If we were to accept this motion of no-confidence in this House, it would imply that the whole of South Africa had no confidence in the Government, because every member of this House represents a constituency consisting of between 10,000 to 15,000 voters, and as such the people outside have no confidence in the Government. In spite of that, we repeatedly submitted the figures, as the hon. the Minister of Information did as well, to show that according to past elections the voters are continuing to show greater and greater confidence in the Government.</p>

<p>In the course of his speech the hon. the Leader of the Opposition raised certain points, very general points I must admit. It would really have facilitated our task had the Leader of the Opposition and those members who spoke after him been more specific. He raised certain general points of criticism and gave us a review and I wish to thank him for the fact that he did not come here with criticism against the Government and nothing else, but for having given us a review, and I think an honest review, of how he viewed South Africa and Africa and possibly also the rest of the world. But while I appreciate the way in which he did it, it does not mean that he has discharged the onus which he himself has placed upon his shoulders. He certainly did not acquit himself of his task with greater success, although we regarded it as a reasonable speech.</p>

<p><span class="col_179-180" refersTo="page_0104"/>The points he raised were, <i>inter alia,</i> the following: He said amongst others that we should cultivate friends at UNO. I admit that when you look at the voting at UNO from time to time we are all concerned. We realize that the voting does not paint a very favourable picture for South Africa and that gives all of us cause for great concern. However, I think we are also all agreed that the voting at UNO is not, in the first instance, an absolutely true reflection of the real friends we have in the world, because, rightly or wrongly, there is a feeling against discrimination in the world to-day. The feeling that there should be no discrimination on the basis of race or colour is being revealed throughout the world to-day. The countries who feel that way, countries which we know are good friends of ours, reveal that feeling that there should not be any discrimination. But they do not have the same problems which we have. The problem which confronts South Africa is unique inasmuch as it only applies to countries where the White man is to a very great extent in the minority and where the Black man is numerically the stronger. We must obviously make the deduction that the Black states of Africa and the other Coloured races cannot feel very sympathetic towards us because of our policy of discrimination. I should, however, like to ask the Leader of the Opposition and hon. members opposite this: When they come forward with their so-called race federation plan, a plan which contains all the elements of discrimination, are they at all hopeful that that system of race federation will gain them more friends at UNO? I get no reply from that side that that will be the position because I think hon. members accept that that will not be the case. The reason why we have problems at UNO is the feeling which exists against discrimination and the race federation plan of the United Party contains all the elements of discrimination. Not only does it contain the elements of discrimination, but it also contains all the characteristics to sell the White man in South Africa. You cannot doubt that, Sir, if you really approach the matter objectively because we have had repeated examples of that in Africa. It is exactly the same policy which other countries followed and where the position of the White man has worsened. It is the policy of partnership, of granting concessions. Britain succeeded to keep her Empire going for several hundred years by following a policy of granting concessions, but we must realize that the world has grown very much smaller. The world is no longer as big as it was in the past. There are easier means of communication to-day, such as the radio, the telephone and improved transport facilities. What happens here to-day is known this evening to all the other countries of the world and that is why the development in the world is taking place at a much faster pace. If we had to revert to a policy of making concessions to-day, a policy which may have been successful in the past for many years, we must realize that as a result of those concessions the process of development will be at a much faster pace than in the past. We will achieve nothing else than that if we follow the policy of the United Party. We know that what they are going to give to the Bantu by way of concession will not satisfy the Bantu. He will ask for more to-morrow and even more the day after.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also referred to the laxity in making provision should Britain join the Common Market. He also said that in spite of experience we were giving independence to people in South Africa; that we had not learned the lessons of Africa. I think we can justifiably say that the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. members opposite do not learn from Africa. Africa has repeatedly proved to us that the policy which they advocate to-day, the old policy of partnership, has been tested in numerous countries in Africa and failed. The same sort of policy was followed in Kenya, Tanganyika and the Rhodesias and they know as well as we do what happened there. I think, therefore, that it is not us who have not learned from Africa but the Opposition. If it is possible to continue to exist in a multiracial country like Rhodesia or one of the other African states, a policy other than that of partnership must be evolved, and the National Party has evolved that other policy and the Government wants to put it into effect. That is the reason why the people outside are giving stronger support to the Government to-day and will give it stronger and stronger support in future. In the other African states those people, who personally experienced it paid dearly for this policy of the Opposition, this policy which has failed there. They are coming to South Africa in their thousands and they are the people who are the greatest and strongest supporters of the policy of the National Party, they who have had the experience of what went wrong in those states which were handed over to the Natives. It is often said that we are allowing South Africa to be divided and parts of the country to come under the control of the Bantu. I admit that I too would have liked the borders to be different. We are often accused of dismembering South Africa. Naturally I would have preferred a border which extended from east to west across Africa, along the Limpopo or the Zambezi, so that we could have said that this southern point of Africa belonged to the White man and what lay to the north of it belong to the Bantu. That would have been much more acceptable to all of us but that is just not practical politics. To-day we are only within the borders of South Africa and it is only here that we have any authority. It is only within those borders that we can carry out our policy.</p>

<p>There was one person in the past whose views hon. members opposite have always accepted. I refer to General Smuts who thought very strongly along the lines in which the Government is to-day working. I just want to read portions of what he said in 1948. The accusation is often levelled at us from that side of the House that we want to practice a policy of domination (baasskap) and that we want to remain the master, that we want political domination. Even in 1948 General Smuts said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our policy is the policy of White domination in this country.</block>

<p>Then he continued&#x2014;</p>

<p>Hon. members are still agreeing, but they do not want them to be given any power in their own areas. General Smuts went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is our policy and naturally it also means this that as they become educated, as they progress, we must ensure that they also develop in the political field, so that they can take their place in the management &#x2026;</block>

<p>Those were the lines along which General Smuts thought in 1948 and if hon. members still agree with him I do not think we are very far away from each other. They should develop politically. That is precisely the difference between what is happening here in South Africa, between the policy which we are following here and what is happening in other African states. In other states of Africa the control was given to undeveloped nations, people who were not in a position to exercise that power. Here in South Africa we have a policy in terms of which we first want to educate those people; we as White people want to educate them so that they will ultimately be in a position to attain that power. If hon. members agree with what General Smuts said I think they can to a very great extent agree with us, at least to such an extent that, together with us, they will defend the policy of South Africa in respect of this all important question.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member believe that the Government is now following the policy of General Smuts?</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) possibly did not follow too well what I said. I quoted what General Smuts said. I said that in 1948 General Smuts thought strongly in terms of what is being done by the Government to-day. [Laughter.] If hon. members do not believe it, I shall read it again. This is what they hold against us&#x2014;that we give the Bantu political rights as they develop in their own areas. In Col. 2906 General Smuts said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is our policy, and of course it also involves this. As they become educated, as they make progress, we must see to it that they develop politically so that they can play their part in managing their own affairs in these areas.</block>

<p>Not in the Parliament of the White man, but in their own areas. All that I say is that if hon. members agree with General Smuts, they are not so very far removed from us as they occasionally try to make out.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made two further allegations which actually, in my opinion, deal more with administrative matters than matters of principle. He said, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Government accepts the fact that people are communists if they step into the breach for the non-Whites, and he also spoke about the neglect of our education. I think that this is actually more a question of the implementation of a policy, the administrative aspect more than the policy itself. If the hon. member had discussed this matter, one could have considered it, but he did not really argue against the policy. The general nature of their criticism made the attacks of the Opposition most ineffectual and I would prefer to confine myself to another subject, namely, the amendment, because I feel that by doing so I will be able to make a far more positive speech and because there is a great deal of substance in the amendment, namely, that the House has confidence in the Government. The hon. members of the Opposition had, quite understandably, very little to say about the economic position. The hon. members for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) and Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) were the only ones to <span class="col_183-184" refersTo="page_0106"/>discuss this question. I think that if one tries to criticize a Government one has to ask oneself how things are going with the country. The first thing that one then has to ask is: What is the state of the country financially and economically? It is quite understandable that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not discuss those points because the position in South Africa to-day is so good. The hon. member for Constantia quoted from speeches made by the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs and another Minister, and the only criticism that he was able to pass in the economic sphere was that these Ministers did not all tell the same story. However, in any case, I do not think that we will easily move him to believe hon. members on this side of the House. That is why I think that we should rather examine the statements of people who move more in these circles. Round about New Year various newspapers gave financial reviews of the past year and gave their opinions in regard to what could be expected this year.

<block name="quote">Investors had one of the best years in a long time. This should have been a very happy Christmas for the average investor in South African shares. We have had one of the best years for a long time, a year of steadily rising share prices, which in many cases have found their justification in larger dividend cheques.</block>

<p>This is in regard to the past year. Dealing with the possibilities for 1963, no less a newspaper than the <i>Sunday Times</i> stated on 30 December&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Good year ahead is forecast. Business and finance chiefs confident. Economy of the country buoyant. Commercial, industrial and financial leaders expect that 1963 will be a good year. That is the opinion expressed to me by a number of executives interviewed yesterday.</block>

<p>A newspaper in East London stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South African economy booms in New Year.</block>

<p>These are the reports which we receive in connection with our financial and economic position. and if the hon. member for Constantia wanted to say something about this matter he had only to look at some of his own newspapers. In this morning&#x2019;s newspaper we again read (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Reserves rise again. The South African reserves in gold and foreign currency rose last week by more than R4.000,000.</block>

<p>On the same page we read that the revival is continuing on the property market. This is the type of report which we have to-day in regard to our financial and economic position. I say that this is the first important test which must be made of any Government: How are the finances and how is the economy of the country managed? Is the country financially and economically sound? It was for this reason therefore that I asked the hon. member for Jeppes just now, when he contended that the policy of this Government in regard to racial matters had a detrimental effect upon our finances, to compare the position in South Africa with that of other countries in Africa where our policy is not being implemented. On the contrary, South Africa is the most stable state in Africa. We have the greatest measure of security of all the states in Africa. What is the reason for this? There can actually be only one reason which causes South Africa to stand out above the other states of Africa in the economic sphere and that is the policy of this Government. Because other states such as Kenya have completely lost their stability as a result of racial matters, it can only be in respect of our racial affairs and policy that we are retaining that stability, and nothing else.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>We in South Africa cannot avoid our racial affairs. No matter what we are discussing, whether we are discussing economic affairs or education, nine out of ten times racial matters enter the problem. Because it is so often discussed, I want to-day to make my own humble analysis of South Africa, in the first place as part of Africa and, secondly, the position of South Africa in the world to-day.</p>

<p>In the first place, I want hon. members on the other side to see South Africa, as I do, as a part of Africa. In Africa there are no fewer than 220,000,000 non-Whites, and on the whole continent there are only 5,000,000 Whites of whom more than 3,000,000 are in South Africa. The White man has lost his authority and his position in all the other states of Africa&#x2014;or is rapidly doing so. I want to ask this question: This side of the House is attacked by the Opposition because of the Government&#x2019;s racial policy. I want to ask hon. members opposite: Where the White man has lost his position of power in the other states of Africa, has this happened because he has followed the policy of the National Party there? Did the White man lose his position of power in Kenya because he followed a policy of apartheid, or is it a fact that we are faced with the problem to-day that we have to deal with Pan-Africanism and with the slogan &#x201C;Africa for the Africans?&#x201D; If this is true, if we accept the fact that the more than 200,000,000 Bantu in Africa are voicing the cry of &#x201C;Africa for the Africans&#x201D; and that it is not a hollow cry&#x2014;that they really do want Africa for the Black man&#x2014;then you will agree that apartheid has nothing to do with the matter, <span class="col_185-186" refersTo="page_0107"/>but that we as Whites in a country forming part of Africa have a common struggle and hon. members are all concerned with that common struggle, just as I am, irrespective of whether they are protagonists of apartheid or not. If hon. members agree with me in this regard, they will also realize that we have to stand by one another at this time against that great danger, a struggle which is not being waged against the apartheid policy but against you and me because our skins are white. We must realize that the time has come when we as Whites must stand together against that common enemy who is threatening the survival of the White man, not only in Africa but also in South Africa.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at a South Africa in the rest of the world. We exchanged a few words just now in connection with UN. We heard that that cry of &#x201C;Africa for the Africans&#x201D; is accepted in world circles&#x2014;the most extreme form of race hatred ever to have existed in the world in this sense that the White man is not conceded the smallest niche on the whole of the continent of Africa. However, that cry of &#x201C;Africa for the Africans&#x201D; is obviously accepted in world circles. Why is it accepted? It is accepted under the cloak of a so-called freedom. Articles which the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs quoted mentioned freedom which should be given to the Bantu as against the White man. This is done under the cloak of freedom; if the truth be known, it brings no freedom. Where independence has been given to them in the states of Africa it has not meant freedom for those people; it has not meant more freedom for the individual. What it has meant has been murder and death and sorrow to a very, very large extent. Notwithstanding this, however, the architects of this whole scheme in Africa succeeded in carrying the world along with them to a large extent because it was done under the cloak of freedom. As a result of the fact that many of our friends in the Western world have their own problems, economic and otherwise, and as a result of the fact that they often actually consider it to be of greater benefit to them to do business in millions than to look to the survival of a small group of White people in Africa, there is a second fact that we must realize. In the first place we must realize that we have this danger in Africa not as a result of apartheid, but because we are White people. The second thing that we must realize is that at this stage in any event we cannot expect much support and protection from the rest of the world and that to a very large extent we will have to wage a lone struggle in South Africa. In order to wage that struggle, in the realization that we are doing so alone and that we cannot expect support from any of the countries which should actually support us. it is more necessary to-day than ever before that we in South Africa should co-operate and stand together. It is sometimes disturbing to us to see a tendency on the part of our political enemies to pin their hopes on interference from outside. The hon. member for North-East-Rand (Brig. Bronkhorst) stated at a meeting last year that the Government would obviously not be removed from office from within South Africa and that this would perhaps have to take place from outside. It appears to me &#x2014;I hope that I am wrong&#x2014;that that idea has taken root in the minds of other leaders.</p>

<p>If, finally, we make an analysis of the position in South Africa. [Interjections.] I did not speak this evening about the Progressive Party or the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). I do not think that it is necessary at the present stage to devote much attention to her. I do not want to offend the hon. member for Houghton, but that is my opinion. In 1961 the Progressive Party received a reasonable measure of support at the general election. Shortly before the election I was in the Natal area where the Progressive Party received considerable support. Who was actually responsible for the fact that the Progressive Party received so much support there? It was no less a body than the United Party. Businessmen in reasonably high circles in Natal gave me the impression that they could no longer see any future in the United Party and that they were quite prepared to lend their support to any other party in which they could see their future salvation. That was why a number of them went over to the Progressive Party. Our experience recently has been that they are starting to trickle back. They realized that they were wrong. There is to-day only one possible alternative government and that is a government of the official Opposition. They are the only people with whom we can make comparisons. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>But when an hon. member talks about our standing together <span class="col_187-188" refersTo="page_0108"/>he must take the argument a little further and tell us behind whom we must stand together, and on what basis. Does he want us to stand together on the basis of petty apartheid, which is the cause of the difficulties in which South Africa finds itself to-day? No, Dr. Malan once said something very true, namely that there is a certain type of unity which is much more dangerous than division, and I must say that I regard unity with the Government as much more dangerous to the future of the White man than the differences we have.</p>

<p>The proposition is continually being stated that the Opposition wishes to make &#x201C;concessions&#x201D; to the non-Whites, and that &#x201C;concessions&#x201D; must necessarily result in the abdication of the White man. I want to ask the hon. member: Is the policy followed by the Government in respect of the Bantu areas not a political concession to the Bantu?</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Then what about the granting of local government to the Bantu in the urban areas? Is that not the beginning of political concessions to the Bantu outside the Bantu areas? And if the hon. member believes&#x2014;something with which I do not agree&#x2014;that making concessions essentially contains the germ of abdication, he is still destroying his own argument because his Government is in fact making concessions to the Bantu in the sense in which he himself refers to concessions. In any case, I do not think that to us it is a question of concessions. The policy of the Opposition is not based on making concessions <i>per se.</i> Concessions are not relevant. What we have to decide in South Africa is not whether we should make concessions here or there, but the question is what we should do to remedy what is wrong in the relations between White and non-White, and what we should do to do justice to everybody&#x2014;not to make concessions out of the heights.</p>

<p>We continually hear the argument that the Natives will not be satisfied with the policy of the United Party. All of us sitting here surely know that the actual racial problems of South Africa are not situated in the Transkei and in respect of the tribal Natives. The crux of the problem is the large settled urban Bantu population which cannot be removed. Several millions of Natives will remain living in the cities permanently&#x2014;many of whom have no contacts with the reserves, were not born there, and have or will have no interests there. Does the hon. member want to tell me that they will be satisfied with the formula of the Nationalist Party, of being allowed to vote in a place where masses of them have never been before, will never go and do not want to be?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Government is always busy comparing South Africa as a country with the new independent states in the rest of Africa. I regard that as quite fantastic. South Africa has 300 years of civilization and development behind her, with a strong economy, with the rich gold mines, with 3,000,000 Whites and 1, 500,000 half-Whites. The conditions and the population here are in no way the same as those in the rest of Africa. One simply cannot compare them. Even in Southern Rhodesia, where there is the largest number of Whites except for South Africa, there are only as many White people as we have in Paarl and Worcester and a few other large towns. In Kenya many people regarded themselves as temporary residents. I met a South African-born woman there who was married to a Briton employed in the public service in Kenya, and who spoke enthusiastically about the prospect of &#x201C;home leave &#x201D;&#x2014; but &#x201C;home leave&#x201D; was the official term used for a holiday in Britain! Apart from that, none of these areas in any case was at liberty to determine its own future. The White man in Kenya did not hold his own future in his hands, nor the White man in Rhodesia, Uganda or any of the other African territories. They were colonies and were subject to the authority of Britain. The position there is quite different. But to go further: What actually went wrong in Africa? The hon. member alleges that partnership failed. I deny that. What failed in Africa is apartheid&#x2014;&#x201C; baasskap apartheid &#x201D;. Let any hon. member get up and tell me where &#x201C;partnership&#x201D; was fully applied in practice. It was not really applied in any territory in Africa, in any case not timeously. In Kenya <i>I</i> found myself in the company of a Minister from Ghana. That was during the conference there of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and I could not even take this Ghanaian Minister into the club where I stayed to have a meal with me in order that we could converse a little. There was as much apartheid there as there is here. In Rhodesia, with its Land Apportionment Act, they used the term &#x201C;partnership&#x201D; but never applied it. In some respects apartheid was applied more strictly in Rhodesia than in South Africa. Partnership has never been given a chance anywhere in Africa, and I say that what has failed in Africa is apartheid. The White man in the rest of Africa has paid a heavy price for enforced apartheid, for &#x201C;baasskap apartheid &#x201D;. There they woke up too late and now belatedly they want to make changes. Unless we in South Africa wake up and have a change of spirit we will also pay a price which will frighten us.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>No matter how much I may differ from a political opponent, there is one thing which I do not do lightly and that is to doubt the good intentions of my opposing party. There are of course exceptions to all rules, but no matter how wrong and how detrimental to the country the political actions of some politicians may appear to me, it is my opinion that most politicians and political parties believe that the road which they have taken in politics is in the best interests of the country. Of all the political parties in the country there is, however, always only one whose view of what is in the best interests of the country can be tested against the results of its administration, and that is the political party which is in power and forms the Government of the country. An opposition party may be attacked in regard to what it says it wants to do, but all the accusations against an opposition regarding the alleged results of its policy remain speculation and nothing more than pure speculation. One can try to make comparisons with what has happened in other countries or what is happening there, but that actually makes no difference because in no two countries of the world do we find that the background to things and the circumstances are ever the same. Least of all are South Africa and her population even remotely comparable with any other country on the continent of Africa and the population of that country. I want to emphasize the fact that it is only the political party in power that can be criticized without such criticism resting necessarily upon speculation. The result of its administration are there for all to see. It is therefore on the grounds of the visible and tangible results of the policy of the present Government that a clear and firm rejection of its administration is more than justified. I should like us to look, for example, at two aspects of the picture of South Africa as it has developed and as we find it to-day as a result of the policy and the administration of the Government, and then to look at the attitude and the relationships which have resulted from it.</p>

<p>In the first place let us take the relationship between the White and non-White sections of the population in this country. One can quote reams of evidence from less moderate Black political leaders to show how strongly the hatred, the bitterness, which the Government has created with all the injustices of apartheid has developed in the mind of the non-White. But I deliberately refrain from quoting the extreme political leaders. I want to quote the evidence of a moderate Coloured, a lecturer at the Government&#x2019;s Coloured University College of the Western Cape&#x2014;Mr. Adam Small, the Afrikaans writer&#x2014;in order to prove how embittered the non-White feels to-day. In his book &#x201C;Die Eerste Steen&#x201D; (The First Stone) he writes as follows on page 25 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What must I think and how must I feel when my wife who is six months pregnant has to stand in a bus for seven miles&#x2014;as I have described&#x2014;and has to experience that suffering and humiliation for the same reason that we are not allowed to form part of the people and of the nation; she is not White &#x2026; My Afrikaner brother, be honest; I am not talking because of a cheap political interest but from a heart which, I hope, has affection: Is any law which covers such incidents, <span class="col_205-206" refersTo="page_0117"/>which approves of such incidents, justified? Can it be reconciled with Christianity? If people who have had a good home for generations in a good residential area are uprooted, torn from the earth they love and on many occasions with no other consideration against them except their colour&#x2014;can a law which necessitates such incidents be reconciled with Christian principles? The home which is my birthplace was also taken away in this manner&#x2014;but once again, it is not only my experience; these experiences are with us every day. If opportunities for employment are taken from us because we are Brown, because we are allegedly a &#x201C;danger&#x201D; to the White man, is this how one treats one&#x2019;s fellowmen? Must we rear our children so that one day from the moment they leave their home in the morning until they return home in the evening, they will have to watch out for boards with prohibition notices and work out each moment for themselves in advance where they may walk, may sit, may stand? Must we rear our children to suffer these humiliations, this violation of our human dignity which dogs our every step like our shadow? &#x2026;</block>

<p>He states further on (page 18)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The White people in South Africa are doing dreadful things to us, things which cause a Christian conscience to cry out for justice &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the evidence of a moderate Coloured, a person who is not even in party politics. This is what another important Coloured leader has stated&#x2014;Mr. N. Kearns, chairman of the Coloured War Veterans&#x2019; Organization. I quote from the <i>Banier</i> of July 1961. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The loyalty of the Coloureds on which the Government has always depended, has disappeared for all time&#x2014;I repeat, for all time &#x2026; The legislation of the Government in regard to group areas and job reservation has compelled the Coloured to hate not only the Government but all Whites. And the hatred is strong.</block>

<p>The administration, the policy and the legislation of this Government has, in the relationships between White and non-White, created a bitterness in the mind of the non-White which I do not think we will ever be able to eradicate in South Africa. The Afrikaner knows what the Anglo-Boer War did to his soul for generations. I wonder whether the White man in this country will ever overcome the hatred and bitterness against the Whites which the action of this Government has created in the minds of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>The second picture that I wish to paint of South Africa as it is under the present Government concerns the relationship between South Africa and the outside world. It is continually said by members opposite that enmity towards us started in 1947 under General Smuts and the United Party.</p>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>But you said that yourself.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is true. It is true that in 1947 harsh words were used against South Africa at the UN, particularly by India. The difference is that at that time, under the United Party, the hostility was restricted to a few countries. to-day it is general. The second difference is that at that time, although we had a few enemies, all the important Western countries stood by us. Study the records. Look at all the countries which were still on our side in spite of the few enemies that we had. Look at the friends who actively assisted and defended us. But, in the third place, if a man like General Smuts had remained in power, he would have acted in such a way and administered the country in such a way that he would either have overcome that hostility or else reduced it or at least not have allowed it to increase. I agree that this Government inherited a certain measure of enmity, but its task was to reduce that enmity. After all that is the task of diplomacy. General Smuts did not have the time; shortly after the 1947 session of UNO he was removed from office. Countries always have their enemies and South Africa will also have her enemies. No one imagines that we can win the friendship of the communist countries. America also has strong enemies at UNO. We complain that we are being attacked there by America and Britain are sometimes attacked by the communist countries at UNO even more strongly and unfairly than South Africa is. We are not the only country which is attacked unfairly. But I repeat that, the difference between our position and that of America and Britain is that America and Britain do at least retain strong friends on their side; they do at least have a good case which they can defend and by means of which they can retain their friends. They do at least ensure that they administer their affairs in such a way that they retain strong allies. Our Government, however, because of its lack of diplomacy, because of its unfortunate administration at home, has placed South Africa in a position where we no longer have only a few enemies as was formerly the case, but where the entire civilized world has turned its back on us. Even Portugal which always voted with us has already gone so far as to abstain from voting and is also gradually moving away from our Government.</p>

<p>When we consider our position abroad, we find that over the past years things have gone from bad to worse with us. In reality, we were forced out of the Commonwealth; we are forced out of every meeting in Africa, even meetings of a non-political nature. And who will deny that our membership of UNO is at present hanging by a thread? I personally am strongly in favour of South Africa&#x2019;s having to play a dynamic role in the community of nations throughout the world and in Africa. Think of the material we have in South Africa! We have Whites of Dutch, British, French <span class="col_207-208" refersTo="page_0118"/>and German descent; we have Coloureds, also Coloureds of Malayan descent; we have Natives of Africa races; we have people of Indian and Pakistani descent. If these elements can co-operate, if these elements can find a joint loyalty towards South Africa, if we can harness this talent correctly, if we give this talent a South Africa to which they can all be loyal, then South Africa can play a leading role in the organizations and on the platforms of the entire world&#x2014;if only we had a Government which had greatness and vision! As things stand to-day, however, I am often inclined to think that as long as this Government is in power, it will perhaps be better for us to withdraw from everything, because wherever it is, its presence creates a crisis and weakens our position and causes greater harm. There is really nothing good that this Government can still do for South Africa in the international sphere in respect of foreign affairs.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs returned from UNO not so long ago, and listen to what he reported. Before he left New York, he said in an interview with the New York Press.</p>

<block name="quote">I do not have many contacts here&#x2014;not that I do not want them. I attended receptions but not with very much success.</block>

<p>This report appeared in the <i>Burger</i> of 10 November 1962. He admitted failure. What was more, he returned to Johannesburg and reported as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I was never so pleased to return from the hatred and spite of our enemies which has never been as strong as this year.</block>

<p>This report appeared in the <i>Burger</i> of 17 November 1962, which reported further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Louw added that he had also noticed a cool attitude towards South Africa &#x201C;amongst our so-called friends It was not so much coldness as unwillingness to be seen in his company, he said.</block>

<p>What a shocking report to make! What a position for a country to be in! What an admission of absolute, irrevocable failure: People do not even want to be seen in the presence of South Africa&#x2019;s representative! And the Government accepts the futility and the hopelessness of its position to such an extent that it does not even try to do what every other country would do with an ambassador who reported such abject failure, and that is to replace him. I think that the time has come when the hon. the Prime Minister should personally begin to sit up and consider the position in which South Africa finds herself. My personal opinion is that the Prime Minister should himself take over the Department of Foreign Affairs and that he himself should take the responsibility of trying to salvage the position. To reassure its own members the Government is trying to do its best to create the impression on the part of everyone that it is the fault of the Opposition that the world has such a terrible picture of the Government. The facts however unequivocally refute such a standpoint. Most of the important countries of the world have their own representatives in South Africa as observers, men who send reports out of the country and so help formulate the opinion of their governments on the other side. I admit that an Opposition member is quoted outside here and there, but that is by way of exception. When people overseas judge a country, they do not judge it on the grounds of what its Opposition states; they judge it according to the actions and the legislation of the Government in power.</p>

<p>Just look at the reports in the overseas Press. They do not deal with what Opposition members say here but with what Government leaders say and do. Take for example a piece of work like &#x201C;South Africa and the Rule of Law&#x201D; issued by the International Commission of Jurists, Geneva. 1960. This is only one of many documented accusations against South Africa. If someone wishes to make an attack upon South Africa and seeks facts, he will first lay his hands upon a document of this nature. This is one of the documents which is most condemnating of the state of affairs in our country to-day and it is based, piece by piece, not on what the Opposition has to say here, not upon quotations of Opposition members; it is based piece by piece on laws and regulations of the Government or statements by Government leaders and even upon policy documents of the Nationalist Party. The same thing holds good for all the important statements and books against South Africa. Take even the report of UN on South West Africa. Here and there an Opposition member is quoted&#x2014;I have also been quoted. I do not mind being quoted as long as I speak the truth. To tell the truth I believe that it is in the interests of South Africa that the outside world should know that there are about 50 per cent of the Whites here who are doing everything in their power to try and bring about a change of Government. My point is this: For every Opposition member who is quoted abroad there are ten Government leaders who are quoted to the detriment of South Africa. The image of South Africa which the people abroad have is the image which is based on the policy and the application thereof and the words and actions of the Government itself. A book has just appeared written by Field-Marshal Montgomery, a friend of the Government, a friend of South Africa. In it he states&#x2014;according to the <i>Burger</i> of 15 October 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The laws dealing with petty apartheid (klein apartheid), which are merely racially discriminatory, must be reviewed at this stage. Apartheid is still sometimes applied harshly and unjustly.</block>

<p>These are our friends who see what is going on here and who speak in this way. This is not the Opposition. One of the best friends <span class="col_209-210" refersTo="page_0119"/>of South Africa, Lord Fraser of Lonsdale, who has often been in South Africa and knows what is going on said again recently&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Petty apartheid is irritating and unnecessary and places South Africa in a bad light.</block>

<p>These are not the statements of the Opposition but the actions of the Government. I can go on producing proof after proof in this regard. Mr. Willem van Heerden writes in an article in <i>Dagbreek</i> of 18 November 1962 [Translation.]-</p>

<block name="quote">We cannot expect to make ourselves loved in Africa if we create the impression that we do not wish to allow Black people to play on golf courses in the White area because we do not want to allow them to use "the same toilet facilities as the Whites".</block>

<p>And then the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs comes along and complains bitterly because nobody in Africa wants to be friendly towards him! How can the Government expect the people in Africa and the rest of the world to sit with him at one table while he and his Government determine that in this country a Coloured may not even enter by the same door of a post office or a government building as a White man, simply because he is Coloured? How can one expect to make friends and sit down together with others if in our own country they are not even permitted to enter by the same door of a post office as the White man does?</p>

<p>I think that it is high time that the Government put its hand into its heart to see how much of the fault lies with itself. There are few people whose politics have indeed contributed so much towards placing South Africa in an unfavourable light abroad as the Prime Minister himself. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Church clause as an example of something for which the Prime Minister was personally responsible. I have a book here which appeared recently entitled &#x201C;The Challenge of Change&#x201D; by Alexander Steward. He is one of the most ardent supporters of apartheid on two legs. He is a follower of the Prime Minister and of the Government. He was chief information officer in London for many years and on page 165 of his book he writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Church clause was condemned throughout the Western world and was doing great damage to South Africa&#x2019;s reputation.</block>

<p>Indeed, so serious was the harm caused by this step of the hon. the Prime Minister that our office in London had to make special representations to the Government; and all this because of something which was not necessary. No, Mr. Speaker, if one studies the record of the Government, one finds that it is the petty, silly, unnecessary apartheid which only wounds and solves nothing, which is responsible for South Africa&#x2019;s miserable reputation abroad. The same thing as happened with the Church clause happened with the removal of the Native representatives from this House. I can mention many other things that the Government did and I repeat: No single politician has contributed so much&#x2014;and I am speaking about his politics, not about his person&#x2014;towards creating a harmful image of South Africa abroad by the things that he did as Minister of Native Affairs, and permitted, as the hon. the Prime Minister. Look at the language that the hon. the Prime Minister again used in his New Year message to the outside world. He referred to unnamed nations as &#x201C;ducktail nations&#x201D;, ducktail nations which are apparently in control of UN. As a South African I lodge the strongest objection to the use of that language by the Prime Minister of our country. I say that in that way he has done a colossal disservice to South Africa. I have no objection if the Prime Minister wants to attack another government. I would have no objection if he were to say that there is a ducktail government in power somewhere, because there are countries which consider his government to be a ducktail government and say so. However, to malign an entire nation as being ducktails&#x2014;I think that that is language which is unforgivable. Moreover, if one considers the facts, one finds that no single group of nations always votes together at UN. Even the Afro-Asian group is often seriously divided on certain matters. Therefore, there can be no question of the control of UN being exercised by a single group. Nothing of that nature exists. They are indeed united in regard to the handling of South Africa&#x2019;s affairs. Yes. in a certain respect America does have control over UN. It is in her hands to allow UN to collapse financially. However, is that what the Prime Minister meant? Did he refer to America when he spoke about ducktail nations being in control at UN, or did he mean all of those which attacked his government? We must remember that India and the African countries are not the only countries which sharply attack South Africa. What about Holland? Does he regard the Hollanders as a ducktail nation? Are the Indians, the people of Ghandi, a ducktail nation? No, I think that it is time that the Prime Minister should rise to tell us what he meant by accusing nations of being ducktail nations. By that statement he has finally made his own position and South Africa&#x2019;s position in the community of nations impossible and I think that he owes it to South Africa, if not to himself, to apologize as soon as possible -I hope, to-day.</p>

<p>I fully realize the difficulty of the Prime Minister. He wants to leave UN and he is going to leave, and he is making public opinion ripe for his withdrawal from UN. In 1961, when there was talk of our leaving UN he said: South Africa should not leave it now. The newspapers which reported him did not emphasize the &#x201C;now&#x201D; but I have here the English text of his official statement and in terms of that statement he said&#x2014;</p>

<p>South Africa will not leave the United Nations now. That was very significant, to my <span class="col_211-212" refersTo="page_0120"/>mind. He himself emphasized the &#x201C;now". His statement about ducktail nations, the speech of the President, at the opening of Parliament, the attitude of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he said yesterday that South Africa would not tolerate her representatives at UN being maligned any longer, all appear to me to be indications that the Government is trying to prepare public opinion so that it can place its final stamp upon the total collapse of our foreign diplomacy. South Africa is a country with great problems, but the greatest problem we have in South Africa to-day is in my opinion the Government we have. I believe that every person and every body which assists the Government and supports it while it is linked with minor apartheid and while compulsory apartheid forms the basis of its administration, makes itself part of the problem instead of the solution. The Government is too firmly enmeshed in its own creations to change its policy. However, I believe that history will not allow it to continue for long with its present course of action and I think that in the meantime it is the duty of every thinking White person, as long as this position continues, to dissociate himself as far as possible from the Government and to fight for a change of Government. I want to see a White Government taking office and a White Parliament which can still take timeous action in South Africa to restore the relationship between people in South Africa and between South Africa and the outside world before it is finally too late.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) said in the beginning of his speech this afternoon that he wanted to discuss only two aspects of the present position in our country. What the two are I still do not know because he had something to say about almost everything without accounting in the least for one of his standpoints. He started in this way yesterday. He stood up yesterday and said that it had been said that partnership had failed in Rhodesia. However, he said, it was not partnership which failed; it was apartheid which failed. Well, I listened most attentively to hear how the hon. member for Bezuidenhout was going to argue in support of that standpoint. He did not touch on it again. He said that what happened in Rhodesia was the failure of apartheid.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member this: Is it not true that Sir Edgar Whitehead based his platform on the rejection of apartheid a week or two ago before the election he fought?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>That is the strangest reason that I have ever heard. Sir Edgar asks them to reject apartheid and instead of rejecting apartheid they reject Sir Edgar!</p>

<p>As the latest recruit to the United Party the hon. member is setting a complete liberalizing process in motion in that party. All that he actually seeks to prove by that argument is that this system which existed in Africa, the system of race discrimination, of the recognition of racial identity, has collapsed. That is what he wants to tell us; that instead of the system of racial inequality which existed we must now have the system of equality. That is what he has in mind but he does not have the courage to say it.</p>

<p>He also made another point, one of a large number of loose statements. He said: We must not look at Kenya and the other African territories and then say that this is what happened there, and learn a lesson from it. He said that it is totally different in Kenya. There, the people never had the desire to remain permanently in Kenya; they were there temporarily only, or that was how they regarded themselves. Mr. Speaker, there are things which are different and there are things which are the same in Kenya and in South Africa. It is not surprizing that the hon. member should stare blindly at that one aspect which he mentioned. I want to refer to two things of which he is perhaps aware but which he does not wish to admit for his own peace of mind, and those are the things which are the same between ourselves and Kenya, namely, the demands which are made of the White man by the communists, by the liberals and by the agitators. The same demands which are made of the White man in Kenya are made here of us. These are the things which are the same. However, there are also things which are different, and one of them is that in Kenya you had a White population who were there as the outpost of a colonial power. In South Africa you have a White nation which has accepted the challenge of Africa, which has accepted the fact that it is part of Africa and that it has a vocation here. That is the difference, but the hon. member does not share in it; otherwise he would have found his place in our Party because this Government is the bearer of that vocation, of that acceptance of the challenge of Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to deal with the hon. member any further. He said many things which he did not support at all. I referred to him as a person who is seeking to set a liberalizing process in motion in the United Party and in the light of his statements here in the House in the past I actually thought that he would join with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in his accusation against the National Party that we are seeking to treat the liberals and communists as one. I expected him to do that but apparently he is too liberally-minded and they were afraid that he would go too far in speaking about a matter of this nature.</p>

<p>I want, however, to return to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said about the matter because after him the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) spoke and said the same things which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had said, and that was how the English newspapers reported them. The remarkable thing <span class="col_213-214" refersTo="page_0121"/>about this is that what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition said, namely that this Government was making the mistake of equating Liberalism and Communism, were literally and precisely the words used by Lawrence Gandar, the editor of the <i>Daily Mail,</i> the mouthpiece of the liberals. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition took over that statement of Lawrence Gandar word for word and announced it to the world&#x2014;he announced it as an accusation against the National Party. I will return to this point later. Let us look now at this statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. Is it true that the National Party and this Government can be held responsible for the fact that Communism and liberalism are spoken of in the same breath? That is not so. It is not necessary for this Party to link liberalism and Communism with one another or to equate them. That is what takes place daily. It is a reality in South Africa that the liberals and the communists equate themselves daily, they associate with one another, they identify themselves with one another. It is not necessary for us to say it and it is ridiculous for the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to say that this Party is responsible for that and that we are making a mistake in trying to combat Communism in this way.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Two days ago the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) stood up in this House&#x2014;I do not think she will take it amiss of me if I call her a liberal &#x2014;and associated herself most vociferously with the statements of Mandela who is a communist. If in a political debate one finds that a liberal quotes the evidence of a communist in order to support her standpoint, what does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition call that? What does the hon. member for Wynberg call it? There are numbers of such examples. We know for example what is at present happening in Cuba. Cuba is a communist base, a Russian base, and we know that a number of years ago the communist Castro took over the Government there after the Government had been overthrown and Batista had been murdered. In 1961 when it was quite clear to the whole world that there was a communist dictator in Cuba, an agent of Russia who was in control in Cuba, on 2 June 1961 the <i>Cape Times</i> wrote a leading artical in pursuance of the fall of that other dictator, Trujillo, in the Dominican Republic&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Until the liberalizing movement which started with Castro&#x2019;s revolution in Cuba began &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is how the mouthpiece of the liberals views that violence, that taking over control by the communists&#x2014;as the start of a liberalizing movement. Liberalism and Communism are therefore linked up in the minds of those people. It is not we who link them up. However, I want to mention another example to you. Here in South Africa we had a man called Patrick Duncan who was and is still perhaps, an office-bearer of the Liberal Party, a man who was editor of the paper <i>Contact</i> which is the official mouthpiece of the Liberal Party. The <i>Cape Times</i> referred repeatedly to him as &#x201C;the most outspoken anti-communist in South Africa&#x201D;, I have here an issue of <i>New Age,</i> the communist paper in South Africa which has now been banned. This is the communist mouthpiece in Africa and on 5 April last year they wrote a leading article the concluding paragraph of which read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The main need is to unite in one freedom front all anti-apartheid South Africans, who must put aside their differences in minor points and concentrate on their common and urgent task of survival.</block>

<p>That was what the communist mouthpiece in South Africa wrote on 5 April and on precisely the same date, 5 April 1962, in <i>Contact,</i> on page 2, a leading article appeared under the heading: &#x201C;Let anti-apartheid forces unite&#x201D;. I will read to you what they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The time has come when it is necessary for all who love freedom and equality, and all who hate racism, to stand together in one powerful movement that can finish off apartheid.</block>

<p>Then this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is the main obstacle in the way of union? In our view it is the stubborn refusal by the congress movement to be truly neutral.</block>

<p>The only demand which the Liberal Party and the Liberal mouthpiece makes for co-operation with the communists in South Africa is that they must be &#x201C;truly neutral &#x201D;. Then they are prepared to co-operate with them completely. It was perhaps coincidental that it was on the same date that the organ of the Liberal Party and the organ of the communists in South Africa made an identical appeal that the communists and liberals should stand together in South Africa, ostensibly against apartheid, but not against apartheid; against White rule in South Africa. I ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition once again whether it is we who are responsible for the fact that Liberalism and Communism are equated. Or is it the United Party which now and again steps into the breach for the liberals the Party and Press of that hon. member? We had the case of Dr. Edward Roux, now Professor Edward Roux. In his own book he described himself as an agitator. We know that under the United Party Government he was sentenced because of his agitation. He was a member of the Communist Party and was named. After this he joined the Congress of Democrats and when Wits made him a Professor, the <i>Sunday Times</i> wrote&#x2014; remember, this is the newspaper in which the hon. member for Yeoville now and again still <span class="col_215-216" refersTo="page_0122"/>receives an opportunity to express his views&#x2014; that he was only a liberal. He was a self-confessed communist, but they did not want to know it and they said he was a liberal. And then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition blames us for linking Communism and Liberalism with each another. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to accuse us of doing these things and says that they are mistakes in our combating of Communism, he can continue to do so, but then we will also know that he is not doing so because he is in earnest in combating Communism, but that he is doing so in the tradition of his Party in order to intercede for the liberals and nothing more.</p>

<p>I have very little time but I would also like to dwell for a moment on one other matter because the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made so much of how wrongly we are trying to combat Communism. He said: &#x201C;We must destroy the seed-beds in which Communism germinates&#x201D;, Then he mentioned a number of things which the Government should do in order to destroy the seed-beds of Communism. He said that the Bantu should receive title rights and that there should be Parliamentary representation and exemption from the pass laws. However, his first point was: &#x201C;You must eliminate poverty&#x201D;, This was one of the grounds for his accusation against the Government that it was not combating Communism&#x2014; that the Government could not eliminate poverty. Mr. Speaker, which Government in Africa and which Government in South Africa in the past has done more to combat poverty than the present Government? That is the sort of accusation which is made. However, that is not the point which disturbs me most in this connection. We combat poverty because this Government considers it its duty to govern the country properly and not so much because it considers that in that way it is combating Communism. What worries me more is that this story which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition keeps telling us&#x2014;that one should not combat the liberals and that one should not adopt measures like the Suppression of Communism Act, but that one should combat poverty&#x2014;is a tale which returns like clockwork once or twice a year. There was a time when it was feasable to say that one could combat Communism by combating poverty. That was the time when Communism was still making its assault upon capitalism as an economic system and when it was still making its attacks in economic terms. It accused capitalism of being the cause of all economic misery, the reason for the extremes of wealth and poverty which existed in the world. At that time it suited communist terminology to make its appeal to people who were poor, the peasants, the labourers. At that time it made its appeal directly to those people in economic terms because it attacked capitalism in economic terms. However, those days are long past. The hon. member for Yeoville knows that in 1947 the Commintern in the statement which it issued did not even refer to capitalism. It referred to imperialism, particularly British imperialism, and then of course it became senseless to make an appeal to the labourer and the peasant if one wished to attack imperialism. With that change in terminology there was a complete change of front and a complete change in the approach of Communism which makes it ridiculous now to combat it along the lives of methods of a previous decade and earlier. However, that is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is trying to do. The communists have realized that it is far easier to make use of cultural and professional and social frustrations on the part of people who have freed themselves from their communities, people who have been liberalized, like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. They have noticed that it is far easier to influence them than to try to make use of economic frustrations. With that change which has come about, it is not realistic to-day to try to make out that one can combat Communism by combating poverty. One would then be fighting on completely different grounds from those on which Communism operates. I want to give one example of an insight into this reality and I think that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will take note of it and respect it. I quote this to indicate that it does not help to combat poverty if one wishes to combat Communism effectively. This is what Sir Godfrey Huggins, now Lord Malvern, said in June, 1952&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The real appeal of Communism is not to the African masses, but to the urban intelligensia, and the appeal is not on account of its economic doctrine, not because of its world view, but because of one element in its philosophy&#x2014;abolition of colour prejudice.</block>

<p>One other point: If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition thinks that with his policy of granting title rights, granting Parliamentary representation and granting exemption from the pass laws he can effectively combat Communism under existing circumstances, as Sir Godfrey Huggins put it, then he is making a big mistake because then he will be trying to combat Communism on communist terms. He will be trying to bid against Communism in the dispensing of so-called rights to these people. He cannot combat them in that way.</p>

<p>One can combat Communism if only there are two basic acknowledgements. The one is the promotion of a sound and true patriotism and a sound and true nationalism. That is the most effective counter to communist infiltration. The second is that one must have a Government which is not afraid of the responsibility of governing; one must have a Government which shows that it is seeking to maintain order, not that it is seeking to maintain order for the foreseeable future only. That is how the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his Party assist Communism best, because they are already informing the communists that they are prepared to maintain this order for the foreseeable future only.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. memberim-who has just sat down, in his deep concern <span class="col_217-218" refersTo="page_0123"/>with the problem of liberals and communists, asked the question as to who had done more to combat Communism than the Nationalist Government. The answer to that is quite simple. The answer is that the United Party did more. [Laughter.] And that is not the view of this side of the House only. It is the view of the Minister of Justice&#x2019;s own former Commissioner of Police, who stated in a public declaration dealing with Communism&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To spread communist propaganda is now an offence.</block>

<p>He continued to state that the years 1946 and 1947 were amongst our best years in coping with these people. Those were the days of the United Party government, and his own Commissioner of Police, in dealing with the problem of subversion, admitted that it was under the United Party government that Communism was best combated in South Africa, and that was after his Government had been in power for some 13 years. When it comes to the fighting of Communism, this Government is prepared to play politics; it is prepared to use the fears of the people to try to win votes, but it has completely failed in the real fight against Communism, the real fight which is the eradication of those issues and circumstances which are the field in which Communism thrives. This Government, instead of eliminating the causes of Communism, is creating an atmosphere whereunder Communism can thrive. But all we have had from the hon. member who has just sat down was a long lecture on the equation of communists with liberals, which indicates the obsession which Nationalist leaders have with this question of Liberalism, an obsession which has gone so far that it has blinded them to all other aspects of proper government in this country. And so in their obsession they build up a feeling of frustration and fear which enables them to continue with the present policy of their Government. But not one member opposite has tried throughout this debate to deal with the charges against that policy which we on this side of the House have made.</p>

<p>The first speaker on the Government side, the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), stated that he had taken three years during which he supported the Nationalist Party and before he actually joined it, and he used that as his explanation of why the Nationalist Party had not made progress recently in the by-elections.</p>

<p>There are two issues I wish to bring to the attention of hon. members. The first is: How do those results compare, not with the previous results but with their forecasts of the day before the Weenen and Florida by-elections, when they were going round offering bets on majorities of 1,000 to 1, 200 in Florida. The same hon. member for Vereeniging was prepared to bet me on a majority of 1, 200. His colleague, the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) actually did take a bet with me on a majority of 900. But after the results came out I hope the hon. members who were so confident before the Florida election, will come to light with their confidence in the hard, material form in which it was couched. At Weenen the votes were actually counted the following day and on the day after the Weenen poll closed, when they knew the percentage of votes polled, their records in the Nationalist Party office indicated a majority of 360 more than it actually was. The point at issue in those elections is that for the first time the people of South Africa were voting against the Government without telling them so. Quietly in their own minds when they come into the ballot box they are making their cross for the United Party, and this Government is unaware of that change because they have not been told about it. Take Florida, which the hon. member for Vereeniging brags about, where the Nationalist Party register 300 more new voters than we have done. So already they lost 260 of their majority, because they should have gone up by 300. No, let them not talk to us about their piffling little gains at Florida.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with another aspect of the speech of the hon. member for Vereeniging. The hon. member stated that he had followed the Government&#x2019;s policy of total apartheid for three years before joining the Nationalist Party and that it had always been their policy to have these independent Bantustans. It is strange that 18 months before the hon. member joined the Nationalist Party, after he had left the United Party, after he had been expelled from the United Party, he said in a letter&#x2014;this is not a Press report&#x2014;to the <i>Argus&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Lawrence had said that on three major issues, the republican issue and total apartheid and on the Railway Budget, we came to the assistance of the Government. Exactly the opposite is true. On all three questions we strenuously and constructively opposed the Government.</block>

<p>They opposed the Government on these three issues, including total apartheid. But in a speech earlier in this debate that same hon. member said that it had always been the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>I stick to what I believe in, as the United Party has stuck to the traditional policy of South Africa, as we have stood by it consistently, despite losing elections. We have consistently stood for what is right for South Africa and the traditional policy of this country.</p>

<p><span class="col_219-220" refersTo="page_0124"/>But I want to come back to the issue of whether total apartheid is in fact and has always been the policy of the Government. I refer to total apartheid, territorial segregation leading to independent states, and I am not going back into history; I am dealing now with 1959. After the 1958 election, the Nationalist Party in an official party newsletter on 28 August 1959 issued the following statement of policy to its members. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In die reservate kry die Naturelle ook vir &#x2019;n aantal vasgestelde sake op verskillende maniere selfbestuur onder leiding van die Regering soos o.a. bepaal in die 1959-wet. Selfs die hoogste vorm van selfbestuur wat hulle kan geniet maak van die reservate nog geen afhanklike state nie, soos die Verenigde Party valselik beweer het. Hulle val nog onder die algemene gesag van die Regering, wat die belangrike algemene sake soos by. verdediging behartig.</block>

<p>That is after this Prime Minister became Prime Minister, after he became leader of the Nationalist Party. After he embarked on the road towards independent Bantu states, the Nationalist Party for political purposes said that our claims that these states would be independent were false statements. No, the Government cannot have it both ways. What is happening now is that people are starting to realize that this sort of propaganda which I have just quoted, this claim that it was only United Party propaganda which stated that there would be independent states is not correct. People are starting to realize that the United Party was right and that the propaganda pumped into them was wrong. I believe that both in this House and outside there are thousands upon thousands of people who have a deep and urgent desire within themselves to stand behind the United Party in its policy of moderation, people who are turning away from the policy of Bantustans and are turning back to the United Party. Only one thing so far is holding them by a tenuous thread from taking that step, and that is the attempt which we have seen again and again in this debate to sow suspicion in the minds of the people as to the United Party&#x2019;s reliability and as to its ability to be trusted with the future of White civilization in this country; and we are getting a little tired of that propaganda, Sir. We on this side of the House, we who throughout the history of South Africa, ourselves and our forefathers, have stood and fought solidly and consistently for the building up of the civilization we know here, we are the last people who are prepared to gamble with the future of our civilization or of the White man. I say here unequivocally and without any shadow of doubt that I believe that only the United Party can give to the Whites and to civilized people in South Africa any hope for a secure and stable future, because this Government and its policy is abrogating that leadership of the White man; it is abrogating responsibility over eight sections of South Africa, and in its running away from its responsibility it is gambling with the future of civilization itself. It is creating jumping-off points for those very dangers which the hon. member for Innesdale (Mr. J. A. Marais) and others expounded upon at such length. It is creating the jumping-off points from which those who wish to achieve what hon. members have been putting forward as the terrible dangers to South Africa can proceed. It is the United Party with its policy of moderation which can give to all the people of South Africa the stability and the security and the steady progress under which the White man can be secure, but at the same time under which the non-White can rise to higher and higher standards of civilization. Sir, we on this side of the House&#x2014;and the people of South Africa need have no doubt of that&#x2014;are not prepared at any time to gamble with the security of our standards or of our civilization. We are not prepared at any time to take steps which will endanger the future of the White man. That is why we are so opposed to this Bantustan policy which we believe is the greatest threat which we and the civilized standards of this country have ever had to face, because instead of dealing with these dangers all we have had from Government members in this debate has been the great bogy of fear which they are trying to create, and having created it, which they are trying to sustain, fear that the White man cannot maintain his leadership. It is that side of the House only which is afraid. It is that side of the House which was driven out of the Commonwealth by the Black states. It is they who are not prepared to show confidence in the White man&#x2019;s ability, and it is they who in their admission of their own lack of confidence in the White man are now seeking to run away from the problem of living together with the non-Whites in one country. That side of the House has admitted that White and non-White cannot live together in one country, and in that admission it is trying to run away from the problem by cutting off separate states. We on this side are not prepared to run away, nor have we lost confidence in our ability to solve the problems of this country justly and fairly.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, I wish to say that we in South Africa have one overriding advantage over all other African states which makes all this nonsense which has been talked in this House by Government members just the nonsense it really is, and that is the one overriding factor which they have ignored, that we in South Africa have a ratio of one White to four non-Whites. If you take the Coloureds as belonging to the Western group, that ratio becomes one in 2&#x00BD;. You cannot equate a country with a modern industrial structure, with an interwoven and interdependent economy, with countries like Ghana where the White man is in the ratio of one to 1,000, or Tanganyika where it is one to 400, or Nyasaland where it is one to 300, or Uganda where it is one to 590. We are not one to 400; we are one to four, and in addition there are the Coloureds, who are part of the West, blood of the blood <span class="col_221-222" refersTo="page_0125"/>of the White man, and with them included we become one to 2&#x00BD;. In addition to that, we have the economic strength of an interwoven, interdependent economy in which White and non-White work together and must continue to work together. Therefore it is arrant nonsense to suggest that because certain things have happened in Kenya and elsewhere we of the United Party will allow those things to happen here under our policy and our regime. I believe that the people of South Africa are turning away from this fear policy of the Government and will turn towards our policy because it offers the only course of moderation which can bring South Africa on a road to a future in which we do not live in fear and trembling and doubt as to what tomorrow will bring.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, at this stage of the debate my hon. friend the Leader of the Opposition has surely discovered already that his motion of no-confidence is a total failure when viewed in the light of the fact we have a Government which stands so firmly and which has the confidence of the people. His own members could of course make nothing of it, except for the soapbox effect created by the hon. member who has just sat down. It is really a tragedy that a session of Parliament should commence with the type of debate we have just had. I do not blame the Leader of the Opposition for that only. Perhaps he had no alternative. I am beginning to wonder whether the rules of the House should not provide for this not being the only way of initiating a broad general debate. There should be something else than just a motion of no-confidence couched in some form or other. In circumstances like the present, where a comparatively recent election proved that there was tremendous confidence placed in the Government by the electorate, and where there is so much prosperity in the country and so much proof of confidence both inside the country and outside it, it is obviously ridiculous to have to move a motion of no confidence. In that sense I am sorry for the Leader of the Opposition. I think he is a victim of the rules of the House, which I would like to see changed.</p>

<p>In the first place I wanted to say this. In the second place I want to say that I have watched the course of this debate. I did not participate in the debate immediately after the Leader of the Opposition spoke, and I think it should be clearly understood that no duty exists, either on the grounds of courtesy or for other reasons, which obliges the Leader of the Opposition and I to jump up promptly after one another when either of us has spoken. It would be ridiculous if we could not use our discretion as to how we wanted to participate in a debate. I do not expect it of him either. I do not regard it as courtesy on his part always to speak immediately after I have spoken, and I take it that he does not expect it of me either. Then we would in fact be like two puppets bound together by a string, or like two children on a seesaw; now he is up, and then again I! Nobody wants that.</p>

<p>It must also be clear that the reason why I waited until now must have been something else, and certainly something different from what the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) tried to guess. I had the feeling that I should for once wait to see what happens to a motion of no-confidence when this side of the House does not give life and meaning to it by announcing something which is of real interest and which would give substance to the debate. On former occasions it so happened&#x2014;I cannot really say that the matters concerned were of a coincidental nature&#x2014;that the Leader of the Opposition by his motion or speech opened the way for me to make announcements in regard to important matters which in the national interest soon had to be tackled. I did not seek a dramatic occasion for such announcements. In future it must be very clear to those who think that we will use a motion of no-confidence every year to make a particular announcement that they are completely wrong. I think it would be a mistake, because then a Government would not be making its announcements objectively and soberly when the time is ripe to do so, but it would be attempting to make merely a debating point of it. Under no circumstances will I lend myself to that. In the past it just so happened, ever since I became Prime Minister, that every year there was something of the greatest importance which had to be done in the national interest and which had to be announced early in the session, so that the motion of no-confidence practically opened the door for doing so. For the rest, the country can be assured that the Government will announce what steps it considers necessary when it considers that the time is ripe for it, whether that is in the beginning or in the middle or towards the end of a session, or even in the recess. When a matter has to be tackled, it will be announced and action will be taken.</p>

<p>After having listened to this debate so far I really seriously doubted whether it was worth while participating in it to-day, bit I realised that my silence would be misrepresented outside, as the hon. member for South Coast already did the other day. Therefore I thought that it was perhaps better for me to participate, even though it was only to say what I think of this debate and of certain other matters. I think that this debate represents the weakest attack imaginable. It is a tragedy that the United Party, which calls itself the alternative government, is not able to make use of such a debate to tell the country what it will do if it can take the place of the Government. If there is one reason why the electorate has confidence or no-confidence in a government it is not because of what it says but because of what it does; and if there is one reason why the voters want to put another government into power it is not because of the way it criticizes the existing Government but because it so clearly indicates something better which it wants to do that the voters elect it to do so.</p>

<p><span class="col_223-224" refersTo="page_0126"/>What have we had during this whole debate? There was only one positive statement as to what they want to do. That was the restatement of the race federation plan. But the race federation plan as an alternative course of action from which would flow the manner in which they would restore better relations with the outside world is something which was fully discussed at the time of the 1961 election and which was then unequivocally rejected by the people. That is the only thing which emerged from this debate as a positive suggestion. Under the circumstances it is very clear to me that the so-called alternative Government is in fact no alternative government at all. At best it is a group of people who take delight in depicting the acts of the Government in such a way that it is obstructed in implementing them. In other words, they are prepared to obstruct the progress of the people for the sake of their attempt to foster so many grievances in the minds of the people that they would want to get rid of the Government, and even to put an alternative government without any policy in its place. An Opposition which adopts such an attitude deserves no confidence and has never received any confidence in any country. As I have said, it was a great temptation to me to keep silent and thereby to emphasize how futile and insincere and unrealistic I regard this motion to be and. in so far as this Government is concerned, how innocuous it is.</p>

<p>There is another reason why I also felt that I should participate. It is that an accusation was levelled which closely affects my honour and that of the party of which I have the honour to be the leader, the accusation that we did not deal honestly with the electorate in the 1961 election. The allegation is that we withheld from them that the policy of apartheid and the policy of creating separate territories may lead to self-government to an ever increasing extent according to the potentialities of the Bantu, even though that should mean that their territories would eventually become independent states. It is alleged that we withheld from them that we were, or would be, taking steps in that direction. That is an accusation which affects my personal honour and that of my party. I therefore want to deal with the question whether there is any justification for such a gross accusation.</p>

<p>When one considers how from time to time we adopted standpoints in regard to our policy, various facts will be ascertained to prove that right throughout from the very beginning we clearly gave the public to understand what direction the road followed. The first example I wish to mention is how we all, myself included, even before 1948 as well as thereafter, used one particular example to state the difference between the policy of the United Party and that of the National Party. The United Party then formulated its policy totally differently, but it still went in the same direction as it does now. It has only progressed further now on that road we said it was following. The example we used was the following. We said that the country stood at the crossroads in regard to its colour policy; one can turn either to the left or to the right. We turned right and we said that the United Party had turned left. We said that there were various stations along that road. The road which had thus far been followed by South Africa was segregation, but it also contained elements of integration. These two roads have become intertwined during the course of time, but now the United Party swings away to develop the principle of integration to an ever increasing extent. The National Party swings to the right to make the principle of segregation its most important guiding principle for the future. We said that there were various stations on the left-hand road. The one is where one still, although one is an integrationist, wants to maintain certain principles of segregation, like certain aspects of social segregation, separate residential areas, etc., but abandons others which one formerly maintained. It was then emphasized that if a party once started to follow that road it would have to continue along it station for station. I said that the end of that road was not what the United Party thought it was, namely equality, but that the end of that road was Black domination. As against that, I said that we were on a different road. I admit that on this other road, particularly the beginning, there are still elements of integration inherited from the past, which we must gradually get rid of. At that stage there was still integration in the universities, to mention just one example. But then, we said, we would make progress step by step away from it, and the end of that road would be total political separation. It had nothing to do with territorial separation. We also said that although it was a long-term policy&#x2014;and it necessarily must be&#x2014;in that long-term policy there would be things which, even though we did not like them, were unavoidable. One of these things is that the influx of the Bantu to the cities, in spite of methods of control, would increase until about 1978. Thereafter we would be approaching the turning point as the result of the long-term policy of trying to obtain also further separation, human separation, and even territorial separation. Here, we said, are therefore the two final stages. These policies are perhaps not so clearly distinguishable from each other at this stage because we are still comparatively near the beginning of the separation, but our paths are quite divergent. I want to remind the House of this policy which I propounded throughout the country, together with others, because that is the first clear proof that we did not hesitate to say that total political separation, with the Bantu in control of his own area, was our aim. At this moment I am not talking only of what we said before the 1961 election; I am referring to what we said as early as 1948 and even before that, and on which we won the elections from then onwards. Not a single member of the public was ever misled, and if there were members of our party who are no longer members of it and who, as the United Party alleges, say <span class="col_225-226" refersTo="page_0127"/>that they thought we were bluffing, then they were dishonest in regard to our policy, but not us.</p>

<p>I want to mention a second fact to prove that our standpoint was unequivocal and very clear. I want to mention an example of which the United Party is well aware because they continually quoted it against me in an attempt to incite the public against us on precisely this same point. I also mention it because it happened during the time when Dr. Malan was still Prime Minister. The Opposition continued with those attacks even during the time when Adv. Strijdom was Prime Minister. In spite of that, those two Prime Ministers kept me in my post and therefore maintained this standpoint. Our party also from time to time referred in its brochures to these expressions which I am now going to quote and which hon. members tried to use against us so much even during the 1961 election. In these the public was told: This is our policy and we are not frightened by the propaganda made against us.</p>

<p>I am going to quote from one of the pamphlets published in 1959 when these attacks were also made on us and we defended ourselves by again putting into writing what we had in fact said. What I am now going to quote, and various other quotations, emanate from a publication of the National Party which it distributes continually. It is a comprehensive booklet, <i>Skietgoed,</i> in which are incorporated its monthly and other papers which we distribute to our party members. I deliberately quote from it to show that these are the things we told our party and the public.</p>

<p>I quote from the speech I made when addressing the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council before dissolving that Council because of its uselessness. On that occasion I used the words which are quoted in this pamphlet. That is the policy as it was logically and practically stated and applied. The passage which was quoted in the party pamphlet emanates from the <i>Transvaler.</i> I was at that time Minister of Native Affairs. The statement was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The only possible way out&#x201D; (after I had stated what the problem was) &#x201C;is the second alternative, namely that both, i.e. the White man and the Bantu, accept a development separate from each other. The present Government believes in the domination (baasskap) of the White man in his own area, but it equally believes in the domination (baasskap) of the Bantu in his area.&#x201D;</block>

<p>And this, as I have just made clear, was subscribed to by the party as a whole and by the Prime Ministers who supported me. Hon. members opposite quoted that against us. They said that I had said it. I never denied having said it; I always stood by it, and the members of the National Party also stood by it. Now I ask: How dare those hon. members then accuse us of having acted dishonourably towards the electorate in 1961, in view of the fact that we had stated this standpoint very clearly ever since 1950? I mention this as a second example.</p>

<p>Now I come to a third example. When the Bantu Authorities Act was being mooted, I discussed the matter on more than one occasion with the then Prime Minister, Dr. Malan. That Act was intended to implement the policy we had laid down, viz. gradually, step by step and in accordance with the ability of the people at that time to continue with forms of self-government. It was our task then to say what the step at that stage should be. We decided that the step which had to be taken then was one which was based on the experience of self-government the Bantu had at the time, on the knowledge the Bantu had of tribal government and tribal laws. That was the time when Dr. Malan used the expression which those hon. members are so keen on quoting, namely that in the circumstances of the time with which he was dealing then, no great progress could be made in regard to apartheid and that there could not be total apartheid. He very clearly let it be understood that we were dealing with a gradual process. On one of the occasions when I discussed this matter with Dr. Malan, he even put the question to me, when we were specifically discussing the Transkei: Why not have a parliament there? My reply was&#x2014; and peculiarly enough, that was in line with what the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) suddenly admitted the other day&#x2014;that we would have to lead the Bantu step by step to progress from the methods of self-government he knows, viz. the tribal system and the tribal customs, towards a parliamentary system by the gradual addition of Western elements like election of representatives as and when he becomes ripe for it as the result of the experience we allow him to gain. That is why we then introduced the Bantu Authorities Act. At the same time this proves that Dr. Malan already at that time was prepared for the further stage which came later, viz. in 1961 when the promise of a parliament was given This idea was therefore nothing new; it is one which was stated throughout, not only by one Prime Minister but by all of us. I want to take the case of Adv. Strijdom. In the first place I want to quote what he himself said in public in 1955. Later on the Party again brought it to the notice of the public in its publications, <i>inter alia</i> again in 1959. What he said was reported in the <i>Transvaler</i> of 26/8/1955. He spoke about the object of apartheid, the separation of the races, and then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the same time, in fairness to the non-Whites, the opportunity must be given to them also in their own areas and under the guardianship of the Whites &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. member should wait a little before saying, &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D; I That would be wise. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; under the guardianship of the Whites to develop according to their own nature <span class="col_227-228" refersTo="page_0128"/>and capabilities and there, as they develop, according to the system which best fits in with their nature and traditions, to govern themselves and to serve their community in all the various spheres of their national life.</block>

<p>He therefore said: &#x201C;and, as they develop, to govern themselves", At the same time I, as Minister of Native Affairs, had specific interviews with Adv. Strijdom as Prime Minister, not once, but at least three times, to give substance to what he had stated in general terms. On those occasions he and I&#x2014;I am stating this now and the people who want to believe me may do so, and if they do not want to believe me I cannot help it&#x2014;discussed in detail what the steps should be if the Bantu authority system was to develop to the next step of self-government. On those occasions we discussed the policy, which is to-day known as the Transkei policy, almost in the same detail with which I announced it in 1962. It was evolved and discussed jointly. To the best of my recollection&#x2014;and I am now perhaps saying it for the first time in this Parliament&#x2014;Adv. Strijdom was to have announced this policy for implementation in the beginning of 1959. Unfortunately he then died, and when I took over circumstances were such that I could not immediately carry on with what I knew were his intentions in this sphere. <i>Inter alia,</i> shortly thereafter I first had to tackle certain other big tasks which I first had to carry out, namely the establishment of the Republic of South Africa and the provision of a new constitution. Thereafter there was our withdrawal from the Commonwealth and everything which accompanied it. The result was that the implementation of the policy which had already been discussed and formulated and planned had to wait from 1959 to 1962. In 1961 already I could discuss the principles clearly, but I could only give details of the Constitution when the time was ripe for its application. This I was able to do in the beginning of 1962. Hon. members will realize that this proves that right throughout, consistently and unequivocally, the Party adopted a clear standpoint. My own speeches of 1959 prove that clearly, and not only, as has already been proved, my own speeches of 1959 which I will refer to in a moment, but also those I made before and after. These two speeches, namely the one on 27 January 1959 and also the one on 20 May 1959 both made before the 1961 elections, were therefore clearly brought to the notice of the public at the time of the election, the more so because the United Party continued to attack us on this very point. Up to that stage they said that our intentions were not honest. Then they did not say it was wrong; they then said: &#x201C;If only they would do it, it would be right, but they will not do it After we started they again said that it could not be implemented. Now that we have gone further in the process of implementing it, now that the Constitution is going to be put before Parliament, they suddenly come with other stories to catch White votes, namely that it will be wrong and bad. Now they are trying to incite the public against it from another angle. At that time we were immoral people; now we are people whom they allege to want to sell out the Whites. On 27 January 1959 I said in this House&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa is at the crossroads. It must be decided whether it will go in the direction of a multi-racial society with a common political life or whether it will bring about total separation in the political sphere.</block>

<p>A little later I continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I also see to it that I choose a course by which on the one hand I retain for the White man alone full rights of government in his area, but according to which I give to the Bantu, under our care as their guardians, a full opportunity in their own areas to put their feet on the road of development along which they can make progress in accordance with their capabilities. And if it so happens that in future they progress to a very high level, the people living at that time will have to consider how further to reorganize those relations.</block>

<p>I even indicated clearly one of the methods of co-operation which I thought could perhaps be implemented practically. I said that for purposes of comparison I took the British Commonwealth, the various constituents of which were not represented in the Mother Parliament, although inside that type of organization there are bonds, economic and other, by means of which there can be co-operation between states and people without ever having a mixed Parliament or Government. I further said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We want to build up a South Africa in which Bantu and Whites can live next to one another like good neighbours and not like people who are continually struggling for domination.</block>

<p>What is clearer than that? I further stated, on 20 May 1959&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would rather eventually have a smaller State in a South Africa which is White and which will control its own army, its own fleet, its own police and its own defence force, and which will stand as a bulwark for White civilization in the world; in other words, I would rather have a White nation here which can fight for its existence than a larger State which has already been handed over to Bantu domination.</block>

<p>I concluded that speech by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The standpoint of the National Party is one of striving for a permanently White South Africa, whatever dangers may threaten it, but which is prepared to develop areas in which Bantu control may increase under <span class="col_229-230" refersTo="page_0129"/>the guidance of the Whites as guardians, and with the understanding that even though this should lead to Bantu independence we will try by our statesmanship to ensure that this development takes place in such a spirit and in such a way that friendship will remain possible, but without the White man ever finding himself under any form of Bantu control, whether it be in a federation or in a union. That is the choice.</block>

<p>And of course, where we were busy working out either the Bantu Authorities constitution or the present Transkei Constitution (in the latter case also development still takes place under guardianship and it is certainly still true that defence, foreign affairs and other matters remain under the control of the Government of the Republic), we then described as false the propaganda of the United Party that that step (the Bantu Authorities Act of the Transkei Bill) would be one amounting to absolute independence. That is what the hon. member who spoke just before me accused us of and I say again that of course we described that false propaganda of the United Party as being false, and I still say so. Whatever we might say as to what the present constitutions may develop into, if the Bantu is capable of more development and does so develop, there can be no doubt that we are now dealing with a different stage of development. We shall have to guide our Bantu in their self-government of their own areas step by step so that eventually they will still be democratic nations and states and not nations or states which, as the result of the over-hastiness we saw in the Congo or in Ghana, will fall into chaos or become dictatorships.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that point later.</p>

<p>Then I want to bring closer to the year 1961 itself this accusation that we did not keep the public informed, that we were dishonest with the voters. I contend that throughout the whole of that election campaign the struggle concerned the question either of race federation, which we attacked, or separation, meaning total political separation, with the right of self-government for the Bantu in his own areas, even if it should lead to independent states later on. In an election pamphlet issued three days before the election, the following words appeared (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are the Whites going to retain their own Parliament, which will be further safeguarded by also developing their own political organizations for the other racial groups, or is one multi-racial Parliament going to be established with Whites and Coloureds as members to begin with, and later on Bantu and Indians as well? The National Party contemplates a White Parliament. The United Party, the National Union, the Progressive Party and the Liberal Party all aim at a multi-racial Parliament. That is the great contrast. Whether a White Government will continue to exist in South Africa will depend on how you choose sides.</block>

<p>It was also stated in that pamphlet that we were not being told by the United Party how long it thought the Bantu would be satisfied with White or non-Bantu representatives, or with separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls, instead of being placed on communal rolls like the Coloureds. Then there follows as the fifth point this exposition of United Party policy&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bantu in the reserves or Bantu homelands will be able to govern these areas separately as provinces.</block>

<p>That was how the United Party stated their policy at that time. The Bantu would therefore be able to govern themselves, but to-day we hear a different story from the Leader of the Opposition. Finally it is stated in this pamphlet&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let every racial group govern its own people. So too the White man will govern his own country and retain his own government.</block>

<p>There was no doubt whatsoever as to the attitude of the National Party: The White man will govern his country and the Bantu will govern his people, his areas. Thereafter, on the day of the election, the National Party came forward with a clarion call, a clarion call which went out from me personally; the previous one was a document issued on behalf of the Party. This was a clarion call which went out from me personally and in which the following was stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You want to safeguard your future. That can only happen if you vote for the National Party. None of the other parties has a colour policy which gives the White man the certainty that he will retain full control over the affairs of his country. None of the other parties offers such a future of their own to the various non-White national groups in which they can control their own destinies without competition. In other words, it is only the National Party that can justifiably say that it is heading for racial peace. It is only the National Party&#x2019;s policy that will eventually lead to an absence of racial discrimination because it is only when the races are separated and live like neighbours that discrimination will be able to disappear.</block>

<p>Then it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Moreover, it is only the National Party&#x2019;s policy which gives the certainty that it will be possible for national unity to come into being, national unity as the term has always been understood and that is that the Whites of the two language groups will stand together. The Opposition parties are now suddenly all beginning to strive for a new <span class="col_231-232" refersTo="page_0130"/>&#x201C; national unity&#x201D;, namely unity between all inhabitants of this country, White, Coloured and Black.</block>

<block name="quote">This so-called multi-racial nation with one multi-racial Parliament, can, however, never become a unit. Such divergent elements would try to exterminate each other. True unity in a racial group can only develop amongst its own people, separated from the others. The only national unity for the Whites is unity amongst the Whites.</block>

<p>There we stated perfectly clearly what policy we wished to follow&#x2014;throughout our history right up to the election of 1961. I decry the fact that the United Party, even through its Leader, takes it upon itself to make the accusation against us that in 1961 we brought the electorate under a wrong impression and that then suddenly, on 27 January 1962 we allegedly announced a brand-new policy. It was no new policy; the details of it were not even unknown to the two preceding Prime Ministers. It was the policy which this party had constantly followed and worked out.</p>

<p>Having said that I hope that we will have an end to this type of accusation. I just want to add that all that happened in 1962 was that details were then also given as to what a constitution for the Transkei would have to embrace. In that constitution we were going to do what had been decided upon in principle at the election of 1961. What the electorate did do also in 1961 was to express lack of confidence in the race federation policy, and yet confidence in that policy is asked for in this motion! It was rejected by the electorate and the electorate expressed its lack of confidence in it with an increased majority. What the electorate did in 1961 was to give a mandate to this side of the House to proceed with its policy to the next step of political separation of the races. We are now acting accordingly, and that is why, in the speech of 27 January 1962 I gave the further details as to what the next step was going to involve.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made a second allegation&#x2014;an accusation really&#x2014;and that is that in this debate we have not been able to controvert the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Opposition. Good heavens, not only did hon. members who spoke on this side effectively deal with various arguments of his but they effectively exposed the nebulousness, the unreliability, of what is allegedly the positive element in the United Party&#x2019;s race federation policy, to which I referred a moment ago. Questions which were put to them disclosed either that they did not know or that they did not dare to say how their policy would be implemented&#x2014;this policy which is supposedly going to give the White man protection. Hon. members on this side replied very effectively to the Opposition. But that is not all: I contend that in that speech of his, except for the method of approach and the wording, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition produced practically nothing that was new, nothing that we have not already discussed. In other words, there was in point of fact no case that had to be met. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition simply ignored all the clear replies given in the past, replies that were given to problems that he had raised. He raised those same problems here as though they were brand-new ideas that he wanted to put before the electorate. In order to emphasize that point of mine I want to read out the various questions to which I replied in my speech of 24 January last. Hon. members will realize at once, after having heard just a few of these questions, that the allegations which he made in this debate were dealt with fully and effectively at that time. The first point with which I dealt was this: He (the Leader of the Opposition) submitted that because of the Government&#x2019;s policy to grant independence to the Bantu homelands, the Republic of South Africa was being fragmented. In other words, I dealt amply last year with his attack on the fragmentation of South Africa. Do hon. members opposite want me to take an hour and a half once again to reply to the same point? The second question was whether these independent Bantu areas would not be a danger to the Republic of South Africa; whether they would not become jumping-off places for the communists? I dealt very thoroughly with that question last year therefore. A further question was whether the Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of Bantu homelands would not entail terrible financial implications. In other words, it was the same accusation, in a different form, with which he has now come forward and which he also made in the election with regard to the economic retrogression (&#x201C;planned poverty &#x201D;) of this country, but together with question No. 5 it refers to the same matter. The fourth question last year was: Is the United Party&#x2019;s accusation true that the policy followed by the Nationalist Government has led this country towards isolation, as the result of its withdrawal from the Commonwealth, and is that not the reason also why South Africa is facing threats from abroad? Hon. members will recall that he once again raised this point in the course of his speech. But I dealt with it at length and fully last year. The fifth question was this: Will the economic consequences of the policy of separation not be detrimental to this country? The sixth concerned the United Party&#x2019;s submission that it was the Government&#x2019;s policy to suppress the Bantu as far as human rights and the franchise were concerned and that apartheid meant everlasting domination. I do not think that he dealt with this point on this occasion. I take it he was satisfied that that is not the case. The seventh point was that the Government was doing nothing positive for the non-Whites except in so far as housing was concerned. That too is a matter which he has not discussed on this occasion because, after all. his tactics have changed. to-day the accusation is that we are doing too much for the Whites! Actually this accusation comes more from the members on his side. He had to avoid this point carefully therefore. The next point is <span class="col_233-234" refersTo="page_0131"/>that last year the Leader of the Opposition stated that the numbers of Bantu migrating to the White cities was still increasing. I therefore dealt also at that time with this whole problem of increasing numbers. His next question was whether this country was not going to experience difficulties because of the fact that the Bantu have not yet acquired sufficient administrative experience for self-government. He then asked whether we were not forgetting the Bantu within the White area in the Republic. I think I have mentioned enough examples to show that the points made by him in this debate were replied to on that occasion. As far as the question of the Protectorates is concerned, I dealt with that question fully on another occasion. I explained why we believed that the incorporation of the Protectorates was no longer practical politics and why it was no longer of any value to South Africa. I also dealt with the dangers which would arise in connection with the Bantu homelands policy but I contrasted that with the dangers which would arise as a result of the policy of race federation, or as the result of any form of Progressive Party or Liberal Party policy. In point of fact, all the points that were made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition in this debate were dealt with except for the few new approaches which, as I said, I propose to deal with now.</p>

<p>I want to say candidly that even if hon. members opposite say that I am not replying to his speech&#x2014;because I am not going to repeat my arguments&#x2014;I do not propose to do so, but I want to refer the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to Hansard and recommend to him that he should enrich his knowledge with regard to our attitude by once again reading that speech of mine.</p>

<p>There were a few other points in connection with which he had something new to say and to which I think I can refer. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition alleged that the Government was not taking into account the fact that UNO would continue to survive as long as that was the desire of the U.S.A. One asks oneself how long it will continue to be the desire of the U.S.A. that UNO should continue to exist if the U.S.A. has to pour so much money into it and then find that more and more the majority of the newly created states thwart her wishes when the matter is put to the vote. How long will it continue to be her desire to keep UNO going when she can no longer use UNO as an instrument in connection with her own policy and if it does not bring peace in the interests of the world at large, which she is so anxious to serve in this way? If on the contrary it does just the opposite, will the U.S.A. then be prepared to continue to support UNO? I do not know, nor does the U.S.A. know. But that is not really the most important point. What is of great importance is this: What does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition mean when he puts a question of this kind? Does he mean that we must take into account the possibility that UNO will still continue to exist for a long time, dominated by the wishes of the U.S.A., so much so that we should be prepared to sacrifice the interests of South Africa to the consequences of the existence of such a body and the consequences of its ideas? Is the inference that he draws that we should abandon our policy of White self-preservation? He says that we should take world trends into account and seek partners; that we as a small state must form alliances. Of course I believe that we should have friends; that wherever possible one should have partners; that wherever possible one should form alliances. But why is it necessary for a state to have these things? In the national interest and in the interests of the nation&#x2019;s survival. What is the use of a friend, what is the use of an alliance, what is the use of a partner if the price that we have to pay is the downfall of White government in South Africa, a change-over to a multi-racial state and eventual non-White domination? The downfall of one&#x2019;s nation, the sacrifice of White government in South Africa, is a price which cannot be paid for friends and for partners.</p>

<p>I should like to put this question to the hon. Leader of the Opposition. I know he is going to reply later on and in the meantime he can think this over: Is he prepared to pay that price? But there is one thing which the Leader of the Opposition must understand perfectly clearly. He labours under an illusion&#x2014;I would almost go so far as to say that he has an idle hope and a self-righteous faith &#x2014;if he believes that the policy of race federation will always be accompanied by White rule and that the U.S.A. or world opinion will be satisfied with that. It is in this sense that he wants his policy to be understood by the electorate of South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is what he says, but he wants people to interpret it as meaning &#x201C;for all time to come &#x201D;. He wants them to interpret &#x201C;foreseeable future&#x201D; as meaning &#x201C;for all time to come &#x201D;. He uses the word &#x201C;foreseeable&#x201D; to be on the safe side so as to have a loophole, but he wants the electorate to interpret it as meaning permanent White rule. If he wants to give me his reply now and say that he does not wish to suggest that his policy is not intended to keep the Whites in power permanently, then the electorate of South Africa will believe him even less than they believe him at the moment. That is why I say that he wants to bring the electorate under the impression that his policy aims at White supremacy &#x201C;for all time to come &#x201D;. Would the electorate of the Republic want to have any alliance if it means sacrificing White supremacy? Our attitude is &#x201C;no ". As a small nation we value the continuation of the White man&#x2019;s rule at least in what is his legitimate share of South Africa. We value the survival of our White nation as we have it to-day in our Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="col_235-236" refersTo="page_0132"/>That is what we value. We are not going to barter away any part of our policy so as to gain a so-called friend who, however, wants to push us in an opposite direction. And, as I put it a moment ago, his policy will not succeed either in acquiring friends who would not wish to do so. He must decide for himself whether he wants to pay the price of White capitulation. I am not prepared to pay the price of such concessions; it would plunge our country and our nation into misery.</p>

<p>I want to add that it is not right either to say that we have no friends, that we have no partners, that we do not even have alliances. Friendships, alliances, co-operation with partners, are not limited to co-operation in respect of our colour policy. Outside the sphere of colour policy, that is to say, in the sphere of economic life, in the scientific sphere, including space research, and in the sphere of international common interests apart from those which are affected by colour relationships, we have many friends and very harmonious relationships. There we are able to meet on common ground, to consult each other and to assist each other. Moreover, this assistance is not one-sided; it is not only given to us by the bigger states; South Africa also gives assistance to others, including the bigger states of the world. I contend therefore that we do try to form and that we do succeed in forming friendships and through this friendship in those other spheres a better understanding may develop in due course of events in South Africa. Indeed I believe that that better understanding is already developing. The idea may even develop that our policy, after all, is of importance and is the best not only for South Africa, but also for the world, particularly the White world. Apart from that, if hon. members opposite are so concerned about friendships, why are they so inclined to place obstacles in our way when we try to develop friendships? Let me mention just one example. I refer to the case of Japan. Who was it in this country who tried to ridicule the sale of South Africa&#x2019;s pig-iron (and the Government&#x2019;s policy) for Japan&#x2019;s friendship. We abandoned no part of our policy in our endeavour to establish harmonious relationships with Japan. After all, if in the economic sphere and in other spheres we are able to obtain harmonious relationships with one Asiatic country&#x2014;and later on with others&#x2014; with the retention of our policy as a domestic affair of our own, that is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition desires! Is that not the policy too that we should follow in the case of Africa nations? Why does he ridicule such efforts, which involve no abandonment of our principles, by saying that this Government will not get their co-operation? I know that we cannot get it now. But must we because of that behave like an immature state and cease to be ready to co-operate with them when those states change their minds and become amenable to co-operation, without interfering with another country&#x2019;s domestic affairs? Why do hon. members opposite not rather praise our efforts when we establish good links with countries like Japan, without abandoning our policy and without any danger to White civilization; or when we seek to do the same thing in the case of Africa nations with the same reservations? Why do they belittle our efforts when we enter into links with the Western nations to a greater extent than those existing already, but also with those reservations which are such that we do not destroy ourselves? Is the Leader of the Opposition going to continue with his ridicule and allow his followers to do so? This sort of equivocal attitude is the tragedy of the situation in which South Africa finds herself. And then the Leader of the Opposition dares to come along with reproaches. When the Opposition are really able to do something practical for their country by standing together with the Government, then they do not do so; then they make things difficult for the Government.</p>

<p>It was also stated that the Government did not realize that many of its internal actions were not understandable to the Western world. The Leader of the Opposition mentioned the Church clause as an example. Again he raked this up from the struggle of the past in order to strengthen suspicion. I accept that it is difficult for the outside world to understand certain steps which South Africa has to take from time to time in order to maintain order and peace here. People overseas do not live under the circumstances under which we live here; they do not have the problems with which we have to contend. I can understand it therefore. I contend, however, that but for the statements made by the Opposition and by the Press and by the liberals in South Africa, there would have been a much better understanding overseas of many of these matters. In particular I want to take the so-called Church clause. What I am saying now is old news but I am compelled to repeat it. The Church clause was a small extension of the ordinary segregation clause which had existed previously, an extension which nevertheless had to be framed in detail in many words in an attempt to obviate misunderstanding. In principle, however, it was just a limited extension of a provision which was already contained in the Urban Areas Act as we had it under General Hertzog and as it was redrafted in 1945 under General Smuts. These restrictions were placed on the Bantu in that Act in connection with various activities but at that time we did not have the problem which began to arise after 1948, namely this endeavour on the part of the agitators of this new period, incited by Whites, to break the segregation policy by suddenly establishing multi-racial clubs and by bringing the Bantu to White churches in White residential areas where they had never been and really had no desire to be. They were sometimes enticed to come; at other times they went there with great ado even though it was not to attend the service but simply to make a noise outside or to make things unpleasant for the churchgoers along the road. All that the so-called Church clause, that is to say, the addition <span class="col_237-238" refersTo="page_0133"/>to the segregation clause did, was to stipulate that where, as in the other spheres for which provision was already made in the clause, this would lead to disturbances and unpleasantness in the opinion of the local authority and the State, steps could be taken against it. The Church clause therefore was obviously designed to make it possible for the community to take steps against any interference with the orderly conduct of divine services. This is supposed to be the terrible deed which is not understood in the outside world! Why is it not understood? The United Party is the guilty party. It was the United Party members who started these misrepresentations; they began by even creating the impression abroad that there was a brutal suppression of religion itself. They should read again what they said in this Parliament at that time and they will realize that it is understandable that there were often misunderstandings in this regard in the outside world. That misunderstanding exists because the germ was sown in this country, and to a large extent it was sown by the United Party even in this Parliament. The same applies to many of these matters in regard to which there is misunderstanding.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also stated that we had learned nothing from the Metropolitan states in Africa, particularly in this respect that when a process of emancipation is started, as in the Transkei for example, the Government is unable to control the timetable of the process of emancipation and retain the friendship of the Bantu. We are supposed not to have learnt that lesson! My contention is that we have learned from the experiences in Africa and that we are trying to obviate all the possible evils by acting differently. I am not so sure that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has learned it. What happened in this Africa of ours was without any doubt that the Metropolitan countries which had territories here thought that after World War II they could comply with the demands made upon them by giving a semblance of government to the non-Whites to a limited extent but with the retention ultimately of White government. They realized, just as we all do, that the White man&#x2019;s ability to govern and his skill were of the utmost importance to the Black man in Africa. They did not realize, however, that thereafter the pressure for Black government in those countries would become stronger and stronger. They did not realize that this process which they had set in motion&#x2014;this process of giving limited rights, moderate rights to some, to govern together with Whites&#x2014;would lead to more demands by them and more demands by their unprivileged countrymen until it eventually led to Black independence and sole control. The lesson which Africa has taught us is that where the Metropolitan states tried a policy of appeasement by yielding to a certain pressure&#x2014;with partnership government, with sham friendship, with some measure of control here and there, or with a measure of control to only a few persons&#x2014;it had to lead to Black rule and Black independence. That is the lesson of Africa. In the meantime they also thought that they could go on with the then existing measure of segregation. They did yield too in respect of certain segregation measures and in the long run in respect of most of them, but it was never enough. We have this phenomenon therefore that it was this application of a policy similar to that of the United Party which proved a failure. Nevertheless the United Party refuses to admit that it is the United Party which has not learned the lesson of Africa. It does not admit or realize that to her they follow the same policy, the policy of limited joint control, of propagating the Bantu&#x2019;s right to govern jointly in one multi-racial state, it will mean, just as it did elsewhere in Africa, that those people will make greater and greater demands. That time-table in point of fact is one which he will not be able to control, and that is why his &#x201C;foreseeable future&#x201D; is of no significance. It is this time-table of &#x201C;the foreseeable future&#x201D; which went awry in Africa&#x2014; not a time-table with regard to our policy of separate development, because that is something entirely different, namely the road of Africa, an acceptance of people&#x2019;s right to govern themselves in their own areas.</p>

<p>I also want to say to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the example of Rhodesia is very important indeed. The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) has suggested that the example of Rhodesia cannot be quoted because basically the situation in the Federation and in Nyasaland is allegedly entirely different from the situation here. I should like to know what he means by &#x201C;different &#x201D;? Does he mean that it is different, but like Kenya, like Tanganyika? In other words, does he, a front-bencher of the United Party, mean that Rhodesia must become Black? If he does not mean that, what does he mean by &#x201C;different &#x201D;?</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Oh yes, the numbers are different, but what must the result be of that difference in numbers? What does he wish me to conclude from that? If we must ignore the example of what happened in Rhodesia, namely, that where because of the difference in the numbers, the policy of the United Party is applied, in principle that numerical ratio leads to Black domination, if we must not come to that conclusion what must we conclude from his statement? There is nothing else. The member for Germiston (District) would like us to believe this: We, the United Party in South Africa will maintain White domination because of our numbers, one to four, under our federation policy and in spite of our willingness to take the non-Whites as partners in the management of the country. But then he must surely mean, and I must say it here, that he does not believe that Rhodesia, with the same policy, will be able to maintain itself because the number of Whites there is smaller in relation. His argument <span class="col_239-240" refersTo="page_0134"/>cannot mean anything else. Then I say, if that is the case that he bases his argument that the United Party policy will succeed here, although not there, particularly as far as the example of Southern Rhodesia is concerned, on the smaller difference between the number of Whites and Blacks here, he is building on sand. In both partnerships the Blacks remain the greater majority. The United Party&#x2019;s policy, namely of taking the non-Whites with them in a common government in one form or another, no matter what the qualifications are, is fatal. The lesson of Africa is this: The Whites cannot maintain themselves in that way.</p>

<p>I want to say this to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: He unjustifiably alleges that we did not learn anything from what has happened in Africa in regard to the time table which you would like to determine or the friendship which you would like to retain. As I said at an earlier stage we admit that there are problems and difficulties. But not only did he himself not learn the lesson in regard to the time table and friendship but he also did not learn that with United Party policy the citizens in the Republic will not even retain control over their own destiny. We with our policy will at least retain control over the destiny of the Whites in the Republic although we will not be able to control the time table of the Transkei, something which I am not even as yet prepared to concede, but which I do accept as a possibility. But we will at least have control over our own destiny.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went further and said that Africa had proved that White control was necessary but that I wanted to remove White control from the Transkei. It is true that you must have the White man to lead the Black man further. We shall therefore continue to do that in the Transkei; we are still at a stage of development where it is very clear that we must do so, although not in the way in which he wishes it, namely, that in the industrial field we should allow White initiative to operate in such a way that as in other parts of Africa, the White man will eventually be regarded as exploiters in that area. Even in the economic field I pointed out how the Whites will indeed be able to take the lead in regard to management and financing without creating that impression and danger. I have explained that very clearly in the past; I am not going to repeat it.</p>

<p>In this connection another argument must be raised with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. What does he mean with &#x201C;control&#x201D; when he says the United Party must retain &#x201C;control&#x201D;? The United Party wants to &#x201C;retain control over the entire South Africa&#x201D;; the United Party wants &#x201C;to incorporate the protectorates so as to get control over them as well &#x201D;. He used the word &#x201C;control &#x201D;. What does he honestly mean the White man must do there under United Party policy? The word &#x201C;control&#x201D; is a word which means nothing else than &#x201C;White supremacy&#x201D; or &#x201C;White domination &#x201D;. &#x201C;Control&#x201D; cannot have any other meaning than domination, supremacy. You can call it what you like. &#x201C;Control&#x201D; is domition, domination is supremacy, &#x201C;supremacy&#x201D; is domination, &#x201C;supremacy&#x201D; is domination. You cannot get away from that, Sir. &#x201C;Control&#x201D; means that the White man will remain the real controller. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition sometimes also uses the word &#x201C;leadership&#x201D; and &#x201C;guidance</p>

<p>A leader however, only remains the leader as long as the majority of his supporters want him to. You can only give &#x201C;guidance&#x201D; as long as the people are prepared to follow you as guide. When therefore, the United Party talks about offering White leadership&#x2014; &#x201C;guidance&#x201D; to South Africa as long as the majority of the multi-racial citizens, the Bantu in South Africa as well therefore, accept it, South Africa must realize that it will not be &#x201C;control &#x201D;. Then the United Party dare not represent to the country that they are indeed propagating White leadership in the form of White supremacy.</p>

<p>I want to turn to the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) in this connection. He is a person for whom I feel very sorry, and I am not saying that mockingly. In my opinion he is a pathetic figure. The reason why he is a pathetic figure has my deepest sympathy. The inhabitants of Natal are rightly deeply worried, and have always been worried, as to what will happen to the White people there. This is a province which I have on previous occasions, with very good intentions, described as a white sheet of paper on which, as it were, a black hand had pressed, with the result that its map is characterized by Black areas with White areas in between. That is how it has developed in the course of our history. It is no good saying that the Whites in that area are to-day still the master of or controllers over those Black areas. To begin with that is the position but will it remain like that? I have just explained how under United Party policy the White man will not even rule South Africa, therefore, not even the White areas in Natal and even less the Black areas in Natal. But Natal has landed in the unenviable position that in addition it has a great number of Indians. In other words, according to the United Party policy Natal should be very conscious of the fact that it is not only threatened by potential Bantu domination, either over this area or over that area, but in addition it is faced with the mighty problem of the number of Indians. The hon. member for Germiston (District) said that the numbers in Rhodesia were the deciding factor. Why not in Natal as well under the United Party&#x2019;s partnership policy? The result is that the hon. member for South Coast, who is fond of his Province of Natal, who would like the Whites there not only to be the leaders but the rulers, is in this unfortunate dilemma that as a result of political history and his other prejudices, he is fastened to a wrong policy which he must defend and justify. It has grown with him&#x2014;he is co-responsible for it&#x2014;but it is a <span class="col_241-242" refersTo="page_0135"/>policy which is the most dangerous to Natal of all the provinces. He cannot. He must try to retain the confidence of his public in Natal by continuing to assure them that his policy will lead to White domination, White supremacy and that our policy will not bring that about. He does that by grasping at a straw here and by attacking there. He even clashes with his party on the question of the acquisition of land, for example, because the land which will still have to be acquired is that land which his party decided on in 1936. The only difference which he can grasp at is to say: &#x201C;Yes, but to-day the Whites are controlling it and the National Party wants to give it to the Bantu to control.&#x201D; Everybody knows, however, that just as in the case of Basutoland, just as in the case of the Transkei, Zululand was a purely Native area in the past and that it was the intention of generations of Whites that it should remain a Native area. It is also realized that what will be added to Zululand will become Native area. He knows as well as I do that it is fiction to say that the Whites will remain in control forever&#x2014; no matter under what policy&#x2014;and that that fiction cannot be maintained. In order to save White Natal for the Whites it will be necessary, therefore, to separate White and Black politically at least. In that case the Whites will at least retain their foothold in those areas which they have to-day and in which they are active.</p>

<p>The boundaries will be as they will be determined but it is clear that they will only be limited according to the will and the power of the White man in South Africa and according to the right which he knows he has to his own land.</p>

<p>I still want to mention a few other matters which were touched upon by the hon. member for South Coast, really to illustrate the trend of thought amongst people, and I want to ask the question whether that trend of thought can instil confidence in the electorate. The hon. member is confused. He has to be, because his most deep-seated belief, his most fervent desires, clash with the policy which he feels compelled to support. He continually reproaches us&#x2014;that is of minor importance &#x2014;and says that the people do not know what the Constitution will be. The Transkei Constitution has, however, been made known and it contains all the details which he has asked for. It will also now come before Parliament. Why does he struggle with reproaches which have no substance? He says further that White South Africa will have to defend the whole Republic, including the area of the Transkei. On the one hand he tells us what the dangers are of separate areas like the Transkei and that it can offer landing ground to foreign powers because of its long coast line; on the other hand he reproaches us for retaining the responsibility of defending the entire Republic, including those areas and for retaining the Defence Force in our hands alone. In other words, on the one hand he wants to guard against a danger which does indeed exist (although of course a greater danger will arise if the country gets a multi-racial or Black Government, because in that case the whole country and its Defence Force will fall into other hands), but when we take steps against this danger, he holds that against us as well! That is the trend of thought of people whose heart and party-independence clash.</p>

<p>The same happens where the object of your policy is to accept the Zulus as people with their own human dignity and with their own desire to see it embodied in their own institutions. There we find on the one hand that the hon. member also reveals a feeling for the Zulus and that he prides himself on the fact that he is their representative, as well as the fact that some of them come to him for advice. A minute later, however, the hon. member says: You cannot allow the Zulus to govern themselves because they are as barbarous as they were in 1802. How must we understand these contradictions, this belief of his in the Zulus on the one hand and those ideas against them on the other hand? I can understand that as little as I can understand the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when he argues on the one hand that the Bantu cannot govern themselves, not even as far as the limited powers which they get with the additional assistance of the Whites at this stage, is concerned, and when he says on the other hand that we should develop a middle class and that he wants to take them in as partners. He wants them to have representation although to begin with it will be by means of Whites in this Parliament. He wants them to be able to climb higher and higher. On the one hand he says those people are so good, on the other hand he says those people are so bad! How must you understand people who argue in that confused manner? I repeat that that is the result of their colossal confusion and really of a deep-seated belief that they with their policy will not be able to retain White control.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with what seems to me the crucial point in respect of which this nation must say whether they have confidence in us or in the Opposition, whether they have confidence in the National Party or in the United Party.</p>

<p>I maintain that judgment was given in 1961. Reduced to its simplest form the problem is nothing else than this: We want to keep South Africa White. The United Party also say they want to keep South Africa White. &#x201C;Keeping it White&#x201D; can only mean one thing namely White domination, not &#x201C;leadership&#x201D;, not &#x201C;guidance&#x201D;, but &#x201C;control&#x201D;, &#x201C;supremacy &#x201D;. If we are agreed that it is the desire of the people that the White man should be able to continue to protect himself by retaining White domination, one must ask oneself how that can be done. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says it can be done through a race federation, and we say that it can be achieved by separate development.</p>

<p>Territorial separation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Separate development together with territorial separation. Whether segregated populations are added to it one day or not is not the question at the moment. Let us look at these two directions once more and see what their simplest consequences are. Then the question must be put: Which one can serve that purpose? Let us first take race federation. In the first place it means a political federation of races, and therefore it includes the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians, the various Bantu groups (both those who are in what we call the White areas and those in the Bantu areas). Everybody must have a share in the government of the country. Those non-Whites must be given a share in the government of the country. In the first place they must have it by being represented in Parliament, either by Whites in the beginning and later by non-Whites, or immediately by members of their own race. The second, of course, inevitably follows on the first if indirect representation is granted as a start. We must therefore surely presuppose that according to this course at some time or other Blacks, Coloureds, Indians, will sit in this Parliament together with the Whites. Let us look at the number of Blacks. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition admittedly says that in the beginning there will be only a few representatives for the Bantu. But for how long will he be able to limit it to a few? And can it in fact be only a few non-Whites?</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition also says that there must be a few representatives of the one group, viz. the Coloureds, and a few for the second group, viz. the urban Bantu, and a few for the third group, viz. the Indians, after negotiation. In addition, he also accepted that the Transkei and the other Bantu areas would be governed as Black provinces. (Peculiarly enough, according to him, the Bantu will be able to govern a Black province but are not able to handle the proposed stage of self-government in the Transkei! That is even more than peculiar, but I mention it just in passing.) Therefore there will be such Black provinces and his race federation plan must also include them in the joint government of the joint nation&#x2019;s joint country. That means that there will be another few non-Whites in the federal parliament. And not only that. The Leader of the Opposition further wants the High Commission Territories to be incorporated, and therefore they must also be represented here. In other words, there cannot be only a few representatives if we include them all! In addition, one has the example of certain African states and of Rhodesia, and then the question arises: When once matters have progressed so far that there is Black representation in this Parliament, can it be limited to small numbers or will those numbers infinitely multiplied, get out of hand? In addition, when once the Republic takes the form of an integrated state, it must be accepted that that State will not be integrated only in the political sphere. The Opposition does not want that only. It wants to have mixed universities in that State&#x2014;that is part of the whole plan; it wants job reservation to be abolished in the economic sphere, etc. etc. The Bantu and all other workers must be able to rise to any level&#x2014;sometimes the Whites will be on top and the Blacks at the bottom, and sometimes the Blacks will be on top and the Whites at the bottom. We must all form one intermingled nation. That is part of the process of integration. The Bantu must be able to enter any profession in any place and reach any level. If that is so, the non-Whites must also be able to take part in a single social life. Then we cannot continue to have residential segregation unrestrictedly. In other words, the Leader of the Opposition&#x2019;s policy seeks to bring about integration in all spheres. Surely he cannot bring together people of all races in this Parliament without their hoping at some time to get into the Cabinet; or can he have them there as equals without accepting them in the public service. If he abandons job reservation in the factories, surely he can not introduce it in the public service. The non-White must be able to climb to any post. Not only that, but the United Party will have to be consistent and say: Not only in the Government of the country, not only in the public service, not only in the whole of our social life and economic life, but non-Whites will also be allowed to be members of our defence force and rise to any post. Can he include them in his Cabinet and accept them everywhere without welcoming them in his army also?</p>

<p>Now the voters of South Africa must ask themselves: Will White government and White control survive along that road? Can it? The other choice is the opposite policy where we say that there will be no mixed society or a mixed nation whose people will increasingly have to mix with one another in all these various spheres. If there is integration, nobody can give the assurance that a numerical minority will retain its domination permanently. What must a nation do then? It can do one thing only, and that is to separate the races, to separate them politically, based on territorial segregation. Give each racial group the area which is its own historically and let each of them then obtain control, if they desire it and can handle it, in that area which historically is its own. Whilst the fullest rights are given to each racial group, let us then try gradually to guide those who are inexperienced and to bring them so far that when they come to full sovereignty they will be used to the White state and to its usefulness and will be well disposed towards it. It can work out that way because the White man and his State have not stood in their way and has guided them to achieve independence and economic progress. Then there is hope for the non-White and for the White man. I do not want to go further into the details of the policy of separation and its benefits. I am just stating clearly that the simple choice lies between the abovementioned policies when the public has to decide whether it <span class="col_245-246" refersTo="page_0137"/>has no confidence in the policy of the one party or that of the other. Which of these two plans has the best chance to ensure the continued existence of the White nation and to give happiness to both sections of the population?</p>

<p>I need not say more about this. There can be no doubt about it, and the decision was given in the 1961 elections. In fact, hon. members opposite know how many more people than those who voted for us really believe that their welfare and that of their state and their children lies in our policy.</p>

<p>The final matter one has to consider when it comes to a question of confidence or no confidence is in regard to plans or actions of the parties. It is of little use knowing how people talk; a good speaker can always make a temporary impression on an audience. People should therefore have regard to what the parties do or intend doing. One must study the history of the party which is not in power and take note of what its leaders did when they had the opportunity. If the history of the United Party is considered, one remembers the widespread dissatisfaction of 1948 when the United Party was ousted from power to its own great surprise. The older voters remember the misery and the unfavourable circumstances in almost every sphere which were inherited by the new Government. The electorate then got rid of a government which had proved to be a failure, and the people will think twice before putting such a government into power again, particularly in the light of the history from 1948 until to-day. Let us briefly devote some attention to what the previous Government did in the various spheres.</p>

<p>If one looks at the development of South Africa since the National Party came into power in 1948, one sees that in the sphere of race relations there has been a tremendous improvement. When we came into power die United Party was prepared to allow the Bantu to flow into the cities without applying any control, and it allowed them to live in the foulest squatter camps.</p>

<p>Everywhere; right throughout the country. The whole of South Africa was one sink of misery insofar as the housing of the Bantu was concerned. There were bad housing conditions in every town and city, without exception, and it was a scandal of the first water. The Bantu flowed in uncontrolled and endangered the jobs of their own people in the cities. The National Party Government vigorously tackled that problem.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Everybody knows that conditions were very disturbing. Thereafter we had to tackle the problem of trying to evolve a form of government of their own for the Bantu and to give them prospects of development for the future. We did that. We evolved, discussed and applied certain systems. We have already introduced the one step towards self-government in the form of Bantu Authorities throughout the whole country. We are already commencing with the second stage in one place. Hope has been given also to the other non-White groups by means of the various types of machinery created for their own development.</p>

<p>Amongst us White people a new relationship has been created as the result of certain other great deeds, great reforms, particularly constitutional reforms, and in fact a new nation is growing up. In the constitutional sphere South Africa has experienced a great change. to-day nobody feels unhappy about it any longer. Everybody realizes that the establishment of the Republic of South Africa was to the benefit of the whole nation and of the growth of a new nation. That was one of the greatest changes. We were told beforehand that it would be accompanied by bloodshed, but the way in which a wise Government acted ensured that it came about without clashes or disruption.</p>

<p>The fact that we left the Commonwealth, something which we did not seek for the sake of mutual goodwill, but which we had to accept unless we wanted to pay the price of being dominated by the non-White members of it, and losing White control in the country, took place without too much heartbreak although it was a matter which hurt the feelings of many members of the population. To-Day everybody is gratified to see that the results of our resignation are not what was predicted. On the contrary, South Africa has derived appreciable benefits from it.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have the economic growth. I have received a detailed report from the section of my department which deals with economic matters in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s expansion in the economic sphere from 1948 until to-day. I have not the time to-day to submit it to the House, but this review indicates the most colossal progress. There is abundant proof that there has been progress in every sphere of our economic life. The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) said a few days ago that there would have been more progress under a United Party Government and that our economy simply just could not turn the corner! But neither of those statements is true. The only basis on which there can be economic progress is stability. It is the stability of the country and the fact that it has had the same Government for almost 15 years, together with the certainty <span class="col_247-248" refersTo="page_0138"/>that it will remain in power for a long time still, accompanied by the definite policy it has and which it follows consistently and from which it does not allow itself to be deterred, which creates confidence in South Africa and makes all these new developments possible. Apart from that, the Government itself has had the courage at every stage during these 15 years to tackle or to encourage new undertakings. There is, e.g., Sasol, which was ridiculed by the Opposition and which has developed into a great undertaking, which is the basis for a big chemical industry in South Africa, including the further development of a rubber industry. There is the development at Phalaborwa in regard to which we were also continually criticized, and which is now giving rise not only to the most valuable fertilizer industry but is indeed also a factor in the possible development of large-scale copper deposists there. There is the further development of Iscor and Escom. In every possible sphere of our economy there is nothing else but a broad vista of growth which opens before our eyes. That is the result not only of the general stability established by the Government, but also the result of direct decisions taken by the Government, and of its initiative and the encouragement it gave. It is also the result of the sound financial management of the country which it has maintained, sometimes, it is true, by means of orthodox methods, but still it was a strong, sound policy. South Africa is becoming stronger in every respect as the result of its economic prosperity. I say that whatever the prophet Jeremiah of the United Party might say, we have already turned the corner. As the result of that growth, South Africa is also able to ensure that its defence is strong, or is becoming stronger. In any case it will be able to defend itself against attack in Africa. I have been told that we should find allies even to protect us against internal unrest&#x2014;or perhaps the Leader of the Opposition meant unrest in Africa. For that we do not require any assistance from outside. We are strong enough to maintain peace and order ourselves.</p>

<p>Very well, then I will not stress that point. South Africa has grown and become strong. The Government has tackled the most serious colour problems energetically and is well on the way to making the light shine for everybody in future. In the economic sphere it took advantage of all the opportunities. A great future lies ahead of us. The Government is busy consolidating the White people of South Africa, but it is also offering the Bantu and the Coloured and the Indian prospects for happiness. What more does a nation expect of a Government? If the people had to choose between these two alternatives, the tangible creation of prosperity and happiness by the activities and drive of the Government together with the stability of the country on the one hand, and the empty past and the promises of the Opposition on the other hand, how can the public have confidence in anybody else than this side of the House?</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister when he started his speech spent some time in justifying his intervention in the debate at this late stage. We on this side of the House agree that the Prime Minister can use his own discretion when to come into the debate. But what is interesting is the time the hon. the Prime Minister chose, because while he was speaking reports reached us from outside that a strange darkness was descending over South Africa. I do not want to press the symbolism of the darkness outside when the Prime Minister spoke, for he brought light to this House on a very important issue, on whether this dangerous, this crazy policy of creating independent Bantustans out of the living body of South Africa is the traditional policy of the Nationalist Party or not, and whether it was the policy of any other Prime Minister in South Africa except the present one.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister devoted an hour of his speech in reading from &#x201C;Skietgoed&#x201D;, the name of a little booklet he had with him. He read to us from &#x201C;Skietgoed&#x201D; to prove, Sir, that since before 1948 the policy of the Nationalist Party has at least been moving towards the creation of independent Bantustans. I want to say with the most profound respect for the hon. the Prime Minister that he is mistaken in believing that. I can prove it by statements from every Nationalist Prime Minister since 1948, including the present one, that it was not the policy of the Nationalist Party. But what the hon. the Prime Minister succeeded in establishing is that within the Nationalist Party there has been a group moving in that direction. That is all, but that group did not succeed until this hon. gentleman took over the reins of government. I would like to remind the Prime Minister of the statement made by the late Dr. Malan in this House on 12 April 1950, when he said that one could have supported total territorial apartheid where practicable. &#x201C;It would be an ideal state, but it is not the policy of our party and it is nowhere to be found in our official documents. On the contrary, I clearly stated, and I said it clearly on platforms, that total territorial separation was impracticable under present circumstances. Our whole economic structure is to a large extent based upon non-White labour.&#x201D; Has that position changed in any way since then? If it is now admitted that the policy of the Nationalist Party was changed, why is it not shown that this important circumstance also changed and that our economy, as Dr. Malan told us, is now no longer largely dependent on non-White <span class="col_249-250" refersTo="page_0139"/>labour. What was the attitude of the late Mr. Strijdom? He wrote a letter to the late Mr. Brill, the gentleman who later became the hon. member for Mayfair.</p>

<p>I am not sure to which remark the hon. the Minister is referring, to Dr. Malan&#x2019;s or Mr. Strijdom&#x2019;s, and I am not particularly concerned, but the late Mr. Strijdom used almost the same words as Dr. Malan. He said that total territorial segregation may be the ideal, but in practice it could not be carried out, because of tens of thousands of people using the labour of Natives and Coloureds would never agree to it. In which way have circumstances changed to-day? But those two Prime Ministers are no longer with us. What about the hon. the Prime Minister who spoke to us to-day and accused us of misrepresentations when we suggested that this policy of separate Bantustans has not always been the policy of the Nationalist Party? The Prime Minister was for years a very energetic and dynamic Minister of Native Affairs. As long ago as 1951 we of the United Party warned our hon. friends opposite that this hon. gentleman wanted separate states, but the Nationalist Party repudiated it and accused us of misrepresentation, and apparently brought so much pressure to bear upon the hon. gentleman who is now our Prime Minister that he, too, had to deny it in most emphatic terms. He did so on28 May 1951, in this House, speaking as Minister of Native Affairs. I want to give some quotations from Col. 7815 onwards. The Prime Minister spoke about the Leader of the Opposition and said he repeated the general accusation which had been made outside by the Leader of the Opposition and also by various Press organs of the United Party. He said that the Leader of the Opposition intended winning the Ceres election. There was a by-election at Ceres, and he said the Leader of the Opposition intended winning the election by making the people afraid of the Nationalist policy, as if they were busy establishing a Bantustan. He continued to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He did not succeed and this further misrepresentation of our policy will also fail.</block>

<p>Then the Prime Minister went on. He referred to the speech he made before the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I used the words &#x201C;baasskap in their own area &#x201D;. Both for Natives and Europeans. The reason why I did this was to counter the propaganda and the agitation and the spreading of a bad spirit by the other side of the House among Natives in respect of those words. The attitude I proclaimed was as follows: The Native was granted by the United Party a sort of broad body, a sort of parliament, which was of a purely advisory character, namely the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council.</block>

<p>Then he went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hon. members have my speech before them. Why should I try to get away from it? Within his own area, therefore, the Native can have his local government. If there are towns then he can have town government in them. In the bigger areas he can have regional government or &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; or supremacy there; he can also have his &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; or supremacy or self-government in the whole Native area where there is an entire unit &#x2026;</block>

<p>Then he went on in Col. 7818&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My view is this: All those areas can become self-governing, and in this sense they can have baasskap over their own fate; but all the areas will be within the geographic and economic unit of the Union of South Africa and dependent on it, also in respect of any international relations concerning the defence of this country. It speaks for itself that South Africa is the trustee and ruler of the whole.</block>

<p>What now becomes clear? That in 1948 he had discussions with Dr. Malan and he had them in 1950, and later a certain policy was about to be announced by Prime Minister Strijdom, but it was not announced owing to the unfortunate death of the then Prime Minister. It was not told to the people. It was denied, as I have just read out to prove. There was a secret movement inside the Nationalist Party which was not revealed to the members of the Nationalist Party or to the people of South Africa. The people were not to know. When this hon. gentleman became Prime Minister, as he told us this afternoon, he had to set about establishing a Re-public and that is why he did not then make <span class="col_251-252" refersTo="page_0140"/>the announcement that this would be the policy. The people were not to know what the state of the Republic would be&#x2014;eventual fragmentation. [Interjection.] Let the Prime Minister make up his mind. When we said some years ago what the policy of the Nationalist Party would become, what it is to-day, he also said that we misrepresented it. But was the Minister of Foreign Affairs also under a wrong impression when he spoke according to Hansard, Col. 117, on 30 August 1948. and accused the United Party of misrepresentation when we suggested that the Natives in terms of their policy would be removed from the Western Province? Then he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under our policy the detribalized Natives will remain in the European areas of the Cape Province.</block>

<p>Can it be said that the Nationalist Party is consistent in its policy? The hon. member for Durban (Point) quoted from this pamphlet to show that as late as 1959 assurances were officially published by the Nationalist Party that the Bantustans would not be allowed to become independent. What the hon. member for Durban (Point) mercifully omitted was the name of the author of this pamphlet&#x2014;&#x201C; opgestel deur M. C. Botha, L.V.&#x201D; And so grateful was the Nationalist Party to the hon. member for denying that their policy was one of Bantustans that he was promptly accepted as an expert on Native affairs and was made Deputy Minister of Bantu Administration.</p>

<p>Even the highest form of self-government cannot make them independent states. [Interjections.] Then we have the Minister of Bantu Administration. He had no delusions that this was the policy of the Nationalist Party.

<p>Mr. Speaker, eight years afterwards we get this excuse. But the point I want to make is that in the ranks of the Nationalist Party there was confusion about it, to say the least of it. They spoke in two voices. They were reassuring their people, while behind the scenes the hon. the Prime Minister was trying to get the other Ministers to accept this policy, and he almost succeeded.</p>

<p>But I was dealing with the hon. the Prime Minister. Despite all his attempts to deny it, the Leader of the Opposition made certain charges against the Government which shout for an answer, and those answers are not forthcoming. The only answer the Prime Minister gave was that he had heard it before. That may be so. It may be that in previous years and for many years the United Party criticized the Government on similar grounds. Does that prove that our charges are not true? Mr. Speaker, I go to church occasionally. The Ten Commandments were given to us 2,000 years ago and they are still read in my church every Sunday morning. They are not obsolete. Because we continue to sin, we have to be reminded of the Commandments. But the Government continues to sin and the public has to be reminded of it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Information must keep quiet because I am coming to him in a moment. [Laughter.] The second thing was that the hon. the Minister of Justice made an attack on someone who cannot defend herself in this House, Mrs. Bertha Solomon. He said that she wrote an article in the <i>Winnipeg Free Press,</i> in which she made a misstatement about the Sabotage Bill, and he wrote to her about it, and as an honest and courageous woman she wrote back admitting it. [Interjections.] The Department of the hon. the Minister of Information also wrote to Mrs. Solomon, and I am sure he knows about it, because surely his Department does not treat him with contempt, and again she wrote back and said the article was months old, and would it be wise to re-open the matter, but if the Department of Information wished it she would write to the Editor and correct it, but she never got an answer. The Minister of Information was sitting next to the Minister of Justice when he made this mistake but he did not help him. This hon. gentleman gave us a lecture on how lawyers should behave to each other. I think he should consider how human beings should behave to one another. I think it is a shameful thing that the Minister of Information should have knowledge affecting the honour of a former member of this House and yet allow his colleague, the Minister of Justice, to make an attack upon this person without giving him the information in her favour. I think he should apologize to Mrs. Solomon because he was in a peculiar position to protect her honour and yet failed to do so. Then the Minister of Justice suggested that we should now stand by him and by his Government in the fight against Communism, having failed to answer the just and trenchant charge made by the Leader of the Opposition that by his methods he was making martyrs of communists and giving them a status they did not deserve in this country, identifying them in the minds of the non-Whites with the champions for the non-Whites, but he never answered that charge, which was true. Then the Minister says we must help him. Sir, we of the United Party will help anybody to resist communists.</p>

<p>We consider Communism an unmitigated evil, but if people want our co-operation they must offer us a right basis for co-operation. A basis for cooperation which consists in a denial of the rule of law, in giving undue publicity to people whom they think are communists, people who have not been before the Courts, and in denying fundamental rights, in denying our democratic way of life and by practising methods applied in communists states&#x2014;to ask us to co-operate on those lines is useless. I say let them take a leaf from a young man who spoke here, the hon. member for Innesdale (Mr. J. A. Marais). He ended by making a very constructive statement. He said that if you want to fight Communism you must not only fight poverty, but you must oppose against it another philosophy, and he suggested that you must oppose against Communism a healthy patriotism. If the Cabinet would accept the advice of that young man and give the non-Whites a stake in this country to make them feel that they also owe a duty of patriotism to South Africa, it will have the unqualified co-operation of the United Party. Then the hon. the Minister persisted with the canard that Communism and Liberalism are equal. I want to say that it does not take a profound study of politics to know the difference between liberalism and Communism. To begin with, the liberal believes in the maintenance of the rule of law, law which is ascertainable to everybody, which will tell the citizen clearly what is right or what is wrong in his relations to the State and not a law determined by the whim of the Minister. The communists deny and destroy the rule of law wherever they take control. The communists believe in the omnipotence of the State. The State can do no wrong. All their efforts are directed towards the interests of the State as a super entity. The liberal believes that more important than the State is the worth and dignity of the individual. The liberal believes in the separation of power, that there should be a separate legislature and a separate executive, which in some cases they concede should be responsible to the legislature, and that there should be an independent judiciary. The communist especially wants the judiciary to be an agent or an instrument to apply the policy of the Party. The liberal believes in a multiplicity of parties, whereas the communist believes essentially in a one-party State. The communist destroys all private enterprise and believes that all means of production should be controlled by the State. Liberalism was created because they believed so much in private enterprise that they furthered the policy of <i>laisser-faire.</i></p>

<p>This is what the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) particularly should appreciate, that the liberal believes in the value of the individual. I want to say that I am not a member of the Liberal Party. I cannot claim to be a liberal, but I can say this, that all of us in this House owe much of our political thinking to liberal doctrines. Sir, when the law was pronounced many years ago that one should love one&#x2019;s neighbour as oneself, liberalism became an essential part of the creed of Christian people &#x2026; Even the Prime Minister is subject to liberal influence. The Prime Minister says that the Black people should be entitled in their own areas to exactly the same rights as the White man. That is perverted liberalism, because he puts that qualification &#x201C;in their own <span class="col_255-256" refersTo="page_0142"/>areas". If he said &#x201C;according to their state of civilization&#x201D;, I could understand it. The Prime Minister is the most interesting example of twisted Liberalism that I have ever come across. The Progressive Party has certain elements of liberalism. If it would stop the cant of clothing its policy in the pretence that there is in it no racial discrimination, we would respect it very much more. But the Progressive Party believes in it and pays lip service to it, and there is much of liberalism they accept, but in fact they have a policy of a qualified franchise which in practice, if not in theory&#x2014;and practice is what counts&#x2014;will discriminate against the Black man as effectively as any policy of the Prime Minister. We of the United Party are subject to certain liberal influences, but they are modified and corrected by practical considerations and commonsense&#x2026;. We adapt it to the times in which we live. But the hon. the Minister of Justice continues to equate liberalism with Communism, liberalism which has played a part in the thinking of every civilized nation. Then he reads from a book by Mr. Edgar Hoover to show that Mr. Hoover said the same thing, and what was this quotation? Mr. Hoover did not refer to liberals; he referred to people whom he called crypto-communists or pseudo-liberals and I agree with Mr. Hoover that those are the dangerous people. But that quotation certainly did not prove what the hon. the Minister set out to prove. In the same way the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller), who made a very fine speech, issued an appeal to this side of the House that we should join them in the defence of the White man. He warned us that the attacks made on South Africa by so many countries of the world are not attacks upon apartheid but attacks upon the White man, and he said we must help them to protect the White man. We of the United Party are keen and eager and willing to defend the rights of the White man in this country, to defend the worthwhile contributions made by the White man to civilize living in this country and to the improvement of the lot of all our people, and to protect the rewards to which the White man is entitled for that contribution. But why ask us to help to defend the White man but refuse to modify this wicked policy of apartheid? How can they expect us or anybody to accept the fundamentals of that apartheid, to stand with them and to defend this impossible, this preposterous negation of common sense, this petty apartheid? Sir, I wish I had time to show you the folly, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has done, of some of the petty apartheid practiced in this country, but even the big apartheid, even the brand of apartheid of the Prime Minister&#x2014; can we be asked to defend White civilization on that basis? It is the most fallacious piece of thinking&#x2014;that I believe has ever been perpetrated in the political life of this country, that you can satisfy the aspirations of the Black people by giving a minority of them full rights&#x2014;sovereignty if they so desire&#x2014;in limited Bantustan areas comprising one-seventh of the surface area of South Africa and then become purblind and deny the aspirations, the rights, the longings of the majority of them who do not live in those Bantustans and will never, while we are alive or our grandchildren are alive, have permanent residence in those Bantustans. And then, Sir, they answer that these people will have political rights in the Bantustans. Although they are born in the White man&#x2019;s part of South Africa they can vote for a Bantustan government; they can exercise their political rights there. Can any hon. member opposite believe that that is just? Would they support a future government of South Africa who said to the hon. the Prime Minister: &#x201C;You can live in South Africa, you can make your contribution to our wealth but you can only vote in Holland because that is where you were born?&#x201D; Would they consider that just? Why then must it be just in the case of the Black man? Sir, never in history has there been an example of a country willing to make itself economically and strategically dependent on a labour force controlled by a foreign government, and yet that is the policy of the Prime Minister. He will not allow White skill or White capital into the reserves. Our industries must be staffed by workers whom he will make citizens of foreign governments, responsible to foreign governments subject ultimately to the control of foreign governments. It was shown in the last war that it took, I think, seven men in industry to keep one soldier fighting. It is estimated that in the nuclear war of the future the number of industrial workers needed to keep one man fighting will be two or three times as many. The Prime Minister wants to make our industrial life dependent on a labour force who are subjects of a foreign government. It is a ridiculous policy, Sir, and I want to repeat what I said at the outset, that it was not the policy of the Nationalist Party until the hon. the Prime Minister occupied the prominent position of Prime Minister and brought force to bear upon their party. [Interjection.]</p>

<p>I do not know where it came from. The Nationalist Party did not want it, the Natives did not want it, the vast majority of the people did not want it. I believe that it is the product of one of the task groups of the Broederbond and that it was imposed upon the Nationalist Party by the Broederbond. I want to say here that in a candid moment even the Prime Minister admitted that he did not want this policy of apartheid. I think he did it in a generous moment. He was Prime Minister; he was victorious; he could stamp aside opposition in the Nationalist Party; he could announce Bantustan as a policy, so he was generous and he said that even he did not want it. This is what he said in this House on 10 April 1961 (Afrikaans Hansard, Vol. 107, Col. 4277)&#x2014;</p>

<p>In other words, what the Prime Minister accused us of he has admitted is the case with him and the Nationalist Party. He tried to formulate his policy with a view to appeasing world opinion, but the Prime Minister in making his announcement here on 10 April 1961 admitted that the Nationalist Party did not want the Bantustan policy. They accepted it under pressure, I believe, of the Broederbond in order to try to appease world opinion. How dare the hon. gentleman make the accusation against us when they are guilty?

The hon. member acted as a stop-gap this evening, a stop-gap between the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister and that of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition who must come to his senses, and also a stop-gap in the sense that he, as a plausible speaker, had to tell a bad story. The hon. member for Yeoville wanted to produce proof that the National Party&#x2019;s policy of independent Bantu homelands, if necessary, was a new policy. How did he start? A man who is so obsessed with logic as he is, came to light with two completely false arguments, which were not arguments. He produced a quotation from a speech by the late Dr. D. F. Malan, a former Prime Minister, in which Dr. Malan said that total segregation, the complete separation of people, was not the policy of the National Party, and he came to light with a later quotation to show that Advocate Strydom had also said that at that stage total segregation, total separation was not the policy of the National Party. Many hon. members opposite who are more stupid than the hon. member for Yeoville know that this had nothing to do with the point that he sought to argue. He sought to argue that it was not National Party policy necessarily to permit self-government in the Bantu areas, and then he said that it was never the policy of the National Party to remove all the Bantu to the Bantu areas. He was quite right. It has never been authoritatively stated on behalf of the National Party that its policy was to remove all Bantu to the Bantu areas and neither will that ever be said until the time comes when we are in sight of putting it into practice and that is not a stage which we will experience soon. However, that has nothing to do with the argument, and his reasoning on these two points amounts to absolutely nothing&#x2014;I would almost say, like the speaker himself.</p>

<p>We come then to what to my mind borders on impropriety, namely, the quotation from the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister of 1951. What was the context of that speech? He did not give its background&#x2014;oh no, not at all. The background at the time was an equally nebulous attack by the United Party that the National Party envisaged bringing into being one large common Bantustan or Bantu Government. He quoted from Hansard what the then Minister of Native Affairs said and, unfortunately, in order to have the context, I must again read what he quoted and then continue. The hon. the Prime Minister, then Minister of Native Affairs, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Within his own area therefore, the Native can have his local government. If there are towns then he can have town government in them. In the bigger areas he can have regional government or baasskap or supremacy or self-government in the whole Native area where there is an entire unit (volkseenheid), for instance, the Native area of Zululand or in smaller regions if they are isolated. That is as far as I went.</block>

<p>This is in contrast to the idea of one large, common Bantustan. Then he continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I did not even express an opinion on the question whether in the future development there is a possibility of the various scattered Native areas having some sort of joint super-machinery. Constitutional development can be anticipated and guided only to a certain extent. The future must attend to the rest. I am convinced of it and hon. members on the other side are also convinced of it that it will be a long time before Natives can assume full self-control in their own areas. I am not speaking therefore of any super-parliament about which hon. members on the other side spoke and which they wanted to provide to some extent to the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council to whom they wanted to give more powers and who at the beginning was even becoming a dangerous sort of parliament.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is the context, and what the hon. the Prime Minister said here is what he said on the occasion of the announcement of the Transkei self-government plan.</p>

<p><span class="col_259-260" refersTo="page_0144"/>Now to return to the last hollow argument which the hon. member for Yeoville advanced, namely that the hon. the Prime Minister said in 1962: We are not rushing to meet the idea that these territories will of necessity become completely independent. That is the simple elementary truth. The National Party has never said: It is our aim to make those Bantu homelands sovereignly independent. We say: We will not shirk the consequences if that is the only way in which to maintain peace in Africa here; that we will even allow them to go so far as to obtain sovereign independence. The interpretation of the United Party that this party is the creator of an idea that sovereign independent Bantu states must and will be established is surely an untrue one. What this party does say is this: There must and will be a local Bantu government in the Bantu homelands which will give cultural expression, emotional expression to the aspirations of that national group; that there must be a local government which can govern that territory effectively, and if the hurricane which has torn across Africa blows here and if those territories wish to go further than this concept which we have in mind, we will not try to halt it by force and by violence. This homeland policy is interpreted now as a policy which holds tremendous dangers for us. Reference was again made this evening to a few of the alleged dangers. The hon. member for Yeoville dwelt more specifically upon the so-called economic danger in this regard&#x2014;that the Black labour force in our Republic will live in the Bantu homeland subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign power. Is that so strange in the African situation and in the South African situation? Does the hon. member himself not have an intimate knowledge, and was he at one stage not an employee of a mining house in South Africa? Is our entire gold-mining industry not built on immigrant labour, 60 to 70 per cent of which comes from outside the State jurisdiction of South Africa? When will this proposal which has now been made come into being? Is it a proposal which is going to apply in five years&#x2019; time, in ten years or in 15 years&#x2019; time? If it does ever materialize, it is certainly an interpretation which will materialize in the very distant future, but here it is described as an excited voice raised in urgent insistence as though we in South Africa would expose ourselves immediately to the danger of having our labour force under foreign political control. The risk in respect of Bantu labour in our industrial life is precisely the same whether the Bantu homelands exist or not. to a very large extent because the risk exists on the part of the industrial workers themselves. If they are incited by irresponsible elements in South Africa, there is the risk of industrial unrest, and if a position is created where they cannot be incited by irresponsible elements, then we will have a position of industrial peace. I want to express it as the conviction of this party that we believe that we have a good chance for permanent industrial peace, also with the Black man, if he finds spiritual expression in his homeland, if his urban population groups have a governmental connection with the homelands and, above all, if we do not make false promises to them, if we do not tell them: We will give you a share of the &#x201C;ballot box&#x201D;, as the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) said a few years ago, and then come along with such a small fraction of a &#x201C;ballot box&#x201D; that one would be ashamed to offer it to the least of one&#x2019;s fellow-men! That is what will embitter the Bantu, the false idea of participation in the political life of South Africa by means of which the United Party must either deceive the Bantu or else bring about ruin for the Whites. The only two choices open to the United Party in this policy which they propound are: They are either going to disillusion the Bantu and incur his displeasure, or else they are going to deceive the White man and sell his heritage.</p>

<p>In connection with the criticism of the homeland from the economic point of view, when has it ever been stated that the National Party&#x2019;s policy implies that at any stage of development the Bantu homelands will be divorced from monetary and fiscal unity with the Republic of South Africa? That has never been done on any occasion.</p>

<p>Full independence can surely be reconciled with monetary and fiscal unity? Is Swaziland not one with us in the monetary and fiscal sphere? Are hon. members not even inhabitants of the Republic, or inhabitants of the world? It is after all a completely general occurence that monetary and fiscal unities reach beyond political unities. The whole conception of our Bantu homeland development has always been that they will remain one with us in the monetary and fiscal sphere and no financial realist can imagine a Bantu government being so stupid as to wish to depart from monetary and fiscal unity with the Republic of South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>My hon. friend does not understand what a fiscal and monetary unit is. The word &#x201C;fiscal&#x201D; deals with the common import duty structure and the flow of goods, while &#x201C;monetary&#x201D; means a uniform financial and banking system. It has nothing to do with the question of political control.</p>

<p>Lastly then, in connection with the economic aspect of the development of the Bantu homelands which has been raised here on various occasions, I would also like to remove one misconception. The economic development of the Bantu homelands is nothing less than the economic development of an economically backward part of the Republic of <span class="col_261-262" refersTo="page_0145"/>South Africa. Economically speaking, the development of a Bantu homeland amounts to the same thing economically as to set a new economic activity in motion 150 miles west of Kimberley or 150 miles downstream from Prieska or even at Prieska. It is simply the economic development of what is still at present an economically inactive part of our Republic, and how it can be suggested that any economic development, no matter where it takes place, is not to the benefit of the country as a whole, is something that I just cannot imagine. It is so completely inaccurate that no Member of Parliament ought to be guilty of saying such a thing. The strongest argument inherent in this point is to say that if capital is invested in an economically active area of the country one often receives a swifter and larger dividend on one&#x2019;s investment than one would receive in an undeveloped area, but the following is also true: If one does not develop the undeveloped areas, one will never develop the full potential of one&#x2019;s state.</p>

<p>Before I depart from the question of the Bantu homelands in order to deal with the policy of the United Party, I should like to go back a little into history. The hon. member for Yeoville confined his attack to the alleged changed policy of the National Party to Dr. Malan and Adv. Strydom, when he made irrelevant quotations. Then he made an attack upon the Prime Minister and in this regard he made a partial and accordingly, incorrect quotation. The clearest exposition of National Party policy was given by General Hertzog in 1936 when the Native Trust and Land Act was adopted here in the House of Assembly. On that occasion he spoke in English and I want to refer to Col. 4085 of Hansard of 20 May 1936. General Hertzog said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place, let me remind the questioner &#x2026; (a parliamentary questioner) that what we have here is the very starting point of our legislation, namely, segregation. We are busy to say to the Native: We want as few of you as possible in the White man&#x2019;s area. For that reason we are setting aside defined areas for you in which you can go and carry on your farming operations and to which you can go and live. When you come within the White man&#x2019;s area you should know that really you come, in the first place, to serve his interests. Within the Native area we shall try to do everything for you, so that you Natives can advance as well as possible and live as happily as possible.</block>

<p>A little further on he continued&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We say to the Native: This is part of the territory which we have set aside for you as Natives. There you can live as you like, and as many as you like. If possible, we would like to see you govern yourselves, if possible in an autonomous way.</block>

<p>General Hertzog, Leader of the United Party, said this in 1936. I have kept this quotation till now because it covers the two points; it covers the point of attack that the National Party policy has been changed, but it also covers the last point of attack of the hon. member for Yeoville that the National Party has a fantastic policy idea, that we want to tell the Bantu in the White areas: You can work here but have your political rights and homes elsewhere. This is the old historical conception that if the Native comes to the White area, he must know that in the first place he is there to serve the interests of the Whites, and if he does not wish to do so, as many of them who desire to do so can stay in their own area. I do not wish to take up the time of the House unnecessarily by quoting too much from 1913 speeches like that of General Botha, but I want to mention the ratio of this homeland policy which was perhaps best given in 1913 by Mr. H. W. Sampson, who later also became a member of the House of Assembly. In 1913, Mr. Sampson said (Hansard, 16 May 1913. Col. 2493) (Afrikaans)&#x2014;and the hon. Leader of the Opposition should take note of this as being the reason why there is no confidence in his party&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Native could only hope to aim at governing himself and making his own laws in the future by separating from the Whites, for the Whites would never allow Natives to have a hand in the framing of laws for Europeans.</block>

<p>We have to deal here with a simple South African fact. The Whites whom I and we on this side of the House represent will never permit laws to be made for them by the Bantu. History has determined a pattern of life and we are not prepared to accept it. The only solution to the question of Bantu self-expression and government within our country&#x2019;s borders is therefore the Bantu homeland policy of the National Party.</p>

<p>In conclusion, on this point, how is it that the United Party now seeks to create a misconception and say that a new policy is being followed, that a new policy has been created by the Prime Minister? Why is it that they should come to light with this fantastic idea when every young Nationalist, every old Nationalist, every chairman and secretary of the smallest branch, when every member has known so well over the years, and knows so well to-day, that our policy is that the Bantu must develop to self-determination in their own areas? They know that we will not force the Bantu or push him into a swifter and greater self-determination, but that we will not use force to prevent his going as far as his abilities and aspirations prescribe, because we are Nationalists and we concede to those Bantu the same nationhood and national expression as we want for ourselves. That is the long and the short of the whole matter.</p>

<p>The United Party in this debate put forward their criticism of our Bantu homeland <span class="col_263-264" refersTo="page_0146"/>policy. But in this debate the most important matter to my mind, apart from their rushing to the defence of the liberals, was the fact that the United Party, through the medium of its leader, ran way from its own federation policy. We had the phenomenon here that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us what his programme would be if he came into power. There would be three stages. The first stage would be the immediate repeal of laws which allegedly affect the personal dignity of the non-White.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Review, not repeal.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, quite right. The second stage would be&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Secondly, there would be a gradual planned advance through constitutional and economic reform to meet the legitimate aspiration of the non-White races.</block>

<p>When he speaks of &#x201C;constitutional and economic reform&#x201D; I take it that this must also refer to the aspirations of the non-White races; in other words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There would be a carefully planned advance through constitutional and economic reform to meet the legitimate economic and constitutional aspirations of the non-White races.</block>

<p>And then, after having completed that, they would come forward with their third step&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The third step would be the establishment of a race federation.</block>

<p>This is extremely important, Mr. Speaker. It has been put in this way simply because the hon. gentlemen are now running away from their race federation plan. If the disaster should befall South Africa and if the miracle should happen to the United Party that they come into power, they will be placed in the position that they will not have to tackle their impossible race federation plan immediately. That is why the hon. Leader of the Opposition prefaced his statement with these two delaying clauses. These delaying clauses are far more important than they appear to be. Before they start with their race federation plan they are first of all going to satisfy the economic and constitutional aspirations of the non-Whites. In other words, they are first of all going to give the non-Whites certain economic and constitutional privileges. In other words, before race federation, the franchize is going to be doled out, but who is going to determine what the &#x201C;legitimate aspirations&#x201D; are? After all, the people cherishing these aspirations are also going to have a say. That is the basis of their theory. After all we as Whites may not come to a decision without consultation. That must take place with consultation. There is not the slightest doubt. Mr. Speaker, that if, as their Leader has promised, the United Party once satisfy the aspirations of the non-Whites in respect of constitutional matters, it will not be that Party which will determine the question of race federation; it will be a completely different and far more ominous figure that will determine the terms of that race federation. They are running away from their own race federation plan; they are running away by means of procrastinating provisions and in this way they have sold out their own race federation idea to the non-White majority.</p>

<p>Then they come forward with the excuse that their race federation concept will bring peace for us with the Western world; it will take the place of minor apartheid (klein apartheid)&#x2014;a new term coined by small (&#x201C; klein &#x201D;) people in order to cloud an important issue.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is the <i>Burger's</i> term.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member attributes authorship to the <i>Burger</i> when all it did was to use a term coined by somebody else. The author is not the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn)&#x2014;he is not quite so resourceful; nor would I refer to him as a small person! Minor apartheid&#x2014;what else is it but the legislative steps which this Government has had to take, in order to make compulsory by legislation what has always been done voluntarily, because of the deliberate and systematic breaking down of the conventional way of life in South Africa by the liberals. Take the simple example of beach apartheid. If it were not for the talk, the inflammatory behaviour of that party and of worse elements like the progressives and the liberals outside, if it were not for the articles in the English-language newspapers, there would be no such problem as beach apartheid to-day. Then each of us would have known where to swim and what our usual customs were. This spirit of unrest, this spirit of rebellion, this spirit of dissatisfaction was created by that element and their allies. One is repeatedly called upon therefore to transform into legislation what does not lend itself easily to legislation. Human practices, human and social customs are from the nature of things not suitable subjects for legislation. They do not lend themselves well to it and it strikes a harsh note in the mind of a stranger who does not know the social situation which it is designed to meet. This whole question of minor apartheid is a necessary legislative reaction which has been instigated by the systematic attitude of the United Party and its allies in respect of the colour problem over the past 15 to 18 years. This is something which has been forced upon us, it is not something which gives one any pleasure.</p>

<p>To suggest that the repeal of these minor measures will make an important international political difference to the status of South Africa is, as has repeatedly been indicated, a gross misrepresentation.</p>

<p>I do not think that I should discuss these particular points any further because they have already been dealt with in full in this <span class="col_265-266" refersTo="page_0147"/>debate. Let me conclude with a basic reference to the hon. Leader of the Opposition and his assistant, the hon. member for Yeoville and their Party. It was said recently of the hon. member that he should beware lest he play the part of a General Kerensky. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, when Communism was young and weak, when Bolshevism in Petrograd was young and weak, when a strong hand was unable to destroy it and Lenin, General Kerensky as leader of the conservative majority came along with his stories of liberalism, with his stories of a little compromise and a little deferment and a little concession here and there anticipating that the position would clear up. Eventually he lost that long civil war and a monster was created in Russia and in the world, and nobody can tell to-day where it is going to end. We here in South Africa are faced on the one hand with that poisonous communist power. On the other hand we are faced with the force of Pan-African racism which is just as violent and poisonous. This is not a time for procrastination; it is not a time for half measures; it is a time for faith and action. We must put faith against faith. In the communist world we have tremendous conviction; in the Pan-African world we have that tremendous urge for self-expression amongst the Black nations. We can only maintain our civilization if we believe just as steadfastly and just as strongly: We will and we are going to live and win in South Africa. The method is often of less importance than the will, and I believe that the will and the faith in our case is more important than the ally and the weapon. The trouble with the United Party is that they do not give expression to the will and the faith of the White man in South Africa to remain here at all costs or to fall like men. It is the Kerensky idea of &#x201C;the danger is not so great; some plan can be made; trouble can be saved by making a few concessions; we can delay things a little&#x201D;, Do not let the terrible judgment of history be passed upon the hon. and respected Leader of the Opposition; let that Party realize the demands of the times and add its moral support to the support of this side of the House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker I am sure that the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) will forgive me if I do not reply to him immediately and if I reply to the points raised by him in the course of the representations I am about to make. Mr. Speaker, the attitude of the hon. the Prime Minister leaves no room for doubt that he and I have totally different ideas as to the purpose and scope of a no-confidence debate. I also think that his opinion differs greatly from that held by most democratic countries in the world. This Parliament did not meet for six months or more. During that time many things have happened in South Africa and in the world outside, circumstances have changed greatly. In my opinion the Opposition has the right to discuss the great principles of Government policy in the light of those changed circumstances when the House of Assembly meets once again. As far as I am concerned, I feel it is no more than right that it should start by means of a motion of no-confidence, because it is the omission on the part of the Government to adapt itself to those changed circumstances which, to my mind, has given rise to the lack of confidence.</p>

<p>The debate has followed a peculiar course. The hon. the Prime Minister quoted certain questions which were raised last year and he said that he was not going to reply to them again. He said that he spoke last year on the question of whether the new Bantu areas would not constitute a spring-board which would be dangerous to the Republic. Did the happenings in Cuba have no affect on the people as far as that sort of thing is concerned? Did the happenings in Angola not influence these hon. gentlemen? Did they not learn any lesson from that? The hon. gentleman said that during the previous discussion I spoke about the economic retrogression. Even the hon. the Prime Minister admitted between the two sittings that had he and his economic advisers realized what the effect would be of what happened in 1961 he would probably have taken other steps as far as the financial position of the country was concerned. Are those not circumstances which should be taken in account by Parliament when it assembles for another sitting?</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister went on and tried to make the House believe that he resented the fact that it was suggested that the Nationalist Party had in any way changed its policy during the past 10-12 years. He made us understand that he has consistently followed the same policy. We had other quotations from the hon. member for Kempton Park to prove the same thing. I just want to say this, Mr. Speaker: If it is true that there has been no change and that the Nationalist Party has always envisaged that these separate Native states should develop and that they should one day develop to sovereign independence, there is not the least shadow of doubt that every Nationalist Party questioner and organiser at every meeting which I have addressed has lied to me. There is not the least shadow of doubt about that because when I made that allegation it was repeatedly denied. What made me come to the conclusion that that was not the policy of the Party, was the course of events in the year 1951 when the hon. the Prime Minister addressed the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council and when he was subsequently attacked in this House because of what he had said there. He read certain quotations from the speech which he made at the time. I do not wish to take up too much of the time of the House but I just want to read a few further quotations, quotations which clarified the position to me at the time. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We have always said that the White man must rule in South Africa, that the Nationalist Party favours local self-government for the Native in his own areas.</block>

<p><span class="col_267-268" refersTo="page_0148"/>Then he went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You at least have a chance in your own part of the country of enjoying supremacy and also enjoying supremacy as the trustee in respect of the outside world and of the interests of South Africa as a whole. The other way leads without doubt to the domination of South Africa by the Natives.</block>

<p>A question was then put to him by Mr. Robinson&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Are you in favour of federation with the non-European areas?</block>

<p>The reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of course I am not in favour of federation with the non-European areas because there are no White states. The hon. member knows it.</block>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker. I do not think that is of any importance. In that case I must admit that I have never understood the policy of the Nationalist Party as announced by Dr. Malan who, when he wrote to that Canadian parson, said that he expected the relationship between the Native areas and the White areas to develop into a federal relationship; in that case I did not understand the Tomlinson report; nor did I understand the articles written by Dr. Eiselen in which he said that the Native areas would never get greater powers than those of provincial councils.</p>

<p>My charge against the Government in this debate is this, that in its policy it has omitted to adapt itself to the changed circumstances. I do not think it is necessary to say much about that because not a single member on that side of the House has tried to deny that. It is only necessary for me to refer to agriculture and I know the hon. member for Winburg (Mr. Sadie) will agree with me. He is the only person who spoke about agricultural matters. He will agree with me that the Government has not adapted itself to the changed circumstances during the past year and that the farmers have suffered as a result. I also know that the hon. the Prime Minister will agree with me when I talk about education because he himself admitted that the Government had omitted to give sufficient attention to technical education in South Africa. Consequently that portion of my charge against the Government has already been proved and admitted by the side opposite. I went further and said that there were certain lessons which they had not learnt. I asked whether it was not perhaps wrong for the Government to base its policy on the hope that UNO would disintegrate. Mr. Speaker, we now find ourselves in a somewhat difficult position in regard to that statement. The Prime Minister adopted a somewhat different attitude from that of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs tried to make the case that UNO had fallen in disfavour with the countries of the Western world. He quoted from a speech by Lord Hume in which he criticised UNO very strongly. I too have here a speech of Lord Hume, a speech made by him in February 1962. I think it is portion of the speech from which the hon. Minister quoted although I was unable to lay my hands on the entire speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am a strong supporter of the United Nations&#x2019; Charter which the United Nations exists to operate. Insularity is a luxury which this Island cannot afford and we must live, love and work with the United Nations as we find them.</block>

<p>That was his statement, that we would have to live with it although we did not care for many of the things which happened there. Here is what President Kennedy said on 14 January 1963 when he reported to the nation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this quest (for freedom) the United Nations requires our full and continued support. Its value in serving the cause of peace has been shown anew in its role on the West New Guinea settlement, in its use as a forum for the Cuban crisis and in its task of unification in the Congo. to-day UNO is primarily a protector of the small and the weak and a safety valve for the strong. To-morrow it can form the framework for a world of law, a world in which no nation dictates the destiny of another, in which the vast resources now devoted to destructive means will serve constructive ends.</block>

<p>In other words, the President of the United States envisages the continued existence of that organization. What I said was that that organization would continue to exist as long as the United States desired it. What is our attitude towards the United Nations Organization?

<block name="quote">As regards South Africa&#x2019;s position generally in UNO I will say no more at this stage than that we will bide our time and watch the position.

<p>That is not the way in which to drop such an important matter. Is it the intention of this Government to withdraw from the Organization or does it intend to continue to state its case, to defend South Africa there, to fight the opposition against South Africa and even to try to find friends in that organization from amongst the Western powers, friends who would possibly stand by us if trouble should arise in the world? I think that is a question to which we are entitled to an answer. [Interjections.] The hon. Minister says he has given his reply and we can draw our own conclusions.</p>

<p>Two statements were made: The one was &#x201C;we bide our time&#x201D;, I think we now find ourselves in a position of uncertainty as far as this matter is concerned which is a further reason for a lack of confidence in this Government. Because I regard it as yet another sign towards the direction of withdrawing from that Organization on account of the criticism which is levelled against the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister also asked whether we realized how many people were hostile to the White man and hostile to South Africa. I accept that, Mr. Speaker. There are many people in Africa who are hostile to the White man; there are many who are hostile to South Africa but there are many who are only hostile to apartheid. As far as the hostility towards the White man is concerned, we cannot do anything about that; as far as the hostility towards South Africa is concerned, we can try to influence that, but as far as the hostility towards apartheid is concerned, that we can change by following a different course. I believe that this side of the House will be able to follow a course which will indeed give our friends in the Western world the opportunity of once again defending us.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister asked whether I was willing to pay the price, whether I knew what the price was. I wonder what the price will be? From my own experience overseas, in England, in the United States of America and in other countries where I have had the privilege of discussing this important matter with prominent people in public life, I have come to the conclusion that the vast majority of responsible people in the Western world would be prepared once again to seek friendship with South Africa if there were the slightest change of course. [Interjections.! Mr. Speaker, I can read many quotations to prove that. I can quote the Tunku of Malaya. The Tunku who, after the Commonwealth Conference, even said that he would be satisfied had there been only ten representatives in this House.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>As far as I remember they helped him to the extent that he got a great number of votes and that a number of countries abstained from voting. That friendship helped him to this extent that he was undoubtedly in a very much stronger position than South Africa is. [Interjections.] I do not know how Mr. Whitehead can be compared with South Africa. Surely Whitehead is subject, firstly, to the Federation and, secondly, to the British Government. His is not an independent State. The point he had to submit was whether Rhodesia was a self-governing country <span class="col_271-272" refersTo="page_0150"/>or not and whether reports had to be submitted to UNO or not. It had nothing to do with friends.</p>

<p>I went further and adopted the attitude that it would never be possible for the State Information Office nor for many of the mouthpieces of this Government to justify the actions of this Government in this country, because misrepresentations and false images were not the reason why responsible people in the Western world had turned hostile towards apartheid, but the actions of this Government.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister resented the fact that I had referred to the Church Clause.

<p>There has been no reply to the allegation that the Government has not learnt the lesson of the disadvantages of economic isolation.

That is one of the lessons we had expected this Government to learn and we wonder whether they know how difficult it will be to retain control over that tempo.

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I shall deal with that later. The point I wish to emphasize is that we have to-day reached a stage in South Africa where the Native&#x2019;s tribal connections are being severed, where he has to live an individual life in an industrial environment in South Africa and where we have the position that this can happen in two ways. It can happen according to the democratic system which we uphold and for which we stand or it can follow the course of Communism and the communistic threat. At the very stage where it is so important that control should be retained over that development, particularly in the Native reserves, the hon. the Prime Minister intends withdrawing that control and depriving the Native of it. That is one of the big dangers which we can see in the actions of this Government.</p>

<p>We had statements from the other side of the House, particularly from the hon. member for Kempton Park, that it was his Government which would be able to fight Communism in South Africa. Sir, in 1948 we heard from the National Party that they were the people who would throttle Communism, they would show us how to combat Communism. In spite of that, after they had been in power for four years we were told by the then Prime Minister, Dr. Malan, that the position was worse than it was in 1948 when they took over.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I readily admit that. After 14 years of Nationalist government the position has greatly deteriorated because they haven&#x2019;t the vaguest idea how to combat Communism in South Africa. That was the reason why I accused the hon. the Minister of Justice of placing liberalism on the same plain as Communism. What did I get from him? I read that he said &#x201C;The spirit of liberalism is rearing its head here in South Africa, and that is an even greater enemy than Communism &#x201D;. When I made that charge against the hon. the Minister he told me that I had obviously done a great amount of reading during the recess, but that he wished I had read a few of the books of J. Edgar Hoover, the head of the F.B.I. in America. I followed his advice and referred to one of those books. I read the following on page 97 of the book &#x201C;Masters of Deceit &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Communism is the very opposite of liberalism, liberalism means increased rights to the citizen, a curb on the powers of the Central Government, freedom of speech, religion and the press: Communism means fewer and fewer rights for the private citizen, the curtailment of freedom of speech, the press and worship of God; the state becomes all powerful&#x2014;the absolute reverse of the American tradition.</block>

<p>He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Make no mistake: Communists do not like liberalism, that is the general liberalism of Western civilization. They denounce liberals. &#x201C;Liberal block-heads&#x201D; Lenin called them. They attempt by every means to destroy <span class="col_273-274" refersTo="page_0151"/>them. The communists realize that true liberalism is a bitter enemy, a fighter for the things that Communism opposes.</block>

<p>That was one of the reasons why I deprecated the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s statement and why I attacked him. I pointed out that a South African journalist, Pieter Lessing, who has made a study of the whole position in connection with Communism in Africa, came to the conclusion that this Government was becoming an ally of Russia in its action towards liberalism. The hon. the Minister now comes along and asks for co-operation against Communism. On behalf of this Party I can give him the solemn undertaking that wherever and whenever he fights real Communism in a sensible way and on a sensible basis he will get the full support of this side of the House.</p>

<p>There remains little of importance said by hon. members opposite in connection with this matter which I have raised. Certain views have, however, been expressed in connection with race issues here in South Africa and on the Continent of Africa and I think that before I deal with those matters it will be just as well that I dispose of a few points. Firstly, during the course of this debate, and repeatedly in the past, hon. members opposite have drawn comparisons between the position in South Africa and the position in other African states; an attempt has been made to make comparisons in regard to the * policy of concessions &#x2019; as the Prime Minister has called it. I think there are two important points in that connection. The first is that the numerical ratio differs so widely that it is impossible to make a reasonable comparison. The second is that the concessions that were made in the vast majority of those African states were not made with the approval and co-operation of the local White population; they were made as a result of pressure on the part of the metropolitan powers which intended withdrawing from Africa. That applies to practically every single African state that was mentioned.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>He probably said that, but the question is who placed him along that road. Was it not Great Britain? To try to make a comparison between what happened in Southern Rhodesia and what happened in South Africa, is to make a comparison which is not true and valid. Why are the settlers in Kenya so embittered against Britain to-day? Do hon. members know that there was almost a rebellion amongst the White people in the northern provinces of the Congo when it was announced that freedom and independence would be granted to the Congo? Surely you know the trouble with the then Governor and how they bombarded him with tomatoes. No, had the position been left to the White settlers in Africa the story would have been completely different.</p>

<p>The question is, however, whether apartheid as practised by this Government, would have solved the problems of those African states. Will apartheid solve them in Ghana where there is one White man to every 1,000 non-White, or in Kenya where there is one White man to every 94 Natives, or in Nyasaland where there is one to every 329 non-Whites?</p>

<p>Does the hon. member not understand the difference between a race federation and a geographical federation? Surely we do not still have the position where some hon. members on the other side of the House believe that a federation, such as the Central African Federation, is at all similar to the race federation of the United Party? Now we are wise to the sort of propaganda which hon. members make.</p>

<p>The second point with which I still have to deal is the question which has repeatedly been asked, namely, whether the Native will be satisfied with our race federation plan. Coming from hon. members on the Government side that question sounds strange to me. Did they think the Coloureds would be satisfied when they placed them on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll? Did they think the Natives were satisfied when their representatives were removed from this House? Do they think the urban Native will be satisfied under Government policy where he will not have any political rights in the area in which he lives and will only have political rights in states which he does not know and which he will probably never see? But there is another question which I consider to be of much greater importance: Will the White people of South Africa be satisfied with the dismemberment of South Africa by this Government, once they realise fully what the plan of the Government embraces? My experience is this that the more the White people discover what this plan of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s embraces, the less will they support his Bantu policy.</p>

<from>*Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister says your partners in government decide with you whether they are satisfied. My reply is this that when it comes to the question of race relations, I do not think a policy has ever been followed in South Africa which has satisfied all the White and all the non-White races. As a result of that the most you can hope to achieve is a compromise which both sides will be prepared to support in their common interests. It is precisely because of that that we gave the assurance that before there would be any extension of the political rights of the non-Whites in a federal Parliament, the matter would be submitted to the people by way of a referendum or a general election. That was the guarantee which we gave the electorate as far as that was concerned. What guarantee has the Prime Minister given the electorate?</p>

<p>Then we find that there are still hon. members opposite who try to prove that General Smuts either had the Bantustan policy in mind or that he supported it and they relied on speeches which he made in the twenties. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) quoted a speech from which he concluded that General Smuts had moved in the direction of a Bantustan. Unfortunately, however, they forget that General Smuts always said that the Native areas must remain under the supervision of the White Parliament and that he always said that they should have representatives in this House.</p>

<p>I just want to quote from the 1948 speech, the speech from which the hon. member for Ceres also quoted. Unfortunately the hon. member stopped too soon. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In 1936, after lengthy investigation, we at long last obtained practically unanimity in Parliament amongst the nation, and we were able to assemble in happy circumstances in the political field and in that way produce the 1936 agreement, the Hertzog agreement which remains in force and to which we adhere. We see no reason to deviate from it and to change the political representation, the political rights little as they are, as far as the Native people and the Coloured people of the country are concerned.</block>

<p>The actual position is that General Smuts did not in the least think about the Bantu policy of this Government or that he had it in mind, though it can be said that to a great extent he had already moved in the direction of a race federation. Because in 1947, before the general election, he was giving the Native greater and greater control over their own affairs within their own reserves. In 1947 he made certain suggestions to the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council. Unfortunately I have those suggestions in English only&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) The Natives&#x2019; Representative Council should be enlarged and become an all-native elected body, to whom, in addition to their present functions, will also be progressively delegated by the Government an increasing measure of executive authority in respect of the development of the Native reserves. The Natives&#x2019; Representative Council will have its own officials and may have its own executive committee for this purpose;</li>

<li>(2) The local advisory boards in urban locations and Native satellite towns now arising in urban and industrial areas, will also be mainly elected and grouped into a general conference and linked up with the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council.</li>

<li>(3) Legislative, executive and taxing powers which may be entrusted by law to the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council, will be exercised subject to the authority of Parliament and government who will retain the final say;</li>

<li>(4) The general council system will be developed and will also exercise administrative functions as at present provided by the Native Affairs Act, and will do so under the general supervising power of the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council.</li>

</ol>

<p>There will thus be a general unified pattern of Native administration in which the Natives will share under the authority of the Government and Parliament. The working out of a practical plan will be done by the Government and Parliament in consultation with the provincial and local authorities, and will be proceeded with as early as possible but must inevitably take some time.</p>

<p>If you refer to that speech of 1948, Sir, you will find that he dealt further with this matter and that he discussed the further extension of the powers of the Natives&#x2019; Representative Council in connection with his own policy. In other words, he was already moving in the direction that each race should have control over those intimate matters where he would not brook interference by members of other races in South Africa. That was what he envisaged for the Native and there is not the least shadow of doubt that as far as he himself was concerned he was of opinion that the White man should retain control over those powers.</p>

<p>On the other hand the question has repeatedly been asked whether those representatives will be White or Black and for which constituencies those representatives will be chosen. Sir, I remember clearly the late Mr. Strijdom stating in a Select Committee (and he voted accordingly) that the Natives should be represented in the Senate by Natives. That was 25 or 30 years ago. The idea was that that would solve the entire non-White problem of South Africa. That is why I cannot understand the concern of hon. members opposite. The policy of our party is that Natives should be represented by Whites. We realise, however, that it is impossible to deprive them of the right of being represented by their own people for all time to come, particularly after the promises which the Prime Minister has made to the separate Bantustans.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary to pay further attention to such an argument because according to the hon. gentleman it only applies to our side of the House and not to his side, and that is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I think our suggestions contain many advantages, because they ensure that every section of the nation will have the responsibility of citizenship and because they confer rights on the individual within his own community; they will create safety for everyone and they will mean the establishment of democratic institutions throughout the community.</p>

<p>But there are other advantages as well, one of which is that South Africa will be maintained as an inseparable whole instead of being dismembered. Secondly, it is fair towards everyone because an individual, no matter his race, will be able to advance as much as his ability will allow him to and the progress of his group as a whole will be recognized and recompensed. Thirdly, it offers an immediate solution to our most pressing problems.</p>

<p>We can start with it to-morrow, we need not wait for the year 1978, or any other imaginary date which the Prime Minister sometimes has in mind when he talks in this House. It will contribute towards an immediate lessening of racial tension because it will make possible a certain measure of participation by all races in the governmental machinery at administrative as well as legislative level. It will promote social welfare, it will promote the economy because it will ensure the best possible use of our labour force. It will create a permanent respect for human dignity.</p>

<p>Compare it with the Nationalist Party and the existing position, and you will realise, Sir, that it will provide us with flexibility as opposed to the sterile rigidity of the policy of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s. I verily believe that it will ensure us friends in the world outside. I wish to add that I have confidence in the policy because it contains the best of what every section in South Africa has in mind. Those who feel that a new set-up is necessary for the non-Whites in South Africa, not only for selfish reasons, but because they feel it is an act of justice, will find expression in the application of this policy of a race federation, and those who think that they are supporting the Government because they believe that separate development contains the germ of a solution for our problems, will realise that the best which is to be found in the idea of separate development forms part of the policy of race federation. In other words, it will ensure that we progress in an orderly way. It can really give the non-Whites hope for the future and it can give the Western world reason once again to hasten to our assistance. The little experience which I have gained in life has shown me that there are two major principles which are valid in practically all circumstances and in respect of all policies in all countries. That is that there are great moral laws, such as the laws we learnt at our mother&#x2019;s knee, respect for the individual, honesty, dignity and things of that nature and secondly, we have those multitudes of economic laws. Where a policy clashes with those moral laws and with the economic laws, no matter how long it takes, that policy can never triumph. The major thing that is wrong with the policy of this Government, Mr. Speaker, is that it clashes with the moral laws of the Western world; and it also clashes with the sound economic laws as drafted by sensible economists.</p>

<p>I wish to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House declines to grant leave for the introduction of the Bill, because, <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<ol>

<li>(a) it is the first step towards the fragmentation of the Republic into separate independent States;</li>

<li>(b) it is being introduced at a time when the commission appointed to safeguard the rights of the Whites in the Transkei has not reported; and</li>

<li>(c) important groups of the Bantu population in the Transkei have not been adequately consulted.&#x201D;</li>

</ol>

<p>I want to make it clear that the opposition from this side of the House does not come because we feel that it is wrong that the Bantu population of this area should have a large measure of control of their own affairs and more particularly those more intimate subjects which affect them personally. In fact, we on this side of the House believe that it is right and proper that the Bantu in the various provinces should have control of those affairs which affect them more intimately. But we are opposed to the Bill, the long title of which we have before us, because we believe that it is part of the pattern outlined by the Prime Minister and hon. members on the Government side of the House through the years that this is to be the first step towards the ultimate fragmentation of the Republic. It is not necessary for us in this debate to determine exactly when that stage was reached in as far as the policy of the Government is concerned. We believe that this is the first step in a pattern which may rapidly lead us along a road from which it will be difficult to return. We believe that it is a step by which the Government intends to place the country in a position where we are advancing past points of no return. So far as we can see from this Bill, no point of no return will have been reached at this stage, but this is the first step and because we disagree with that policy, because we believe it holds dangers not only for the future of the Republic but for the future of Western civilization and the White group in South Africa, we believe it is right that our opposition should be noted in however limited a form at this stage. But, Sir, there is something else that worries us about this legislation, and that is that it is well known that in anticipation of this legislation a Commission was appointed to safeguard and examine the rights of the Whites in the Transkei. Certain members of that Commission have made statements indicating that the position of the Whites in the Transkei would be safeguarded for many years. Sir, that Commission has not yet made a report to the Government, so far as we know. That Commission has brought forward no recommendation, and <span class="col_283-284" refersTo="page_0156"/>despite the fact that the Government thought it necessary to appoint that Commission, despite the fact that it thought it necessary to send that Commission to the Transkei to consult with the Whites in that area as to what their position is going to be in the future, before any report has come from them, we find ourselves in the position that the Government is already coming forward with legislation at this stage. There is a third point and that is that we have not yet available to us the official report of the discussions of the Territorial Authority of the Transkei in respect of proposals made by their Recess Committee on the question of a Constitution, and we as members of the Opposition have not yet heard the official views of large sections of the Bantu population in the Transkei; we do not know what the attitude to this legislation is. We do know that the Paramount Chief of one of the most important tribes has made representations that he should be allowed to see the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development before this Bill is introduced. We understand that the hon. the Minister has not yet seen him. While he may represent a minority or while he may represent a majority &#x2014;we do not know&#x2014;the fact is that it would appear that he has not yet had the opportunity of putting his case before the Minister of Bantu Education and Development and, through him, to the Government.</p>

<p>Here again is an illustration of the attitude of the Government. It makes up its mind to go ahead with plans regardless of the feeling of the people most intimately connected. Sir, on many occasions in this House our objections to the policy which we believe will lead to separate independent states, to the dismemberment of the Republic, have been voiced. This is perhaps not the time to outline those objections here once again, but I think it must be clear to everybody who has followed Government statements and Government policies that this is the first step along that road. For those reasons we feel that our objections should be lodged, and strongly lodged at this stage in the interests of the future of the Republic and Western civilization and all those who stand for that type of civilization within the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has moved an amendment in which he makes three points. I would like to deal briefly with each one of them. He speaks first of all about the fragmentation of the Republic. This is a policy matter in regard to which the Government announced its policy some years ago and the world knows that the intention is to allow the Bantu to govern their own areas. To retreat at this stage would mean a complete reversal on the part of the Government in respect of its declared policy. That is no reason, therefore, for moving this amendment. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition speaks about &#x201C;points of no return &#x201D;. That is typical of the United Party because they are always seeking &#x201C;points of return &#x201D;. They cannot formulate a policy; they are always seeking points on which they can revert to a previous standpoint. They never have the courage of their convictions. They are always seeking an opportunity to adopt a different standpoint or to revert to one which realized that this Government has a standpoint they adopted earlier. I think it is time they and that it has the courage of its convictions and that it is not seeking &#x201C;points of no return &#x201D;.</p>

<p>We come to the second point. He mentioned a commission of inquiry into the rights of the Whites in the Transkei. I am sure that at this stage that is not a valid point because the Bill has not yet been Tabled but according to the report and as it was supplied by the Territorial Authority of the Transkei, it is very clear that the rights of the Whites there are being safeguarded. The commission appointed to investigate this matter must only investigate how the rights of the Whites can be safeguarded; it must not investigate the principle. That therefore is also no reason why there should be any delay at this stage. Provision will be made in this Bill for the safeguarding of those rights; all that concerns that commission is the question of how this must be done.</p>

<p>We come now to the third point, that there was no time for certain Bantu groups in the Transkei to put their standpoint. There was more than enough time. Last year a report was submitted to the Territorial Authority of the Transkei and that report was fully discussed by the Territorial Authority. This was done last year in May, and after May attention was given to the constitution which had to follow that report, and the Bill as it will now be introduced was again discussed by the Territorial Authority on 11 December. There was a period of eight months, therefore, in which every section of the public in the Transkei had the opportunity to express its opinion on this matter. They expressed their opinion on the matter and there was the greatest unanimity, except for one Paramount Chief and he alone voted in the minority. Even his own subordinate chiefs voted against him in this matter. Why he wants to see the Minister at this stage nobody here knows. Only he knows, but it certainly has nothing to do with the Bill. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has given no grounds at all this afternoon in support of his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from><span class="col_285-286" refersTo="page_0157"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Well, you asked what our attitude would be, and he says that that is not the same as asking whether we would accept it. Sir, the point is this: Chief Kaizer Matanzima accepts it; we do not accept it, and we do not oppose it merely because Chief Sabata is opposing it. We are opposed to a measure of this nature because we are satisfied that it would lead to the doom of South Africa. If the hon. member for Vereeniging knew anything about Chief Sabata&#x2019;s policy he would know that he does not support our policies, that he wants multi-racial states with &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; for which we do not stand. We have a pretty good idea of what is to be in this Bill although it is not before us yet, and that is so because a Bill with the same title was discussed in the Transkeian Territorial Authority but we know too that the Prime Minister made it clear in this House that he was not going to be bound by what happened at that session of the Transkeian Territorial Authority. That he would not necessarily accept a Bill which was passed by that Authority, and therefore we do not know exactly what the terms of this Bill are to be. But what we do know is that there has not been consultation on this important matter. We do know that there is consternation amongst the Bantu in the Transkei as to what is happening. The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) says that the Bantu have been consulted. The only people who have been consulted are the chiefs and the headmen and the Councillors of the Territorial Authority and the regional authorities. The Minister, and especially the hon. member for Heilbron, must know that Chief Sabata as head of the Tembu&#x2019;s is opposed to this measure and that the only public meeting which has been held to discuss this matter was held by Sabata at his great place, and there his followers, who were there in their hundreds, opposed the measure and in fact appointed a committee to draw up an alternative constitution. But what happened after the appointment of that committee? The chairman of the committee was arrested the next day, although he was subsequently released again. But how can you have discussions by these people when they see what happens to anybody who opposes the Government&#x2019;s policy? While Proclamation 400 is in force they cannot hold meetings, as the hon. member for Heilbron must know. They cannot hold meetings to protest against any measure. And what discussion was there in the Territorial Authority? A week before the Authority met, the members of the Authority &#x2014;only the members&#x2014;were handed a constitution marked &#x201C;Vertroulik/Confidential&#x201D; and nobody could see it. They were told not to give it to anybody. Nobody else could see this constitution until it was presented to that House. No Africans or Bantu or Natives&#x2014;call them what you will&#x2014;had the opportunity in the Transkei or elsewhere of voicing their opinion with regard to this constitution before it was produced in that House or when it was produced there. The Minister says that he did not arrange to see Chief Sabata before this Bill was introduced into this House. I accept that, but I want to say this to him that it was common talk in the Transkei amongst the Bantu, and the educated Bantu as well, that a meeting had been arranged and the Tembu&#x2019;s were satisfied that the Minister was going to see Chief Sabata. The impression was that a meeting had been arranged by the Commissioner-General; that he had made representations on behalf of Chief Sabata so that the point of view of the Tembu&#x2019;s could be put to the Minister. At the discussion in the Transkeian Territorial Authority there were two motions moved by important men, by Chief Sabata and by Chief Tutor the eldest son of Chief Victor Poto to have the matter delayed, to be given a chance to consult their people. That opportunity was, however, not given to them and the Minister will know that in the discussion on the clause dealing with the constitution of this new Assembly there was bitter opposition and that the opponents were only beaten by a matter of five votes, and when the voting took place, Chief Sabata and some of his followers were not present in the House. The Minister should take cognizance of that fact. I submit that we in this House, Government as well as Opposition members should be given a verbatim report of those proceedings so that we can see what the attitude of those people was and why they objected. Both Government members and we ought to know what took place at that meeting.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron says that the position of the Whites in the Transkei is going to be protected, that the Commission merely had to find ways and means of protecting their rights. But I would point out that the only information we have is contained in the Bill which was presented to the Territorial Authority, and although in the resolution passed by the recess committee there was reference to the protection of the interests of the Whites, there is not one single reference to it in this Bill which was passed by the Territorial Authority.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Where do the White traders live? Of course they live in the Bantu areas. Sir, one of the Commissioners at Umtata told the representatives of the White organization that the Whites would be protected. He said that never in the history of this country had he known any Parliament to pass legislation which did not safe guard the rights of the White people, and he said they could rest assured that provision would also be made in this legislation to safeguard the interests of the Whites. We in this House want to know what the recommendations of that commission are before a Bill is introduced in this House; we must know what protection the Whites are to be given.</p>

<p>In regard to the question of consultation with the Natives in the reserves, I say that they do not know what is happening, that they do not understand this thing and that the <span class="col_287-288" refersTo="page_0158"/>members of the Council did not understand it. There should have been consultation with the White people. Why has the Prime Minister not consulted that liaison committee of White people which he agreed to establish? Surely they are the people who should have been consulted on this matter which so vitally affects them. I say that there should be consultation with the Bantu living outside the Transkei who are also affected by legislation of this nature. There should be much more consultation before this measure is introduced here and the Bill should be published for the whole country to see, and the Nationalist Caucus should be given an opportunity of fully understanding the implications of this measure before the Government commits itself.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>We must remember very clearly what is happening here this afternoon. This is not a discussion on the principles of the Constitution Bill which we seek leave to introduce. The principles are not relevant here. The time to discuss the principles is still to come. The question here is whether or not this Bill should be introduced into this House, and we must take note of the fact&#x2014;and the Bantu of South Africa, particularly the Bantu of the Transkei will duly note&#x2014;that the Opposition does not even wish to allow a Bill to be introduced to make provision for this constitutional development. And then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition still dares to ask us whether on this road ahead, which is envisaged by this Constitution Bill, there is a point of return. By this time the hon. the Leader of the Opposition ought to know that the road of the constitutional development of a nation only moves forward. He ought to know that in the case of a constitutional development such as this, in which these Bantu have a great interest, they must at least be given the opportunity to have this Bill introduced, but the Opposition wants to have nothing to do with it. But apart from the question as to whether they will be able to see from this Bill what the constitution will look like, hon. members of the Opposition, the electorate and the Bantu, about whom they are so concerned, know what the principles are for which they are striving and which will be embodied in this Bill. What is very significant is that in the course of none of the negotiations which took place in the past and to which the widest publicity was given was there any desire or any suggestion on the part of the Bantu in the Transkei that a constitutional plan such as this should not be proceeded with. At the December meeting in the Transkei no proposals were forthcoming from any of the Chiefs, not even from the Paramount Chief whose name has been so abused here this afternoon. No suggestions were forthcoming from them that this measure should not be proceeded with. Neither was such a suggestion forthcoming at the previous discussions which were held. Hon. members ought to know that this constitutional document which will now receive our attention was preceded by a memorandum on which the recess committee was busy for some time and which was also considered by the Transkeian Territorial Authority at its meeting earlier last year. On that occasion too there was no request that this measure should not be proceeded with. Up to the present moment therefore there has been no Bantu at all who has opposed the principle and the details of this Bill and I say therefore that the Bantu will take note of the fact that the Opposition refuse to allow an opportunity to be given for their proposed constitution to be discussed further. The Opposition must of course realize that even after the introduction of the Bill into this House opportunities will still exist, for the Bantu as well, to discuss it. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the last speaker want to know when the Minister is going to meet the Paramount Chief. The attitude of the Bantu can still be ascertained on those occasions and on others. Does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and that side of the House not know that an opportunity to discuss this Bill does not mean the end of the discussion? It is the start of the discussion. This is the democratic standpoint that is adopted by the Opposition!</p>

<p>The other point mentioned by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, about which the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) was also rather concerned, was the position of the Whites there. Here I would like to assist the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. He puts the position as though the appointment of the commission of inquiry of whom Mr. Heckroodt is the chairman, was a condition attaching to the plan for the constitutional development of the Transkei. The appointment of that commission was not a condition attaching the Transkeian constitution. The Bantu did not make it a condition and least of all the Whites of the Transkei who asked the hon. the Prime Minister to have their affairs investigated&#x2014;not even they regarded it as a condition and made it a condition that the protection of their interests should first of all be investigated and settled and that only thereafter should a constitutional plan be decided upon. We all know, and the hon. member for Transkeian Territories ought to know too, that that commission of inquiry is the result rather than the reason for or condition attaching to this Transkei constitution plan. That commission to inquire into the protection of the interests of the Whites is making its inquiry in pursuance of the fact that a constitutional plan for the Transkei is going to be framed, not by way of preparation for it and not as a condition attaching to it, and hon. members ought to remember this. They must remember a further point too. The interests of the Whites in the Transkei are not going to be looked after and covered merely by the Transkeian constitution, merely by this Bill. Are those Whites in the Transkei not subjects of the Republic? Is there no Republican legislation that applies to them? Does this Government not also have duties to perform <span class="col_289-290" refersTo="page_0159"/>as far as they are concerned? Why do the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the other side see the future of the Whites in the Transkei merely in terms of the Transkei Constitution Bill? That is a completely wrong approach. Hon. members opposite must realize that the Bantu leaders in the Transkei and outside of the Transkei were indeed consulted and it is wrong to say, as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories said just now, that there was no consultation. There was consultation, but hon. members on that side must remember one thing and that is that this constitutional plan for the Transkei is a process in which the Bantu themselves took a creative part. It is not something which was forced on them from Pretoria or Cape Town. It is something in which they took a creative part. [Laughter.] Mr. Speaker, we know that organized hollow laughter of theirs. It is the technique of people without a policy. That first document which received the attention of the Government was a creation of the Bantu of the Transkei&#x2014;the committee report. Thereafter this Bill went through the Transkeian Territorial Authority and the Bantu leaders consulted their people according to their customs and their views in the case of both of these documents which they approved of&#x2014;those people whom they wanted to consult, although it may be that they did not consult the people whom the hon. member for Transkeian Territories would like them to have consulted. It is not for the Opposition to determine which Bantu have to be consulted in these matters; it is the Bantu leaders themselves, and that is what they did. They even came into the urban areas and consulted their people in the Bantu residential areas of the cities.</p>

<p>If hon. members opposite do not know, then I cannot help it, but that was done. And in the Transkei they also consulted the persons whom they wanted to consult, according to their views, and whom they felt it was necessary to consult. Of course, I know why hon. members on that side are feeling so bad. It is because they cannot dictate who the people are who should be consulted and how it should be done. I also want to say that hon. members on that side must distinguish very clearly between what the liberal Press states are the contentions and desires of certain Bantu leaders and what the desires of those Bantu leaders actually are. There is a very great difference between a true desire which is cherished by the Bantu leaders and a desire which is placed in their mouths and minds by a liberalistic Press which prescribes all sorts of things for them. The Opposition should also consider this fact because there is a very great difference.</p>

<p>I think we have all listened with a great deal of interest to what the Minister of Bantu Administration has said and it is perfectly clear from what he has said that it is the intention of the Government to hurry this Bill through Parliament and to reach a point of no return as soon as they can. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition made it perfectly clear that we have not reached that point, and it may be a long time before we reach it, but it is quite clear that it is the intention of the Government to reach that point as fast as they can, and the whole of the Bill as represented by the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister is merely to try and present a picture of a <i>fait accompli</i> merely now requiring the imprint of Parliament to make it a valid Act. But he made one or two statements which I think should be seriously challenged. He says that insofar as the resolution of the Territorial Authorities was concerned there was no objection to the draft constitution&#x2014;no formal objection.</p>

<p>I am sorry that the Deputy Minister now remains dumb because it is one of the key points in the whole of this matter. That resolution was moved and the gist of the resolution was that the matter should be referred back so as to give the members of the Territorial Authority an opportunity to discuss it with their tribesmen.</p>

<p>Sir, with your permission I want to read out the title of this Bill. The title of the Bill is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">For leave to introduce a Bill to confer self-government on the Bantu resident in or deriving from the Transkei and to provide for matters incidental thereto.</block>

<p>This is a Bill to confer self-government on people living in an area which is an integral part of the Republic of South Africa. It is part of our country. Sir, and this Bill is designed to confer self-government on them. I do not know to what extent the members of the Territorial Authority are entirely enlightened as to what the constitution which they have approved of means. I am not sure how far they know whether that constitution that they approved of has been altered before its coming to Parliament, but I can say with the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes) that the mass of the Bantu people in the Transkei do not comprehend what is proposed and what is intended by the Government in giving self-government to those <span class="col_291-292" refersTo="page_0160"/>people. But, Sir, they are not the only folk who are to be considered in this matter, quite apart from those of us here in Parliament who have to legislate, but the Bantu throughout the Republic are watching what the Prime Minister has repeatedly said is the first place where self-government will be given to one of the ethnic groups. In passing may I say that there are ten different nations involved in the Transkei and they have not been consulted. Surely when a Bill like this comes before us, the first thing the Government should have done was to have had it published and everybody interested should have been given a chance to see what it contains. We pride ourselves, and we repeat over and over again, that we will protect the rights not of the majority but of the minority. We are not even protecting the rights of the majority to-day. We do not even know what the majority thinks, let alone what any minority may think about it. We have a Bill brought to us in this form after it has been fought out behind closed doors by a small selected group, with the whole of the pressure and the influence of the Government behind their point of view which they are foisting upon the Bantu, and the Bantu have not been consulted. They do not comprehend what is taking place, and at a time when the state of emergency and the particular Proclamation which applied to the Transkei is still in existence, prohibiting the holding of meetings there, we are asked in Parliament to sit down and to pass legislation of this far-reaching character.</p>

<p>Let me come back to the point made by my hon. leader. This Bill is the first step to bring about the fragmentation and ruin of South Africa. This is the fragmentation of our homeland. It is the ruin of our country, this self-government which is being created in the Transkei. Once it has started the Government will not be able to halt the rate of progress. Hon. members opposite will have no power to stay that progress; it will be beyond their capacity. Why should we take the first fatal step, Sir, before the matter has been fully aired before all the people in South Africa, including the voters? Let the Bill which the Government proposes to put before Parliament first go to the people. Let there be ample time for consultation. I cannot imagine a matter of greater constitutional importance to our country than the Bill which is being introduced this afternoon&#x2014;we have not got the Bill yet. I cannot imagine a matter of greater constitutional importance being introduced with less preparation and less knowledge. In the few days at our disposal before the matter comes up for debate how can we acquaint ourselves with the views of the people, the millions of people, who will be affected? It is quite impossible. If the Government takes this step, Sir, then the blood of South Africa will be on the head of the Government. The step which they are taking now is a step the consequences of which cannot possibly be foreseen by any human being. All those consequences must devolve upon the Minister.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say immediately with due deference that the reasons which were advanced were a political farce, to say the least of it! One thing is very clear and that is that throughout its history our Party has followed this path. Every Prime Minister who sat in this House made the same statement, at one time or another, which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made here this afternoon, and that is that he undertakes, sooner or later, to give self-government to the Bantu in their own areas. I cannot understand the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. In one breath he says that he is in favour of self-government being given to them and in the next breath he says that it must not be given now. How must one understand such a person? All that this Bill seeks to do is to give effect to those promises which were made; because it is really an inherent desire on the part of the Government and on the part of every Bantu in South Africa, that the Bantu should be allowed to control their own affairs. We feel that this is a right which is their due. This is the first step to enable the Xhosa in the Transkei to achieve that ideal. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition now says that it means the fragmentation of South Africa into various parts. How can such a statement be made? Those Bantu areas are theirs; they were created by history. The promise was made to these people over the years that they would be given self-government in those areas. Now that we wish to give effect to that promise, the country is told that we are fragmenting the whole of the Republic. The hon. the Prime Minister has made it very clear that if they can take it so far, if South Africa reaches the stage where she has to choose between the loss of the whole of South Africa or the loss of the Bantu areas, she would prefer to retain the White area of South Africa. We hope that that day will never come. If a policy of justice and fairness is followed, if effect is given to the promises made over the years, that evil day will never dawn for South Africa. How can they now come forward with the argument that we are fragmenting South Africa? The story that they have been telling the world over the years is nothing but a fantasy and one to which the people no longer pay any attention at all.</p>

<p>In the second place the argument was used here that the commission which was appointed to look after the interests of the Whites has not yet reported. The interests of the Whites have nothing to do with this Constitution. It was not a condition attaching to this Constitution that that commission should first report. The request came from the Whites of the Transkei that a commission of this nature should be appointed to keep a watchful eye on their interests so that if sooner or later their interests were affected by this development, the problem could be solved in the proper way. The commission was not irrevocably bound to the Constitution of the Transkei. In spite of all the incitement, we have received the very good co-operation of most <span class="col_293-294" refersTo="page_0161"/>of the Whites in the Transkei. They thanked this Government and the Prime Minister for the steps that we took. They did not ask that this Constitution should not be proceeded with until that commission reported. Where do hon. members opposite get the right to pose as the spokesmen of those people in this House?</p>

<p>The third point is that there was no proper consultation. This is the old story&#x2014;that there is only one party in South Africa which has contacts with the Bantu and that is the United Party; the National Party is completely out of touch with the Bantu, according to them. Last year the Bantu moved a motion to the effect that the time had come for self-government to be given to the Transkei. That motion was publicized far and wide. A recess committee was appointed and the Prime Minister himself considered the points of view which they reduced to writing and gave them his blessing. Thereafter it was continually under discussion by the Bantu of the Transkei. There were discussions for longer than a year. If there was one thing which was generally discussed last year among the Bantu of the Transkei it was this Constitution. The accusation cannot be made against us that the people were not properly consulted. They went into it properly at the first meeting. They were given a full opportunity to consider the matter. Here and there we found one or two persons who felt that it should perhaps be postponed for a while but the vast majority of the representatives of the Transkei asked us to carry on with it.</p>

<p>Mention was made here of my meeting with Paramount Chief Sabata. He wrote a personal letter to me in which he asked me to discuss certain matters with him. I agreed to see him. There was never any condition that only he should discuss this Constitution with me and that he objected to it and so forth. There were &#x201C;certain matters&#x201D; which he wanted to discuss with me. We have this fact that all the Paramount Chiefs except Paramount Chief Sabata came to Pretoria to discuss this matter personally with the hon. the Prime Minister. He intimated that he was ill so there was probably a reason why he did not come. Afterwards, Mr. Speaker, one could not help seeing the hand of the Liberals&#x2014;and I am not so sure that it was not also the hand of United Party supporters&#x2014;in the Sabata incident No one can deny that. I want to state without fear of contradiction that if there is one Bill with the terms of which the Bantu of the Transkei are acquainted, it is this Bill. They had every chance to discuss it. They had the right to bring it to the attention of their own council and to raise objections if they wanted to. They had that right throughout. &#x2019;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if ever there was a piece of legislation which should have been published well in advance of its introduction into this House for the information of the public of this country, then this, Sir, is that legislation. It is a fundamental piece of legislation affecting the future of the Republic of South Africa and its boundaries. I do not know whether I understood the hon. the Minister correctly. I believe, however, that I did. One of the points which was made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition was that this legislation would lead to the fragmentation of the Republic. And the hon. the Minister in this regard said&#x2014;I wrote his words down&#x2014; &#x201C;daardie kwaaie dag sal nie kom nie &#x201D;.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, &#x201C;sal nooit kom nie&#x201D;. He said that &#x201C;daardie kwaaie dag sal nie of nooit kom nie &#x201D;. I understood the hon. the Minister when making that point to say that he believed it would not come. Now, if that is so, Mr. Speaker, I find myself simply unable to understand the words of the hon. the Prime Minister who referred to that very matter earlier during the session and referred, Sir, to the fact that it was the deliberate policy of the Government that that would come about. We now find the Prime Minister being contradicted by his own Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. In other words, the Minister hopes that the day when those areas will be separated from the Republic of South Africa will not come. I want to ask the hon. the Minister in all honesty how he can say that to this House in view of what this House has been told and the Minister&#x2019;s own statements in this regard in recent times. I simply fail to understand what the hon. the Minister meant when he said that unless it is part of a campaign to lull the people of this country into a false sense of security while the hon. the Minister goes forth with a policy of which dismemberment is a part, a policy which this side of the House regards as one of the most dangerous policies&#x2014;the most dangerous legislation&#x2014;which has ever been introduced into this House. The hon. the Minister remains silent. I can only assume, therefore, that I understood him correctly. I will say that the hon. the Minister owes an explanation to this House as to what he meant by those words.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister complains that the introduction of this matter should be opposed by this side of the House. We regard it as our bounden duty to oppose this legislation even at this early stage, particularly in view of the points made by my hon. leader and others that the Government, although it indicated that legislation was coming, had not made it known before now. It was not made known to some of the people who are as <span class="col_295-296" refersTo="page_0162"/>directly affected by it as the rest of South Africa, I can only express the hope that on second thoughts the hon. the Minister will agree to withdraw the motion before the House. This legislation is of such importance that it should definitely have been published well in advance so that the public&#x2019;s reaction to the legislation could have been obtained&#x2014; both that of the people in the Transkei and of those in the rest of the country. Because I feel that we are all equally interested in this fundamental piece of legislation.</p>

<p>I think I heard the hon. the Deputy-Minister correctly to say that this was the beginning. That is just what is concerning us. This is the beginning of a course of action which, in terms of this legislation applies to the Transkei. People must realize, if this Government is not removed from power, it will be applied not only in the Transkei but will be applied in Natal, in the Orange Free State and in the Transvaal. In these circumstances I would think that this country, as well as the Opposition in this House, are entitled to ask the Government not to proceed with legislation of this nature at this stage; to withdraw this motion; to publish the legislation so that all can see what it means. So that all those interested will have an opportunity&#x2014;and I maintain the whole country is interested&#x2014;of making their views known to the Government. I wonder if the hon. the Minister could give that answer now, because if not, we can only assume that he desires to rush this legislation through the House as quickly as possible before the public of this country wakes up to the dangers which are inherent in legislation along the lines which the Government has indicated.</p>

<p>I submit again that it is the plain and bounden duty of the hon. the Minister and the Prime Minister to take this course. It is utterly wrong that legislation of this fundamental character should be introduced so early in the session without prior notice and with the known fact that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to put this legislation on the Statute Book as early as possible. I repeat, Sir, that with legislation of so fundamental a character, it is the duty of the Government at least to give the voters of this country the opportunity of letting the Government know what they think of the line which the Government is taking and the legislation which it proposes to put forward. The hon. the Prime Minister made it quite clear that, as far as his supporters were concerned, the line of policy now being followed by the Government, was different from that followed over the past years. The Government&#x2019;s duty is clear and I hope they will do their duty.</p>

<p>One wonders when the Opposition will learn to do a thing timeously, to protest timeously, to raise their voice timeously. The Opposition is pretending this afternoon that the contents of the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Bill are not known at all. The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) knows that everyone who is interested in South Africa and the development in the Transkei is <i>au fait</i> with the principle of the Bill of which the hon. the Minister has given notice this afternoon. There is not a newspaper in the country which has not made the principles and the contents of the Bill known to the public. In other words, White and non-White are <i>au fait</i> with its principles. Does this Bill not owe its existence to a resolution which was passed some time ago in the Transkei? Have hon. members opposite completely forgotten that it was specifically requested? Besides the fact that this Bill is a continuation and practical implementation of the policy which we have been propounding for so many years, it is also before us at the request of the Transkeian territories. The people who are interested in it asked for it. The hon. member for Germiston (District) is worried and he wants to know the contents of it. He can very easily ascertain its provisions. If the motion of the hon. the Minister is adopted, the hon. member for Germiston (District) and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will have an opportunity of taking the Bill to the country and discussing its details. Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and other hon. members of the other side can hold their protest meetings. Both the Bantu and the Whites in this country are greatly interested in this Bill. The Bantu have already discussed the principles of it with the Bantu authorities and accepted them. This is the most important part of the whole transaction because the people who are most concerned with it are the Bantu themselves. They have already adopted the principles as well as the details. So far not one single objection has been forthcoming from them. Do you know what is also of great importance, Mr. Speaker? The contents of the Bill have also been made known to the White people throughout South Africa and thus far, in spite of the allegation of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that it will bring about the fragmentation of the country, we have not received one single protest from the Whites in the country.</p>

I am not talking about the protest meetings which took place under the auspices of certain mayors when only 15&#x00BD; people where present. One has that type of protest. I say that the sooner the motion is adopted, the sooner the country becomes <i>au fait</i> with its principles and details, the better. If what the hon. member for South Coast seeks to suggest does exist, namely, a fragmentation of South Africa, I am perfectly sure that if the White people come to the same conclusion as the hon. member for South Coast, we are going to have a tremendous protest in this country. I would also make so bold as to say that we challenge them to hold protest meetings against this measure in the White areas as soon as the contents of the Bill are known. Then the hon. member for South Coast and <span class="col_297-298" refersTo="page_0163"/>his colleagues will realize for the umpteenth time that in regard to this problem that we are solving in a constructive manner, that stigma which they are trying to attach to us in the eyes of the world can be removed.</p>

The idea was that a commission of inquiry was to be appointed to inquire into the whole question of the financial relations between the Central Government and the provinces, and in anticipation of their report this temporary arrangement would hold good. Such a commission was appointed and made its inquiry and the commission expects to be able to submit its report during the second half of this year. Unfortunately, however, the temporary arrangement which we made lapses on 31 March this year, and it is, therefore, necessary for the duration of this temporary arrangement in respect of subsidies to be extended for a further period of two years. This will ensure that when the report appears it can be properly considered and that legislation can then be framed in conformity with the resolution which will be taken in pursuance of the report.</p>

<p>We are asking for a period of two years, but that does not necessarily mean that this temporary arrangement will continue for the full two years. If, before the end of the two years, and after receipt of the report and the introduction of the legislation which may flow from it, legislation can be adopted, then this arrangement will, of course, be revoked. We want to be on the safe side, however, and therefore we are asking for an extension of the duration of this temporary measure to 31 March 1965.</p>

<p><span class="col_299-300" refersTo="page_0164"/>The various provinces have been informed of this idea. It has been known to them since August of last year and, in the meantime, in addition to the statutory provision which we have for subsidies, we still have <i>ad hoc</i> arrangements from year to year when a good case can be made out. The purpose of this legislation is, therefore, merely to extend the temporary arrangement to 31 March 1965.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it has always been my aim, ever since I assumed office as Minister of Finance, to bring about reforms in our tax system. The basic principles of that system remained untouched for many years, and the first important step in the direction of reform was the introduction in 1960 of a system of bloc rates and the abolition of super-tax.</p>

<p>The Bill before the House to-day introduces a more radical change than ever before, namely the P.A.Y.E. system. This is, without doubt, the most important and far-reaching piece of tax legislation ever presented to this House since income-tax was introduced in this country almost 50 years ago. Now I can very well understand members saying that the best possible reform I could introduce would be the abolition of income-tax altogether. Be that is it may, I am afraid that in the modern world in which we are living, with more and more demands on the state for expenditure, everybody wanting to get something, that can only be a pipe-dream. I know it lies very close to the heart of many members, but I am afraid they will have to dismiss it&#x2014;that particular type of reform in which one would say to income-tax, if one had to write an epitaph on it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nothing became it so well in life as its departure therefrom.</block>

<p>That, I am afraid, is out of the question.</p>

<p>The decision to introduce P.A.Y.E. was not lightly taken, and the system we propose to introduce has been designed after the study of similar systems in force in other countries.</p>

<p>The principal change which the system will bring about will be the change-over from the system of collecting taxes in arrear to collection out of current income. Previously tax was assessed and paid after the close of the year in which it was earned. In future it will be collected before the close of the year in which the income was earned. It is not my intention, Mr. Speaker, to explain in detail the mechanics of the system and I will confine my remarks to the more important aspects of the system and the advantages which will flow from its introduction.</p>

<p>It might be as well at this juncture, to refresh our memories in regard to the history of the project since the proposals by the Commissioner for Inland Revenue were first published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> on 12 January, last year. Hon. members will recollect that these proposals were referred to a Select Committee. Extensive evidence was taken from representatives of all types and classes of taxpayers and the Select Committee issued its report on 23 May 1962. The report recommended the introduction of the system and the revision of the original principles in accordance with the principles accepted by the Select Committee and the republication of the revised proposals for general information.</p>

<p>In June 1962, during the debate on the Income Tax Amendment Bill, I advised the House that the Government had decided to accept the Committee&#x2019;s recommendations and the revised proposals were published in a draft Bill after the close of the session in the <i>Government Gazette</i> on 31 August last.</p>

<p>The publication of the draft Bill brought forth further submissions and suggestions and the Bill now before the House incorporates a number of those suggestions. In addition my department has made a number of alterations in the light of experience gained from its discussions with interested bodies of taxpayers and from numerous discussions within the department itself.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, I can fairly say that this is not a piece of hasty legislation, and that the public has had ample opportunity to study those proposals, if they so wished, before the introduction of this Bill.</p>

<p>Numerous benefits to the country as a whole will flow from the system and the first, and perhaps the most important, is that tax will be collected out of the income as and when it is earned. Not only will the State benefit considerably from the speedier collection of its revenue and the more even flow into its coffers but the taxpayer, and more especially the employee, will derive considerable benefit from the fact that he will no longer be faced with a large tax bill at an awkward time of the year and that he will be relieved of many tax worries. While it has always been expected that a taxpayer should make timeous provision for his tax, it has been the sad experience of my department that in the majority of cases no provision whatsoever was made and in many instances collection had to be effected through the courts or by means of garnishee orders which often led to ill-feeling between the taxpayer and the Receiver of Revenue or between the taxpayer and his employer.</p>

<p>Tax defaulters who in the past have evaded their responsibilities in one way or other, will <span class="col_301-302" refersTo="page_0165"/>no longer find this practical and once the new system is introduced, I feel sure that it will go a long way towards providing a more settled and contented labour force in the country.</p>

<p>The self-employed man and the smaller company will also benefit under the new system. They will have to review their position at regular intervals and this will assist them in the planning of their ventures and their financial commitments.</p>

<p>The farmer too will have good cause to bless the new system, for in his case probably more than any other we have the phenomenon of fluctuating income. So often under the present system the farmer has found himself in the unhappy position of having to pay the taxes on the very high profits of a past year out of the small or even non-existent income of the current year. The proposed system will avoid the occurrence of this as the tax will be paid out of the income as and when it is earned.</p>

<p>From what I have said it will be quite evident that a further important benefit to the country as a whole will be the curbing of inflationary trends. Failure to make provision for payment of taxes has meant that the money which should have been set aside for this purpose, has been used for other purposes, very often without regard to the financial difficulties which might result. Under P.A.Y.E. this money will no longer be left in the hands of the taxpayer to give him an exaggerated picture of his financial position and will keep his spending within his means.</p>

<p>At present the Treasury receives the bulk of its income during the period September to March, with the result that during the valley period, April to August, it is often found necessary to raise short-term loans to carry out the State&#x2019;s normal functions. With an even flow to the coffers throughout the year under P.A.Y.E. the need for these temporary loans will disappear and that will mean a considerable saving of interest.</p>

<p>Tax redemption certificates will no longer be required and the administration costs incurred in connection with the sale and redemption of these certificates and the annual charge for interest will fall away. The tracing of taxpayers will be facilitated and the losses from the write-off of irrecoverable tax will be reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>The additional cost of the scheme will be more than covered by these savings and the increased collections of tax.</p>

<p>I stated earlier on that P.A.Y.E. would curb inflationary tendencies, but at the same time I am convinced that the introduction of the system will benefit the trading community. In the past there has always been heavy demand for payment of taxes towards the end of the year which has limited the spending power of the wage-earner just before the festive season when the general tendency is to spend more freely. Traders have complained that their sales have been adversely affected and that they have had to wait for payment of their accounts until the Revenue Department&#x2019;s demands had been satisfied first. In future the average wage earner or salaried person will know that the amount in his weekly or monthly pay-packet is his to spend without the State demanding portion of it at a later date. No longer will he have to utilize his year-end or holiday bonus for payment of his taxes&#x2014;it will now be available for the purpose for which it was intended.</p>

<p>From all accounts the festive season just ended has proved a bumper season for the trader. This was anticipated, namely that the &#x201C;tax holiday&#x201D; provided in the Bill would make available to those prudent taxpayers who always made provision for payment of their taxes an amount estimated at R20,000,000 and reports by the trading community seem to indicate that a large portion of that amount found its way into their tills.</p>

<p>That, Mr. Speaker, gives a general picture of the effect the introduction of P.A.Y.E. will have upon the economy of the country as a whole, and it remains for me to make mention of the more important provisions of the Bill. The explanatory memorandum gives the detail.</p>

<p>Clause 7 provides for the special deduction in respect of what is called the &#x201C;transition period&#x201D; following the 1962 year of assessment.</p>

<p>That special deduction will reduce to a minimum the possibility that any taxpayer will become liable, during the year ended 31 March 1964, for payment of tax on more than 12 months&#x2019; income. The 1962 year of assessment has been adopted as a practical yard-stick and it is anticipated that most cases will be dealt with under paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) of the proposed new Section 21 bis. Discretionary power has been given to the Commissioner to deal with exceptional cases but any taxpayer aggrieved by the Commissioner&#x2019;s decision will have a right of objection and appeal to the Income Tax Special Court.</p>

<p>Clause 14 introduces a new Section 89ter which will authorize the Commissioner to consolidate all amounts due by any taxpayer and the interest thereon, if any, in one single debt due to the state.</p>

<p>Clause 18 extends the general provisions of the Income Tax Act to bring the various provincial, personal and income taxes within the P.A.Y.E. scheme to enable the machinery of the Income Tax Act to be used for collection of these provincial taxes as well as the central tax.</p>

<p>Clause 31 does not directly affect P.A.Y.E., but in providing for the consolidation of debts which I mentioned a few minutes ago, it was thought expedient to tidy up the position in regard to outstanding amounts of loan levy for the years 1953, 1957, 1958 and 1959. In respect of these years there are certain taxes and consequently portions of loan levies still outstanding. These amounts consist of small sums due by taxpayers who have had difficulty in paying their taxes. They do not represent accruals of tax as they must be refunded with interest after five years. It is proposed to discharge these amounts of levy and consolidate only those amounts which represent tax.</p>

<p><span class="col_303-304" refersTo="page_0166"/>The proposed Fourth Schedule contains the working provisions of the scheme and I will deal shortly with the more important of these provisions:</p>

<p>Paragraph (1) contains the definitions necessary for the scheme. These are self-explanatory and need no special comment. I would like, however, to direct the attention of hon. members to the definition of &#x201C;remuneration&#x201D; which is important.</p>

<p>Paragraph 13 makes provision for the strict control of employees&#x2019; tax certificates. It will be appreciated that these certificates could lead to loss of revenue if they got into wrong hands and consequently strict control is essential.</p>

<p>Paragraph 18, sub-paragraph (2) gives certain farmers, fishermen and diamond diggers the option to elect not to be provisional taxpayers. The right to elect does not, however, extend to companies which carry on these operations. The South African Agricultural Union has, I am informed, advised its members not to elect to remain outside the scheme. The consensus of opinion is that in view of the very liberal concession which requires a farmer, fisherman or diamond digger to make only one estimate and only one provisional tax payment each year before the last day of his financial period for that tax year, there is little justification for permitting the exercise of an option to remain outside the scheme. The Select Committee recommended that the option should be given not only to persons who at 28 February 1963, carried on the operations of farming, fishing or diamond digging, but also to all persons who after that date commence to carry on such operations. It is considered that that recommendation goes too far and the original paragraph of the draft Bill has been changed, in paragraph 18 (2) to restrict the right of election to persons who as at 28 February 1963 were carrying on farming, fishing or diamond digging operations and to those who commence such operations between that date and 30 June 1965. This will enable those persons who have made arrangements to commence farming, fishing or diamond digging operations during the next two-and-a-half years approximately and who may be committed financially in respect of those arrangements, to elect to remain outside the scheme if they wish so to do. The number of taxpayers who remain outside the scheme will then gradually diminish over the years. Basically, the scheme is intended to cover the whole body of taxpayers and there does not seem to be any good reason why a small section should be entitled to remain outside its walls for all time. In the draft Bill it was also provided that any person who had elected not to be a provisional taxpayer could, even though his main source of income ceased to be derived from farming, fishing or diamond digging, continue to be a person not required to make provisional tax payment in respect of his main source of income until such time as he ceased to carry on farming, fishing or diamond digging operations. It is also considered that such a concession is unwarranted and paragraph 18 (3) authorizes the Commissioner to require such a person to become a provisional taxpayer. Such change in circumstances (that is when his farming no longer is the main part of his income) will operate only after the Commissioner has, in the exercise of a discretionary power come to the conclusion that the person concerned is unlikely to derive his taxable income wholly or mainly from farming, fishing or diamond digging. Any such decision of the Commissioner is made subject to objection and appeal.</p>

<p>Paragraph 28 deals with refunds of tax where the employee&#x2019;s tax deducted or provisional tax paid on estimate exceeds the amount finally assessed.</p>

<p>Persons who are not provisional taxpayers, that is employees, will be automatically entitled to a refund of any excess. In the case of provisional taxpayers, however, refunds will not be automatic, as the tax account will normally be in credit and there are accounting difficulties connected with the use of the computer which render automatic refunds impracticable.</p>

<p>As the payment of provisional tax depends upon self-assessment and as deductions of employees&#x2019; tax are taken into account in determining the amount of their payment, it is improbable that there will be many over-payments, but if there should be, this will be carried forward for set-off against the next periodical payment.</p>

<p>But the provisional taxpayer can submit an application for a refund where special circumstances exist and the Commissioner will consider the application in the light of the circumstances, and if he is satisfied he may make a refund; i.e. after application has been made. The original proposal of the Select Committee envisaged automatic refund in all cases, but that, as I have said, is impracticable by reason of the computer mechanics. It is my view, Sir, that the introduction of the system envisaged in this Bill will be to the benefit of all citizens and to the country as a whole, and I wish to pay a tribute to the Commissioner, Mr. M. J. Wells, and to all the members of his Department, for the painstaking care with which they have laid the foundations of this scheme, as well as to the Select Committee and members of the public who have co-operated so generously in revising and improving this legislation. I trust that the Department will receive the fullest support from all sections of our population, particularly during the first difficult years of administering the law. From the public I ask patience during the time of teething troubles. From my Department I ask consideration during this necessary period of adaptation. I move.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has paid a tribute to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue with which this side of the House would like to associate itself. Those of us who have had contact with him over the years know that in him the State and the public have lost a most conscientious and able public servant, and we wish him well in his <span class="col_305-306" refersTo="page_0167"/>job if he sets up as an income tax consultant, where I am sure he will be much in demand.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has made out a case this afternoon for this Bill being generally acceptable to the country. I think he has made out a case for believing that the principles of the Bill are generally acceptable. As he has said, it has been before the country in one form or another for some time. It was before a Select Committee for many months, during which time almost every public representative body gave its evidence and mentioned its difficulties and pointed out what it believed to be the shortcomings in the draft proposal which the Committee was examining. As the result of that, I think I can say that all those public bodies, agriculture, commerce, industry and the mines, conceded that the principle of paying while you earn was a good one, and they all indicated that their members were capable of administering such a system, and of course the workers&#x2019; associations, the Railways and the trade unions, also gave the idea their blessing. As the result of the work of the Select Committee the Bill to which the hon. the Minister referred was. drastically amended to meet as many points as could be brought up and discussed with the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. It was published in August, as the Minister has said, and we know that since that time representations have been made to the Department. As far as I know, there have been no noticeable reactions against the Bill itself. We know that there has been a very large measure of consultation between the Department and the various bodies like the Accountants&#x2019; Society, as a result of which there seems to be general agreement by the people who have to administer this Bill that in the long run it can and should be done.</p>

<p>The proposals in the main part of the Bill to which the Minister referred are mostly administrative or almost consequential on this system being adopted. There are one or two matters which have been brought into the Bill which were not recommended by the Select Committee. There is the one to which the hon. the Minister referred in regard to the farmers&#x2019; right to opt out of the scheme ceasing after 1965. Personally I cannot see why that should be necessary. If this scheme works I believe that by 1965 there will be very little desire on the part of any section of the community to opt out of the scheme. If it does not work, of course one does not see why they cannot retain the right which, owing to the special circumstances of the farming industry, the Select Committee thought they should have.</p>

<p>You always have cranks.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I think the powers given to the Commissioner are quite wide enough to allow him to deal with cranks, and I am not talking about cranks now. I am talking about the basic rights of the taxpayer. Certain rights have had to be curtailed and even taken away in the interest of the country at large, but this particular right is one which the farmer should retain. I know that even if the farmer is a provisional taxpayer, very great concessions have been made in respect of him, which I believe will meet his difficulties. I think we will find in due course that the farming community as a whole will come into this scheme, but I do not see any point in now holding out the threat to them that in future they will not have the choice.</p>

<p>Another matter the Minister referred to in his speech was the question of repayment to provisional taxpayers of over-payments. The Select Committee recommended that if a taxpayer in good faith, whether he is a provisional taxpayer or anyone else, overpaid his income tax under this system, he should automatically be entitled to a refund of the credit which stood to his account. But now the Minister tells us that owing to the mechanics of the computer system it will not be possible for the provisional taxpayer to receive that refund. I do not think I can accept that. When the computer, as I understand it, produces the assessment, and there is an over-payment by the taxpayer, by an employee, he will automatically with his assessment receive a cheque for any over-payment he has made during the year. I have to accept that a similar process is not possible in the case of the provisional taxpayer, but I cannot accept that because the computer cannot produce the cheque on the dot the Department is incapable of, within a very few weeks, refunding any amount standing to the credit of the taxpayer. The Minister in the memorandum which was given to us&#x2014;not the White Paper but the memorandum &#x2014;said he did not think that there would be very much in the way of over-payment by provisional taxpayers, although he did not give the reason. That may be so, Sir, but I have not the slightest doubt that in the hundreds of different cases that may arise there will be cases of provisional taxpayers who do overpay their income tax in good faith by substantial amounts. The Bill now provides that normally if you cannot be credited with that amount it will be dealt with at the next tax assessment, which may in 12 months&#x2019; time. It also provides that you may apply to the Commissioner and that the Commissioner may agree to some arrangement being made whereby it can be taken off at the next provisional payment. I must say that I think that this is being dealt with in rather a departmental fashion, if I may put it that way. The Minister seemed to reveal that temporarily, at any rate, he will have a soft spot in his heart for the taxpayer. I do not know how long that will last, but while it lasts&#x2014;and I hope it will last until we reach the Committee Stage of this Bill&#x2014;I hope he will at that stage accept an amendment to that provision establishing the right of the provisional taxpayer to a refund of any additional tax being made. Just how that refund is to be made is a matter of administration, but the principle that a man who has overpaid his tax is entitled to a refund should, I think, be clearly inserted in this Bill.</p>

<p><span class="col_307-308" refersTo="page_0168"/>I have said that generally speaking we agree that this Bill is acceptable to the country and to us and that we shall not oppose the second reading. The main part of the Bill, the meat of the Bill, of course, is in the schedule and there is one point I wish to raise there. I can never understand why the schedule of a Bill should always be printed in such small type that no one can read it. It may be some relic of the past; I do not know, but in this particular case where the whole esesnce of the Bill is contained in a schedule of several pages I cannot see any reason why it should be printed in this way, and I should like the Minister to consider that point and to take steps to obviate that type of thing in future.</p>

<p>Another point in regard to the schedule is that it is always customary in the Committee Stage to put the schedule as a whole, and I should like to be assured by the Minister that when we come to this schedule in the Committee Stage it will be taken paragraph by paragraph.</p>

<p>Well, we are talking about principles, which is always a pleasant thing until you have to try to put your principles into practice, and it is when you talk about putting this Bill into practice that certain doubts do arise. Income-tax is always a very involved subject. The Income Tax Act is amended every year to remedy anomalies which have emerged during the course of the year, and after all these years we still have not got to the stage where loopholes do not have to be closed up every year. As the hon. the Minister said, this is no ordinary Income Tax Amending Bill; this is a revolution. It is a revolution for the taxpayer, as well as for the tax collector. The Minister referred to decimalization. People have said that decimalization works so smoothly that there is no reason why this should not work just as smoothly, but this is a very different matter. Financial houses and the banks saw to it that decimalization worked smoothly. I happened to look at the money in my pocket just before lunch and found I had nine coins, and eight of them bore the head of Queen Elizabeth and were dated well before the date of decimalization, but as far as I know I am not guilty of a criminal offence in still carrying coins given to me as change which are not decimal coins. There is no criminal implication, but here it is a very different thing. This schedule lists 13 offences, for every one of which the taxpayer is liable to a fine of R400 or six months&#x2019; imprisonment, or both. As a matter of fact, there are thousands of criminals walking about the country at present who have not been fined R400 or given six months&#x2019; imprisonment, simply at the discretion of the Commissioner, as far as I know, because they have all been liable since September. It just shows that in this instance the Commissioner has held his hand. But supposing the Commissioner had exercised his authority and really started prosecuting people, hundreds of thousands of people, for the offence of not registering as employers, just imagine what the position would have been. So much depends on having a Commissioner who does not exercise the powers he has. These difficulties are practical difficulties. We on this side thought when we were on the Select Committee that it would be much better if this system was not introduced until the beginning of 1964, and that it should be introduced into the House now, in the beginning of 1963, and discussed fully, and that 1963 would have been a suitable time really to train the people of the country in the new system. But we were over ruled and I still do not quite know why and what the hurry was. The then Commissioner for Inland Revenue was very insistent, but having committed the hon. the Minister and the Government to this new system he has promptly retired and left the Minister with a baby which may or may not prove to be the flourishing infant he thinks it will be.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The baby will be born only on 1 March.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and it may even be stillborn. But as I say, these difficulties arise and I want to warn the Minister that I do think we were right and that the responsibility for what may happen in putting this Act into operation will be his.</p>

<p>I think there are three main difficulties which confront the country. The first is in regard to the employers. I do not know whether all hon. members have seen this table of deductions. It is a fearsome-looking thing, not very well printed. It is also in small print. It is a booklet of instructions and a table of deductions telling employers what to deduct every month from the employees&#x2019; wages. It seems to me that it is a difficult thing, especially for the small employer, both Whites and non-Whites, and we have to remember that there are thousands of non-White employers in the country to-day, many of whom have not even seen this book, let alone understood it, but who are all expected to start using it in less than one month&#x2019;s time, under threat of penalties. From all accounts&#x2014;the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&#x2014;there are thousands of these employers who are not even registered with the Department yet. I imagine that if they are not registered they will certainly not get the little book of instructions telling employers what to do. The Department and the Press, I know, have been working very hard endeavouring to spread the information and trying to help to prepare the way for the introduction of this new system, but I think the Minister must agree with me that here, within a month of this Bill coming into force, the full impact of what it really entails is very far from having been felt or understood by a very large section of the people who will be affected by it. Talking of that deduction book, another point arises. If the Minister, when he introduces his Budget, reduces the income-tax, that book will be completely useless. There is no provision in the Act for new books to be issued.</p>

<p>I would not believe that even of this Minister. But the fact is that the small employer who has been sitting up at night studying this book may find in a month&#x2019;s time that all his labour has been wasted. I also raise this point that one hopes that the Minister will not use this as an excuse for not reducing the income-tax when he introduces his Budget. The country has been more or less told to expect a reduction in taxation by the Prime Minister, and if the Minister were to come along with this excuse, that owing to this new system of taxation he cannot reduce income-tax this year, he will be more unpopular than Ministers of Finance expect to be, and usually are, because even the Minister will agree with me that if the country has to choose between a reduction in income-tax and this Bill there will be an overwhelming vote in favour of reduction in the income-tax. So I hope the Minister will give us an assurance on this point, that when he comes to frame his Budget, the question of what he does in regard to income-tax will not in the least be affected by anything contained in this Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I know the hon. the Minister is a most ingenious gentleman, but I am only dealing with this particular excuse now. The second difficulty, of course, is in regard to officials. Are there enough officials trained yet to handle this great changeover? There will be tens of thousands of queries from every section of the community, employers, farmers, and lawyers who do income-tax work, particularly in the country, and I know that the Minister will tell us that his Department has been giving courses to its officials, and I am not suggesting that they have not done their very best, but when you think of the position throughout the country and of the tens of thousands of people, particularly in the country districts, miles away from a revenue office, who will be affected by this and who will come along asking for information and instructions and help, I am very doubtful whether the Department and the people who do its work, where there are no actual officials of the Department itself, have had an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the queries they will have to deal with. The Department of Inland Revenue will, at any rate for the next year, it seems to me, have to act not so much as the guardians of the public purse, not as policemen, but as tax consultants who know the answers and who can act as the taxpayers&#x2019; friends.</p>

<p>The third difficulty in practice is the enormous powers which are being given to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. In most every clause in the schedule there are references to the discretion of the Commissioner, the directives which he may issue, and the power he has to deal with almost every phase of this Bill. We know that it is inevitable that the Commissioner should have a measure of discretion. I am not worried so much about the measure of discretion, but what worries me more is in view of the enormous amount of discretion and the directives he will be called upon to issue in the next year or two, whether he can possibly do it. Can he possibly hope to exercise the discretion fully and in such a way that quick decisions will be possible and that the scheme will be able to work smoothly? At the moment, of course, there is no Commissioner for Inland Revenue at all. I wonder whether the Minister in his reply to this debate should not take the opportunity to tell the country who the new Commissioner will be. It is a bit queer that within a month of this colossal task being undertaken by someone who must be a most responsible and experienced man, as I have no doubt he will be, the country still has no idea as to who he will be.</p>

<p>Sir, our view in short is simply this, that we agree in principle with the idea of paying as you earn. We think it is going to be rushed. We think it is unfair to the taxpayer, as well as to the Department, and we think that as the result of this rushing there will be a year of difficulties and confusion, and that the Minister is solely responsible for any confusion and difficulty that may arise. We shall point some of them out in the course of this debate and it may be that we will move amendments in the Committee Stage, and we do ask the Minister to give the most explicit assurances. He has given an assurance in his speech, but we ask him to repeat it. We want to be assured that this scheme will be carried out with the utmost consideration for the taxpayer and the utmost tolerance. We ask the Minister to show the same tolerance and consideration for the points of view which may be put up by members on this side of the House, and if any member puts up suggestions which are practicable we ask that the Minister should give them careful consideration and not refuse to budge, as both he and other Ministers have done in the past when they have received good advice from this side of the House. It depends on the Minister and how he handles this Bill and handles us as to whether at the end of these proceedings we finally give our approval to this Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>May I just say in the beginning that we as members of the Select Committee wish to express our appreciation to Mr. Wells for the very intensive study he made of this system now before us and for the information he gave us there and the appreciable measure of co-operation we had from him in the Select Committee. We grant him the rest he will now enjoy, although I think it is really the wrong time to shoulder Mr. Ingram, who is now acting as Commissioner and will possibly become the Commissioner, with the responsibility of acting as the gynaecologist at the birth of one of the largest babies a small mother has ever given birth to. We want to wish him every success if he should be burdened with this task, and we only hope that the matter will be dealt with successfully even though Mr. Wells is not there.</p>

<p><span class="col_311-312" refersTo="page_0170"/>I feel that I have to say something in regard to the Select Committee. We will all agree that there was a good spirit prevailing in the Committee. There was no question of party politics. It was a question of trying to learn as much as possible from the Commissioner and from the other witnesses. We learnt much in the Select Committee, and I think even the Commissioner for Inland Revenue learnt much there. He also made concessions to us on certain points. As the result of that we have a measure before us to-day which is a Government measure but not a party measure. I take it that the parties agree in the main. The principle has been accepted by both sides of the House and that enables one to speak more freely than one would otherwise be able to where one still has points of criticism. I may say immediately, for example, that I fully agree with the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) in regard to his criticism in connection with overpayments by salaried persons. I shall revert to that a little later and expand on it.</p>

<p>We have before us here a radical system of reform, and I think the House and the members of this House are to a large extent committed to accepting it. The reasons for that have been expounded by the Minister and have been rehashed so often that I do not want to deal with the reasons as to why this measure became necessary. I can only mention that on the one hand one finds advantages, whilst on the other hand one finds disadvantages. Amongst the disadvantages, broadly, I may just mention that the collection of income-tax will not become less expensive. It will be more expensive; it will cost the state more to collect it, and it will cost the taxpayer, and particularly the employers, more than in the past to ensure that the taxes are paid. On the other hand, the taxpayer will no longer be taken by surprise, as has happened hitherto, by a tax assessment at a stage when he perhaps expected it least, and in many cases at a time when he does not have the money for it. He will now be taxed systematically as he earns his income. The State will also in future no longer, during part of the financial year, have to incur large loans in order to cover its current expenditure, whilst during other parts of the financial year, again, it finds itself with surplus funds which it has to try to invest.</p>

<p>We know that many persons in the past saved systematically in order to be able to pay their taxes. There were persons who bought tax redemption certificates. There were other persons who systematically deposited money in savings accounts, in the post office savings bank and in deposit-taking institutions like building societies, etc. This type of saving which existed in the past will now fall away, and I think it would be interesting, when once the system of P.A.Y.E. is in operation, to ascertain, if it is ascertainable, how many savings accounts which existed, previously have been closed, because that would be a reflection of the number of people who systematically made provision for the payment of income-tax and for whom it will no longer be necessary to do so. The deposit-taking institutions will, under this system, in my opinion, lose a certain amount of income they enjoyed in the past. Their deposits will now decrease. There are many such cases, but the large majority of people made no provision for the payment of income-tax, and it is particularly those people who are being assisted here.</p>

<p>These considerations were so decisive in the Select Committee that we all felt that some system of current payment should be instituted, but I want to say very clearly and unequivocally that there were some of us who were not in favour of this specific system which was submitted to us. There was, for example, the feeling that one should try to reform the system of tax redemption certificates into something much more simple and something which could be exchanged at face value when the person paid his tax, and which would then be credited to the current account instead of to the Ioan account as at present. There was the feeling that it should be made compulsory. That thought was expressed, and many of us were in favour of it, but the Commissioner for Inland Revenue did not want to know anything about that. In the report of the Select Committee he also advanced arguments against such a system. The Select Committee accepted his arguments. I must say that I personally do not agree with all those arguments, but I realize that there are a number of practical difficulties in connection with this matter, and consequently we were practically forced to accept everything which is now before this House.</p>

<p>I also want to say a few words in regard to the evidence. Altogether we had 33 or 34 memoranda before us. Some of the authors of the memoranda gave evidence before us, whilst others did not. Of all of them only the Chartered Institute of Secretaries rejected the system in principle. The others all accepted it to a greater or lesser degree; in most cases accompanied by criticism on particular points, and in other cases by a plea for the exclusion of certain categories of taxpayers. The evidence was very valuable. The witnesses pointed out numbers of defects and practical difficulties in the proposals before the Select Committee, and I am glad to be able to say that the Select Committee was to a large extent able to appreciate the difficulties raised by the witnesses and to meet them in the measure before us at present. On some points we could not find a solution, and those points were referred to the Department with the request that they should be investigated. I notice that in this measure there are certain amendments which do not represent the findings of the Select Committee, but which were added later.</p>

<p>In spite of this study which was made of the whole question of a system of paying while you earn. I feel that there are still many shortcomings. and from the very nature of the matter it cannot be otherwise. It is a completely new system. It is to a large extent an experiment, and a very radical experiment, and it must necessarily still have defects. We would <span class="col_313-314" refersTo="page_0171"/>be expecting something superhuman if we expected there to be no defects in the system; we are not perfect. In the course of time many amendments will have to be made to the Bill before it can work smoothly one day. At the moment it is suffering all the pains and in the course of time it will suffer from growing pains, and it will be our task to eliminate these pains in the course of time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you will remember that I said a moment ago that this is not a party measure and I think it is our duty at this stage, before we reach the Committee Stage, to indicate certain defects and to ask that special attention be given to them before we come to the Committee Stage, in order to see whether we cannot make amendments there. The two matters I wish to raise are, firstly, the position of wage earners. The hon. member for Constantia also referred to them. The problem here is that people who are exclusively wage-earners are consistently being overtaxed from month to month, and then at the end of the tax year, after having sent in their returns, they find they have a credit with the Receiver of Revenue. The reason for this is obvious. The rebates allowed in the tables are in respect of pension contributions and in respect of children, but no deductions can be made in respect of dependants, life insurance and medical and dental services. These are deductions which in many cases may run into big amounts and in fact do so. The result is that we will find difficulty here in the case of people in regard to whom we can least afford to have trouble, namely our workers. There are more than 900.000 wage-earners who are taxpayers. Some of them also have other sources of income, but the overwhelming majority of them have only their wages which are taxable. I should say that there are at least 500,000 of them. I do not think it is right that all these people should be over-taxed. In my opinion this has always been the greatest weakness in this new system. If you study the report of the Select Committee, Sir, you will see that reference was often made to it, <i>inter alia,</i> by myself. You, Sir, have experience of your voters, just as I have. You know that these are people who to a large extent live from hand to mouth. You know how a salaried man, if he is underpaid, immediately tries to lay hands on the amount by which he has been underpaid; he does not want to wait for it because he needs it, and if he does not get it he sometimes has trouble with his wife. Therefore this is a problem which has a psychological background, and that is why I stress it again. We cannot allow a too large amount to stand over to be readjusted at the end of the financial year. It may perhaps be said that this is my personal opinion, but you can study the evidence of every witness who gave evidence before us and you will find that all of them agreed with me when we discussed this matter. I just want to quote two of them here. There is, e.g., the Gold Producers&#x2019; Committee. Hon. members will find their evidence in paragraphs 321 to 324 of the report, on page 114. The witnesses here are Mr. Mellor and Mr. Thoms. In reply to a question by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn), there is a long reply here concluding as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At any rate, there is bound to be dissatisfaction&#x2014;as is common, I think, amongst all wage-earners&#x2014;if they are overtaxed. I foresee the employers being asked to take steps to put matters right</block>

<p>The next question was then put by the Acting Chairman&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All wage-earners will be overtaxed under the proposed system although that will be repaid at the end of the financial year when a final assessment is made. Is it your opinion that mineworkers will not be satisfied with this aspect of the system?</block>

<p>The reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mineworkers tend to live from week to week and from month to month, and the long-term financial aspects of the scheme are such that the mineworkers will not want to understand them.</block>

<block name="quote">323. The Committee can take it then that, as far as mineworkers are concerned, they will accept with bad grace the fact that they have to wait for 12 months before a repayment can be made to them? Yes. (Mr. Thoms) I think that will be the reaction on the part not only of mineworkers but of all workers generally.</block>

<block name="quote">324. Even if the amount involved is very small?&#x2014;Yes.</block>

<p>Then I just briefly want to quote the Afrikaanse Handels-instituut. In reply to a question put by me, Mr. Brink, <i>inter alia,</i> replied as follows (page 252, paragraph 522)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Experience in other countries with a similar system emphasizes the fact that the worker is only interested in his &#x201C;take home pay &#x201D;. It can therefore be expected that when finding that the money at their disposal is less as a result of the fact that a few rand per month have been put aside for them for tax purposes, the workers may agitate for more wages and better salaries. As indicated, it will be even more the case if the amount deducted from the worker is more than the amount for which he will be liable. I therefore think it will be much better if the deductions can be so arranged that the employee will owe a small amount to the State at the end of the year.</block>

<p>This is clear language and it agrees with the thoughts expressed by the hon. member for Constantia and which <i>I</i> also expressed here. I feel that we cannot afford to quarrel with these people over a few rand. We urged the Commissioner for Inland Revenue to amend his formula somewhat so that the amount will be more or less the same as the amount these <span class="col_315-316" refersTo="page_0172"/>people must pay, or so that they should rather remain indebted to the State at the end of the financial year. However, he did not want to listen to this and said that he preferred making a repayment to them rather than to collect small amounts. He told us that he had a machine which would assess these people, and just as a hen lays an egg this machine would lay cheques for the amounts people have paid in in excess, and the cheques would then be posted to them together with the assessment. I now understand that this can no longer take place. I want to point out that in spite of Mr. Wells&#x2019; assurance that this machine would simply lay cheques and that the cheques would reach the taxpayers within three months after the end of the financial year, the Select Committee was not satisfied yet and it adopted the following resolution, which was worded very mildly so as not to cause a row. I quote paragraph (26) (b) (iii) of the report, on page xxxviii&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your Committee is of the opinion that the proposed system should be kept as simple as possible to avoid burdening the employer with more duties than are absolutely necessary. Every effort should be made, however, to reduce over-deductions of tax to the absolute minimum either in the law as first introduced or by subsequent amendments as the result of experience gained.</block>

<p>That is what the Select Committee recommended, and we were then under the impression that these people would receive their cheques automatically; now it appears that this will no longer be the case. This is a serious matter and I again want to appeal to the Acting Commissioner for Inland Revenue to devote his attention to this matter before we reach the Committee Stage in order to find out what can be done so that we do not create a problem for ourselves here which will later give us great difficulty. I think the evidence before the Select Committee which I have already quoted confirms that these preliminary over-payments constitute a mistake and that we should try to get away from it. I hope that the Government will devote its special attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The second matter I wish to raise here is in connection with persons who are wage earners as well as provisional taxpayers. Here we have a similar problem to some extent, although not quite. There are many members in this House who earn an appreciable income for taxation purposes here and from whom an appreciable amount will be deducted every month by the Secretary of the House of Assembly, and who have further investments returning them a smaller taxable income than the one they receive here, but still a fairly constant income. These persons have now registered as provisional taxpayers and they must get into contact with the Receiver of Revenue three or four times a year and make payments, and then they must tell the Receiver that he cannot deduct the full amount because the Secretary of the House of Assembly has already deducted a portion of the tax and paid it over to the Receiver. I want these persons to have the choice of making an agreement with the Receiver that their employers should deduct a larger amount every month than provided for in the tables and that under those circumstances they will then be exempted from making provisional payments as provisional taxpayers. In this connection I have a letter here from a person who made a study of the matter and who said, <i>inter alia,</i> that his suggestions were based on years of experience in the pay office of various educational institutions. This person makes an interesting suggestion here. I do not agree with everything he suggests, but he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In so far as the salary-earner is concerned, from whom deductions are already being made, the question of provisional payment of tax should be reconsidered. Only in the case where the extra amount exceeds R1,000 (&#x00A3;500) should the salary-earner be expected to register as a provisional taxpayer (R400 or &#x00A3;200 is slightly ridiculous these days, with all the inconvenience of paying three times a year). That will only put the taxpayers concerned up in arms.</block>

<p>The position in terms of this Bill is that the employer is compelled to deduct the amounts provided in the tables, but even though you or I should ask our employer to deduct more, he can simply refuse. At the same time, if he should agree to deduct more, and the Receiver of Revenue agrees that this may be accepted as a provisional payment, the employee can at any time again ask the employer to deduct the amount stated in the tables, and then the Receiver of Revenue is misled and he will perhaps lose revenue in certain cases. I feel that we should amend Schedule 4 somewhat. It will not amount to serious amendments. In the first place we must provide there that if the employee requests the employer to deduct more than his scheduled taxation, the employer must do so, and if he does so with a supporting letter from the Receiver of Revenue&#x2014; because I want the taxpayer to enter into an agreement with the Receiver of Revenue to the effect that he will no longer be a provisional taxpayer but that all his taxes will be collected monthly on this basis&#x2014;then the employer must be prohibited from making any changes to it without the Receiver of Revenue agreeing at a later stage.</p>

<p>And if he loses his employment?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>If he loses his employment, he must in any case obtain a certificate showing that he has been paid up to that date. It will make no difference because if he loses his employment he has already paid his tax in the form of monthly payments or an appreciable amount which he perhaps would have had to pay only three or four months later as a provisional taxpayer. I think a provision of the kind which I have now <span class="col_317-318" refersTo="page_0173"/>suggested will solve this problem, and it will save many thousands of persons a great deal of trouble, particularly a person with a private income of R400 or R600, together with an income of R3,000 or R4,000 in the way of salary. The ratio is such that it is just a burden to the person to go and register as a provisional taxpayer and then to be taxed three or four times a year and to forward the money for the tax and to submit returns. The greatest difficulty will be experienced in the case of the small amounts, but I should like to see that all persons who are wage-earners and who are also provisional taxpayers should have this choice. The choice should rest with the taxpayer, and if he wants to pay his tax in this way no obstruction should be put in his way; on the contrary, he must be encouraged to do so, and he as well as the employer should be protected by the agreement entered into, because in practice it will amount to an agreement between the taxpayer and the Receiver of Revenue, which is in turn transferred to the employer and to which the employer then gives effect. It is the easiest thing in the world for an employee and for the Receiver of Revenue to go to an employer and to say: In the case of this particular taxpayer you must deduct R25 per month extra and add it to the scheduled amount, and then we will not worry him in connection with the payment of provisional taxation. This position was also put to us by Mr. Wells. Mr. Wells told us very clearly that it could be done, and this is one of the things which influenced us in accepting the system, and I rely on this undertaking given to us by Mr. Wells in connection with that machine which lays the cheques. I feel that these undertakings should be carried out because they influenced us in regard to this whole matter.</p>

<p>I just want to read a question which was put by the Chairman (Question 87, page 28)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Receiver of Revenue cannot therefore instruct the employer to deduct tax at a higher rate from the employee&#x2019;s salary?&#x2014; (Mr. Wroth.) That is correct. The employee may, however, request the employer to deduct a larger amount.</block>

<p>That is quite clear, and it is stated in more detail in other parts of the report. I now understand that the employer need not give effect to the employee&#x2019;s instructions if he receives such an instruction.</p>

<p>I have now made the two points I wanted to make and I hope that they will receive particular attention by the Department before we reach the Committee Stage of this Bill. As I have said, this is not a party measure and consequently we can discuss matters frankly. I have done so now and other hon. members will perhaps also do so, and we are able to do it because we are dealing with a new system and we are trying to make it as efficient as possible and as acceptable as possible to the voters outside. Finally, I just want to say that I feel that we should devote attention to the few points I have raised but that we should accept the scheme as a whole and give it a chance. It will be our task to assist in improving the scheme in future from year to year, as experience teaches us, so that we will have a scheme which will be as nearly perfect as is humanly possible.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with my colleague, the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) that in the main we accept the P.A.Y.E. system. It has been welcomed by most people and I know from personal experience that very great efforts have been made by many organizations and by the Department to smoothe the road which looks as if it is going to be pretty rocky before we get this thing running properly. Most people fear that it is being rushed, and some of these fears can be removed during the course of this debate, I understand. The Minister has said that he intends that the administration will be as sympathetic as possible, but I suggest to him that he should devote a considerable amount of personal attention to this. There are one or two matters that I want to refer to. The one is, if my information is correct, a very important one and that is the position of deserted wives. This matter was brought up in Johannesburg and to my knowledge has been discussed with the Revenue authorities. It is not a question of isolated cases. The information given to me is that in Johannesburg there are from 12,000 to 15,000 women who are deserted wives. In many instances these women have lost track of their husbands altogether. In many other instances the husbands have walked out, have simply jettisoned their responsibilities&#x2014;as a certain type of man will do&#x2014;and the women have been forced to take jobs to support themselves and their children. This matter was brought to the Commissioner&#x2019;s notice and as far as I can make out the only provision made to deal with the matter is that there is to be sympathetic administration. But it seems to me that those women will still have deductions made from their monthly income. I want to limit my remarks to those women whose husbands have actually deserted them and who cannot trace their husbands. The Revenue Office may know where their husbands are but there are the secrecy provisions. The position may and will, however, arise in many instances that when and if the Revenue Department finds an erring husband, tax will already have been deducted from the wife&#x2019;s pay at a time when she needed every possible penny to look after herself and the children. I do not want to go into details. I know that the officials will say: *Oh, we can fix it all up; when we get the husband we will get the money from him and we will make a refund to the wife in due course.&#x2019; But I do not think that goes far enough. I do not see why a woman in that position should pay anything at all until it is proved that she can afford to. I am not pleading that the man should pay everything. I am pleading for the deserted wife who has a terrific battle to feed and educate her children. There are 12,000 to 15,000 in Johannesburg; heaven knows how many there are throughout the country. I say there must <span class="col_319-320" refersTo="page_0174"/>be definite provision in this Act that where a woman can prove that her husband has deserted her, she should be relieved of any tax deductions by her employer. There is no other method in which this can be handled without bringing about a lot of unnecessary unhappiness. I do not want to labour the point. I hope I have said enough to prevail upon the Minister to investigate this matter further. I hope he will agree with me that sympathetic treatment is not sufficient in these particular cases.</p>

<p>The farmers have already been mentioned and I can assure the hon. the Minister that from what I have heard recently he will hear quite a lot from them. However, I do not wish to talk about that. I do want to make a suggestion in regard to that long list of criminal offences. Anybody who has had to deal with the Department, as I have on many occasions in the past, will know that there is always sympathetic consideration. But here we are dealing with an entirely new method of collection. But when people see this long list of criminal offences&#x2014;13 I think&#x2014;they will become too paralysed with fright to help to get this thing going. I want to put forward a practical suggestion to the hon. the Minister and it is this: The Minister should state in this House that unless it is proved that there has been a deliberate attempt to defeat the Act no penalties will be imposed during the first year of its administration. I think it is a sound suggestion because there is a very great element of fear amongst the people in this regard. There were some other points which I was going to mention, but I think I will rather deal with them in the Committees stage.</p>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>We are evidently all agreed as to the principle of this Bill. The House will not expect me to say anything in that regard. We are evidently all satisfied that this new method of payment will be a good thing, for the taxpayer and for commerce and also for the Treasury. Therefore, hon. members will not expect me to say anything about that. But I want to come back to the debate as it has progressed. I just want to tell the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) that he need not commit this long list of offences. It is quite probable that no taxpayer will be able to commit all the offences mentioned in this catalogue. It is intended for different people, every one of whom is in the same position that he is in. The list is so long because there are so many people. Or rather, it is so long because there are so many facets of tax collection. I think the hon. member is quite correct in what he said about wives whose husbands have deserted them. But I think that is something we can deal with more advantageously in the committee stage.</p>

<p>I will satisfy myself with a few remarks&#x2014;I will not take up much of the time of the House about what was said by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). He says that hon. members opposite object to what he calls the over-hasty introduction of this new system. He says it would have been better and more advisable if we had educated the taxpayers during 1963 to continue with this system in 1964. I just want to make this remark in that regard: I agree with him that we should educate the people in 1963. But in any case the best method of education is to let the taxpayer&#x2014;or anybody to whom one wants to teach anything&#x2014;do the thing himself. Therefore if we were to have waited until 1964 and had used 1963 to give lectures and instruction, we would have got just as far by the end of 1964 as we will be at the end of the tax year 1963. Therefore, we are really saving a year and we are still doing what he would like. There is no over-hastiness, because we have been discussing this subject for more than a year already. He wants this educational measure not only for the taxpayer but also for our good friend the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. Because, he says, there are so many powers entrusted to the Commissioner, so many discretionary powers, that he will possibly not be able to exercise all these discretionary powers in the time at his disposal. Now the hon. member for Constantia and hon. members on his side always object to discretionary powers being granted to officials and to Ministers. We have already become accustomed to that and, therefore, it was really a pleasant surprise to-day to learn from him that he realizes that there must be certain discretionary powers; all he is afraid of is that the Receiver of Revenue will not be able to exercise all of them. The Receiver of Revenue himself said, and gave himself this testimonial, that he was quite capable of doing this work. In any case, that is what he intimated to the Select Committee. I am the last one to say, if he gives himself such a testimonial, that he is not capable of doing it. If he, therefore, says he will be able to do all these things, it is not for this Parliament to tell him that he will not be able to do it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia also objected to the agreement we arrived at on the Select Committee that all farmers, diggers and fishermen will not always have the choice as to whether they want to fall under this system or under an amended old system. His remark was that if the system is good it is good for everybody, and if it is not good there is no reason for depriving them of that choice. In this regard I want to make only two remarks. In the first place, if the hon. member for Constantia bases the existence of this choice on an agreement, it affects only the people who live at the time when they share in that agreement. Those who come later have, according to the rule of reasonableness, no right whatever to share in the privileges arising from that agreement. We now postpone it to 1965. There is no reason for postponing it any longer for the sake of new people who may come in. If I understood the Minister correctly the people who enjoy this privilege are entitled to it until the day they die. There is a very good reason why we have to do it this way, and that is that any exceptional case always causes trouble in the automation or in the mechanical bookkeeping. It also causes extra expenditure and one of the primary principles of taxation is that the collection of a tax should be as economical as possible. The more deviations there are from the Act, the more <span class="col_321-322" refersTo="page_0175"/>expensive it becomes. I do not agree with the Minister that it is only cranks who want to do so; I prefer to say that it is advisable to have uniformity. The sooner we have uniformity the better. Because there are certain people who always believe that the old method is the best we are postponing it until 1965, and thereafter there will no longer be any choice for these people. As I know the Minister, and as I have learnt to know the Receiver of Revenue, if we are able to make out a case in 1965 that these new people who will become farmers, fishermen and diggers must also share in that benefit, I think it will certainly fall on sympathetic ears.</p>

<p>A final point. The hon, member for Constantia does not agree with the Minister, and says that the Receiver of Revenue will not be able, or that it will be very difficult, to make repayments to people who have a credit with the Receiver of Revenue. What he really says is the taxpayers who earn a salary immediately get their money back if they have made an over-payment, but the provisional taxpayer cannot get it back. It is not that he cannot get it back, Mr. Speaker; he must just ask for it. He receives his assessment and sees that he has a credit. The credit may be in respect of a provisional payment he made a week ago. It would surely be foolish for the Receiver of Revenue immediately to repay the money he received a week ago, because that may be a payment which was already due. But because there was no debit there is now a credit. If an amount is to be repaid immediately, even to that provisional taxpayer, we would be destroying our own plan and defeating its object. Therefore it is essential that the taxpayer, if he sees that he has a credit, should himself ask for the repayment of that amount. It is obvious, as the hon. member for Constantia has said, that he may receive his assessment only in 12 months&#x2019; time. I can well imagine that when a taxpayer draws the attention of the Receiver of Revenue to the fact that he will submit data only after 12 months to show what he must pay and asks that this amount should be repaid to him, they will not be so hard-hearted as to retain such a taxpayer&#x2019;s money without interest for so long a period. Therefore he will have a good case every time and the money can be repaid to him. I think that is the only point raised in the debate which the Opposition can discuss. Nor do I wish to go into it further. This was practically an agreed measure, except for these few exceptions about which the hon. member for Constantia does not feel very happy. I want to tell him that there are certain other people who do not feel very happy about it either.</p>

<p>I just want to revert briefly to a point raised by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever). He mentioned that on a directive asked for by the taxpayer and issued by the Receiver of Revenue an employer should be compelled to make larger deductions than those he would normally make in terms of the tables. There is much to be said for the suggestion, and I am inclined to agree with the hon. member. The only objection there can be to it is that the amount which is in the hands of the employer will be regarded as a trust fund&#x2014;and I use the word &#x201C;trust&#x201D; in quotation marks. If he were to go insolvent and those trust funds were to be protected, whether by the law relating to trusts or by an amendment of the Insolvency Act which will give the Receiver of Revenue certain preferences to that money, there may also be preferences in regard to any surplus which lands in the hands of the employer or in the hands of the trustee of an insolvent employer. I cannot really advance this as an objection. But, supposing there is such a surplus, it must surely be discovered sooner or later, and if there is such a surplus, it is the easiest thing in the world for the Receiver of Revenue, or even for the trustee in an insolvent estate, to utilize that surplus for the benefit of other creditors. Nor does it mean that the Receiver of Revenue, if he holds such an amount, must retain it. He can repay that surplus, to which he is not entitled. It is quite true that the <i>actio ex causa in debiti</i> does not lie against the State, but there is no obligation on the State to stand by that right it has. Personally I believe that such an action in this case cannot be to the benefit of the Receiver of Revenue.</p>

<p>Having made these remarks, Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the Minister on this measure. On behalf of many people in the country, and particularly on behalf of the small employer to whose interest it is that there should be an equable flow of revenue and expenditure and an equable flow to the Treasury, so that during certain periods of the year a large sum of money is not diverted from the private sector to the public sector, I wish to express our congratulations and our blessings.</p>

<p>When I was more closely associated with the problem of raising funds for a provincial administration, I was often told by experts in this matter that with regard to taxation we should always work to the good principle that taxation should be in a form which was simple to understand and easy to collect. I want to say at once that I do not think that this particular Bill is easy to understand. It may be easy to collect, although I am not so sure about that. The Minister is taking many far-reaching steps to make it easy for him to collect. He is using such a large number of instruments for that purpose, instruments that will be called upon under pain of penalty to do his work for him and to pay for it out of their pockets. We have heard from various speakers to-day that by and large most organizations and groups of people are in favour of the principle of this Bill. That may well be so but I do not think the feeling is as widespread as some of the speakers would make out. May I say that when the Minister replies I shall be grateful if he will tell us whether this Bill in the form in which it is before us was the Bill which was submitted to <span class="col_323-324" refersTo="page_0176"/>the S.A. Agricultural Union, because I understand it is not</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;yes &#x201D;. I suggest that it was not the Bill which is before us to-day. [Interjections.] The hon. member now says it was the principle: that is the point. The principle is one thing and the detailed Bill as it is before us is another thing. Both in the law itself and in the administration of the law, it is not merely the principle which binds us but the details set out in the Bill and in those very extensive schedules to which the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) has referred. If this Bill were to be submitted to the S.A. Agricultural Union I do not think it can be said that they will accept it. In fact, Sir, I believe that it goes against one of the points which they made particularly when they gave evidence before the Select Committee and that is in regard to farmers as such. I want to deal with it for a moment from the point of view of the farmer. May I say in passing that I accept by and large that from the point of view of the employee this Bill has virtually no objectionable qualities. If a tax has to be paid and the employee has to pay it then if his employer collects the money on a monthly basis it probably has many advantages from the employee&#x2019;s point of view. But when one moves away from the employee and you get to the small business and to the farmer who is not only a farmer but has an income from other sources and you run into the whole gamut of human endeavour associated with making a living, you begin to wonder just how in practice this legislation is going to work out. Let me deal with the position of a farmer who in terms of this Bill can remain on the present basis. First of all you must have his income from farming. The greater portion of his aggregate income must be from farming. If he has income from some other source and his income from his farming falls below 50 per cent of his aggregate income he ceases to be a farmer. And a farmer once out is out. You get this position, Sir, that with the embargo at the end of 1965 I can take advantage of that to take by own case as an example; I am so often an example&#x2014;and opt out. So that I will remain as a farmer; I will carry on with the present system provided that I do not fall under the provision of the law which makes me continue to get the larger portion of my income from farming. But if after 1965 I have a son who wishes to take up farming on my farm then he cannot be a farmer for the purpose of that clause. He will become a provisional taxpayer and he will fall under the whole of the provisions of the Act, whereas I as his father, farming with him, do not. There will be two different systems operating in regard to the same business. Unless I pay him a salary, and then he is not a farmer, then he becomes an employee. But if he wants to be a farmer then he loses the privilege of being able to follow the same course which I followed.</p>

<p>I have known the hon. the Minister of Finance for a long time. He will forgive me if I say that any appeal to his soft heart and to his generosity and that sort of thing will, I am sure, fall on deaf ears. I have never known the hon. the Minister of Finance to have a weak spot or a soft spot or anything of that sort. If the hon. the Minister lends an ear to anything from this side of the House he has it at the back of his mind that some time or other he will take advantage of that. I do not think any appeal to the Minister of Finance in regard to this matter will cut any ice at all. There may be appeals to a present non-existent Commissioner. That I can understand, because the Bill from start to finish is full of references to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue, his powers and his discretion. But even the Commissioner can only act within the broad limits of the Bill. It is true that he has a wide discretion. I realize that in these circumstances that is a good thing because neither the Minister nor his advisers could set out their intention in terms of legal concept in writing in this Bill. They could not do it. They could not grapple with the thousand and one facets of our business affairs which will be presented to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue from time to time by thousands and tens of thousands of people. They could not compile an Act which was going to cover all cases, or even probably the majority of cases. They could follow certain broad lines but apart from that they were completely at sea. What the Minister did then was to say: * We will leave all these other matters to the discretion of the Commissioner; we will give the Commissioner wide powers. He will find an <i>ad hoc</i> way of dealing with this or that problem. We can only foresee the problems, we cannot set out the way in which they should be dealt with.&#x2019;</p>

<p>Let me come back to my own position and say that I see myself in this difficulty as far as I am a farmer and as far as my son may wish to be a farmer which he does. But I want to go a stage further. Many of the hon. members who have spoken are in the happy position that they either work or have their activities closely associated with a big city or some big centre in an urban settlement. It is not so difficult for those gentlemen to telephone the Receiver of Revenue in their town and put their problems to them. But what is the position of us farmers? I don&#x2019;t know why, but recently in some of our smaller towns, we are no longer able to deal direct with the Receiver of Revenue in those small towns. In my own case I have to go to the Receiver of Revenue in Durban who is 100 miles away. If I want to see the Receiver of Revenue I cannot just pick up the phone and speak to him. I am talking about the farmers who are in a similar position to myself and I want to see this thing in its practical application. I cannot just speak to him over the phone and tell him I am coming to see him, because he is only just round the corner. I have to get into my car and travel 100 miles there and back. I have to travel 200 miles. That costs me plus minus R20. If the amount that I am questioning is going to result <span class="col_325-326" refersTo="page_0177"/>in a saving of tax of less than R20 it is bad business for me to go off to Durban to see the Receiver of Revenue; it is better for me to pay it. I will be saving my time quite apart from saving my money.</p>

<p>As far as my auditor is concerned, as a member of a firm of accountants, what is the position there? The moment I have such a query, I get through to the accountant. By the time I have taken the matter up, which requires the discretion of the Receiver of Inland Revenue and by the time I have asked him to apply his mind to my little problem, which will have come from some centre or other and through my accountant, by the time it has reached him what is it going to cost me? It may cost me anything depending on the type and size of the problem no doubt and dependent upon the time my auditor has devoted to it One of the things that is worrying me about this system is the position in our smaller areas, especially if what has happened in the past should happen again that whereas we always took matters to our local Receiver of Revenue in the smaller towns, these matters have more and more been concentrated in the bigger towns, and if that is done how are we in the smaller centres going to deal with people who in fact can give us advice?</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I thought the hon. Minister said &#x201C;consecrated&#x201D;, because they are really holy. Mr. Speaker, those of us who are away in the country districts because of the concentration of these matters in the big urban centres have to face up to the fact that our small matters and our small troubles cannot be dealt with in our own centres and our own areas&#x2014;they have to be taken to the big centres to be dealt with. In that connection I want to make this plea. I realize that the state must get its revenue, must get the proceeds of taxation and that where a tax falls upon the taxpayer, the taxpayer can fairly be expected to pay that tax. I accept that. But where the question of penalties comes in, and the penalties, presumably, are going to be enforced at once, subject to the discretion of the Commissioner, there are many folks, many good folks who will say &#x201C;Rather than risk a penalty. I am going to pay a little extra, in order to be on the safe side&#x201D;. They do not want to risk trouble. The penalty, Sir, is not associated with wrong intentions, <i>mens rea.</i> There may be no intention whatever to do wrong, there may be no guilty conscience so far as the taxpayer is concerned, or the provisional taxpayer. There may simply be a straightforward, <i>bona fide</i> misunderstanding as far as the Act is concerned and the Schedule and regulations, and even in those cases a penalty is there. And how do you avoid a penalty? Again by an appeal to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. Now I want to say that in the case of the small businesses, not only the farmers now, where you have got small people in the country who are hammering out a living, who have to work hard, and who have to make up their own returns, the position is very difficult. In the past they might have gone along to the Receiver of Revenue in their own area to get the thing fixed up; once a year they had to deal with their affairs in connection with income tax, but now in practice they will find that this matter of income tax will be hanging over their heads day after day for 365 days a year; they will never be free of it. It is all very well in the case of an employee who actually has nothing to do with it because the employer deducts the money and that is that. But it is the employer, the man who has to watch his accounts all the time because he is called upon progressively to put in his estimates and so forth, with a penalty hanging over his head. Those are the people out in the country areas who in my opinion who are going to create, perhaps not immediately but in the second stage, the big flood of applications that will be coming in to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. And the Commissioner is going to act on the assumption that if he can satisfy himself that there was no intention to wrongdoing, that there was no <i>mens rea,</i> will allow for the abolition of the penalty in that particular case. Well, if that is the case, I cannot see how he will cope with it in his lifetime. I do not see how one man can do it in a lifetime. I have not been able to trace any provision that the Commissioner in turn can pass on his authority, can delegate his authority to any other official. I may be wrong, but I cannot find such a provision. I think it would be a very dangerous thing to let that develop. I am thinking of these thousands and tens of thousands of cases.</p>

<p>Now I want to move on to another point. The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) dealt with the non-Europeans. That, Sir, is a matter that is going to affect many of us very closely indeed, because there are not hundreds to-day but thousands of these people. What is going to be their position? You see, Sir, it can be the case that if some of these people get into trouble with the Revenue Department, it is going to affect their credit in regard to their business connections, and it may very severely affect their credit. That is going to be a matter of considerable moment in the country districts where Government pressure to-day is building up, deliberately as part of their policy, a group of business people who are non-Europeans. There is one group, the Asiatics, who need no encouragement from the Government. They have by and large taken advantage of whatever the law has permitted them in the way of trading and so forth, and the whole of that group will also come into the picture. I cannot for the life of me see how in the first 12 months, or even the first 24 months, we are going to avoid almost complete <span class="col_327-328" refersTo="page_0178"/>chaos because of the number of queries and decisions that will have to be decided only by the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. He will have to send out his directives and their name may be legion.</p>

<p>It is for these reasons that I believe it is a great pity that the matter has been forced through as fast as it has. A lot of people have been led to anticipate that this measure is coming and that at the end of next month it will come into operation. It is very difficult now to turn round and to appeal to the Government to hold over the matter, and in fact it might have even some deleterious consequences for many business people who are anticipating the enforcement of this system. I realize that. Once you have agreed to such a scheme you have to carry on with it. But what I am concerned about are the penalties, and I would like the hon. the Minister in his reply to say what is going to be the position in regard to the penalities, because I can see penalties being incurred on thousands of people who are completely innocent and who have no intention whatever to do anything that is wrong, people who simply do not understand the Bill and the regulations to be framed thereunder.</p>

<p>I would say that this Act was clearly designed for an old established country, with an old established economy and possibly for a country with a homogeneous population in the main. We are not like that. We are a new country, we have got a population that is not homogeneous. In many aspects of our economic life we are a dynamic community. South Africans are up and doing, their businesses are moving, despite of difficulties. But under those circumstances, I must say in all fairness that I believe that this type of legislation is going to create a tremendous amount of difficulty in administration and for the taxpayers.</p>

<p>As far as I am concerned, the position therefore is that I fear that farmers as a group in this country have not understood precisely what is in this Bill, and that when it is put into operation many of them believe that they can opt out of the provisions and that then they will find out that they cannot do so, and that that is going to lead to a great deal of trouble. And I do regret that apparently the hon. the Minister, judging by some of his interjections when my colleagues referred to farmers, has not got much sympathy for them. He went out of his way to say that in any case why should there be a small group of people who hereafter will not be brought within the general run the same as other people&#x2014;he simply ignored the fact of the peculiar position in which they are placed. I am afraid they will find themselves in great difficulties. I don&#x2019;t think for example that the Minister or his advisers have as yet taken into account the quota system as it applies in respect of so many agricultural products. I do not think they have taken that into full account into dealing with the taxation system as set out in the Bill. Very often these producers at the beginning of the year do not even know what their quota is going to be, and yet they may have to assess their income in respect of a quota they do not know the size of. I am thinking of that kind of thing. The quota system has unfortunately become part of our economic system in the field of agriculture, and there again the application of the Bill may cause a man to appear as a man who has trouble in respect of penalties, although he had no intention to do anything wrong, and then he may have to go to the Commissioner to testify that what was done was done in innocence and he may have to ask the Commissioner for leniency and to get him out of trouble. I do not like that at all. Simply postpone the penalties for 12 months or more until people have had the opportunity to see how the thing works and until they have got over their initial difficulties.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. F. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>I am a little surprised at the hon. member, because he is apparently somewhat uninformed. When the commission was originally appointed the farmers were the people who were very scared of this Bill and that was why, when we started, the question was asked as to whom we should call to give evidence and I think it was a number of us farmer members who suggested that not only the South African Agricultural Union should give evidence but that other affiliated bodies should also give evidence, such as the Stud Book Association, the National Wool Growers Association and others. Those bodies appeared before the Commission and that is why I think the hon. member is wrong when he says that we did not investigate the matter properly. I was one of those who was very sceptical originally and who said that I refused to accept the principle until such time as I had accepted the evidence of all interested sections. I must admit that as far as the business world is concerned, I learnt a great deal but what struck me was the fine spirit which prevailed amongst the businessmen. We often think that the farmers form an isolated little group and that we are being neglected but I must admit that the Commission and the evidence given to the Commission was very sympathetic. We said at the beginning that we wanted to retain the old system and even the South African Agricultural Union sided against any change, to my surprise. Their argument was that the farmer never knew before the end of the year what his income was. If you have to make two estimates you may possibly, after seven months, assume that you will reap so many thousands of bags of maize and in the meantime a hailstorm destroys the entire crop. That was why we insisted that we should adhere to the old system, that we should eliminate the various difficulties and that you should be allowed, as previously, to state your case once a year. But after a long discussion and after we had heard what the South African Agricultural Union had to say, and after the South African Agricultural Union had eventually agreed by saying: &#x201C;If there has to be a voluntary system under which a farmer can <span class="col_329-330" refersTo="page_0179"/>submit returns twice, while he can also remain under the old system, let those who wish to submit returns twice do so,&#x201D; we also agreed. The farmers as a whole accepted it. There is only one small point on which I differ from the Minister and that is in regard to the young farmers. We put it this way that a father, for example, has a son. The father may eventually die and the son is then regarded as a young farmer who has no choice under the scheme. The hon. the Minister has now gone so far as to say that he will extend it till 1965 and if necessary he will extend it further.</p>

<p>That was the only point on which I differed. I do not want to go into the position of big businessmen. I think the hon. member makes a mistake where he talks about the small man. Many of our small farmers do not pay income tax. It is true he completes his form but he does not pay tax. Say for instance the farmer employs someone who earns over R400 per annum, then he goes to the magistrate and he pays in respect of that one person. But the general farm labourer does not fall in that category and in that regard the hon. member is probably wrong. The small man does not come under this. If I may give advice to the bigger farmers who farm on a large scale, those people who pay a heavy tax, <i>I</i> should say that the big farmers will be better off under the system which we have at the moment of submitting returns twice a year. I would advise the smaller farmers to remain under the old system. I think the big farmer will benefit by the reduction which he is getting now. True, it is only in respect of one year, but it nevertheless helps. It will be better for him to submit returns twice in order to enjoy this reduction. The smaller farmer who does not pay tax, however, should rather remain under the old system.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I feel it will be generally conceded, after reading the report of the Select Committee on the introduction of P.A.Y.E., that this system has more advantages than disadvantages for both the taxpayer and the State, and I think it must be conceded that on a comparison of the systems prevailing in Britain, in the United States of America, in Canada and New Zealand, our system, as now evolved under this Bill, is certainly less complicated than any of the systems at present in practice in these countries. Credit must be given to the Treasury and its officials for having made such a close study of the other systems, and for having taken out of these systems the things that are best in them and the way they have been applied to our country. That is proved by the fact that 34 organizations and persons submitted memoranda and that a further 20 gave evidence in person. The general consensus of opinion&#x2014;except of course the Chartered Institute of Secretaries&#x2014;was that this system should be introduced in our country. Sir, when we look at the diversity of persons and organizations that gave evidence, we find that on one day the &#x201C;Papkuil-boerevereniging&#x201D; gave evidence, and the very next day the &#x201C;Gold Producers Committee of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State&#x201D;, then it is apparent how diversified was the evidence placed before the Select Committee.</p>

<p>The Select Committee, I would say, made a number of very important changes, both in detail and the machinery for the implementation of the scheme, and thereby removed many hardships and anomalies. For instance, it will be remembered that in the original scheme the penalties for provisional taxpayers were, in my opinion, very severe indeed. The Bill now before us considerably lessens those penalties&#x2014;for instance the penalty for an under-estimate of tax by a provisional taxpayer was a treble tax, and now that penalty has been removed, unless of course the estimate is less than 90 per cent of the final determination and is less than the previous year.</p>

<p>Another factor which is introduced in this Bill and which I think is to the advantage of commerce and industry is the elimination of the necessity for having a trust account. That has been welcomed right through the country as far as commerce and industry are concerned.</p>

<p>I said that this scheme has advantages for both the taxpayer and the state, but it also has advantages for commerce and industry as a whole. One of the biggest factors, I feel, is the fact that there will be a better monthly spread of income throughout the year, and we will not have the unsatisfactory position that now prevails whereby at the end of each year the employee has a headache in trying to find his income-tax, and invariably has to come to his employer for a loan, afterwards having difficulty in the repayment.</p>

<p>It has been stated that an amount of approximately R1, 500,000 extra taxation will accrue to the Treasury from the introduction of this scheme. I think that is an under-estimation on the part of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue of what will really accrue in extra taxation. Let us, however, accept this amount of R1, 500,000. Against that extra money will have to be found for the collection of the taxation. But the Commissioner himself says that the maximum he thinks it will cost the country to introduce this scheme will be R500,000 in the first year, and in subsequent years that amount will decrease. So the Minister of Finance has got at least R1,000,000 more available this year than last year, and I hope that that will be taken as justification for a reduction in taxation. A further reason <span class="col_331-332" refersTo="page_0180"/>why I think there should be such a reduction is the considerable saving to the Government in interest rates. No longer will it be necessary to pay interest on tax-redemption certificates, and the hon. Minister must remember that he is now going to have advance payments of taxation, whereas before he was only getting his taxation in arrear. The fact that a large group of South African citizens who previously did not pay taxation will now be caught in this web, is, I feel, only fair and correct, and that too will amount to a considerable amount of extra taxation flowing to the Minister. But against that I would ask the hon. the Minister to keep in mind the considerable increase in overhead expenditure that is now going to be borne by Commerce and Industry who are now being compelled to become tax collectors for the Government. It will mean a considerable amount of extra work for commerce and industry. I think the point has been taken, but I would like to reiterate this appeal, that the Minister should give consideration to the request by commerce and industry, that some form of commission or remuneration will be made available to them for the collection of taxation on behalf of the Government. The amount that should be set aside is something that I think the Minister and his department can determine by a simple process of calculation. I would also like the hon. the Minister to keep in mind that the money that is now being paid by commerce and industry and individual taxpayers in advance, is money that was previously used in business for financing turnover, purchase of stock and things like that during the course of the year. The very fact that these payments have to be made&#x2014;by provisional taxpayers three times a year&#x2014;means that large amounts are taken out of circulation, and at least for the first year this will prejudice commerce and industry as such.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria-Central (Mr. van den Heever) made the suggestion that a taxpayer could ask the Receiver of Revenue to instruct his employer to make payment of an amount over and above the calculated amount as set out in the table. I would like to suggest that that would be a dangerous course to follow at this early stage in the implementation of the Act, because one of the cardinal points that was taken into consideration in drafting the Select Committee&#x2019;s recommendations in this matter, was the very need for secrecy as far as an employee was concerned. That is cardinal to all of our taxation principles. There must be no disclosure of any other income an employee as taxpayer may earn, and the very fact that the Receiver can be instructed&#x2014;if the hon. member for Pretoria-Central&#x2019;s viewpoint is accepted&#x2014;to increase that amount by say 25 per cent, would create the very thing that we are trying to avoid, namely any disclosure of a man&#x2019;s income from sources other than the income from the employer himself.</p>

<p>One of the hidden results of this income tax system which I think has not yet been touched upon, and which I think as the years go on, will become an important factor, is the fact that the Minister can increase taxation by very small amounts on the monthly contributions as far as an individual taxpayer is concerned, without the country as a whole noticing this invidious inroad into taxation. A taxpayer for instance will not notice that there has been an increase of say 10c on his weekly deductions, but that spread over all the taxpayers of this country would be a considerable amount. It is a subtle means, I am afraid, a Minister of Finance could use in future in order to increase taxation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will not be discouraged! Experience has taught us that a scheme of this kind once imposed becomes irrevocable, and although it must be admitted that roughly 90 per cent of South Africa&#x2019;s 1, 100,000 taxpayers will have had an eight-month tax-free holiday by the end of February&#x2014;if this scheme is introduced&#x2014; the other worrying aspect, purely looking at it from a general point of view as far as the country is concerned, is that there are only 78,000 taxpayers who earn more than R3, 600 per year. That is the figure on which the tax free period of eight months has been based in respect of any income of R2, 400. One then arrives at the unhappy conclusion that out of a population of roughly 12,000,000 in this country, only .65 per cent are taxpayers who earn more than that amount. Or if you want to take it as a percentage of the taxpayers of the Union as a whole, only 7 per cent of the taxpayers will automatically have this tax-free period. I think that is something to which we should give consideration when looking at the economic picture of this country as a whole.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister in his speech dealt with the question of loan levies and their repayment. As is known, these loan levies are repayable at the end of a five-year period. I am wondering whether the Minister would not be wise with the introduction of this scheme, of allowing all loan levies to be paid out right at this stage, the 1st March, 1963. Allow them to be paid out with interest right up to that date. That to my mind, would climate a considerable amount of administration costs for the Treasury and would redeem all outstanding loan levies at this stage. The hon. member for Pretoria-Central (Mr. van der Heever) has dealt with a matter, which I think is of very great importance to the ordinary small taxpayer. I refer to the fact that the salaried man under this new scheme will automatically at the end of each year have made <span class="col_333-334" refersTo="page_0181"/>an over-payment of his tax, and only at the end of the year will he be entitled to a refund. I think it is an unsatisfactory feature that a taxpayer should be over-taxed, and have to wait until the end of the year to get a refund of the money due to him. Although I appreciate the reasons why this has to be done, e.g. that the table cannot provide for insurance premiums, for dependants allowances or medical expenses, would it not be better to make him pay only 90% of the amount he has to pay in terms of the tax table? At the end of the year he will then be very near the mark of what he has to pay, or else only a nominal sum will have to be refunded to him. I think the question of a very small refund to a taxpayer is much better than the system now envisaged under this Bill. I fully agree with the hon. member for Pretoria-Central that this question of over-taxation is going to cause dissatisfaction and it is something which I suggest can be handled fairly simply administratively, by cutting the percentage shown on the table down to 90% or 95%.</p>

<p>The question of a provisional taxpayer having to make three payments during the year is something which has also caused a lot of comment amongst commercial and industrial concerns. In order to cut down the expenses that firms will now have to incur in making these payments, I think the Minister and the Treasury should give consideration to the question of making two payments only during the year, instead of three. That would mean that at the end of the first six months the provisional taxpayer would pay a half of what he paid the previous year, and at the end of the year he would then make an assessment of what his tax is likely to be, and would pay in the difference in the same way as the system now envisaged. This would cut down administrative costs considerably, both as far as the employer and the Treasury is concerned if you only have to handle two payments during the year instead of three.</p>

<p>On those same lines, may I draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that the evidence before the Select Committee showed that practically all commercial and business undertakings which gave evidence stated that it was their opinion that the employers as such, and the self-employed person, should have been left out of this scheme for possibly two or three years until such time as the scheme was functioning smoothly, and then only to have brought in the employer and the self-employed man. I am personally of the opinion that that would have been a more satisfactory solution of the problem, but be that as it may, I realize that it is a question of the whole or nothing as far as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is concerned&#x2014; looking at is purely from his point of view of administration. The evidence of all these organizations was what they felt that at this stage the self-employed man and the employer should have been left out of the scheme until it was more effectively administered and running smoothly. Having made these comments, and accepting the general principle of P.A.Y.E., I wish to appeal to the Minister to give consideration to some of my recommendations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we thought originally that it would not really be necessary to discuss the principles of this Bill in any way, particularly in view of the fact that the House has certain recommendations of the Select Committee before it, but particularly with reference to the speech of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) I nevertheless think it is desirable to say something about the principles of the Bill.</p>

<p>I personally was rather sceptical about this legislation at the beginning, particularly because one is conscious, or was conscious, of the fact that this major change in our income-tax system, as the hon. the Minister pointed out a moment ago, will also entail certain disadvantages. As has been pointed out it will create a great amount of work in certain respects for the officials, particularly as far as its administration is concerned. It has also been pointed out to us, particularly by people concerned in commerce and heads of factories and businesses, that administratively it will mean a fair amount of extra work to them because under the new system the employer will actually be the Government&#x2019;s collection agent. In spite of that, all the various bodies except one which gave evidence, either personally or by way of memorandum, supported this legislation in principle as well as the farmers who were represented by the S.A. Agricultural Union. As I say, this change was supported throughout. What impressed me particularly and the reasons why I decided after all that it would be in the best interests of the country for us to change over to this system, are twofold. In the first instance we have the fact which was also mentioned by the Minister, the better distribution of money during the course of the year. I thought, and I still think so, that that consideration outweighs all the disadvantages which this measure may possibly contain. In other words, the position which will prevail under the new system, because throughout the year from the 1st of January to the 31st of December the taxation will flow evenly from the private sector to the public sector, is so important that it outweighs all possible disadvantages. It has been pointed out, and I think this is very important, that under the old system, there was an exceedingly heavy flow of large sums of money from the pockets of the public to the Treasury during the last few months of every year, and in South Africa and in all Christian countries that part of the year is really the part when you expect the greatest activity in your business and that is the time when the money is being taken out of the pocket of the individual. I think, therefore, that it is of the utmost importance to the economy that there should be an even distribution of taxation throughout the year.</p>

<p>The second reason why I think it is of the utmost importance that we accept this system is something which has not been raised by <span class="col_335-336" refersTo="page_0182"/>many and that is the question of taxation after a person&#x2019;s death. Under the new system you have the sound principle that the money is paid as it is earned. In other words, there is no accumulation of arrears taxes. That by itself is a sound principle. Under the old system we found that when a person died, particularly if he had not submitted his returns, a large sum of money must be found from the estate funds in order to pay the arrear income tax. I had experience of that a short while ago in connection with an estate which I had to handle and where no less than R15,000 income-tax had to be paid after his death and the estate was not so big that it did not create very great problems for the survivors. I think, therefore, that it supports the principle that tax should be paid as the income is earned and that in the case of the survivors particularly it will be of very great value that the tax be paid as the income is earned so that in the case of death very little or no income tax will be due.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words in connection with the doubts which are often expressed, particularly by farmers, and as also expressed by the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). In the case of the professional person, such as the attorney or the advocate or the doctor or the accountant, and in many other cases where income is derived from various sources, you have to make a preliminary estimate of your income for the year. In the case of the professional man he is expected to make an estimate after four months in the year and he must make another estimate later in the year. Every time he makes an estimate he must pay portion of his income-tax based on his estimate. I must honestly say that I think that in many of those cases, particularly where the person derives his income from various sources, and where the professional man will often find it very difficult to know beforehand what his income will be for the year, that will be very difficult. In spite of that no serious objections were ever raised to that. We had many more objections in the case of the farmers. Originally the farmer had to make an estimate a month or two before the end of the year and pay a portion of his tax and at the end of the year he had to make a final estimate and pay the balance. The farmers envisaged many problems in that regard, and quite rightly so, because to a great extent farmers have to cope with the elements of nature which are beyond their control. As a result a concession was made to the farmers in the first instance by way of a discussion in the Select Committee, namely, that instead of his having to make his estimate a month or two before the end of the year, he should make his estimate just before the end of the year. The farmers were of opinion, through their representatives, that that would be very fair and reasonable, because the farmers ought to be in the position at the end of the year, a day or two before the end of the financial year, of knowing what his income was. I know farmers find it exceedingly difficult to handle paper and pencil. They would much rather handle a spade or a tractor and they foresee great difficulty in having to make an estimate of their income. But we said that it could be a very arbitrary estimate. The form to be completed is not a long one; it is merely an estimate in a round figure of what his income will be. This opinion was expressed by Mr. Van Wyk, the under-secretary of the Agricultural Union. After this concession had been made that he could make his estimate just before the end of the financial year he was asked whether he had any objections to it and his reply was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not believe there will be any objection. The actual objection is to the procedure under which two estimates and two provisional payments will have to be made. For the vast majority of farmers it is only possible to relate the total income to the total expenditure once a year.</block>

<p>I am making these few remarks in connection with the farmers because I really want to try to get the farmers not to envisage all these difficulties under the new system, as the hon. member for South Coast did. The hon. member, <i>inter alia,</i> said that the possibility of a penalty being imposed on him will hang over his head for twelve months in the year if he is given the opportunity of making an estimate on the last day of the year. Thereafter he receives his usual form, he completes it, and he can then decide for himself whether or not he has made a good estimate. If he has overpaid he gets a refund and if he has under paid he has to pay the difference. The hon. member is inclined to exaggerate somewhat. I do not think there is any question about a possibility of a penalty hanging over his head for twelve months of the year. As I say, I am making these few remarks because I think we should encourage the farmers rather to cooperate with the State machinery. I personally am of the opinion that it is in the interests of the farmers to join, although as a further concession the choice is given to them to remain outside and to continue under the old scheme. I think it is in the interests of most of them to link up with the machinery of State. Not only is it better for the machinery of State if they are all linked up but I think the farmers will find that it will be more convenient to them to do so.</p>

<p>A few remarks were made in connection with the possibility of over payments and the objections which may possibly flow from that. I must honestly say that that is the only doubt which I really have in connection with this system. I do not want to enlarge upon that; enough has been said about that but I do want to ask that we should try, insofar as it is within our power to do so, to make the system work in such a way that in the most cases there should rather be an under payment than an over payment. I feel that the salary earners are by far in the majority, there are over 800,000, and it would appear that in most cases there will <span class="col_337-338" refersTo="page_0183"/>be an over payment. I think that will give rise to a fair amount of dissatisfaction. People will feel that even if it is a small amount it is in the hands of the State instead of in their own pockets. That is nothing more than the human element with which we are dealing and although very big financial implications are not involved, it is nevertheless a factor. Consequently I want to ask that, though it is only done administratively, we should rather try to receive an under payment than that the taxpayer should make an over payment with the result that he feels that he is the loser during the short period before his money is refunded. I have not the slightest doubt that time will show us that this new system will yield very great benefits to the economy and that in most cases it will make the position of the taxpayer easier, particularly that of the 800,000 salary earners who will, as it were, probably have no income-tax problems in future. I feel that if the necessary co-operation comes from the public we will find that South Africa will benefit very considerably under this new system and that it can be introduced very easily.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, apart from the Minister&#x2019;s introduction of this Bill, hon. members on the Government benches have carried very little conviction as regards the reasons why they are accepting this Bill. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) said that it was quite easy to claim repayments and he ended by saying that he would advocate that the system rather be one of under payments than over payments. How a matter like that can be rectified I do not know, but I would like to indicate to him, as he mentioned the farmers, the difficulty in regard to an employer employing a casual labourer at skilled work. Such a man is generally paid R3 to R4 a day, which immediately makes the employee liable for income-tax.</p>

<p>Do you refer to piece-work?</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. At the end of the year that casual worker is most likely not to have earned sufficient to make him liable for income-tax, but he has to make a return. This is now a Coloured or Native employee, uneducated or semi-educated. He has to make a return and claim for the excess which his employer deducted from his income. It is almost impossible. Take some of the rural areas which are 100 miles from the nearest Commissioner for Inland Revenue. I had a case before I left home of a boy coming to me who was entitled to some refund from the Government and his cheque was made payable by the Receiver of Inland Revenue. It is like the payment of compensation for slaves in the early days! How does this Native know that he must go and draw his money at Port Elizabeth? It will be exactly the same in the rural areas in regard to the farmer employing casual labour at a wage worthy of the man&#x2019;s labour. It will mean that farmers will have to pay them less, which will put less money into circulation. The farmers must naturally do what they can to avoid the complications of these returns, especially when employing casual labour now and again on skilled work. Now, I am pleased that the Minister has stated that the compiling of hundreds of thousands of new income-tax tables will never debar him from reducing income-tax when the revenue of the country justifies it, but when I look at these tables I do not know. I have my doubts. I fear that income-tax in this country will become more or less static.</p>

<p>There are hundreds and thousands of income-tax tables alone which will have to be reprinted to cope with any reduction or increase in income-tax which the Minister may find it necessary to impose. The Minister must agree that this is a very complicated system and the proof is the hours and days it took to explain it to members of Parliament before they understood and accepted it. When put into operation it will be one of the most difficult pieces of legislation to carry out. I have doubt whether there will be sufficient accountants to cope with the number of employers of labour who will come to seek assistance. No doubt this measure has received the support it has because it provides for an eight months&#x2019; tax holiday. That is the only reason why the Minister has received some popularity in regard to the introduction of this measure. It provides an income-tax holiday. We members of Parliament are induced to become more reasonable if we are offered even a day&#x2019;s holiday, from our duties, in this House. It has a wonderful psychological effect, and it is this holiday which is making this measure popular in the big centres, but not in the rural areas. I can assure the Minister that this Bill may be popular in the larger industrial centres, but it is not popular in the rural areas.</p>

The Minister has stated what powers will be given to the Commissioner in regard to carrying out this Bill, and how we can appeal to him. Take even the farmers&#x2019; rebate. It may sound very nice to hear about these concessions, but the Minister should realize that we have had droughts recently lasting for three years in some parts, and if the farmer has to calculate his rebate from the drought years, when he had no income at all, his tax holiday will not mean much to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when speaking on this Bill when the House adjourned for supper, I misunderstood an interjection which was made by the hon. the Minister. I apologize for this. The hon. the Minister asked me whether I wished him to withdraw the provisions regarding a tax holiday from this Bill. I. however, understood the Minister to ask whether I wished him to withdraw the Bill itself.</p>

<p>I have indicated the many difficulties which farmers labour under and it is in this connection that the hon. the Minister made his interjection. Many farmers are not wedded to the principle of a tax holiday and many farmers are going to exercise their right to stay outside the provisions of this Bill as regards their own income. I think the Minister should appreciate the unhappiness which does exist when a large section of the community, such as the farming section, do not wish to be incorporated under the proposed system of tax payment. I should like, however, to warn the hon. the Minister that if the provisions regarding a tax holiday were withdrawn from this Bill, the Government would lose every urban seat it now holds. That is what would happen if these provisions were to be withdrawn from the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, I am not proposing it. I am appealing to the Minister to administer this legislation with compassion towards those who will suffer under its provisions. There will be hardships. Even a Member of Parliament whose Parliamentary allowance with dividends make his income greater than his income from farming and who seeks to be classified as a farmer will encounter difficulties. In other words, a man who has been classified as a farmer all his life, will cease to be classified as such under this Bill if his dividends are in excess of his income from farming. That is something which the Minister should clear up during consideration of this Bill in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Then there is the case of farmers who farm as a company with their sons. These farmers shall have to register their sons as employees. In this connection, I should like to ask whether the Commissioner for Inland Revenue will allow this to happen, namely that farmers who farm as a company with their sons, will be allowed to register their sons as employees and in that way dissolve the company. It is just as difficult for farmers who farm as a company to estimate their income as it is for the individual farmer who will now be allowed to make one annual return, assess himself and fix his cheque to his return. This is something which we appreciate&#x2014;we appreciate this provision, but I do not see why a farmer who farms as a company with his sons should suffer through not having a similar advantage despite the fact that it is just as difficult for them to estimate their income as it is for anybody else.</p>

<p>There is also the question of farming foremen. Many farmers will now have to register as employers and as such make a return every month and by the 7th of the following month pay in with the Receiver of Revenue what they have deducted from their foremen&#x2019;s salaries. Most farmers include in these salaries a bonus. The Minister has made provision for this in his Bill and I appreciate it. Many of these foremen, however, have grazing rights. I understand the farmer will have to estimate the value of these grazing rights. It is difficult enough as it is to estimate the cost of production, but to estimate the value of grazing rights will be more difficult. Therefore I think farmers should be exempted from this provision. The employee himself should be required to reflect in his return what his grazing rights were worth to him. Similarly, he should be required to indicate the value of his accommodation. It is very difficult for the farmer to say what such accommodation is worth per month or annually to his employees. Much of such accommodation is taken up for farm purposes. For instance, a room is being used as an office, etc. I should say that the value of accommodation on a farm cannot be compared with the value of accommodation in a town. In respect of accommodation on a farm, an employee has to make certain provision for farming needs. I know, for instance, of a foreman who, during a very cold spell, brought all the sheep into his house in order to save their lives. That is part of his farming operations.</p>

<p>It ought not to be difficult for the Minister to provide that the employee should in his return estimate the value of accommodation and grazing rights instead of the farmer doing that in his monthly statement.</p>

<p>I should also like to ask the Minister what percentage of employers his Department estimates has not registered. I understand that no prosecution will take place in this connection, but I should like to ask the Minister for how long this holiday will be extended as regards these unregistered employers.</p>

<p>These are some of the difficulties with which the farming community will be faced under this legislation. I am thankful for the time I have been allowed to raise some of them and I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister would deal with them in his reply to this debate.</p>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>I am not one to argue if there is no reason for argument. However. I cannot but be surprised at the attitude which has been revealed this afternoon by the Opposition. In this connection I want to start by referring to the attitude of the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). He was one of the members of the Select Committee which inquired <span class="col_341-342" refersTo="page_0185"/>into this matter and was therefore present when each of the problems which he raised here this afternoon was thrashed out. I want to mention a few of those problems.</p>

<p>Firstly, I want to say that I agree with the hon. member where he said that the proposed method of tax collection would revolutionize our tax system. However, he complained about the wide powers which are being given to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue under this legislation. The hon. member was, as I said, present at all the meetings of the Select Committee and was aware of the powers which the Commissioner would be given under the proposed legislation. Moreover, he was also aware of the powers which the Commissioner had under the Act of 1941 and all the amendments to it. He now comes along and pretends that a new principle is being established by this Bill in this respect.</p>

<p>The hon. member also comes to light with the complaint that the officials whom the Commissioner will have to appoint will have insufficient training. This is also a matter of which the hon. member was aware when he was a member of the Select Committee. As a final summing up the hon. member said: &#x201C;This measure was rushed through&#x201D;, and said that the United Party would move amendments at the Committee Stage. That is their right, but I want to ask him whether, if he wanted to move amendments, the Select Committee was not the correct place to have moved them so that they could have been discussed? The fact is that the hon. member sat there all the time but did not move one amendment which was not discussed or in regard to which no agreement was reached on the Select Committee.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with those hon. members who spoke ostensibly on behalf of the farmers. I noticed a very interesting fact in this regard. We had hon. members, like the hon. member for Natal South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker), who posed here as the great friends of the farmer! I ask myself whether this is not merely a continuation of the old two-faced policy of the United Party, namely, that they are acting in this way so that some of them can go to the platteland and say that they did this and that for the farmer.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out, although you yourself and hon. members opposite know it as well as I do. how Select Committees are constituted. Mr. Speaker, the Select Committee which inquired into this matter under discussion was announced by you on 25th January, 1962. I am not going to dwell on those members who represented the Government on the Committee, but I want to refer to those members who served on that Committee on behalf of the United Party, members who were nominated by the United Party whips and also, I take it, by the caucus of that Party. Let us study them more closely. Mr. Emdin was one of them. I do not know what his profession is but I am quite sure that he is not a farmer. Other members nominated were Mr. Hopewell, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Ross and Maj. Van der Byl who describes himself as a &#x201C;simple little farmer &#x201D;. I welcomed his appointment as a farmer to the Committee. Another person who was appointed was Mr. Waterson. A week later, however, Mr. Speaker, you announced that Mr. Emdin and Maj. Van der Byl had been discharged from service on the Select Committee and that Messrs. Taurog and Oldfield had been appointed in their stead.</p>

<p>I want to ask now why the United Party did not nominate the hon. member for Natal South Coast or the hon. member for Albany if they wanted to have the farmers represented on the Committee? There is the hon. member for East London City, someone who knows a great deal about farming and who would have been a good representative of the farmers. No. Mr. Speaker, they could not nominate him because he has already made too many mistakes. He does not know as much about farming as they thought he did!</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, but I was merely pointing out how the United Party posed here this afternoon as the friend of the farmer and pretended that it wanted to safeguard the interests of the farmer, although it had the opportunity of nominating farmers to serve on the Committee but did not do so&#x2014; except for the hon. member for Green Point, the &#x201C;simple little farmer&#x201D; who is entering the Chamber at the moment and who was discharged from the Committee at a later date.</p>

<p>I want now to come to the hon. member for Albany. He made a general allegation by saying that the farmers were very disappointed&#x2014; I am quite prepared to resume my seat if he tells me that I am interpreting him incorrectly &#x2014;and did not accept the P.A.Y.E. system. Am I correctly interpreting the hon. member?</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. member whether he still takes note of the opinion of organized agriculture or not? Do the opinions of organized agriculture still count with him? To judge from his silence I must take it that the hon. member for Albany only takes notice of one or two of his friends with whom he may sit and chat in the shade on a Sunday and that he is not aware of what is going on in organized agriculture circles. Allow me to give him some information in this connection. I have here a bilingual periodical entitled &#x201C;Georganiseerde Landbou&#x2014;Organized Agriculture&#x201D; of December, 1962. On the cover of that issue we find the message: &#x201C;A happy Christmas and a Prosperous New Year to all our readers&#x201D;, I want to refer to page 18 of this issue where the hon. member will find this opinion expressed by organized agriculture&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_343-344" refersTo="page_0186"/>The latest proposals of the Receiver of Revenue in connection with the P.AY.E. system of paying income tax are published in <i>Government Gazette</i> No. 324 of August 31st, 1962. The taxation committee of the South African Agricultural Union has considered these proposals and recommends the following to all farmers&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(A) That they should adopt the P.A.Y.E. system because

<ol>

<li>(1) As employers they resort under it in any case;</li>

<li>(2) It is in the interests of the country&#x2019;s economy;</li>

<li>(3) The tax-free period holds many advantages and farmers who stop farming must switch over in any case;</li>

<li>(4) After consulting the Commissioner, they do not have to change their financial year.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>Is the hon. member aware of this?&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(B) That farmers should not alter their financial year;</li>

<li>(C) That when estimates are made which are lower than the previous year&#x2019;s income, farmers should first consult their local receivers of revenue.

<p>Farmers must clearly understand that this is a new system of tax collection. However, it is not detrimental to the ideal of levelling income and the taxation committee of the South African Agricultural Union continues to pay attention to this aspect.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that I am doing the hon. member for Albany an injustice by quoting this article to him because he should have read it himself long ago!</p>

<p>I want to come back to the appointment of the members of the Select Committee. If the hon. member for Natal South Coast or the hon. member for Albany had been on the Committee I am sure that the hon. member for Kempton Park and I would not have voted in the minority alone because they would haye voted with us. I make no apologies for voting against the adoption of the principle of this Bill. Neither do I make any apology for obtaining what I did for the farmers. I make no apology for what I was able to do for them in co-operation, of course, with the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker), the hon. member for Ladybrand (Mr. Keyter) and other hon. members who served on the Committee with me as representative of my Party</p>

<p>I want to point out that the recommendation of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue was in the first instance that farmers should pay two provisional instalments during the course of the year. The first of these was to be paid in November when the farmer had to pay two-thirds of the tax upon his estimated income for the year, or an amount equal to two-thirds of the income tax which he paid the previous year. Furthermore he had then during the 12 months to pay a further one-third which had to be correct to within 90 per cent of his taxable income for the year. We on the Select Committee felt that this would make the farmer&#x2019;s position a very difficult one and this also appeared to be the case from the replies to questions which were put to the representatives of organized agriculture. Hon. members know how the income from agriculture fluctuates. I want to point out here that it was not only the farmers for whom we intervened in this connection. We did have other groups of taxpayers in mind whose incomes were just as uncertain as those of the farmers. I am speaking here about fishermen and diamond-diggers. They are also gamblers just like the farmers. We also made representations on their behalf that they should be permitted to pay only one instalment in a year and not two.</p>

<p>Eventually we arrived at the point where the Commissioner as well as members of the Committee realised that it would be extremely difficult to pay two instalments a year. Accordingly a compromise was arrived at which has been incorporated in the Bill now before the House, namely, that farmers, fishermen and diamond-diggers need only pay their first instalment in the twelfth month of their tax-year if they elect to accept the system.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Albany must not come along and tell me how dissatisfied the farmers are and how they will rebel against these provisions. If there are farmers&#x2014;and I know that there are such cases and I sympathise with them&#x2014;who do not want to accept the scheme, they can, in terms of the recommendation of the Select Committee incorporated in this Bill, elect to remain under the old system. That will leave their position as it is.</p>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>Will it not be necessary for such farmers to comply with the requirements of the Bill in regard to registration as employers?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Oh, yes. We certainly cannot expect to be completely excluded from the operation of legislation for the country. If I am an employer and, as such, employ a White person, a Coloured or an Asiatic earning more than R430 per annum, I am then compelled, as is the case with every other employer&#x2014; why should I be dealt with differently?&#x2014;to make a provisional payment for that employee. The same obligation will rest upon me as upon all other employers. This also holds good for a Bantu earning more than R600 per Annum. This not only holds good for farmers, diamond-diggers and fishermen, but for everyone. If this is so, why should I be excluded from these provisions simply because I am a farmer? I do not want to be treated differently to all the other employers in the country.</p>

<p>There is another point that I want to raise. There will still be farmers, fishermen and diamond-diggers who will find it extremely difficult to make an estimate even though it be in <span class="col_345-346" refersTo="page_0187"/>the twelfth month of this tax-year. Accordingly, the Select Committee recommended, and the hon. the Minister has incorporated the recommendation in this Bill, that these people could be excluded from the P.A.Y.E. system. There was a specific reason for this. It can be justified. They were not excluded simply because they fell into those categories. There was a recommendation by the Commissioner that all young farmers should accept the system. The Committee felt that if there was justification for the aforementioned three groups being excluded, there was also justification for contending that there would be people in these three groups who would have the same difficulties in the future. Therefore it was recommended that if they elected to stay under the old system, they should be permitted to do so.</p>

<p>If there are such persons, they cannot be expected to participate in the so-called &#x201C;taxholiday&#x201D; or &#x201C;tax-rebate&#x201D;, which is the term I prefer. I do not think that there is anyone who can object to this. However the Bill makes provision for the termination of this concession in 1965. I want to make my standpoint in this connection very clear. If there is justification for the recommendation of the Select Committee that the aforementioned three groups can elect to accept a different system to that of the other taxpayers, then that justification holds good for to-day as well as for any period in the future. It has, however, now been proposed that this concession should be terminated in 1965. My standpoint is that if there is reason to-day for people to be excluded from the new system, that reason will still hold good in 1965 and thereafter. I put this very clearly to the hon. the Minister and I am now putting it here to the House. If the majority of members differ from me in this regard, I can of course do nothing about it.</p>

<p>My view is therefore that if there are persons &#x2014;I do not want to call them &#x201C;cranks&#x201D;, <i>I</i> do not think that it would be right for me to do so because every taxpayer knows what will be in his best, interersts&#x2014;who have reason to be excluded from the system at present, those reasons will still be valid at a later stage and they must retain that right.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by repeating that I make no apology for my actions on the Select Committee. I accept this Bill for the reason that the 110,000 farmers who either pay income tax or render returns are tremendously interested in and sympathetically disposed towards the 800,000 employees who also pay income tax and for whom the proposed system will be best because under the old system they did not always have the ready cash available when they received their assessments. I shared the view of the hon. member for Pretoria (Central), namely, that there were other methods which could be put into operation to achieve the same object&#x2014;for example, a system of redemption certificates and so forth. However. this was not accepted. Under the circumstances I am pleased about the 800,000 taxpayers for whom this new system holds many advantages and I therefore support this legislation.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) has brought a terrific amount of emotion into this proposal to change the method of our taxation. I can understand hon. members showing emotion when the hon. the Minister of Finance wishes to increase the tax rate, but when debating the question of a simpler method of taxation, I find such emotion a little bit difficult to understand. The first thing I should like to suggest to the hon. member is that he should get his facts straight. I was appointed to the Select Committee but never served. He launched an attack on the hon. member for Albany and on the hon. member for Constantia for trying to make improvements to this Bill. In particular he said that as the hon. member for Constantia was a member of the Select Committee, any suggestions he had to make should have been made in Select Committee. May I draw his attention to the fact that after the Select Committee had done its work and submitted its report, the hon. the Minister and his advisers produced a Bill in August of last year. to-day, however, not many months later, a new Bill has been produced and it took the Minister 14 pages of explanatory notes to explain the difference between the Bill of August and the Bill of January. And rightly so, because the Minister, like the hon. member for Constantia, is merely trying to improve the Bill. Therefore I cannot understand the attack of the hon. member.</p>

<p>He also accused the hon. member for Constantia for using the word &#x201C;revolutionary&#x201D;, Let me refer him to a motion moved by the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) in the Select Committee. He moved that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your Committee, however, sees the main disadvantage in the proposed scheme as being that it entails a revolutionary change in the taxation system &#x2026;</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, listening to the hon. the Minister expounding all the benefits which a system of P.A.Y.E. will bring to all of us&#x2014;to the Government, to Industry, to Commerce and to the individual&#x2014;I almost felt that he was offering us a gift as bountiful as doing away with taxation altogether. I wonder, however, whether the benefits which we are to derive from this change in the system of our taxation are not debatable. I do not. for example, believe that the small business because of P.A.Y.E. is going to be more up to date and efficient and have more day to day knowledge of his business. I am more inclined to believe that he is going to have some harsh thought on the extra work which this system is going to impose upon him and <span class="col_347-348" refersTo="page_0188"/>instead of becoming a more efficient person, he likely to become one of the great estimators of this country. Nor do I believe that the hon. the Minister is correct when he says that this country needs a dose of anti-inflationary medicine. If that were so, we would have expected the Minister to have given a word of warning to those people, including some of his colleagues, who are propounding the theory &#x201C;spend for prosperity &#x201D;. Personally, I am inclined to go along with those who say &#x201C;spend for prosperity &#x201D;.</p>

<p>I think it would be wrong of us on this side of the House not to congratulate the Minister and his staff for the amount of work which they put into this matter. It gave me great pleasure to have been present at a number of symposiums held under the guidance of professional societies and attended by members of the staff of Internal Revenue who gave of their time, their brains and their effort. For that our thanks is due to them. I should also like to thank the Department for the steps which are being taken to acquaint the public with the changes which are going to take place; for the publicity that is being undertaken; for the use of the radio and press publicity. One could almost go so far as to say that the hon. the Minister of Information could learn a point or two from the hon. Minister of Finance on how to publicize things outside the country. Mr. Speaker, although we offer our congratulations, we cannot hide the fact, as has already been stressed, that there are a number of unsatisfactory features in this Bill and in the whole concept of what has been laid before us. The first which has been dealt with already but which must be hammered home is these wide discretionary powers given to the Commissioner. We know that discretionary powers in the hands of a Commissioner is nothing new. We also know that the Commissioner does not like discretionary powers. It is part of this change-over which makes discretionary powers necessary. There are innumerable discretionary powers. Section 21<i>bis</i> contains as much wording on discretionary powers as on anything else. It is true that these discretionary powers in the main will cease as soon as this tax holiday has been completed but there are others that will follow us into perpetuity. For example, the provisional taxpayer in his first two estimates is required to make an estimate of not less than an amount equivalent to the taxable income for the proceeding year of assessment. He can only make a lesser estimate with the consent of the Receiver. So from now until the Bill is changed if a person finds himself in the position of having to make his first or second provisional return for a lesser amount than he would have paid for the equivalent period in the previous year, he must have the consent of the Receiver of Revenue. It is true that the taxpayer has the right of appeal to the special court and thereafter to the normal court but basically he is in the hands of the Receiver, let ns make no mistake about the situation. It has been said earlier in this House to-day that people will underpay as a result of the provisional estimates. I do not believe that that will be the case. <i>I</i> believe that they can just as easily over-pay because of the penalty that is imposed should they under-pay. You know, Sir, there is a certain fear complex in the ordinary citizen of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue and the Receiver of Revenue. It is like when you go to your bank manager in regard to your overdraft. You go there with a certain feeling of trepidation. I hope the hon. the Minister of Finance will one day change the image of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue and that of the Receiver of Revenue, those people who raise certain fears in the mind of the taxpayer. What people are going to do is to over-estimate their income and not under-estimate it because of the penalties that are involved.</p>

<p>Small businesses very often write up their books only once a year. They have no knowledge whatsoever until the end of the year or well into the following year what their profit or loss was. Many big businesses do not get their accounts out before three to six months after the end of the financial year. I agree that from a business point of view it is bad but the purpose of P.A.Y.E. is not to improve the business standards in the country. I should like to ask the hon. the Minister how many extensions of time for payment of tax he is called upon to give each year. Not because that they cannot pay but because they have not got the information to complete their forms. There must be hundreds upon hundreds. Now to expect them to estimate up to 90 per cent of what their income was, is to expect the impossible. Why not one or two months grace? I know that basically the proposals are that we should pay our tax in the period we earn the income. But surely at the 12th month we should be given one or two months in which to determine what our income was during the previous 12 months. Sir, the uncertainty of this situation is bad. I hope that the hon. the Minister together with his Department will be able to find some yardstick in the future with which a man will be able to measure his income so that this uncertainty can be done away with; a yardstick such as turnover, just to take one out of the air.</p>

<p>Secondly, Sir, it seems to me that every person whose income is not entirely straightforward will be asking the Receiver for a directive. For example, if a man was divorced before March, 1962 and he pays his ex-wife maintenance, he will ask the Receiver for a directive as to what he can deduct. If a man earned a salary and commission, but paid his own car expenses and other expenses, he will have to get a directive from the Receiver as to what he can deduct If a man is a commission agent and he employs sub-agents and pays them sub-commission, he will have to return his commission less the two deductions that are permitted and he will have to ask for a directive in regard to the amount he pays to his sub-agents. If a company director receives a <span class="col_349-350" refersTo="page_0189"/>reimbursable allowance for entertainment he will have to get a directive. This is all necessary, Mr. Speaker, because only two deductions are permitted, that is contributions to a pension fund and rebates for children. One is not attacking the principle, Sir, one understands the problems. We are trying to help to see if some formula cannot be found. For example, would it not be possible where a deduction has been allowed for, say, two to three years previously to deduct that automatically and save the trouble of getting a directive? There is a further problem connected with directives, and that is that it is the employer who has to apply for the directive. You may well have the situation where the employee does not wish to disclose certain facts to his employer yet he is not in the position to ask for the directive. As I understand the position it has to be made by the employer. If a man is an agent of a company and unbeknown to bis employer he employs 10 or 12 sub-agents, before he can have the sub-commissions deducted he must go to his employer and ask him to apply for a directive to say that he can deduct the sub-commission he pays to his subagents. If I am right in my thesis I think the Bill can be improved in that an employee should be able to apply for a directive direct, and a directive simply in figures not in substance or reason could then be issued to his employer saying &#x201C;You are permitted to deduct so much from this man&#x2019;s salary before making your tax calculations&#x201D;, That brings me to my third point. Sir. It seems to me there is little doubt that on the legislation as it is before us we are going to pay more and not less in the main than our actual taxes. This is a matter that has been dealt with by a number of other members in the House. In the case of a salaried man he will get his refund at the end of the year because he is undoubtedly going to over-pay. He cannot deduct his medical expenses, he cannot deduct his insurance, he cannot deduct any allowance for dependants or any other item except the two expenditures allowed for in the Bill. So he will over-pay. In the case of the provisional taxpayer he cannot make these deductions either and he must wait patiently for a refund one day although he has the right to apply. It seems to me wrong in principle that the average taxpayer should be a permanent creditor of the Government of the Republic. I think it was rightly said that rather pay a smaller amount and let the Government collect the final amount than that we should all be creditors of the Government. There are a number of other matters which crop up. There is the problem of those people whose incomes fluctuate and who are near the deadline for tax. There is the problem of persons who receive housing and/or rations. There is the problem of whether a commission man is an agent or a principal. I have read much on this question of P.A.Y.E. and on this question of a man who earns a commission there seems to be an enormous amount of conflict because some say you must deduct ten per cent&#x2014;that was in the <i>Cape Times,</i> I think&#x2014;whereas others say he is a principal. I would ask the hon. the Minister to have this point clarified. There are tens of thousands of people employed in the Republic who work on commission and commission only. I think it should be clarified very quickly whether they are principals or agents.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have complete sympathy for the hon. the Minister and his staff in this vast problem they have undertaken. I hope that the criticism we have made so far has been in the spirit of helpfulness, if the hon. the Minister cannot deal expeditiously with all those matters that are going to arise under P.A.Y.E. There are many he knows nothing about at the moment and many that we know nothing about. We hope, however, that in setting up this vast change he and his Department have made all the changes that are necessary to absorb the work and the problems If they do that, as we hope they will, we will be happy to come back to this House and compliment them once again as we have done any times from this side of the House on the preliminary work that was put in. But if they do not it will not be the Department on whose neck our criticism will fall but that of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>There is only one other suggestion I would like to make. With all the vexed problems that will be arising constantly, the taxpayer, and particularly the professional man who deals with taxes, will be thirsting for information. We know that the Department issues many rulings to its own staff. In the main those rulings are completely unknown to either the taxpayer or his adviser. I would like the hon. the Minister to consider whether where matters of that nature come before the Department and departmental rulings are given and there is no real need for secrecy as an internal matter, those rulings should be made available to the taxpayer and his adviser. I think if that is done it will save not only the taxpayer but the Minister and his Department many a day of headaches.</p>

<speech by="#field">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Every speaker who has spoken so far in this discussion has stated first the good principles involved in this Bill and all have gone on afterwards to draw attention to the many difficulties that will arise. They have put forward various suggestions for improvements to be made. It seems to me that the point is to weigh up the advantages in the principles and the many disadvantages not only to the Government but to the taxpayer who will have to face these many problems. The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) maintained that the benefits to be derived from the even spread of money throughout the year outweighed all other disadvantages. It seems to me that that hon. member has lost his sense of proportion in putting that forward. The amount that will be spread in that way is limited to the small amount of taxation that is paid by a small number of the taxpayers of the community, particularly those who are the <span class="col_351-352" refersTo="page_0190"/>smallest of the taxpayers. Therefore the point that he makes that this outweighs all other disadvantages is quite a minor consideration. I think his sense of proportion has gone all wrong. I think there are many much more weighty considerations that we should take into account. It seems to me that there are really only two benefactors from this Bill. The main benefactor, of course, being the Government and the wage earner. The question as to whether the wage earner will reap any benefit is quite a moot point. I was particularly interested in the remarks of the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. v. d. Heever) who was actually the chairman of the Select Committee. He drew attention to the fact that the wage earner would be over taxed throughout the year; that he could have been drawing interest on the money which he has paid to the Government. I was particularly struck by his statement that many difficulties had been presented to the Committee, that the Committee had put forward many difficulties but that eventually the Bill had been accepted under pressure. [Interjections.] The word he actually used was * dwang &#x2019;. I made a note of the word as he used it. I feel that the benefits in this case are almost entirely with the Government. They will get their taxes in earlier; they will receive interest on the taxpayer&#x2019;s money in advance; the employer will act as tax collectors for them; the employers will be the buffer between the Government and the taxpayer.</p>

<p>The extra amount which the Government will collect, to my mind, is really very inconsiderable in comparison with the many disadvantages which this method of taxation will bring about not only in the additional work which will devolve upon the tax collecting department but to my mind it is the inconvenience to the country that we must really take into account. Some of these have been raised in the Select Committee.</p>

<p>A number of speakers have given the impression to this House that nearly all the bodies that gave evidence before the Select Committee had supported the scheme. I find, in looking at appendix B * Summary of the Opinions Expressed in Representations submitted to the Committee &#x2019;, that a great deal was said against it. The scheme was rejected entirely by the Chartered Institute of Secretaries. &#x201C;Support the introduction of the scheme for employees but are opposed to its extension to self-employed persons and companies&#x201D; included the Association of Chambers of Commerce of S.A.. the Steel and Engineering Industries. South African Motor Industry Employers Association, National Federation of Building Trade Employers, S.A. Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors and the Joint Council of the Societies of the Chartered Accountants of South Africa. All those supported the scheme only in a very qualified measure and considered that the benefit of being excluded from the scheme should be extended to many others besides farmers.</p>

<p>Then I find that a number of others considered that farmers, short-term insurers and professional men should be excluded from the scheme. Those included the South African Agricultural Union, the National Wool Growers Association, the Umfolozi Co-operative Sugar Planters, the Insurance Councils, the Societies of Cape of Good Hope and Transvaal Law.</p>

<p>Some supported the scheme in principle but considered that the implementation thereof should be postponed to afford an opportunity for further study. These included the Gold Producers&#x2019; Committee of the Transvaal and Die Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut. &#x201C;Memoranda confined to criticism of certain of the administrative proposals &#x201D;&#x2014;South African Insurance Employers Association, Association of Pension and Provident Funds, South African Trade Union Council, Cape Society of Accountants and Messrs. Goldbly, Panchaud and Webber. So by far the largest proportion of those who gave evidence were either opposed to the scheme or gave it very qualified support or considered that the benefit of being excluded from the scheme should be extended to others besides farmers.</p>

<p>I find that there are many other new considerations besides those put forward by these bodies who gave evidence and I want to refer to one point raised by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker). He pointed out a number of the difficulties that farmers will have to contend with. I maintain that one of the points he raised applies in a great many other directions besides the farmers. That was the point that there will be many small contractors or workers who work for a short period at a wage which is above the rate of R600 per annum but who do not work the whole year. So after the employer has submitted their taxation it will be found that they were not required to pay tax and they will be put to a great deal of trouble in getting a refund; in many cases they will not get it back at all. I think that is one of the basic difficulties that will be encountered. a difficulty which will increase and not diminish within the next few years as this scheme is put into operation.</p>

<p>As was said before, this scheme was taken over from highly developed countries. In those countries practically every worker, skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled, are all in the taxation ranks. Whereas here in South Africa four-fifths of the workers, mainly the unskilled workers, pay poll tax and do not at present fall within the range of this new scheme. These workers will now gradually work up into the range of this scheme. Gradual increases in wages will bring these people into the scheme and more and more we will have the difficulty of people falling within the range of the scheme for two months in the year and then not qualifying by the end of the year. That will greatly increase the difficulties of those who employ them. This fact will be emphasized and intensified by the Government&#x2019;s policy of migratory labour.</p>

<p>That is a point which has been left out of account; I have not heard it mentioned anywhere. Those people work for short periods and are away from their work for the balance <span class="col_353-354" refersTo="page_0191"/>of the year. The irritations involved with that will increase from time to time. I feel that that point alone is one of the major points which will make it difficult to apply this Bill and which is going to cause more and more irritations. I feel that whatever good principles this Bill may possess it should have been left over until the labour of South Africa was on a more permanent and settled basis. It could then have been introduced with similar conditions as apply in the more developed countries from which we have taken this legislation. I feel that that position might possibly have been reached in some 25 years&#x2019; time and that this Bill has been introduced altogether prematurely.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the Minister and I could not find any reason why this Bill should come into operation this year. Why the rush? I suggest to him, as has been suggested before, that there are very few receivers of revenue in the countryside who understand this Bill. Our unfortunate magistrates are the most overworked people and their officials and their offices are very heavily over-worked. They are the people who will have to explain this scheme to us. I wonder how many of them really know the full implications and the workings of this Bill. I have an auditor who belongs to a firm with a world-wide reputation. About a month ago I asked him for advice and he could not give me the full details. Tomorrow I am fetching my farm manager to have two or three hours&#x2019; discussion with him. He has not got the forms and the books yet so as to explain the position. We suggested in the Select Committee that it should be introduced next year. This unnecessary haste will create nothing less than chaos and confusion throughout the country. From the 1st of March we are all going to become unpaid civil servants. At the end of the following March we will still be servants but I wonder how civil we will be after we have done this job. Think of the extra expense. Practically every farmer will now have to employ a bookkeeper to make his returns. We suggested that it should be deferred till 1964 so that the officials&#x2014;I am not talking about the very senior officials&#x2014; could get more accustomed to the whole idea and understand it better. As my hon. friend said just now in great industrial countries like Great Britain people earning from &#x00A3;100 upwards have to pay tax. They have grown up with it; they have seen it develop; they have lived with the scheme. We have hundreds of thousands of people in this country who are not fully educated or partly educated and who do not understand this scheme. You do not employ those people under contract. In other countries they would be under contract to build a dam or a shed, but here you simply employ them by the day because they do not understand a contract and do not know how to work out the cost or their pay. Those people are going to suffer grave injustices. The hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) referred to me as the, eenvoudige boertjie&#x2019;. I will rather be a, eenvoudige boertjie&#x2019; than a &#x2018;politieke boertjie&#x2019; like all those members over there. On the farm the farmer often hires a man to put up a building. You hire him for a month or two and you pay him R3 per day. At that rate he gets R78 per month which is about R936 per annum. You will have to make a deduction in that catogorie of income and pay it over to the Receiver of Revenue, though a full year&#x2019;s income might be under R400. True he gets a certificate to show that he has paid; it is true that he can ask for a refund. But with the amount of work that the officials will have to cope with when is that man going to be refunded? He might be out of work for the next two or three months; what does he eat in the meantime? That is one of the points which I think is most important. I an concerned about the unfortunate man who cannot protect himself; who does not know how to go about this business. I feel that those are the people who have not been considered in this matter at all. You try to get a refund on a railway ticket and you will realize how many months that takes. These people will have to wait so much longer because there are going to be so many claims on the officials&#x2019; time.</p>

<p>Another point is the value which is placed on free food and housing. I should like the Minister to give us some idea as to how that is going to work. I have tried to find that out from various sources but have been unable to do so. The value which is placed on his house and food may well bring him into the tax-paying category. It is an important matter. to-day I build a house of at least six rooms for the Coloureds on my farm. In a town that would be let at about &#x00A3;12 or &#x00A3;15, but it is not worth that on a farm. The same applies to his rations, his meat etc. It largely depends on whether the Government is going to place a value on that or whether the farmer will do so. Then you come to the man who shears once a year. In our area they shear from August to September/October. He has made his estimate for his income. But in December his wheat crop fails and he finds that he cannot meet the interest on his mortgage or he has to buy certain essential machinery. So he decides to shear short wool in March or April. In other words he gets a year and a half&#x2019;s clip in one year and a half a clip the next year. He will be hopelessly wrong in his estimates because an unforeseen contingency arose. That is a very serious matter. When the farmer made his estimate he had no idea that it would be necessary for him to do that in the near future.</p>

<p>What worries me too are the terrfying powers which are being given to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. I deal with Bellville and I have found the officials there very courteous and very helpful. If they find that you are not out to evade taxation they will help you in every way possible. You will remember, Sir, some time back the Commissioner for Inland Revenue added a Schedule I to the income-tax forms. In that Schedule I you were called upon to say how you spent your money in the last year. Sir, who can remember whom <span class="col_355-356" refersTo="page_0192"/>you tipped or whether you backed slow horses. My view is this that once you have paid your taxes what little remains over belongs to you and you can spend it as you like. But he actually added that Schedule I. Pressure was, however, brought to bear on him and he was made to withdraw it. But that gives you an idea of what a man can do if his powers are too great. Therefore I say that these terrifying powers are almost worthy of a dictator. It is a dangerous thing. There is no relief; you cannot argue, you cannot refuse to pay, you cannot go anywhere else to defend yourself; you are in the hands of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. I think that these penalties which can be applied to perfectly innocent people are very serious and I do hope the Minister will consider it very carefully, anyhow for the first year.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister in introducing this Bill said that he was a reformer on taxes and he said that he enjoyed the role of the reformer. The hon. the Minister will know of course that the role of the reformer is a hard one and during the course of this debate we on this side of the House, while agreeing to the Bill in principle, have been endeavouring to show the Minister some of the difficulties he will have to face. Members on the Government side have tried to reassure the Minister. Time will tell during the next twelve months whether those difficulties we foresee will so easily disappear. At this point I would like to take exception to the remark made by the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) who suggested that the farmers were not represented on this side of the House on the Select Committee. Mr. Speaker, we were appointed on the Select Committee to deal with taxation and I challenge that hon. member to show that in respect of any point during the whole course of that Select Committee our side was not prepared to look after the interests of the farming community. This Bill was discussed objectively by all sides, and if you look through the voting that took place from time to time, you will find that the voting was not on party lines, but on the merits of the subject before the Select Committee.</p>

<p>The Minister, I think, will concede that one of the reasons why he has got so much support for this Bill outside is because of the tax holiday. Might I suggest that if he wants to achieve success in the administration of the Act, he would be wise not only to grant a tax holiday but also a penalty holiday. Reference has been made from time to time during the course of this debate to the very wide powers of the Commissioner for Inland Revenue. Hon. members have referred during the course of the debate to the farmer, to the small businessman, but no reference has been made to the ordinary salaried worker, and it is the middle income group who, I fear, are going to be caught by the incidence of this Bill. You see, Mr. Speaker, there are going to be many workers who earn a moderate salary and whose wives are working in factories or in offices, and for reasons best known to themselves, possibly because they thought they were clever, they have not disclosed their wives&#x2019; income. They are going to be caught up under this new arrangement. The wife&#x2019;s deduction will be made by the employer concerned, the husband&#x2019;s deduction will be made by his employer, and then the Commissioner for Inland Revenue will discover that these people are showing their income at the end of the term, and the Commissioner for Inland Revenue will then say: &#x201C;Mr. So-and-So, over the past year income is shown in respect of yourself and your wife, but in previous years no return has been made of the income of your wife. Did your wife work?</p>

<p>What is wrong with that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>He may find that the wife has been working in the past but that there has not been a disclosure of her income. The Commissioner for Inland Revenue has the power to go back over several years. The Commissioner knows that he has these powers and he has also the power to exact penalties. I think the Commissioner for Inland Revenue could take a leaf out of the book of the Minister of Justice. The Minister of Justice knows that it is illegal for certain people to have fire-arms, and so for some time past he has closed his eyes to the law and has given people a certain time to register their fire-arms. In that way he has been very successful in getting unlicensed fire-arms registered. I suggest that if the hon. the Minister wants this Bill to work, there will be many cases of people who have been dodgers in the past and who will be terrified of having their past exposed, and this will be an opportunity to close that whole gap. I suggest that if in a case like this the Minister will give a penalty holiday, he might be more successful in getting the administration of this Act working smoothly and quicker than he would in the ordinary way.</p>

<p>This Bill provides for a reform and as the hon. the Minister says will also enable him to collect his taxes monthly. It will also have this advantage that we can expect better budgeting from the Minister in future. As the ordinary taxpayer will have his tax deducted each month, the Commissioner for Inland Revenue will have monthly collections of tax and we will expect better budgeting from the Minister. He will know his monthly expenditure because this House will have approved of such expenditure in advance and he will know his monthly revenue because he will be collecting it monthly. May I say that I hope the Minister will discourage the Commissioner for Inland Revenue from making the year end for all companies on the 28th February. I submit that as taxes will be collected monthly from employees and as employers and companies will be encouraged to give an estimate in advance, it is a matter of indifference to the Minister when the year-end of a company is. Because if he persists in the practice of the past of making all companies as far as possible end on the <span class="col_357-358" refersTo="page_0193"/>30th June, it is only a matter of time before he gets the same bottleneck at the end of February as he has had at the end of June.</p>

<p>Under the Bill they have got a choice.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is so, but I hope that as they have a choice, pressure will not be brought to bear on them by the Revenue Department to discourage them from maintaining the old year and that persuasion will not be employed by the Minister&#x2019;s department to get companies to end on the 28th February. If it is the attitude of the department to try and persuade people to end the financial year at the end of February to suit the convenience of bookkeeping, then it is only a matter of time before we have another bottleneck again.</p>

<p>This Bill is also discriminatory. It discriminates between different types of taxpayers. There are reasons for that which have been shown during the course of the debate. There is, however, one discrimination I fail to appreciate and that is where the Act makes a difference between farmers and farm companies. The farmer has an option, but a farm company has no option. A farm company has to be a provisional taxpayer e.g. you might have a man who leaves his farm to his three sons who decide to form a private company to save arguments and discussions later on. They register themselves as a private company in which the three sons are equal shareholders, with the understanding that if at any future time any transfer has to be effected, it will only be a matter of transferring shares. In effect, that is virtually a farming organization, but under this Bill as it stands a farming company will not have the option which the farmer gets.</p>

<p>Would your argument also apply to fishermen and fishing companies and to diamond-mining companies?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The farmer is given a special privilege and a farming company which is only interested in farming operations is discriminated against. I see no reason for such discrimination. I hope the hon. the Minister will give me reasons for this discrimination. The hon. the Minister knows that when it comes to diamond-mining companies, you do not have a solitary individual who goes and digs his own diamonds. Fishing companies is also a different matter. If you have four or five fishermen who form a private company, the same would apply. The position is different from a farming company which is a proprietary company consisting of three or four farmers who are virtually the only shareholders as against a farming company which is an investment company. A farming company which is an investment company is analogous to the diamond company or a fishing company in which public money is invested. I suggest that where a farming company is only a proprietary company and the only shareholders are individual farmers, some consideration should be given.</p>

<p>This Bill deals with reforms and the main reform is going to be tested in the hard school of experience, and while we could discuss various examples for a considerable time, it is only in actual practice where difficulties can be ironed out. We cannot foresee all the difficulties which will crop up. A number of difficulties have been foreshadowed. Many members have allowed their imagination to run wild by quoting various examples, and we have tried to anticipate many difficulties. But there will be other difficulties and the solution thereof depends largely on the attitude of the Department of Inland Revenue, and the attitude of that department will depend largely on the attitude of the hon. the Minister. I counsel the hon. the Minister to have a penalty holiday of at least twelve months, and to deal with this Bill sympathetically if he wants it to be a success.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to commence by thanking hon. members very heartily for the varying degrees of support they have given to this Bill. It reminded me of the story about the Scottish farmer. His wife could not go to church that morning because she had to cook, so she told him, &#x201C;Sandy, you go, then you can come and tell me what the parson preached about.&#x201D; Sandy went and when he returned she asked him, &#x201C;Do you know what the text was? &#x201D;. He said, &#x201C;No, I don&#x2019;t.&#x201D; She asked, &#x201C;What did the parson preach about? &#x201D;. He replied, &#x201C;Sin &#x201D;. &#x201C;But what did he say about sin? &#x201D;. Sandy scratched his head and said, &#x201C;I gathered he was against it.&#x201D; I am now under the impression also that hon. members opposite are not against the Bill but in favour of it. And on my own side of the House also, as I read the debate, the principle is generally accepted that everybody is desirous of making improvements to the Bill. In that respect I welcome the remarks made here, all the suggestions for improving the Bill. I accept it in that spirit.</p>

<p>It will now be very clear to you, Sir, that it is very difficult for me again to draft the whole Bill <i>de novo</i> as a result of the suggestions made here. That is almost an impossible task. Before replying to specific questions, I just want to deal with a few points.</p>

<p>The first point I wish to make is that this Bill breaks new ground. It is true that there i&gt; such legislation in other countries, but this Bill is different from the legislation in other countries. I am glad to learn from the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) that this Bill is less complicated than the laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada. It was in fact our object to make this legislation as simple as possible, simple to understand and to make it easy to collect the taxes. But the qualifying words here are &#x201C;as possible&#x201D;, It is not something one can oversimplify. and therefore I am glad to hear the tribute from the hon. member for Springs that <span class="col_359-360" refersTo="page_0194"/>the draughtsmen of this Bill succeeded in making it less complicated than the laws in other countries where this experiment has been made. But it still remains an experiment, and from the very nature of the matter there will be shortcomings in this Bill. There will be shortcomings and after experimentation, after gaining experience in the hard school of practice, we shall have to decide how it should be remedied. It is no use having discussions here for hours as to what we think is best. Now is the time to pass the Bill and then during the first year or more to see what the defects are in practice&#x2014;not as we thought or argued, but what are the defects in practice, and then it will be the time to come to the House to ask for this or that amendment.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that we should wait another year. Do you know what the position will be if we come with it again in a year's time? The people will not in the meantime have become cleverer in regard to this Bill. There is a very important principle in pedagogy, and that is &#x201C;learn by doing ". By doing a thing one learns much more about it than merely by discussing it, and if we put this Bill on the statute book everybody in the country will know much more about it and its implications in the next year than they would have known if we had said that we would give them another year in which to study the Bill. That is simply not human nature, but if they are placed in the position where they have to apply it in practice they will, in their own interests, learn much more about it in this period, and then we can come back at the end of that period and see what the defects are and how they should He remedied.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to discuss is the fines referred to.</p>

<p>It has been asked from various sides that the Commissioner should be somewhat conciliatory and lenient and that he should not demand his pound of flesh in very case. To that I want to reply immediately that as far as I am concerned it will be my instruction to the Commissioner and to the various Receivers of Revenue not to impose the fines in every case where the person, the taxpayer, can satisfy them that the mistake he made was a <i>bona fide</i> one. I do not want us to grant a complete holiday from fines, because the fines have a wholesome effect on the people who consciously and deliberately make mistakes. Therefore I want to put it this way. that the fines should be there because otherwise there will be large-scale evasion. But in every case where a fine could be applied but where the person to whom it would have been applicable is able to convince the Commissioner or a Receiver of Revenue that his mistake was not made deliberately, the Commissioner or the Receiver will act leniently. We realise, and I am sure the Department will realise, that we are now entering a period of adaptation for this new legislation, this new system we are applying, and that in fact it is a school, and whilst one is still learning one should not be treated as strictly as when one has finished school and has started practising. I do not only want them to adopt a sympathetic attitude in respect of fines only. I also want the Department in other respects to be as conciliatory and as sympathetic as possible during the first year. They should not become impatient with people who make a mistake here or there, but they should act as patiently and sympathetically as possible, and with as much understanding as possible, and they should take by the hand the people who need guidance, and not treat them curtly and discourage them.</p>

<p>A third point I wish to make is that, as I said in the beginning, we have had a Select Committee. I am very grateful to them for the work they have put into this Bill. They have given us a Bill and although I do not regard that Bill as the law of the Medes and the Persians which cannot be changed, I still think that our deviations from it should be as few as possible. The Bill produced by them has been thoroughly investigated. The points I have introduced here are points which did not pertinently come to their notice. In the one case, where we allow the option to continue until 30th June 1965. I said that if before that time a sound case is made out for prolonging the period of the option still further, I would consider it. I do not want to promise to do so, but if a good case is made out before that time I am prepared to consider very seriously and sympathetically extending that period beyond 30th June 1965. I do not think it will be necessary, because I think by that time people will have become so accustomed to the Act that it will not be necessary further to extend the option period.</p>

<p>Many suggestions have been made here to-day and I shall deal with the most important of them, those which affect the principle. Many suggestions have also been made which deviate from the principles already accepted by the Select Committee. I think, e.g., of the suggestion that whereas we now provide that the provisional taxpayer should render his returns three times a year, we should make it twice. I cannot give any consideration to that. The Select Committee decided on three, and at this stage I would rather not tamper with their decisions too much.</p>

<p>I want to come to a few of the more important points raised, and then I shall deal with a few of the minor problems. The first point I wish to deal with is the over-deduction from salaries. That is the point particularly dealt with by the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever). As the position is now, there is a measure of overpayment which is inevitable. The medical expenses are not taken into account, nor insurance premiums, nor the rebate for dependants. All three of these things are very difficult to determine beforehand. One will only know what the medical expenses are at the end of the year. Insurance premiums can be altered at any time of the year; the number of dependants may increase or decrease during the course of the year. Nor are they automatic, like the rebate for children. In every case <span class="col_361-362" refersTo="page_0195"/>certain things must be proved. Those are difficulties with which we are faced, and we have set out from the standpoint that there will inevitably be some measure of over-payment by salaried workers, but that it will be very small and insignificant. But we also felt that from the administrative point of view it would be preferable to make repayments at the end of the year, rather than to make further collections. Not only is that what we felt, but we also know from experience that the problems in regard to collections can be very serious. That is also the experience in other countries like Australia and the U.S.A., where similar forms of taxation apply to what we are now proposing. The object is as nearly as possible to deduct the exact amount every month. But in regard to the overwhelming majority of salaried people there are repayments. That is our experience. In other words, experience shows that even though they try to get as near as possible there is always some measure of over-payment in the case of salaried people. In the United States the percentage of salaried people who receive repayments at the end of the year is 70 per cent and in Australia it is 95 per cent. Now the reason for the over-deductions is very interesting. It is ascribed to various factors. Fear of the fine is not a cause which is mentioned, but one cause which is in fact mentioned is that some taxpayers regard it as a kind of compulsory saving and deliberately pay more than they should pay in terms of the tables. They prefer to have a higher assessment every month. Now it is very interesting that e.g. in Australia the Commonwealth Treasurer expressed the following opinion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under-deduction of course leads in turn to the issue of debit assessments which would be ill received by the employees affected and could pose a serious administrative problem in collection. Quite possibly the present number of debit assessments of less than 200.000 would be raised to as many as 1, 600,000.</block>

<block name="quote">The overriding consideration for the Government in the operation of the pay-as-you-earn scheme is to strike a fair balance between administrative advantages of the system, the interests of employees and the work-load involved for employers. This is certainly not an easy balance to strike, but I feel that the present system does in fair measure achieve it.</block>

<p>Still we find that under that system 95 per cent of the wage-earners must be given a repayment at the end of the year because to some extent they made an over-payment every month, whilst the fact that certain deductions still had to be made was not taken into account.</p>

<p>I do feel that I should devote attention to the desirability of making the margin as small as possible. If there is over-payment it must be as little as possible. I shall devote my attention to that. It is no easy matter. We cannot take into account rebates for dependants and insurance premiums and deductions for medical expenses. That we cannot do, but perhaps we can collect a smaller amount than the actual figure in order to satisfy the people that an over-payment is not demanded from them beforehand. I shall go into that. But as I said, the experience in other countries is that there are appreciable over-payments and that the people welcome it. Many of them do so deliberately because they regard it as a form of compulsory saving. At the end of the year, they receive something which they have saved without actually realizing that they were saving.</p>

<p>I want to come to another point, the question of repayments. Many hon. members discussed that. I have now spoken of wage-earners, employees. If there is an overpayment in their case it is repaid automatically. I think there is some measure of misunderstanding. In the case of wage-earners the repayment of any over-payment is automatic, only in the case of the provisional taxpayer it is not automatic, but it can be repaid on application. The reason why it cannot be automatic is because we have now accepted the single account system in our latest legislation. In other words, we consider that all the debt of an individual to the State by way of taxation, whether it is arrear debt or whether it is for the current year, and whether it is for the province or for the Central Government, all of that constitutes one single debt owing to one creditor. It is not that one now owes some money here and some money there and that there are various provisions in regard to fines if one does not pay in time. There is now a uniform system and there is only one account. That simplifies the accounts and facilitates the collection. Because we have that system now, a provisional taxpayer, if he owes arrear taxation and he has made an over-payment, will not be given back the over-payment, but it will be used to pay his debt, because it is now one current account which is kept for him. But on the other hand I want to say that whereas it is now practically certain that there will be a small measure of over-payment in the case of salaried people because certain rebates are not taken into account, over-payments by provisional taxpayers will seldom take place because these persons, in calculating their liability, will take into consideration all deductions and rebates. They will do so themselves, and therefore the possibility of a repayment to them at the year will really be so exceptional that I do not think it is necessary to do anything further in that regard in view of the fact that we have difficulty in regard to our electronic computer. It has been suggested that in the few cases where over-payments may take place, repayments should be made on demand. Now I will tell hon. members why I say &#x201C;may be made on demand&#x201D;. If someone to-day has a credit of R20 in that account (an over-payment was made when he last paid), and in a short while afterwards his next payment falls due, surely it is foolish to repay that R20 to him to-day if within a week or a fortnight he has to pay another R40.</p>

<p>Will he know about it?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>He will know about it, because he can make application and the Commissioner must approve the repayment, and the Commissioner will tell him: This is the position; you have made an over-payment but it is a small amount and it was used in respect of the debt you incurred in the past, or it will be set off against the next payment within a week or a fortnight. But if he can make out a sound case, the Receiver will give it back to him. However, we cannot make it automatic. That position would simply be impossible as the result of the limitations of the computer, in view of the fact that we have now accepted the single account system. That is only in the case of the provisional taxpayer. The wage-earner&#x2019;s is automatic.</p>

<p>Now I come to another opinion which has been expressed here by various hon. members. I think the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. Van den Heever) mentioned it first. I refer to the proposal that where employees request their employers to deduct from their salaries bigger amounts than those prescribed in the relevant tables, the employer should be obliged to comply with the request, provided the Receiver of Revenue agrees to it. I think that is the proposal. Well, I think this is one of the matters that we considered very carefully and there are certain difficulties in that regard that I want to mention. The first is that if it is made compulsory we run the risk that the employers will be dissatisfied. We have repeatedly given the employers the assurance in the course of these preparations that they will not be obliged to comply with such requests from employees. We are committed to a certain extent therefore in this connection. But the position may still arise that the employee applies for it, that the employer has no objection and that the Commissioner agrees. What is to happen then? Then there is another difficulty and I am pleased that to some extent the hon. member for Standerton (Dr. Coertze) has given the reply on this point to the difficulty I have. This additional deduction over and above the prescribed deduction will also enjoy preference now over other amounts which have to be withheld from employees, which have to be deducted from their salaries. We are also changing the priority of debts in the case of insolvency. In the event of insolvency, as the hon. member has correctly said, if there has been an over-payment the Commissioner will only take what is due to him, and he will then be able to hand over to the trustee the amount overpaid to be used in terms of the Act. I think that is the reply so far as insolvency is concerned, but there are also other amounts such as amounts collected, for example, in terms of Court orders for the maintenance of a child and which also have to be deducted by the employer from the employee&#x2019;s wage and if there is not sufficient for that purpose it may be that eventually the surplus will come back to the taxpayer, and it might just as well go back to the person who is entitled to it, and that is the wife who obtained the Order of Court. There are difficulties, however; but I shall go into this matter further. I do not want to act hastily. In any event I want to say that I do not propose to ask for the Committee Stage immediately. I want to put the amendments that I propose to move, on the Order Paper so that hon. members can also consider them. If hon. members also wish to bring about amendments I shall be very pleased if they will put them on the Order Paper. But the question of an increased deduction is one which I should like to go into a little further to see what can be done&#x2014;not to make it compulsory&#x2014;but to see what can be done where the employee asks for it, the employer has no objection and the Commissioner is satisfied with it. At the moment it is not possible to do so.</p>

<p>I think these are the three main points which have been made here. Then there is another point which has been made in respect of deserted wives and the position as far as they are concerned. The normal case of a husband whose wife works, presents no difficulty. The rebate is given to the husband and that is why the wife pays comparatively more than the husband, but the position is rectified because if there is any amount to be paid in the husband is asked to pay it, not the wife. The joint sum that they pay in must be the same as the amount which they would have paid if they had received one assessment as a family unit. Under the present system the position is the same because if the husband applies for a separate assessment, his wife will be in the same position as is the case here, if the husband pays separately, the various rebates and deductions are taken into account, but in the other case where the wife has been deserted by her husband and she does not know what his address is, or where he is unable to pay anything and she has to take care of her children alone, we have said that all that the deserted wife has to do in such cases is simply to approach the Commissioner and obtain a directive from him to her employer to make deductions which will be more in line with her eventual tax obligation.</p>

<p>A few other minor issues have been raised. The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) has referred to the question of reimbursive allowances and the fact that sometimes the employee does not wish to give his employer the facts; he prefers to go direct to the Receiver. It is only in the case of reimbursive allowances that the employer has to obtain a directive from the Receiver. In other cases, for example where the employee incurs expense in obtaining his renumeration, the employee has to obtain the directive from the Receiver. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has raised the question as to whether there can be any delegation of power. In this regard I have this note here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_365-366" refersTo="page_0197"/>Section 3(1) of the Income Tax Act may be exercised or performed by the Commissioner personally or by any officer engaged in carrying out the provisions of the Act under the control, direction or supervision of the Commissioner.</block>

<p>In other words, there is no necessity for a specific delegation in any particular case.</p>

<p>There are many other points which have been mentioned here. I have dealt here with some of the points which should really be dealt with in the Committee Stage and I have indicated where it is my intention to go into those points further. In other cases I have explained what the position is. Then there are the other cases which I have also mentioned here and which to my mind represent too much of a deviation from the recommendations of the Select Committee and which I would rather not take into account. I do not think that that is something that we should start with at this stage. I want to make an appeal again, not to hon. members but to the public that we should give this scheme a chance, in the first year particularly. If there are any shortcomings one way or another, let us be patient and tolerant, and let us try to see this year where there are hitches and defects and then we can come back to this House again. If hon. members discover defects they can write to the Department from time to time and we can then bring about the necessary amendments later on.</p>

<p>This is a very important Bill. I do not know whether hon. members are fully aware of it, but it has been referred to here as a great reform, which I think will have far-reaching consequences, not because the State will profit by it, as the hon. member for East London (North) has said. In actual fact the State is the taxpayer of South Africa, because if it collects a great deal of money here it will be to the benefit of the taxpayers and then there will be so much less money to obtain from the taxpayer by way of other taxes. In other words, any benefit that accrues to the State, benefits the taxpayers of South Africa as a whole and if any person evades taxation then it is not the Government in the first place that he is cheating but he is cheating all the other honest taxpayers, because the result of his evasion is that more money has to be collected from the other honest taxpayers. This is an important innovation. I know it goes without saying that every new system is always viewed with a certain amount of suspicion. I recall that when we introduced the decimal system there were many people too who had misgivings. But unless we come forward with new schemes we shall make no headway and, after all, we must go ahead. I think this is something which can contribute a great deal towards the progress of this country generally, and I therefore move.</p>
