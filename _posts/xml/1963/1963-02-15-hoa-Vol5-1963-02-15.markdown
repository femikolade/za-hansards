<question by="#van_der_merwe" to="#minister_of_justice">

<num>*XXVIII.</num>

<from>Mr. VAN DER MERWE (for Dr. de Wet)</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Justice:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 13 February 1963, that the movements of a doctor in Fordsburg have been restricted by law so that he could not visit patients who were dangerously ill; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#van_der_merwe">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>Yes, my attention was drawn to the report concerned in the <i>Cape Times</i> in which <i>inter alia</i> the words &#x201C;a doctor was also forbidden to visit his patients in three African townships&#x201D; appeared. My attention was also drawn to a banner report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> on Wednesday, 13 February 1963, of which the headlines were &#x201C;Shock ban on Doctor. He can&#x2019;t aid dangerously ill patients&#x201D;.</p>

<p>In the order concerned which was served on Dr. Kasi and which limits his movements to the district of Johannesburg where he <span class="col_1401-1402" refersTo="page_0715"/>practises and which prohibits him from entering certain Bantu townships the following words appear: &#x201C;Except for the sole purpose of attending on a person who <i>bona fide</i> requires your services as a medical practitioner.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Dr. Kasi has therefore not been prohibited from visiting his patients and the informant or informants of the newspapers concerned have therefore deliberately told them an untruth obviously with the intent that South Africa can and should again be besmirched thereby. I have no other explanation why the words quoted above were suppressed.</p>

<p>It is conspicuous that the newspapers concerned and in particular the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> gave the report so much prominence without ascertaining the correct position, more so because, according to its news reports, the said newspaper appears to have the closest contact with leftists and could accordingly very easily have obtained the information from Dr. Kasi himself.</p>

<li>(4) Yes. Irrespective of the fluctuation in prices between winter and summer and adjustments made from time to time, in accordance with the economic circumstances, the only drastic reduction in prices occurred on 1 December 1961. This was necessitated by the considerable surpluses which arose in 1961 and on which heavy losses were incurred. The position was further aggravated by the quota which was imposed on the importation of butter by the United Kingdom. Immediate steps had to be taken to stimulate the local demand which could only be effected by a reduction in consumer prices, which could only be accomplished by reduction in producer prices, and in the case of butter also an increase in Government subsidy.</li>

<p>In this connection I wish to refer to the Press statement issued by the hon. the Minister of the Interior on 23 November 1962, in regard to the general salary increase to public servants with effect from 1 January 1963. In regard to non-Europeans the hon. Minister announced that a general wage revision for non-Europeans is at present being investigated. Non-Europeans, who are paid according to approved salary scales, will, however, also receive a salary improvement of approximately one salary notch on the new key scale with effect from 1 January 1963.</p>

<heading>KEEP-RIGHT TRAFFIC RULE</heading>

<speech by="#de_villiers">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I move the motion standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House request the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to investigate the practicability and desirability of applying the keep-right traffic rule in the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>I want to put it to you, Mr. Speaker, that this motion does not ask the House to decide upon or to choose between the keep-left and the keep-right traffic rules; it asks for the appointment of a commission of inquiry and recommends to the Government that an investigation be made into the pros and cons of the matter. I want to start immediately by saying that to create and maintain order in the movements of modern man in our modern state is almost just as important as our foreign policy or our defence policy or any other aspect of our political economy. It is almost as important as peace and war to a modern state. This process of destruction which is in progress on our roads is just as effective as war and almost as expensive. In this connection, the Republic of South Africa has a fairly black record. I want to prove this by figures which were made available to us recently, not to show that it will be better to keep to the right of the road, but to show that one country can learn from another where there are figures which are reasonably comparable.</p>

<p>I want to compare our fatality rate with those of two countries in the Old World which are reasonably comparable, Britain and Germany, the populations of which are more or less the same, where in both cases there is one car for every five people, and where in the one case there are 9,000,000 cars and in the other case 10,000,000. In Western Germany <span class="col_1421-1422" refersTo="page_0725"/>the fatality rate is 265 per million, while in Britain it is 137 per million, almost half that figure. The fatality rate in West Germany is 1 per 710 cars while in Britain it is 1 per 1,300 cars. These two comparable countries give one completely different results. But there is another damning figure. I want to compare the Republic of South Africa with the United States. We only have 1,250,000 cars, while the U.S.A. has 74,000,000. Our fatality rate is 250 per million inhabitants and theirs is 211 per million. These figures do not differ so very much but in the Republic of South Africa we only have 1,250,000 cars and the fatality rate is 1 per 380 vehicles while in the U.S.A. with its 74,000,000 vehicles it is 1 per 2,000 vehicles. I mention these figures not because they form a pattern which proves that it is better to follow the one or the other rule of the road customs but I say that where the figures are at all comparable, one country can learn a great deal from another. Mr. Speaker, you will perhaps know better than I that a custom is something which dies hard. One is often afraid of an inquiry because one thinks that the result of the inquiry will clash with one&#x2019;s established customs, or that the findings of the inquiry will embarrass one and will require a greater effort from one in the future than is the case to-day. But as a matter of interest I want to show how many of our human customs spring from the fact that we have a left and a right hand and how the left-handedness or right-handedness of a person&#x2014;or rather, his right-handedness&#x2014;is directly connected with his habits and that many of these habits are not, as many of us may think, traditions, but merely habits.</p>

<p>If we were to say that men must button their jackets right over left, we would have a revolution, but the present custom merely springs from an old custom in the cloak-and-dagger days when men fastened their jackets in this way so that it was easy for them to draw their daggers. I want to hazard a guess &#x2014;I am not sure whether this is so&#x2014;why in the Old World people acquired the custom of driving on the left of a person coming towards them. I think this springs from medieval times&#x2014;from the days of the knight with his sword. If someone came towards him and there was a fight, he had to ensure that his enemy was on his left, and I also want to hazard a guess that the English idiom, &#x201C;Keep on the right side of a person&#x201D;, also has its origin there, because if a man approached another man in peace, he passed him on the right side. That is why I always try to keep on the right side, Mr. Speaker. Even the driver of a team of horses drove to the left of a person coming towards him because it was easier either to chat to him or to greet him, or even to fight him if necessary. I do not know of a country in the world where, for example, a plough throws the soil from right to left. They all throw the soil from left to right because the man holding the plough wants to walk on firm ground. We have too the old expression of &#x201C;to left and right&#x201D; (bakboord en stuurboord). The ancient Romans used to use the expression &#x201C;dexter&#x201D; and &#x201C;sinister&#x201D;. When the soldiers were standing on parade before the pavilion dexter was the side of the shield on the left of the spectator, that is to say, on the right of the soldier. Over the years therefore we have learnt to say that something is sinister if we mean that it is underhand, and we have a word like &#x201C;dexterity&#x201D; which means that one is skilful, that one has general ability or skill. The <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> calls it &#x201C;manual skill, neathandedness, handy or skilful in the use of limbs&#x201D;, while &#x201C;sinister&#x201D; has become synonymous&#x2014;to quote the <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> once again&#x2014;with &#x201C;prompted by malice or ill will; prejudicial; unfavourable; darkly suspicious; unfair; underhand; harmful; unlucky; adverse&#x201D;. I mention this to prove that left-handedness is the exception and that right-handedness is the rule. If one teaches one&#x2019;s child when he is small to greet an older person and he puts out his left hand, one thrusts it aside. But when vehicles were slow and very rudimentary, the sphere of man and his vehicle was very small. At first he could not cross mountains or rivers and his area of activity was considerably restricted. But in modern times his sphere of activity has become larger. Barriers are being removed all the time. It is shocking to think that in this country we only succeeded a few years ago in breaking down our provincial barriers. As recently as 1955 we had four different road traffic ordinances in the four provinces and it was only with a great deal of trouble that we remedied that state of affairs and started to become interested in a national pattern only a few years ago. We only obtained uniformity in our own country a few years ago. At the start we only thought provincially, but later we started thinking nationally, and I want to say this morning that the time has come for us to start thinking internationally.</p>

<p>We already have what we can call a continental pattern. I will try to show that the continental countries have adopted one pattern more and more over the years. Parts of the Continent which were a trifle more isolated or which were islands, fitted less into that pattern. But to-day efforts are being made throughout the world through the medium of international conventions to obtain more uniformity throughout the world. For example, the Geneva Convention laid down provisions which are applied by about 120 countries.</p>

<p>May I indicate briefly what the continental pattern looks like to-day. In Europe there are 10 countries which keep to the left as against 35 which keep to the right. Amongst those 10 are Britain, Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic, Sweden, Iceland, Cyprus, Malta and other small islands. In the two largest countries of the 10, Sweden and Britain, an inquiry is already in progress, an inquiry which this motion asks the Government to institute. In Africa, 20 countries keep left and 26 keep right. Among the 20 which keep left are South Africa, the Rhodesias, Mozambique, and the existing or former British territories. <span class="col_1423-1424" refersTo="page_0726"/>In West Africa the possibility of a change-over is also being investigated. In Asia we have 17 countries which keep left and 24 which keep right. Among the 17 we have Japan and India and the remainder are also existing or former British territories. In Australasia the picture is reversed. There 15 countries keep left as against 11 which keep right. The Commonwealth of Australia, New Guinea and the other British territories keep left. In America we have 11 countries which keep left as against 28 which keep right. Here we again have the same pattern. It is the connection with Britain which is responsible for this fact. The total is 73 as against 124, a proportion of almost 1 to 2.</p>

<p>But what is interesting is that in the last 25 years, nine countries have changed over from left to right, such as Austria in 1937, Czechoslovakia in 1939, Hungary in 1939, Panama in 1943, the Argentine in 1946, China in 1946, the Philippines in 1946, Uruguay in 1946 and recently the Honduras, whose change-over date I do not have, while as far as I know there has been no change-over from the keep-right rule to the keep-left rule. That is why I come to the conclusion that if one does not take into account islands, small and large, in a certain geographical pattern, one already has a continental pattern. Viewed against the background of first thinking provincially, then nationally and finally internationally, we can already see the tendency in the world&#x2014;to link up more and more with general usage and thus obtain a convention which will be uniform.</p>

<p>The other point that I want to make is that with the increase in vehicular traffic, interest in international journeys and international roads is increasing. For example, consideration is already being given&#x2014;and I believe that the plans have already been drawn up&#x2014;to a road linking Western Europe and Indo-China. A road is already under construction to link North and South America with one another. Strong consideration is being given to the question of linking Britain with the Continent by means of a bridge or a tunnel. The idea of building a trans-Africa road is also receiving more support, a road which will link the Cape with the Mediterranean Sea. My argument is that if the Republic, which is a young and progressive country, has to participate in the future in the building of expensive throughways with everything connected with that, such as modern traffic interchanges, this can only be considered if those structures can be regarded as being of a permanent nature. We cannot afford it if we cannot give the assurance of permanency to that development. We are already building traffic interchanges which fluctuate in price from anything between R500,000 and R1, 700,000 and which cover anything up to 20 morgen of land on which production is taking place, land which is being developed and which is becoming more and more expensive. For that reason the pattern has been indicated to us&#x2014; that sooner or later we will have to break this deeply ingrained habit, and if that is to be done, it is necessary for it to be done timeously in order to facilitate future planning. It can already be done even though we may decide not to take the plunge as yet. One can already start planning one&#x2019;s traffic interchanges in such a way as to adjust the proportion between the up and down journeys, to adjust the proportion between the deceleration lanes and the acceleration lanes, and to adjust the cambers from the left side to the right side over mountain passes.</p>

<p>There is another point, namely, the cost of vehicles. We import about 80,000 new motor vehicles per annum. Authoritative sources contend that these cost us R100 more per vehicle if they are manufactured in countries where they are equipped with the left-hand drive and that we can save anything up to R80,000,000 in that way&#x2014;if we accept the fact that the modification costs us R100 per vehicle. Another point that I want to mention is that we are on the verge of becoming a manufacturing country and I see no reason why we cannot become such a country. People are already starting here, although perhaps on a small scale, but it will make a world of difference to them if they can so set up their factories that they are able to capture the markets of the world in the future. It is perhaps being rather ambitious to say that we can become an exporting country, but one does not think of the past when one plans for the future. Here I also want to emphasize the fact that it is vitally necessary for these people to know what the attitude of the country is going to be in the future in respect of these two highway rules.</p>

<p>May I say a few words about the influence which Britain&#x2019;s attitude may have in this connection. It is contended that Britain&#x2019;s intended entry into the Common Market, which has perhaps received a temporary setback, may result in Britain being forced to change over. There is the aspect of the exchange of products which may also perhaps make it attractive to or necessary for Britain to change over. An investigation is already being undertaken in Britain. Therefore we cannot say that because we are thinking of an investigation to-day we are out of fashion. A very important fact that I want to mention in regard to Britain&#x2019;s attitude is this: All new roads in Britain have already been planned so that either highway rule can be followed. This proves to us how the land lies there.</p>

<p>As far as expense is concerned, if one thinks of a transition period of from 10 to 15 years and that the average life of a vehicle is about 10 years, then this can be planned if one starts soon enough and the transition period can pass without any dislocation. The accident figure may rise in the first few months and the doors of public vehicles will have to be built on the other side, but with proper and timeous planning and education, the Republic will still at this stage be able to meet the shocks and the expenses, while my argument here is that we may find later on that all the other countries change over and that we will be forced <span class="col_1425-1426" refersTo="page_0727"/>by circumstances to change over, but it will then be so late in the day that we will perhaps no longer be able to afford it. Other speakers will have more to say in this regard.</p>

<p>Allow me to say in conclusion that I will not take it amiss if anybody should think that this motion appears to be rather ill-considered or unbalanced. There is nothing as balanced as something which is stationary, and there is nothing as unbalanced as something which moves. We are told that speed tends to lift, and movement, if we analyse it, is a process of losing and regaining balance. In starting to walk from one place to another I lose my balance as I lift my foot but when I put my foot down I regain my balance. And so we have movement. That is why I want to say: Please do not hang the reformer because without him the world would be a very balanced place but it would stand still!</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. L. D. M. VENTER</person>:</from>

<p>I second. The motion before the House is, of course, a very important motion and its purpose, as the mover stated, is not to persuade this House that we must proceed to institute the keep-right rule. The purpose is to ask for an inquiry, an inquiry to determine whether it is possible and desirable for such a rule to be applied. I think that the mover has convinced the House that the matter is sufficiently important to justify such an inquiry because it must be emphasized that in this motion we do not seek to advocate either of the two rules; that we do not seek to convince the House that the keep-right rule is better than the keep-left rule. The question is so technical and so involved and has so many different aspects, economic, psychological and other aspects, that it will require a board of eminent experts to reach finality on this matter after considering all the possible facts for and against&#x2014;whether it will be advisable for the Republic of South Africa to effect such a drastic change and to change over to the keep-right traffic rule instead of retaining the keep-left rule. The first question which has to be answered therefore is whether the matter is sufficiently important to justify such an inquiry. I think that in this regard we can say quite definitely and unequivocally that it is sufficiently important. The statistics and information which the mover of this motion has given us have proved one thing to us and that is that there is an increasing world tendency to change from the keep-left to the keep-right rule. He has mentioned the fact that there are 124 countries in the world which are already following the keep-right rule as against 73 which still follow the keep-left rule.</p>

<p>If we study those statistics and the history of the introduction of this rule, we will notice that there is not one single case where a country changed over from the keep-right to the keep-left rule. That is why we can say that there is a very definite tendency towards the keep-right rule. That tendency is so strong and so much pressure is being exerted on countries that in the case of a country like Sweden, for example, a referendum was held on this matter. The vast majority of the people voted for the retention of the keep-left rule but in spite of that fact the Swedish Government nevertheless instituted an inquiry into the desirability of a change-over. The referendum therefore did not do away with that pressure. The pressure which is exerted by world opinion, and the slowly changing consensus of opinion in Sweden, make it desirable in the eyes of the Swedish Government, in spite of the unequivocal decision of the people, that they should nevertheless have this matter investigated. That is why I feel that for that same reason it is of the most vital importance that our Government should investigate this matter. If one looks at the specific population zones which are already following the keep-right rule, one notices that the Continent of Europe, with single exceptions, and North and South America almost exclusively, with individual exceptions, maintain the keep-right rule. We must remember that these are areas which are influential areas in the world; these are people who are calling the tune and who to a large extent are going to determine the future. Influential countries and peoples have adopted that rule and we must take into account the fact that that influence is steadily making itself felt. If we want to keep pace with the development initiated by those countries, we will have to start obeying this rule. One even finds that tendency in Africa. As the mover of the motion has indicated, there are 26 countries altogether which already have the keep-right rule as against 20 which follow the keep-left rule, but we also find that a number of countries in West Africa are at present engaged on this same inquiry. That is why we say that there is a tendency to change over more and more to the keep-right rule and for that reason it is quite clear that this matter is sufficiently important to justify a thorough inquiry. The motion before the House asks that an inquiry be made into the desirability and practicability of the changeover. It may be desirable for a country but not practicable. When we listen to the arguments of persons who view the matter from all angles, we can say that the most important arguments which are advanced to promote this matter&#x2014;the arguments in favour of this change-over&#x2014;are in the first instance that we should follow the world tendency which I have just mentioned. The hon. the mover of the motion has pointed out that international roads are being planned to-day. He has referred amongst other things to the fact that an international road will probably be planned in the future which will run from the Cape to the Mediterranean Sea. None of us can overestimate the value of those international roads, from both the economic and cultural points of view. All of us will want to use those international roads to our own advantage. We will want to use them as sources of development for the building up of our nation and our country. But if we have such a road from the Cape to the Mediterranean Sea running through the various countries one can imagine the chaos <span class="col_1427-1428" refersTo="page_0728"/>there will be if one country follows the keep-right rule and another country follows the keep-left rule. One can imagine the danger this would create. This is why we say that having regard to the building of these international roads it is necessary for this matter to be considered because it is desirable that those international roads should be built. Reference has been made, for example, to the question of economic saving&#x2014;R100 per vehicle of which 80,000 are imported into this country annually. This means a saving therefore of about R8,000,000. There is of course the further fact that a larger number of tourists will be attracted to this country because they will find it safer if they come from those influential countries which I have just mentioned&#x2014;North and South America and Europe &#x2014;to tour our country. Those tourists will feel safer on our roads because we will be following the same rule that is followed in those countries. Viewed from that aspect therefore such a change-over can have very important advantages for us. The counter-arguments are, of course, just as weighty. Reference has been made, for example, to the question of the replanning and the reconstruction of our roads which is going to cost a tremendous amount of money. We must realize therefore that it is going to cost a great deal of money to change over our roads which have been constructed with a view to the keep-left rule in order to adapt them to the keep-right rule. Together with the reconstruction of our roads there is the planning of road signs and all that sort of thing which may cost enormous sums of money. The fact is mentioned by persons who are opposed to this change-over that there are 1,113,000 cars which have been equipped for the keep-left rule as far as steering is concerned and that the cost of modifying that large number of cars will amount to a very large sum. Then there is the important argument of road safety. In Great Britain where this matter is being investigated it has been statistically estimated by experts that a tremendous increase in the accident figure must be anticipated during the transition period while people are not yet <i>au fait</i> with this rule. This is one matter of course which we cannot simply ignore. But I do want this House to realize how difficult the position is. There is no one here who can stand up this morning and say that it is better to introduce the keep-right rule or that it is better to retain the keep-left rule. Apart from the desirability there is still the question of the practicability. Are we able to do it? The practicability of the change-over is also a matter which will require expert investigation. There is the question of expense, for example. In reply to the expense argument it is pointed out that the average life of a car is no more than ten years and that if this change-over process takes place gradually, it will mean that the expense argument will not prove to be as important as people suggest.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is also the question of accidents. It is said: Yes, it is true that on the basis of statistical estimates it appears that there will be more accidents, but everyone who knows anything about human nature knows how unpredictable human beings are. If we had those statistics before us this morning, Mr. Speaker, we would see that the greatest number of accidents do not take place on the most dangerous corners of our roads, because drivers drive carefully around those corners. The greatest number of accidents take place on our national roads through the Karoo and those areas where one can see a long way ahead, because that is when one becomes careless. I want to predict that if we adopt the keep-right rule, that accident figure will not toe as high as people originally estimated because everyone will be careful during that transition period. Everyone will be so much more careful during the transition period and until we are able to follow the new road rule automatically. The result of this will be that the accident figure will not be as high as was initially estimated. This is the case in regard to all changes. When we changed over to the decimal system, it was estimated statistically that the cost of the change-over would amount to a certain figure; that we could expect certain expenditure, and on every occasion that figure has been lower than the statistical estimate. I think that in this case where one has to deal with people whom one educates, and where one has so many means of educating them&#x2014;by means of the radio and the Press&#x2014;we will find that the accident figure will not be as high as was originally feared. Indeed, I think the position will be easier if the whole world can adopt one rule, whether it be the keep-right or the keep-left rule, because then a large number of accidents will be prevented. What is happening to-day? We have tourists coming here from America who are acquainted with the keep-right rule there and who follow that rule automatically. They come to this country where we have a different rule; they first have to think before they do anything, and the result of it all is that they are often wrong in their timing and they are more likely to be involved in accidents. I think that the one shortcoming that we experience here to-day is that we do not have uniformity in our own country as far as traffic rules are concerned. Robots differ from place to place and road signs differ from province to province. Here in the Cape Peninsula you will be surprised to see how little uniformity there is and I think that this is one of the reasons why there are so many accidents. If a person is used to doing something automatically and he finds himself in a place like the Peninsula, where he continually has to concentrate and think ahead, one can understand that he will be more vulnerable and more accident-prone. Therefore if we have a uniform rule which is followed by the whole world or most of the countries with which we have dealings, this will largely promote safety in general. I think that it is not only important for us to have this investigation but it is vitally necessary for that inquiry to be held immediately. In the <i>Cape Times</i> <span class="col_1429-1430" refersTo="page_0729"/>of 3 July 1962 the following report appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The S.A. Road Safety Council has asked the Minister of Transport to appoint a committee to inquire into whether there should be a change in South Africa&#x2019;s rule of the road from keep left to keep right as soon as possible. The Council had not recommended a change but wanted the investigation because if the change did become inevitable it should be made as soon as possible, a spokesman of the organization said yesterday. Only an exhaustive investigation would show whether the advantages of a change would outweigh the disadvantages, said Mr. A. F. Trew, the Secretary-General of the Automobile Association.</block>

<p>He tells us that it is essential that this investigation be instituted immediately because he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A change would obviously be enormously costly and become more the longer a decision was delayed, so the investigation and the decision should be made soon.</block>

<p>Therefore, because this is a matter of the most vital importance which so deeply affects our country and its future development, and because every new road which is planned may perhaps involve unnecessary expenditure because we may find that it should have been planned differently if we eventually do change over, we feel that this matter cannot be postponed and we ask that a commission of inquiry be appointed immediately to inquire into and report upon these various aspects.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Having listened here this morning to the arguments for and against driving on the right or the left side of the road, I think hon. members realize that there are many facets to this matter. It is interesting to note that the Road Safety Council of the Republic has in fact asked the Government to appoint a commission to go into this matter. Up to now the approach to this subject has been purely academic; various authorities have dabbled with it but there is no really reliable information to go on other than the facts derived from various bodies such as the Automobile Associations, the Road Federation and Societies of Road Engineers. It has been said here this morning that as there are uniform rules for ships meeting at sea and for planes in the air, we should have some measure of uniformity as far as the rule of the road is concerned. Sir, you have also heard various theories here to-day as to how we have come to drive on the left of the road while other people drive on the right. Very interesting theories have been put forward by protagonists of the various rules and it seems reasonable to assume that the rule of the road dates back probably to the seventeenth century or even before, when you had the English driver sitting on a box on the right side driving his cart; he had his whip on his right-hand side, and on the Continent you had his counterpart who preferred to ride one of the horses in the team; he invariably rode the left or the near-side horse and kept his right hand free to use his whip. He would naturally ride on the right-hand side in order to keep clear of traffic. There is also a theory that the Emperor Napoleon when he subjugated Europe adopted the right-hand side for battle tactics. One could go on enumerating various theories.</p>

<p>Since the introduction of the rule of the road a number of countries and territories which originally had the keep-left rule have since changed over to the keep-right rule. Reference has been made here to-day to the fact that Austria changed over in 1937, Argentina in 1946, Czechoslovakia 1939, Hungary in 1939, Panama in 1943, Philippines in 1946 and also Uruguay. In a number of these cases quoted, the dates indicate that the change has often resulted from military occupation by forces accustomed to the opposite rule. It is interesting to note that no country has ever changed from right to left. The most recent convert was the British Colony of Honduras which is adjacent to the Americas, and changed from the left-to the right-hand rule. That confirms the theory that the tendency is for adjacent countries to adopt the same rule of the road. You see that in the Americas and on the Continent of Europe. If we in South Africa considered the question of changing over from left to right, we would naturally have to have consultation with the neighbouring territories because at the present time we get most of our tourist traffic from these countries although the tourist traffic from overseas is growing. This is a serious matter and one which any commission appointed would have to take into consideration. It was said here this morning that Great Britain was at present considering the implications of changing from left to right. Britain is an island; there is no country adjacent to her so she has not been affected to the same extent as other adjacent countries. She has therefore retained her rule of driving on the left, but the Western European Road Safety Council has urged Great Britain to give consideration to this change in the interest of uniformity of traffic regulations. It is expected that a change-over, if done within five years, will cost Britain R40,000,000 and R70,000,000 over a period of 15 years. Sir, Sweden has been mentioned here. It has also been mentioned that in the referendum that was taken 80 per cent of the people affected voted against a change, but notwithstanding this the Swedish Government is going to pass legislation to effect this change in 1966. This will cost Sweden something like R46,000,000. Although cars in Sweden drive on the left, the steering is on the left, so if they were to change over to the system of driving on the right, the steering would naturally be placed on the right side, that is to say, if they follow the present policy. Sweden is one of the cases that I mentioned where you have adjacent territories. With the growth of the European Common Market and the increased traffic in Europe, Sweden has found it necessary to make this change in order to facilitate the growing traffic between these countries. Most vehicles in use throughout the world today <span class="col_1431-1432" refersTo="page_0730"/>are equipped with steering on the left side, and they are built for countries where the traffic keeps to the right of the road. There are numbers of countries which still adopt the rule of driving on the left of the road, although they are not as numerous as the countries which have adopted the rule of driving on the right. As far as the advantages and disadvantages are concerned, the advantages of conversion are not so great. The main advantage would be to bring South Africa into line with the international rules of the road and to facilitate matters for tourists who visit this country. It was also mentioned here by the hon, member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. D. M. Venter) that the overall costs of manufacturing cars with the steering on the left would be lower, because of their numbers. That may be so, but the saving would not be as much as one is inclined to think because it must not be forgotten that in the designing of a motor vehicle provision is made at the design stage for either left-or right-hand steering. The world will not suddenly go over to the rule of driving on the right; and cars would still have to be manufactured for those countries which follow the rule of driving on the left so the design would continue. I think hon. members know that there is no difference between the new price of a car with the steering on the left and the price of the same model with the steering on the right. It is only with a greater volume of production of left-hand drive vehicles that there would be a drop in the prices, but I do not think that it would be sufficient to warrant a change from the left-to the right-hand rule. It has also been suggested here that driving on the right is safer and certain figures have been produced, but if one examines road safety figures throughout the world one cannot find anything really to support the theory that driving on the right would promote road safety. Now let us examine the disadvantages.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage would be the cost factor. The cost would be very high even if the change were introduced over a period of 15 years. There are something like 1,250,000 vehicles on our roads to-day. That is the 1960 figure which is, of course, out of date. Of these vehicles there are 901,515 cars and 16,371 buses. The most costly item would be the replacement of buses. A double-decker bus, for instance, is not easily converted. One cannot convert the platform from the left to the right-hand side or convert the staircase. Buses would virtually have to be written off and replaced or new bodies would have to be built. But there is another difficulty; in some cases the chassis is designed to take the left-hand drive. The single-decker buses could not be converted at all. Then there is the question of the trolley buses, and here you have the same thing. The majority are double-deckers; you would have to convert them but they would virtually be write-offs; then you get the overhead tracks of the trolley buses. You find that the tracks of trolley buses are routed a certain way. Those tracks would have to be dismantled and re-routed. The average cost of a double-decker bus and a single-decker bus is something like R14,000. A double-decker bus costs about R16,000 and a single-decker about R12,000. If you take the average cost of replacement at R14,000 and multiply that figure by the number of buses you have on the road, you will find that it runs into a substantial sum. You cannot delay the changeover in the case of buses; you cannot say, &#x201C;we will change them in 15 years&#x2019; time&#x201D;. They have to be changed immediately in the interest of road safety otherwise you would have people alighting from buses in the middle of the road, and the possibility of fatalities would be very high. The next important item is the conversion of cars. To convert a car from right-hand drive to left-hand drive, in the case of a medium-sized car, would, it is estimated, be R300 and the cost of conversion of a larger car would be R700. The conversion of the car would entail a complete replacement of the steering, and in the vast majority of cars you would have to change the gear-box and clutch assembly arrangement as well. It could be argued that it would not be necessary to change over the cars. But I think any scheme that you put into effect, any scheme of change-over, must be geared to the lowest intelligence of drivers on the road to-day. You cannot expect people to put up with the fact of having to drive a right-hand drive car on the right-hand side of the road. Their vision would be obscured and not safe. You cannot expect them to sell their cars and buy left-hand drive cars. The loss per unit would be enormous. If one had to convert these cars, the sum total of what the motorist would have to pay out for conversion would be fantastic and it would be completely uneconomical.</p>

<p>There is the question of local authorities. They will be faced with very heavy expenditure in the way of changing traffic signs and robots, etc. Some local authorities run public transport systems and as we all know these transport systems never pay. The local authorities will then, over and above their losses on the system, be involved in great expense to convert their buses. You can imagine the added capital expenditure in having to buy completely new bus fleets. They would have to receive Government assistance in some form to assist them over the change-over period. The private passenger operator would expect Government assistance as well. The private car user should also be compensated. So you see, Sir, it is a very involved and costly business to change over.</p>

<p>There is the other factor which is a very important one and that is the road safety factor. I think that is perhaps one of the most important factors which should be considered very seriously by the commission if it is appointed. You can imagine, Sir, that during the change-over and shortly afterwards, there will be a measure of chaos. You will find drivers who have been accustomed for years to drive in one way, when they reach a traffic island they will subconsciously move over to the wrong side with serious consequences.</p>

<p><span class="col_1433-1434" refersTo="page_0731"/>Then you have the question of our heterogeneous population. Although I must say that our Bantu and Coloured drivers are exceptionally good on the whole, they would probably pick it up very much quicker than we expect. At the same time, Sir, we have to convey the message to them that the rule of the road has changed and that would be very difficult. In the meantime you would have a rising accident rate. It is interesting to note from a recent survey by the C.S.I.R. the accident rate in this country is very high, one of the highest in the world.</p>

<p>To sum up, Sir, in the face of the evidence which we have in front of us I think it is safe to say that the advantages to be gained are far outweighed by the disadvantages. You have the enormous cost factor but the road safety factor during the conversion period alone is enough to put the whole idea of conversion out of thought. As I have said, the money will have to be found and that will probably have to come from the petrol vehicle user and the diesel-fuel vehicle user in the way of added taxation. At the present moment a portion of that money goes into the road fund for road building purposes. Some of our provincial roads are not up to the standard that we would like to see them and their grants may be cut down to compensate for the changeover. We would not like to see a retardation of our road building programme in order to compensate a change-over. The Minister of Economic Affairs will be in this position that he will have to provide additional permits to import change-over spares. Car owners, in the interests of road safety, will undertake the conversion of their own cars if the State does not assist. The country will be faced with the necessity of having to provide foreign currency for the importation of these spares.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to our changeover to decimalization. I do not think there is any analogy between the change of the rule of the road and the change-over to decimalization. The change to decimals was gradual and the change of the rule of the road will take place overnight. I said in my opening remarks the interest on this particular subject has been one of an academical nature over the past years and in order to obtain all the facts for and against a scheme such as this, we would support the appointment of a commission. I would like to suggest that if any commission is appointed it should consider among other items the road safety factor and the question of the adjacent territories.</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I have listened attentively to the arguments advanced by the hon. member, firstly his arguments in favour of the appointment of such a commission and then later on with regard to the difficulties and the problems which may arise. Let me say immediately that I am not blind to the problems and those difficulties which will arise in connection with the change-over from a keep-left rule to a keep-right rule. The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) mentioned two important problems, particularly the expense factor, which is of course vitally important, and the road safety factor. We all accept the fact that there is a high expenditure pattern connected with this matter but the longer it is postponed the more money we will be spending uselessly if we continue with our road building programme in the way in which we are doing so now and then decide later to Change over after all. I am pleased that towards the end of his speech the hon. member did come to the important issue and that is when he said that he supported the motion as it appears on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to appoint a commission to investigate the practicability and desirability of applying the &#x201C;keep right&#x201D; traffic rule in the Republic of South Africa.</block>

<p>That is more or less the same wording as that of the terms of reference of a commission in England. They had similar terms of reference in England.</p>

<p>I want to deal first of all with the question of road safety. One can well understand that in the first place road safety organizations will object to the change-over because they are the people who also have to watch over the interests of travellers. One realizes that they will be constructive. I have here a copy of a memorandum drawn up by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents in England in connection with this matter when this body was approached to submit reports and to draw up memoranda. In the first paragraph ROSPA&#x2014; which incidentally is the abbreviation for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents&#x2014;says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">ROSPA has yet to be convinced of the need for any change. If a change is made accidents will tend to rise. The following measures are considered essential if this possible rise in the accident figure is to be minimized. The measures relating to road engineering and vehicle design changes do not, of course, purport to be exhaustive.</block>

<p>In other words, this body also realized that the accident figure would be higher. It was estimated that it would be 10 per cent higher over the first two or quite possibly three years. I do not want to weary the House with the details but this body does make recommendations under various headings and supports these recommendations. They have various headings and the first heading is &#x201C;The timing of the change&#x201D;. In the case of England they recommend that it should be done at the beginning of March, probably because that is just before the heavy tourist season. The second heading is &#x201C;Educational&#x201D;, the training and educating of the youth and other people as well as the various bodies and the travelling public long before the time. They have another heading &#x201C;Propaganda&#x201D; and further headings &#x201C;Legal&#x201D; and &#x201C;Enforcement&#x201D;; they also have another heading &#x201C;Road Engineering and Vehicle Design <span class="col_1435-1436" refersTo="page_0732"/>Changes&#x201D;. The hon. member for Salt River raised many points in connection with the modifications to be made to vehicles and so forth. The final heading is &#x201C;Finance&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I made some inquiries to ascertain the attitude of our road safety people. I wrote a letter to Mr. Mare, the Director of Road Safety in South Africa, and his reply was as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">You will realize that it will create many new problems for us but we are prepared to do our share in the interests of the general public.</block>

<p>This body is also prepared when such a commission is appointed to make its contribution.</p>

<p>There have been many references to Sweden where an investigation in connection with this matter is in progress. In the case of Sweden the Prime Minister had confidential discussions with the Leader of the Opposition and leading members of the Opposition there notwithstanding the referendum to which the previous speaker referred. Notwithstanding the expense, the Swedish Government decided to change over to the keep-right rule. It is very difficult to ascertain, or rather, it is impossible to say at this moment, as far as the death rate on our roads is concerned, whether there will be a decrease in the number of fatalities here if we change over to the keep-right rule. Indeed, as the mover explained, it is difficult to obtain comparable figures because the various countries do not always operate on the same basis as far as the fatality rate is concerned. The following is the practice in South Africa. When a person dies even some time after an accident, his death is regarded as being attributable to that accident and his death is then added to the road fatality figure. In other countries they fix a period of three or at most 30 days and if the victim dies after 30 days his death is not regarded as being attributable to the accident. That is why I say that it is very difficult to obtain comparable figures.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. member who spoke just before me that when a commission is appointed to investigate this matter it will be a good thing for the commission to co-operate with our neighbouring states, that is, the Rhodesias and the Portuguese territories. As far as I know the keep-right rule holds good in Portugal but because Mozambique is so close to us and because so many of our people visit that country, the keep-left rule is practised there. I believe that it is of importance that in connection with this matter these territories should be approached in order to effect the change-over there too.</p>

<p>The question of tourism is a very important matter in connection with the change-over. According to statistics, which I do not want to repeat, 63 per cent of countries observe the keep-right rule and only 37 per cent observe the keep-left rule. I want to hazard a guess and say that 60 per cent of the countries which still observe the keep-left rule had some connection with the United Kingdom at some stage or other or still have that connection. If the international rule of keep right is applied, it will be to the advantage of South Africa as far as tourists are concerned. We know that if anyone goes to America or to any country where the keep-right rule holds good, he has to concentrate very hard in order to become used to the road rule of that particular country. If we apply the international rule, the position here will be easier for tourists.</p>

<p>Strong arguments have been advanced on this side; facts have been given, facts which should convince everybody to support this request for the appointment of a commission, and I want to say in conclusion that this commission should consist of experts in various spheres. This question chiefly affects certain aspects and I think of the following experts who could be appointed to such a commission: The Chief Engineer of National Roads in the Department of Transport; an engineer appointed by the four provinces and South West Africa; a senior official of the Department of Commerce and Industries and a very important person to serve on this commission to look after the interests of the public and to ensure that the anticipated high death rate on our roads is eliminated as far as possible &#x2026;</p>

<p>We have heard various arguments that 19 countries have changed over during the past few years from the keep-left rule to the keep-right rule. I take it that those various countries also had their problems in connection with this matter. It will probably be a good thing to obtain information from those countries in connection with the problems that they had to deal with and how they overcame those problems.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I accept the promise of the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. van der Merwe) not to put me on this commission, so I can speak quite objectively about this matter. I think there are two aspects which are important. The first is. of course, the aspect which affects the motorist as such, and the second is the national aspect. If I may do so, Sir, without being presumptuous, I want to compliment the hon. member for Hottentots-Holland (Mr. de Villiers) on the thorough study which he appears to have made of the subject, and on the way in which he presented his case to this House. I think he erred in one respect only. I think he said that we imported some 80.000 cars per annum which were made in countries where the keep-to-the-right rule <span class="col_1437-1438" refersTo="page_0733"/>applied and that it cost us R100 per car to convert them to a right-hand steering. He said if we adopted the keep-to-the-right rule&#x2014;in other words, if we imported those cars from those particular countries in their original form &#x2014;we would be saving R80,000,000 per annum. That was what he said, Sir. He said &#x201C;tagtig miljoen rand&#x201D;, I might be a little befogged as a result of the week&#x2019;s activities, but if you take 80,000 and multiply that by 100, I think you get 8,000,000, not 80! I had occasion to raise the question of arithmetic earlier this week in a less fortunate context. If the hon. member is correct about his figures, which I believe he is, of the cost per car, then the saving which we will effect by adopting the keep-to-the-right rule in this country will not be R80,000,000 but R8,000,000.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>There goes the hon. member for Cradock. I am talking about motorcars, not about sheep. In any case, a saving of R8,000,000 per year, I think, is very small compared with the total cost involved in this contemplated change-over in regard to the existing car population. I do not wish to traverse the figures which have been given; I think there is a slight discrepancy between the one of 1.130.000 vehicles in the country, and the other of 1,250,000. Be that as it may on the analysis of the hon. member for Salt River, there is no doubt that the total cost involved in converting the cars alone, let alone the traffic systems, is far greater than R8,000,000. If we were to adopt this proposal, I do not think we would do so because of the saving on the number of units which are imported in the so-called C.K.D., or completely knocked down, condition of R8,000,000 per year. Much more than that is involved, as far as I can see.</p>

<p>Sweden has also been held up as an example. where by common consent here the Government has ignored a referendum in which 80 per cent of the people voted against change-over to the other system. But the Government despite the decision of the people of Sweden, is apparently pursuing the matter.</p>

You can well imagine, Sir, what would have happened in South Africa very recently if, after the referendum when a small majority voted for the Republic, the Government had then said: &#x201C;Regardless of this majority for a Republic, we refuse to give you a Republic.&#x201D; You cannot have it both ways.

I think that both the mover and the seconder of the motion made out a very good case for an inquiry. They put their case well and since there is such complete unanimity in the House as to the desirability of appointing such a commission, I am quite prepared to accept the motion and to appoint a commission of inquiry. If a commission of inquiry is appointed we will then have the facts before us. At the moment we only have ideas and theories.

<p>I regret the hon.

I would like to say that, although this is a free vote in the House to-day, speaking for the members on this side of the House who belong to the farmers&#x2019; group, we are totally opposed to the appointment of a commission to investigate the question of changing from the left-hand system to the right-hand system on our roads. We say that the expenditure on a commission is not justified, and we claim that the findings of a commission would very soon be out of date, and so an absolute waste of money. It has been stated here over the floor of the House that the right-hand system is safer than the left-hand system. Mr. Speaker, that makes one feel inclined to laugh, because there is no proof whatever that the one system is safer than the other system.</p>

<p>Who said that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bowker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BOWKER</person>:</from>

<p>It was said here in argument that the right-hand system is safer. The hon. member for Hottentots-Holland (Mr. de Villiers) said that in Great Britain the accident rate under the left-hand system was increasing. He did not bring figures to show that the accident rate in America, where the right-hand system is in operation, is not also increasing. I think that this motion is motivated by trade interests and the interests of American manufacturers, the influence of American manufacturers who construct the right-hand drive car. We know the influence of American trade all over the world, and I think it is manifested here to-day in this motion for the appointment of a commission to investigate this particular question. Mr. Speaker, we have to face the costs of any conversion to-day. It has been stressed by the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) what it would cost to convert our buses and vehicles in this country. It would perhaps not be necessary to convert the ordinary vehicles we have at present in the country, because, at present, we have people with right-hand-drive cars, adhering to the left-hand-drive system in our country, but vehicles like buses would have to be converted and there would be a considerable cost involved. And furthermore think of the cost in respect of our road system. Just think for a moment only of the De Waal Drive, think of the first overhead crossing on the De Waal Drive here, a left-hand crossing. Any member driving on to the De Waal Drive could estimate what it would cost even to convert that one overhead crossing to a right-hand crossing! It would change the whole structure of the road, and it would cost many thousands of pounds. The cost on our road system in general would be colossal. Even the &#x201C;keep left&#x201D; signs which would have to be converted would cost an enormous sum. Therefore I say that it seems ridiculous that this question is raised to-day. I myself am surprised that the proposer of this motion was given preference to discuss this matter to-day. I think there are many other subjects on our Order Paper, motions by private members, that are very much more important than this one. I search to find a justification for a motion of this nature. The hon. member for Middelland (Mr. P. S. van der Merwe) said that Portugal adheres to the right-hand drive, but he might have said that the Mozambique Territory adheres to the left-hand drive, and that there are no countries in Southern Africa that adhere to the right-hand drive. It has been said here in argument that it would be safer for our tourists. Now what tourists do we have here that come in any numbers with their motorcars? Only the overland tourists, or those from the Rhodesias, countries that adhere to the left-hand drive. The argument in respect of tourists bears no weight at all. How many tourists enter this country with their own motor-cars when they come from overseas by ship? Hardly any at all.</p>

<p>My principal objection and that of the farming group to this motion was not only the cost of conversion of vehicles and the cost of changing our whole road system, of which we are particularly proud, but we object in the interest of road safety. We have an appalling number of accidents in proportion to our White population in this country to-day, but we also have hundreds of thousands of Natives to-day who are drivers of vehicles. They are people who are perhaps not quite so mature as the European. I have no doubt, and our group has no doubt, that conversion brought about any time in the near future would undoubtedly increase the accident rate on our roads. I do not think anybody can <span class="col_1441-1442" refersTo="page_0735"/>argue contrary to that view. We should do everything possible, and, as a matter of fact, we are scratching our heads in an attempt to devise means to reduce the accident rate on our roads, and here we have a motion coming before Parliament promoting a system which for years to come would be inclined to create a greater accident rate on our roads. You see, this &#x201C;keep left&#x201D; has become almost something instinctive in the human beings in this country. Even if one walks down our streets, one finds that people pass each other mostly on the left. It is inherent in the general population and we cannot only think of the 3,000,000 Whites in this country, we must think of the 15,000,000 non-Europeans who have to be taken into consideration. Many of our Coloured and Native people are involved in accidents on our roads, and, I have no doubt, that if we converted to the right-hand-drive, for many years to come people would have the legitimate excuse in any court to state &#x201C;Well, we have not quite acclimatized ourselves&#x201D;. <i>I</i> am opposed to the appointment of a commission, principally on the grounds of road safety, and I say that the conversion of our vehicles and our roads to the right-hand-system is not justified at all. No argument has been advanced to justify the expenditure, and in the same way no proof has been brought that even the expenditure on a commission is justified. I maintain moreover that any finding of a commission in that regard would be out of date within a few years. It would be a Blue Book that would find its way to the scrap-paper basket. Speaking as secretary of our farmers&#x2019; group, I want to register our most sincere protest against the appointment of a commission to investigate the question of the right-hand or left-hand system on our roadways.</p>

</ol>

<p>In moving this motion, it is very interesting for me to see that notice has already been given of an amendment. I do not want to discuss this amendment at a later stage and would like to say a few words in connection with the amendment now. In analysing the amendment I see that paragraph 1 of the amendment contains precisely the same terms as in my motion, namely, to continue, encourage and intensify research in all branches of the timber industry and the promotion of the use of South African timber. I say that I am pleased to see that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) also considers it of so much importance that the task performed by Forestry should be continued. When I come to the second part of this amendment, to leave timber-growing and the operation of sawmills and timber processing as far as is practical to private enterprise, as being in the best interests of the Republic, it is necessary for me to make it very clear at the start that this motion has nothing to do with private enterprise as far as sawmills and timber growing is concerned. On the contrary, this motion takes account of the fact that the hon. the Minister announced earlier that it was not the task of the Department of Forestry to interfere with private undertakings or to compete with private undertakings in any way at all. Furthermore, the hon. the Minister also indicated on a previous occasion that there had been a decrease in the number of sawmills. In other words, it is not my intention in this motion to interfere with the present existing private sawmills or with the further development of private sawmills.</p>

<p>It is, however, also important for us to record that when the State plantations started production in 1938, private undertakings had no confidence in sawmills in South Africa and did not want to make a start in this connection. Now that proof has been given that forestry is a profitable undertaking, people are keen to enter this field, but we must also remember that profits do not lie in the sales of log timber; they lie in the less bulky timber, in the processed timber, and it is very important for this House to record that the taxpayers&#x2019; money was used over the years to establish State timber production and to cultivate all the plantations. If one considers this fact, one cannot summarily hand things over to private individuals.</p>

<p>I want to give a few examples in this connection and I take only the period from 19367 to 1961-2. I find then that the total expenditure incurred in cultivating State plantations amounted to the sum of R79,293, 903. The revenue was R64,388, 495. In other words, the revenue over the period from 1937-62 was still nearly R15,000,000 less than the expenditure. But over this period we also built up an asset to the State, an asset to the citizens and taxpayers to an amount of R92,000,000. This is a tremendous asset and one cannot summarily hand over that asset to private sawmills or private undertakings. On the contrary, it is an asset which one has to exploit correctly so that the taxpayer who has incurred this expense over the years will continue to <span class="col_1443-1444" refersTo="page_0736"/>derive benefit from it. I would like to make this final remark in connection with the amendment: If one looks at the various civilized countries, one finds amongst other things the following: England is still cultivating timber; Holland, Western Germany, Austria and America are all countries in which it is State policy to retain at least one-third of the plantations of the timber in those areas as State property and to have it exploited by the State in all its various facets. Perhaps this is so because timber is not an annual crop like maize; its growth is a long-term proposition and because, when we deal with conifers, we find that we go beyond the life-time of one man; in other words the man who plants those trees will not derive any benefit from them; it will be his future generations who derive that benefit, and that is why the State must undertake these projects.</p>

<p>If we look at this motion we find that it is necessary to go back a little into history and I want to say that soil, vegetation and water are the fundamental sources of life of a nation and of a country and in early years our public leaders realized that these assets must be protected and further supplemented. We are very short of indigenous timber resources in our country and that is why a start was made early on in supplementing our natural resources by cultivation. We find for example that in the year 1876, when he was Commissioner of Crown Land and Public Works, John X. Merriman had the following to say when he asked Parliament for a sum of money to start timber cultivation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our intention is to spend a small amount during the current years as experimental material with a view to the replanting of the Crown forests under the control of the conservation officers. We trust that the various local bodies can be persuaded to cooperate in the encouragement of afforestation.</block>

<p>And do you know, all that they could afford to spend in that year was an amount of R50 or &#x00A3;25? That was all that they could afford in order to tackle this praiseworthy undertaking. I want to say that because of the faithful service of the various Ministers of State and various officials, this afforestation has progressed so far that we now have a wonderful asset in South Africa. All praise is due to those various officials, not only to the administrative officials, not only to the directors, but to every official, the foresters, the forestry workers and the timber growers. They built up this wonderful asset over the years. In saying this, I want to look at statistics for a moment to see how far this one undertaking has progressed in South Africa.</p>

<p>In 1911 the amount which was spent on forestry totalled R264,408. The revenue from it was far less, namely, R102,942. In 1938-9 the income was still only R408,974 while the expenditure already amounted to R1, 147,698. But let us look at the surface area under plantations. In 1911 it was 48,136 acres, in 1928 it was 168,468 acres and in 1950 it had already reached 444,207 acres. to-day, in 19612 it has already amounted to 675,798 acres. It is interesting to note that it was not only the Department of Forestry which deemed it necessary to promote afforestation in South Africa. We find that from the start, up to 1949-50, the South African Railways also contributed its share in this connection. In 1939 the South African Railways had 5,427 acres under cultivation. The cultivation of the timber was undertaken for them by the Department of Forestry on their land. We also find that this Department has done a tremendous amount of work in this connection with the South African Native Trust. In the Estimates for 1961-2, the expenditure incurred for the growing of timber by the South African Native Trust amounted to R1, 437,940, and 116,405 acres were afforested. In other words, this Department also ensures future security by applying soil conservation and by building up of forest plantations in those areas which will later become Native homelands and Native trust lands, simply because it is one&#x2019;s level of civilization which requires one to make provision for the future.</p>

<p>I find that in the 1962 Budget there was an amount of R12,186,000 for Forestry and that the State already had 305,000 morgen under plantations. If one thinks back to the years when John X. Merriman asked the Cape Parliament for &#x00A3;25 for afforestation, then we have every reason to be proud of our progress in forestry over the years. But as a result of the fine example set by the State and the continual appeals made by our Ministers of State to the people and the assistance given in this connection in regard to the growing of small trees, in regard to the supplying of seed, in regard to improving the quality of the trees, we find that private bodies already own 745,000 morgen under planted plantations in South Africa. It follows of course that because of this expansion the Department of Forestry as the guardian of the interests of the State in the sphere of forestry has to do more and more in the sphere of forestry for which the present State machinery is not yet adequate. I will show just now how even on the Select Committee we have a problem in connection with this matter. As a result of this expansion the Department is changing at the same time into a sort of commercial organization. These plantations were not planted for their aesthetic value alone. Not at all. The taxpayers could not have afforded it. The trees were also planted for their economic value, their economic value to our future generations assets which the generations after us will have to use in the best interests of South Africa and of the whole population of South Africa, those economic values which must not summarily be handed over to a few individuals, which may well be the effect of this amendment of the hon. member for South Coast. These economic values created by man, the natural resources which have been supplemented there, can only be beneficially exploited <span class="col_1445-1446" refersTo="page_0737"/>to the full in the country&#x2019;s economy if the Department of Forestry has the necessary freedom of movement, whether within the framework of the State organization or, if necessary, even outside of that framework, because the Department is in a unique position; it is unlike any other Department, This Department is a farmer; it has to prepare the land; it has to do the work of soil conservation and so prepare the land that it will be able to carry the right type of trees. In preparing the land and in its cultivation it has to have freedom of movement in respect of the employment of its forestry officials and its foresters and of non-Whites in the Native trust areas. But this must also be done in such a way that it keeps in mind the future revenue from the undertaking. In order to dispose of these plantation products to the benefit of the private sector as well, it is necessary for Forestry to set the example and for Forestry to give every assistance in the foreign markets and so forth. I want to tell you what became apparent from an inquiry which was made by the Board of Trade and Industries and by other committees. It appeared from this inquiry that they were most emphatic and made it very clear that the activities of the Department of Forestry could not be carried out effectively within the organization of a State Department as it was at present constituted. But apart from those inquiries I also want to show what various persons who have dealt with international forestry have had to say in this connection. I refer for example to T. A. Critchley in his article &#x201C;The Civil Service To-Day He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No simpler organization could yield the unique combination of virtues, complete impartiality, scrupulous fairness, economy in spending public money, and full accountability to Parliament, displayed by the Public Service. If the machinery is complex and sometimes slow, the end, that of high quality administration, justifies the means.</block>

<p>In other words, he defends that part, but he goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But it is because the machinery is so complex that it is easily over-loaded. Its capacity to cope with new tasks is limited by the intricacy of its internal workings. It is mere common-sense, therefore, to reserve such delicate mechanism for its proper job: The task of government. For any other activity which does not demand the same supreme virtues, a different type of machine is wanted. Indeed it is necessary to limit in this way the use made of the Civil Service in order to conserve its strength for the task that only it can do.</block>

<p>He continues to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The capacity of the Civil Service to undertake new tasks is thus limited by the defects of its virtues &#x2026; the complexities of its organization, which in turn derive from the stringency of Treasury control.</block>

<p>That is the kneehalter, Treasury control&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the need to preserve co-ordination under the Cabinet, the need to safeguard Ministers against an over-burden of detailed work and the constant exposure of its activities to parliamentary criticism.</block>

<p>Critchley writes that the result of this is that many activities which do not fit in well in the Public Service are handed over to semi State organizations of which there were already more than 200 in England in 1951, England, the example of a democracy! He is not the only one to write in this way. Let us see what P. du Sautoy also has to say in the &#x201C;Civil Service&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A feature in the modern state is the increasing number of government or semi-government public boards and corporations to undertake functions which are not regarded as appropriate for the ordinary Civil Service machine. They represent an attempt to preserve public control in a sphere where it is essential, but where flexibility and speed of operations are also of the greatest importance. The State delegates its powers to a board of nominees, representing various interests, and prescribes their powers and duties by law.</block>

<p>I want to say again that he states very clearly that it is necessary for a Department or organization to be able to decide quickly, to be able to use its own initiative and act accordingly. And if it wants that, the Frenchman, du Sautoy. says that one cannot kneehalter it with the sort of Treasury control that one has in the usual State Departments. I will show further how this Department, as a result of its development, and without its detracting from the private sector, or coming into competition with it, has so developed that it cannot be kneehaltered any longer because this can only be to the detriment of forestry and of our economy in South Africa. This swift expansion of the Department of Forestry has brought with it a large number of marketing problems. We must remember very well that the conifer type of tree&#x2014;and this is the type, of tree cultivated in the departmental plantations&#x2014;as a long cycle. Nowhere do we come into competition with wattle trees or blue-gums or trees used for pitprops. Neither do we compete in regard to the conifer types because the Department is simply there to be of assistance and service to the private sector. During this long cycle the income from forestry is derived from the thinning-out process which has to be done continually, and we cannot allow those trees which are thinned out to rot away. They must be converted into an asset to and revenue for the State. I would like to dwell for a moment on the trees which are thinned out.</p>

<p>We must remember that the processing of these trees determines this sound economic basis. If we look back, we find that this interim timber production was used in the <span class="col_1447-1448" refersTo="page_0738"/>past for boxwood and for pulping. In the past we had a reasonable market for our boxwood because the fruit farmers used it for packing of their fruit. But we must remember that the world is changing over completely to cardboard cartons as far as packing is concerned so we no longer have that great demand for wooden boxes and we have reached the stage where we no longer have a market for boxwood in South Africa. As a result of increased cultivation, the tendency is to thin the trees out more and more and to have more boxwood available but the demand is decreasing as a result of the use of cardboard. We have now to dispose of that boxwood on a disappearing market.</p>

<p>This fact compels me to suggest that the Department should be permitted to export timber internationally as a manufacturing industry and to compete on the international market. When a manufacturing industry competes internationally, it merely prepares the way for the private industrialists to come along and say: Give me that opportunity too. It prepares the market and creates the correct climate there. It is this Department which will have to find a market for the large amount of timber which was previously made into boxwood. This search may perhaps soon be over because the problem is already appreciated in the international sphere. If we look at a report by the Swedish forestry industry, we find that one of the Swedish experts had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Timber is gradually becoming a more important raw material. Its many uses are increasing while the sources of timber are shrinking as swift progress is encroaching upon the country&#x2019;s forests.</block>

<p>As a result of the increase in population throughout the whole world, he is afraid that our resources will shrink steadily. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The point is being reached in one country after another where the community is being compelled to step in with control measures. Problems in connection with forest production will eventually become problems of international importance.</block>

<p>In other words, we are not isolated here in South Africa, we who are in the fortunate position of having a steadily expanding Department of Forestry as well as a considerable amount of land on which to expand. But we are also in the position where we must realize that there is no market in South Africa for those increasing quantities of timber; a market must be found abroad, and where that problem already exists internationally, the time has come for this Department to be able to negotiate abroad in order to be able to sell that timber. It is therefore very clear that it is not only in the interests of the Republic of South Africa but it is also of international importance to market that thinned-out timber, those small logs of wood, as advantageously as possible. These small logs are excellent for the manufacture of paper or paper-pulp or pressed wood or for interior partitions and so forth. If we look at this wonderful Chamber in which we are sitting, I ask where we will find finer wood in all the wonderful buildings in the world than the timber which has been used in this Chamber. And it is not pressed wood&#x2014;it is much more beautiful and better. That is a problem which gives me cause for great concern. At present large quantities of these smaller logs are not being used. They must be used in the industry. South Africa cannot afford to leave raw material lying idle. We cannot afford to leave this timber at the mercy of wind and weather. It must be used in the industry. We already have various factories in South Africa making paper and pulp out of wood. I think of the wonderful factory at Piet Retief. One had the strange fact there that they had to define their area of operation and had to tell the farmers just outside of that area: We are very sorry; we cannot take your timber; you must simply saw it up into firewood and send it to Johannesburg. That is only one example of all the factories which are working to full capacity but which are not able to absorb all the available timber, and it is our task, we who have taken the taxpayers&#x2019; money to lay out the plantations, to ensure that those logs are used. We are faced therefore with this question: Either more factories for paper and pulp will have to be erected in South Africa and we must tell the whole world that there is room here and the potential for more factories, or else we must export our surplus timber to countries where there is a demand for it, and there are many problems connected with this question of the export of timber. The problems are in connection with the handling of those logs of wood and so forth. If this Department undertakes the export of that timber itself, we will very soon experience complaints about the so-called competition between a State Department and the private sector. This amendment may already be an example of the complaints which will be forthcoming that the Department is acting as a competitor. But the foreign pulp interests have asked frankly that the Department of Forestry should handle exports of timber because they deem it desirable that this Department, as the largest producer of timber, should be the exporter and should do the necessary preparatory work in connection with the export of timber. When the Forestry Act was passed in the &#x2019;forties it was not realized how our timber production would increase and the proportions it would reach, and that within a short period it would reach such proportions that we would have to export. But we have now reached the stage where we have to export and this law makes no provision for these necessary exports. That is why I feel that it is necessary for the law to be amended in such a way that the Department of Forestry will be able to compete on the international market as a direct exporter of timber products. This means that the Department will <span class="col_1449-1450" refersTo="page_0739"/>also be able to undertake the export of timber for those particular producers profitably, and if there is a lack of confidence, the Department will create a climate of confidence abroad for the interim production, and the outside world will have the assurance that the timber produced in South Africa has been treated properly and is good timber. It is necessary for the envisaged amendment also to make provision for specific provisions with which this timber will have to comply. We know that in the case of the fruit farmers, they have their inspectors who test the sugar-content of the fruit. Poor quality fruit is not exported. We also find that the Wool Board keeps an eye on the quality of its wool and that wool has to be classified before it is exported. This has to be done in order to create confidence abroad that what is purchased from South Africa has been properly treated and prepared, and therefore an amendment of the law will also have to make provision in this regard. I mention this because we have already had private persons who have tried to export timber, but this attempt failed because the timber was not properly treated. The Department of Forestry has since then exported successfully. It was successful because the Department used the correct preparations and treated the timber properly. The result of this action of the Department was that foreign buyers immediately asked the Department of Forestry to control the export of timber and to take responsibility for all the timber exported from South Africa for these pulp interests. All these developments will also be to the advantage of private producers and we have heard how many private plantations there are. The private plantation owners will also have to export and the Department can develop the export market for them.</p>

<p>Afternoon Sitting</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>When we adjourned for lunch I was pointing out that when these various types of timber are offered for sale abroad, this will have to be done at competitive prices. In other words, the Department of Forestry will then be in the position of a dealer or agent who can negotiate and make an offer <i>in loco.</i> The Department will therefore be placed in the position of being freed from the usual Treasury control. It must be in a position to stipulate the best prices for the product on the foreign market in competition with other countries without having to obtain prior approval. It is for this reason and particularly having regard to Resolution No. 4 of the Select Committee on Public Accounts, 1962, that I am moving this motion, namely, that the Forestry Act should be so amended that this Department should not only manage its own plantations and sawmills and do the timber processing, but should also be able to run the industry on the basis of a utility company. I refer to this Resolution No. 4 of 1962, adopted by this House, which states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is certain that the Department is not exempted by any statutory regulation in terms of which it operates from the financial control which the Treasury exercises over all State Departments.</block>

<p>I believe that this was the only logical decision which could have been taken to ensure parliamentary control. It was necessary to adopt that resolution for that reason, but if we wish to view the problems and the nature of the activities in this regard and act in the interests of the forestry industry in all its facets, then we must realize that it has become a commercial industry and that cultivation, soil reclamation and soil conservation will have to be undertaken. Because of all these undertakings the Department of Forestry cannot be dealt with in the same way as many of the other Departments, but can possibly operate partly as the Railways do which have their own auditors and are therefore not under Treasury control and possibly partly like the Post Office which is also developing in that direction. In other words, we have a completely different sort of administration to that of the ordinary State Departments. This is a Department which must be able to act like a commercial undertaking on the foreign markets to the benefit of the State and also to the benefit of private plantation owners, without the kneehalter of the Treasury. That is why I believe that we have reached a stage where we must review and amend the whole of our Forestry Act.</p>

<p>Because there are quite a few members who want to speak&#x2014;and I would like them to have the opportunity to do so&#x2014;I want to conclude on this note. I think that some of the other members will discuss the aspect of research and the other parts of this motion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I second. Mr. Speaker, the timber industry is beginning to blossom into one of our most important industries and is at the same time becoming a key industry in the economic development of our country. The production of timber obviously plays such a big part in our every-day life that you do not always realize its value. Wherever you look around you you see necessities of life which are made of wood, and not only necessities of life but ornaments as is obvious when you look around this Chamber. You think of the various forms of timber products. You think in the first place of construction timber which is indispensable in the construction of buildings. You think of furniture timber, timber which is often processed into beautiful forms. You think of box wood which is such an essential part of industry, particularly in the fruit growing industry. You think of the timber used in the mines without which it will be impossible for our mining industry to develop. You think of the sleepers which are made of <span class="col_1451-1452" refersTo="page_0740"/>wood and which lie under thousands of miles of railway line throughout the country. You think of treated poles for telephone and electricity wires, and of the thousands of miles of fencing on farms. You think of pulp which is used to manufacture the paper without which we cannot manage. You think of match wood and fuel timber which provides warmth on many a cold night.</p>

<p>New techniques in connection with the processing of timber have given us the beautifully laminated woodwork which we have to-day. and in a growing economy such as that of South Africa, it cannot be otherwise but for timber to play an increasingly important role. South Africa is a country where there are relatively few places which lend themselves to afforestation because of our low rainfall. It is only along the eastern coastal regions, against the mountain slopes, and in parts of the Northern and Eastern Transvaal where we have natural forest areas. So we have the position that our indigenous varieties of trees only grow in certain areas with a high rainfall. But unfortunately for us those beautiful indigenous varieties of trees were injudiciously chopped down during the first years of our country&#x2019;s development with the result that they play an insignificant role in our total timber production. It is estimated that in 1959-60 only 186,000 cubic feet of indigenous timber were produced as against 140,000,000 cubic feet in the case of cultivated exotic varieties. Our indigenous forest, because they grow so slowly only produce about 20 cubic feet per morgen per annum, as against 90 feet in the case of the cultivated varieties. That being the position the State had the necessary vision to step in and to protect our remaining indigenous forests and to use our indigenous timber as systematically as possible and to try to restore it. The State has furthermore had the vision systematically to plant exotic trees, particularly soft wood trees, on available State land which is suitable for afforestation but not for agriculture, with a view to the future needs of the country. This far-sighted policy is now beginning to pay dividends in that we can already to a great extent rely on our own supplies of timber. While during the First World War we still experienced an acute shortage of timber here in South Africa and while in the year 1963 we only produced 3 per cent of the necessary construction timber locally, the ratio had improved to something like 39 per cent in the year 1960-1. The far-sighted policy of the Government&#x2019;s through its Department of Forestry, has now opened up this industry through the cultivation of exotic hard wood and soft wood varieties in a country which lends itself very poorly to the timber industry. A departmental survey which was made in 1960 showed that 1,050,000 morgen had been placed under afforestation of which more than half were under hard wood varieties. Seventy-one per cent of that surface is already privately owned which shows that the Government has merely acted as a pioneer, that it has created the confidence and has paved the way also for the private sector to play a part in the timber industry. The State to-day controls about 60 per cent of the soft wood forests while 40 per cent of our exotic plantations are private wattle plantations. It is estimated that there is only room for some 500,000 morgen still to be placed under exotic varieties of trees. The afforestation programme of the Forestry Department was expanded with great confidence particularly after the Second World War. That is evident moreover from the fact that some three-quarters of our soft wood plantations are younger than 16 years to-day, plantations which will only produce in a number of years&#x2019; time because in South Africa soft wood trees are only felled between the ages of 25 and 50 years. As the prospects of the timber industry in South Africa and the circumstances surrounding the industry changed, the State has continually adapted itself to those changes through its Department of Forestry, and the first important development was when the Department of Forestry became a full-fledged Department whereas it was previously grouped together with the Department of Lands. Recently the Department of Forestry has been entrusted to a Minister who is Minister of Lands at the same time, and who also controls other State property. I think it was a wise policy to place the development of our timber industry on a sound basis by means of that co-ordination. I want to pay tribute to the Department to-day and the present Minister. Mr. Sauer, who has adopted a very far-sighted policy in connection with afforestation in South Africa, and also in that he decided that it was not possible for the State alone to utilize all its timber products; that it would concentrate mainly on the large plantations to feed the sawmills and leave the rest to private initiative, as well as his far-sighted policy in connection with the necessity for research, research which could, of course, not keep pace with the terrific extent of the afforestation which had taken place during the years when it was realized that the country should do everything possible to meet its future needs. Mr. Speaker, the figures relating to the scope of the timber industry in South Africa, are impressive. I may tell you that it is estimated that something like R400.000.000 has already been invested in this industry. The annual contribution of this industry to our industrial production is about R80,000,000. Sixty-nine per cent of our private plantations have been planted over the past 15 years and 52 per cent of our soft wood plantations are still under 16 years of age. Now, what about the expected yield of our plantations? This morning here in Cape Town Professor P. P. du T. Deetlefts of the Stellenbosch University gave a lecture to the Economic Institute of the F.A.K. in which he gave these interesting figures in connection with the future of this industry&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It appears that there will be an increase in the production of soft wood from 1958-9 to the year 1970, which is no longer so very far away, from 44,000,000 cubic feet to no <span class="col_1453-1454" refersTo="page_0741"/>less than 164,500,000 million cubic feet, a total increase over this period of not less than 273 per cent. In the case of hard wood varieties the increase will be from 85,800,000 cubic feet to 206,900,000 cubic feet, a total increase in production of 141 per cent.</block>

<p>In addition I may mention that there are altogether 86 sawmills in the country to-day which are continually processing the products of this industry, of which no fewer than 77 per cent are private undertakings. In view of the increasing tempo of production in this industry, it is expected that by the year 1970 another 18 large sawmills will have been erected by private initiative in order to handle the production of the industry. It is striking to note, Sir, that while the Department of Forestry has developed this industry at such a fast pace here in South Africa, the <i>per capita</i> national consumption of timber in South Africa has decreased since 1937 while it has increased elsewhere in the world. The uses to which timber is put include its use as sleepers. It appears that in South Africa the <i>per capita</i> consumption of timber during the period 1957-9 was 2.61 as against 2.91 ten years ago. In Europe, on the other hand, it has increased from 5.23 in the years 1947-9 to 5.93 in the latest year when a survey was made. In the world as a whole the <i>per capita</i> consumption of timber has increased from 3.35 over the same period to 3.92 in the latest year when a survey was made. That can mainly be attributed to the fact that elsewhere in the world it has become more popular to use timber for the construction of wooden houses whereas we here in South Africa are still very slow to succumb to the idea of wooden houses, and also because of the fact that in many cases municipal regulations prohibit the erection of wooden houses. I think that by making more use of our timber potential we in South Africa can use more timber to ease the housing problem, in so far as there is a great shortage of dwellings amongst the non-Whites. But when we look at the position in regard to the expected utilization of timber in the future, we find that it is estimated that in the year 1970 the sawmills will have used no less than 159,400,000 cubic feet as against only 109,200,000 cubic feet in the year 1959 for construction timber and box wood. When we look at the other practically new industry, the wood pulp industry, we find that the increase will be from 13,300,000 to no less than 55,000,000 in the year 1970; when we look at the consumption of timber for rayon pulp manufacture we find an increase from</p>

<p>10,0,000 in 1959 to no less than 20,000,000 in 1970. When we look at the estimated consumption of fibre and hardboard manufacture we find an increase from 6,200,000 cubic feet in 1959 to 8,000,000 in 1970. As far as timber for the mining industry is concerned there is an increase from 38,300,000 in 1959 to</p>

<p>67.0. 000 in 1970. As far as the use of treated poles for various purposes is concerned. we find an increase from 7.340,000 cubic feet in 1959 to 30.000.000 cubic feet in 1970. As far as fuel timber is concerned, we find an increase from 19,400,000 cubic feet in 1959 to 22,900,000 in 1970. In the matchmaking industry we find an increase from 380,000 in 1959 to 1,300,000 by the year 1970. Seen as a whole it appears that by the year 1970 there will be a shortage of 12,700,000 cubic feet in soft wood varieties as against the production figures given by Professor Deetlefs this morning. As far as hard wood is concerned there will be a shortage of 4,500,000 in the year 1970&#x2014;demand as against production. In other words, it is clear that a particularly rosy future awaits the timber industry in South Africa, a period in which labour will justly be rewarded for the first time. Whereas we have so far concentrated on cultivation the time has arrived for us to make use of our timber products. And if we also have to think about exporting&#x2014;I have given you the figures in respect of shortages but they relate to the position as a whole; in the case of certain varieties surpluses are expected&#x2014;if we also have to think about exporting I think the State should also in this regard play the role of pioneer as it did in the case of the opening up of the forestry industry in South Africa; hence the motion by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom that the Department of Forestry should be equipped in such a way that it will also be able to fulfil the function of the pioneer, even in overseas markets.</p>

<p>I want to avail myself of this opportunity of also asking that more use should be made of the Department of Forestry to advertise our own South African varieties of timber. During the past few years, thanks to discussions in this House and thanks to the efforts made by the Department and by private sawmills in South Africa we have made considerable progress in so far as giving preference locally to South African timber is concerned, whereas not so very long ago building contractors and others had a sort of predilection for exotic timber. It is due to this advertising campaign as well as the assistance rendered by the Bureau of Standards that our own South African timber need not stand back to imported timber for building purposes. I wonder how many hon. members have already seen what can be done with our own South African produced pinewood which has been so neglected? Panelling and shelving are made from that simple pinewood which give the most wonderful appearance to a room and furniture.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to say a few words about the special task which awaits the Department of Forestry in the expansion of this timber industry and that is in the direction of research. It appears that a total of approximately R240,000 is spent annually by the Department in various directions on its own timber research institute, on the Wattle Research Institute and on the research section of the C.S.I.R. in regard to timber and the Faculty of Forestry of the Stellenbosch University, and if you add a small amount spent privately on research you arrive at a figure of approximately <span class="col_1455-1456" refersTo="page_0742"/>R300,000 annually. Compared with the annual industrial yield of something like R80,000,000 it means that only .4 per cent of the yield of the timber industry is devoted to research. If you compare this figure of R300,000 with what the State spends on agricultural research, for example, agricultural research only within the winter rainfall area, exclusive of the two research stations, the fruit research station and the wine industry research institute also in this area, you find that agricultural research is subsidized to the tune of R582,000 per annum as against only R300,000 in the case of the entire timber industry in the whole Republic of South Africa. It is clear, therefore, bearing in mind what lies ahead for this big industry, that much more will have to be done in the field of research. Afforestation in South Africa is totally different from what it is overseas. Whereas in South Africa large plantations consisting of one variety only have been planted in order to meet the anticipated shortage of timber in the future, it is customary in overseas countries to plant mixed plantations. We cannot change the existing position. The trees will stand there until they are felled and we will still have to determine what effect such a large plantation without trees of a different variety in between will have on the prevalence of disease. That is only one of the problems which faces the research worker when it comes to afforestation. Thanks to our warmer climate and the nature of our soil the growing period of our forests is faster. It takes a tree 30 to 50 years to reach a size where it can profitably be felled as against 80 to 120 years in overseas countries of production. I mention these facts, Mr. Speaker, just to give you a slight insight into the needs of research which exist as far as this fast developing industry in South Africa is concerned. I am convinced that as production increases in this industry and as the trees reach maturity, we shall be in a so much better position to subsidize research with that income. As I have said research work is being done at various institutions including the research institute of the Department of Forestry itself, but you cannot carry out research and you cannot carry out such a programme of afforestation without trained professional personnel. It is this need which the only Faculty of Forestry in the country, that of the Stellenbosch University, has to meet at the moment. It so happens that sound professional training can only be given if the people concerned are also engaged full-time in research work so that they can convey the benefit of their research work to their students. A great deal has been done&#x2014;and we are very grateful to the present Minister for that&#x2014; during the past four to five years by the granting of bursaries for research to this faculty but the position at the moment is that there is a need for about six technical assistants who will be able to take the lesser important burden off the shoulders of the teaching staff so that the latter will have more time for research.</p>

<p>You also have a somewhat anomalous position as far as the salary scales applicable to the training period is concerned. At the agricultural school at Saasveld where matriculants are admitted, they receive a salary after a few years which the person with professional university training only receives after a long period. In other words, that youngster actually has an advantage and where there is a great need and where we shall have a greater need for trained professional personnel, I want to suggest that some of the best students at Saasveld should perhaps be tempted to continue their studies at the Faculty of Forestry by means of bursaries and in that way meet the need of professional personnel. There is a need for information officers, not only for the State&#x2019;s own undertakings, but particularly for the increasing number of private plantations and also for farmers who want to plant trees and who want guidance; also in this respect trained professional personnel is required. As far as research at this faculty is concerned, there is no danger of overlapping with other research sections of the Department. Each one selects his own particular task, and by means of a control board for co-ordinating research it is ensured that no overlapping takes place.</p>

<p>We are grateful for the opportunity which this motion affords us, of bringing to the notice of the country this important, sometimes forgotten but nevertheless such an important industry in our country, and also this Department and we trust that it will receive the attention of the House and the authorities and that they will do what is necessary to give this wonderful industry a further boost forward.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>This is a most important motion which the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) has moved this afternoon. He has said so much in regard to the importance of the timber industry, both on the side of the grower and the manufacturer and given so many figures, as has been done also by the hon. member who has just sat down, that I do not propose to go over those figures. I think they have said quite enough to show the value of the timber industry to South Africa. Let me say at once that on that score we have no objection to what has been said, but the hon. member has a motion on the Order Paper which he has moved and I now formally move the amendment which stands in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House requests the Government&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to continue, encourage and intensify research in all branches of the timber industry and the promotion of the use of South African timber; and</li>

<li>(b) to leave timber growing and the operation of sawmills and timber processing as far as is practical to private enterprise, as being in the best interests of the Republic&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_1457-1458" refersTo="page_0743"/>I want to say at once in regard to the motion moved by the hon. member that when he had been speaking for about ten minutes I thought he was moving my amendment. It seems that the points he was making were all in favour of my amendment. I cannot read my amendment as being in line with his motion, but I want to come to the specific points of difference in a moment or two, the points of difference between a policy of maintaining the private industry and private initiative and a policy, as contained in paragraph (c) of his motion, which is practically national Socialism.</p>

<p>I see those two concepts as being poles apart. But let me deal for a moment with one or two aspects of the matter in its wider field. Firstly I want to say that I think this debate could have taken place on a more realistic basis if the Minister had at least the Schoeman Report. We have been waiting for that report. We believe that that report showed conclusively that private enterprise in general in the timber industry operated at a considerably lower cost than State enterprise. We are not surprised to learn that because that is a general feeling but in this particular case the value of that report would have been that we would have had precise figures on which this debate could have taken place. However that may be, it is a fact, as both the mover and the seconder of the motion has said, that there is a great deal of room for research, and that is why in the amendment standing in my name we asked the Government to continue to encourage and intensify research in all branches. Sir, the growth of the timber industry in South Africa is really a triumph of research in many respects. The Forestry Department, State-owned and State-financed, must receive the credit to a very great extent, but private growers were not slow to follow, and we believe on this side of the House that that is the pattern that should be followed for the future; that the State through its Department of Forestry, should not take a lead in trafficking in timber products. It should not as the mover of the motion asked, begin to undertake the export of timber products because that will compete at once with private enterprise in this country and we stand for the maintenance of that private enterprise. Sir, private enterprise was left woefully behind when the State was spending millions of rand in expanding the timber industry, but now that is not the position. Private industry to-day is catching up very fast and it should be allowed to do so.</p>

<p>The State should stay there to run pilot plants and to carry out research in many directions. I want to indicate one or two of the directions in which it could carry out research. It could carry out research in regard to our indigenous timbers. For practical purposes we in this country are simply ignoring all our indigenous timbers. They are simply condemned and swept aside; we are told that they do not come to maturity quickly enough; they cannot stand the competition of these exotic timbers which come to maturity so quickly. Sir, that may well be, but is it in the best interest of the State in the long run that we should throw aside our indigenous timber on a long-term plan, as being of no particular economic value? I submit that there is a lot of room for research with regard to our indigenous timber but there is a lot of room for research in other directions as well. In the timber industry we are now going in for what is really monoculture on an enormous and a growing scale. Do we know what we are doing to the ecology of our country not over a few thousand acres but hundreds of thousands of acres where we are growing one type of tree and all of one species? Have we any idea of what we are doing to the ecology of our country? Nobody has any idea. There may be guess-work by various people who are interested in certain branches of science as to what is happening to the ecology of our country that we do not know. Sir, I would tell you a curious thing about this development of our forestry in this country. To the best of my knowledge we have only one book in South Africa dealing with the cultivation of the species <i>pinus,</i> the pine tree, in its various varieties, and that is written by an Englishman. When I sent somebody to our library to ask them to give me the latest books on the growing of pines in South Africa, they sent me a pamphlet dealing with pineapples! That is what they thought &#x201C;pines&#x201D; was. Sir, here we have an industry worth millions of hard currency to South Africa every year and our own parliamentary library thinks that you are talking about pineapples&#x2014;something to eat&#x2014; when you talk about pines. Sir, in regard to eucalyptus seligna, which is now coming to the fore as one of the main standby&#x2019;s for the industrial use of timber, for all sorts of purposes, there is only one good book on that and that was published a matter of 18 months or two years ago by the University of Stellenbosch; anybody could buy it for a few shillings. It is a very, very excellent book indeed but it is very scientific in its approach to the problem. I think the man who wrote it, wrote it for his Master&#x2019;s thesis. Sir, look at this wonderful field that is open there, in the whole realm of literature in the country, to say nothing about what we have got. You know, Mr. Speaker, recently a Press man said to me, &#x201C;we will always accept anything dramatic for our paper&#x201D;. I can tell the Press that there is nothing more dramatic than the story of the dynamic industry which is the timber industry of South Africa to-day. Sir, think of the small beginnings made by one or two people in the Forestry Department, admittedly half a century ago, but what is half a century in the life of a nation? They started with a tree, which is not a thing that you plant to-day and it comes to fruition in a year&#x2019;s time; it is a crop which takes years and years to come to fruition and which in the short period has produced what the timber industry is producing for South Africa to-day. I say it is a dynamic industry and it is a wonderful state of affairs. Let us take seligna for a moment. Here is a seed which weighs something like a milligramme, and under optimum conditions it will give you <span class="col_1459-1460" refersTo="page_0744"/>half a ton of vegetable cellulose in ten years. Sir, that is the basis to-day of huge industries like Soccor with R8,000,000 invested in it. I think to-day it is about R16,000,000.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wakkerstroom said that he had had bad luck with some of our exports. Sir, that is fair enough but think of the research and think of the background and work and experimentation and the investment of that R16,000,000 in Saiccor to produce a product which does not fail when it goes into the world market; it receives no kind of Government support in the way of special preferential treatment or railway rates. It stands in the labour market in South Africa; it buys its raw materials from growers in South Africa at current rates; it sometimes pays a little higher price than some other concerns do. It is paying its labour which it itself uses&#x2014;a tremendous number of people&#x2014; at current rates, and it puts its product into the world market against world competition and it can beat the world. The quality is top, the price is the best, without any artificial backing by means of government measures to support that industry. That is what it is doing to-day. It is no failure; it is no story of partial success; it is a story of complete and utter success as the result of scientific investigation and the hard work and the investment of capital that goes with it. Sir, that is what can be done here in South Africa by private enterprise. I do not want the Government to enter that field. That is why I say that the hon. member should have thought twice before he moved that motion. I put my amendment on the Order Paper so that he could see what it was going to be. I wanted him to see it. I realize that when he read my amendment he realized at once that his motion was wrong. I am not giving any secrets away when I say that the hon. gentleman came to me and said &#x201C;Thank you very much for putting that on the Order Paper so that I can read it beforehand and see exactly what line you are going to take.&#x201D; We are not quarrelling over it, Sir, because I am right. And I am not giving away any secrets when I say that I hope the Minister will also agree with me; that he will not quarrel with me either. The Minister now has to try to find a way out of this difficulty. In South Africa we are moving with a dynamic force; the private sector is moving forward in this realm of timber. Research is also now done by private concerns as well as by the Forestry Department but no private concern can have the resources which the Department of Forestry has. The Department has been carrying that research on over the years; it has the people and it should be supported in every way possible by this Parliament. I plead for that support to-day. That is the true realm of the Department of Forestry. It is no good saying we rely upon investigations within the four walls of an institute where research is carried on. It must be done in the field as well.</p>

<p>May I just for a moment or two give an indication of the directions in which I feel such wonderful work could be done. There is the question of indigenous trees, as I have said. There is more to it than that. There are some of our exotic trees that should be tested out. An ordinary grower in South Africa cannot grow Himalaya Cedar. It takes too long. You simply cannot deal with it like you can with some of the pines. It is not used for the purpose for which we are using pines to-day. The ordinary grower cannot afford a 30 or 40 year rotation to-day, it is too long, but the Forestry Department can do that. Only the Forestry Department can grow Cedar and its future use to South Africa is inestimable. Go and look at the teak forests in India. People think that that teak will not grow under South African conditions, in South African soil and with our climatic conditions but it might well be that it would but on long rotation. A 30 year teak tree is a young tree. We will have to grow them over a much longer rotation than that. Our attention has been concentrated on the quick growing, the quick maturing tree, the tree that reaches large dimensions quickly; that is the sole desire of South Africans in this matter. Teak would do well in South Africa in certain positions, in my opinion, and if given a chance, but only the State can do it.</p>

<p>Then we have investigations into seed trees, trees which have a pedigree behind them. Some work has been done. That work can only be done in the field. There is a field for tremendous expansion so that the private sector developing in the forestry field can take advantage of the lessons that are being learnt for us by the Department of Forestry over a long period. Every lesson that you learn in forestry in a year is qualified by what you learn in ten years and that in turn is qualified by what you learn in a hundred years. But your worth while lessons come from those years and years of research and experience which you gather as the years go on.</p>

<p>What about our soils? Are we making the best possible use of our soil to-day? We know nothing about the changes in the ecology of vast areas which are taking place to-day in our soil. We are concentrating on suitable sites: No. 1, No. 2, No. 3. The first class site, the second-class site and the third class site. Why? For the quick maturing tree that rapidly reaches a large size and outside of that we are leaving it alone. We are to-day almost down to three or four varieties of pines in the whole field of pine growing. We are tending to concentrate on two or three varieties of eucalyptus in the vast number of varieties in that field. Outside of that, Sir, some poplar in little bits and pieces and that is all. There is a vast field for experimentation there and I believe that the Department of Forestry should follow it.</p>

<p>What about trees under irrigation? You see, Sir, one of these days our scientists will find the answer to the desalting of water and this history of the world will change. It will change as much as it did when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. It seems to be a simple matter but there is no easy solution yet found for the desalting of water. The <span class="col_1461-1462" refersTo="page_0745"/>day that that is found the history of the world will change as I have said. If we have water to spare under the conditions which we have here in South Africa&#x2014;we have the land to spare here&#x2014;have you any idea of the timber we could grow under irrigation which would pay handsomely? That has never been tried out. We take our timber to the rainfall; we do not bring the water to the timber. It is not done, Sir, it is unthinkable. It is almost heresy in certain circumstances to suggest that you should do such a thing. But there are areas where we have the water and there are areas where we have the soil. Is it possible for us to test it? The private grower will not do that, Sir, because he cannot get his returns quickly enough. He cannot invest his money and then wait for eight, nine or ten or twelve years before he gets anything directly from his labour and his capital. When it comes to the utilization of timber products and their by-products, the uses to which, for example, even sawdust can be put, the production of vegetable alcohols and things like that the field is immense. I will not talk too much about vegetable alcohol in the presence of some of my hon. friends so I will pass over that quickly and move on to something else. The Minister should be pricking his ears up and taking notice of what I am saying.</p>

<p>Years ago this portfolio was the Cinderella of the Government and of the estimates and so forth. You know I am not given much to throwing bouquets to Ministers, Sir, but we did get a sympathetic Minister when we got the present Minister of Lands and Forestry to take over this portfolio. It was passed from Minister to Minister; I will not go over all that. But we once had a Minister of Defence who was also Minister of Forestry and so on. But it is now no longer the Cinderella. It is of such importance that it warrants almost special privileged treatment so far as the Government is concerned in the one field in which it should be supreme and remain supreme and that is in the field of research&#x2014;inside the institute and outside in the field. I am not asking the Government to plant no more timber. I would like it to limit it as far as is practical to fall into the four corners of the Government&#x2019;s needs to carry on in the field of research. Outside of that let private enterprise go on its way. Private enterprise is on its way. Millions of rands are being spent on various types of sawing plants and so forth. When it comes down to bark processing and the extraction of chemicals and so forth, I say the field is immense; the making of pulp and all those things. The day is not far distant when if a man wants to give his wife a few dozen of silk stockings he will cut down a salinga tree and give it to her and say: &#x201C;There you are; there are a few dozen pairs of good silk stockings&#x201D;, When she goes to the factory and hands in the tree they will process those stockings for her in no time, wrapped up nicely in paper and packed in a cardboard box, all made out of the same tree. My hon. friends laugh, but I wish they would go to Saiccor and watch some of the processing plants. Saiccor is not turning out the finished article yet but we have got factories in South Africa where they are turning out the finished article. Take some of these plastic materials that are being turned out. It is incredible to think what progress there has been over the last few years. Sir, that is the field for the Department of Forestry. Leave private enterprise. The moment the Government starts to export, the moment the Government comes into the market with its products it comes in competition with private enterprise. The Government in the Department of Forestry has got the taxpayer behind it. It must have Parliament behind it to protect our investment in the Department in the shape of plantations, machinery and so forth.</p>

<p>I say, no matter how difficult it may be in practice, the Government should draw a clear line between its functions to pave the way, to put up pilot plants, to carry out investigations, to do research, and the part to be played by private enterprise which finds the markets, takes the lessons learnt from the Department of Forestry and puts them into practice and makes the money for South Africa. There is the dividing line, a delicate line, but I think we have a Minister who will be able to find that line and who will be able to follow it. There is room for the Government&#x2019;s Department of Forestry and private enterprise both to co-exist.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_forestry">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FORESTRY</person>:</from>

<p>I am very pleased because this debate has taken place here to-day. I think the importance of the development of our forestry and timber industry here in South Africa has been emphasized by all the speakers. I think that in emphasizing its importance, everyone realizes that the ordinary public outside do not really appreciate the scope of this new industry in the country. It was quite correctly stated that Forestry has for a long time been treated as the stepchild of State Departments. At first it was not a fully-fledged Department. It was grouped together with other Departments. It became a fully-fledged Department later, but still one of the junior Departments. Now however, as a result of the scope of its activities and its investments and the products which it produces, it has become one of the important factors in the economic life of South Africa. I find, however, that the public outside are to a large extent ignorant of the important role which forestry and its related industries play in our economic life. I make use of the opportunity on meeting Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Industry and similar bodies to give them a review of the activities and scope of the industry and in no single case are those people not surprised when they hear what has, as it were, grown up amongst them without their realizing it. I hope that this debate which has taken place here will contribute towards the country and also my friend, the hon. the Minister of Finance, realizing how important this industry is and the role which it plays.</p>

<p><span class="col_1463-1464" refersTo="page_0746"/>Much has been said about what can be done and I agree with those remarks. As I shall show later, this is practically a new industry in South Africa. The Department and its branches are now reaching maturity and the ramifications of its activities are growing daily. There are many new directions which we will have to follow; the field of research requires investigation and also takes time, but the enormous increase in the activities which have arisen as a result of our forestry industry is a proof that both the Department of Forestry and private industries here in South Africa are not standing still and have not wasted the opportunities which have been created for them, particularly by the cultivation of State forest plantations.</p>

<p>South Africa is, as compared with other countries, very poorly endowed with indigenous trees. It is extremely poorly endowed in comparison with other countries. Only about &#x00BD; per cent of the surface area of the Republic of South Africa is under natural forest which is of any economic value. If one considers that 30 per cent of the surface area of the United States is under economic forests, 53 per cent of Japan and in Sweden, no less than 57 per cent, it proves that we could never have a timber industry in South Africa unless such timber was cultivated by the people themselves; and not indigenous timber but exotic types which grow more quickly than ours. There is a lot in the argument of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) that we must do research in connection with our indigenous varieties but in order to supply our immediate requirements for from 50 to 100 years it was necessary for us to plant exotic trees here. The first planting was made in the Cape as early as 1884 and in the northern provinces, with the exception of wattle, which was started in 1864, the first large planting was made in 1903. Things moved very slowly. Development did not take place quickly. The timber was used first for railway sleepers and there were other more primitive uses for the various types of timber. The first step forward came during the First World War when we were to a large extent cut off from the rest of the world as far as our timber requirements were concerned. This shortcoming was then realized and a fairly swift cultivation was started during and after the First World War. Plantings were again moving very slowly until the real demand was felt particularly during the Second World War and large-scale plantings took place after the Second World War. At the moment the cultivated forests of the Department alone cover about 320,000 morgen. These forests which were planted by the State and by private enterprise also have a capital value which is far larger than most people realize. I am not speaking now about the money invested in them&#x2014;that figure was quoted here to-day. I am speaking about the value of those forests as they stand. The value increases as the trees grow. The value of the State plantations with their machinery and buildings is to-day no less that R180,000,000. The value of private plantations in South Africa is nearly R200,000,000. The value of private and State forests together in the Republic of South Africa is nearly R400,000,000. Very few people outside realize this fact. They think in terms of a tree here and a tree there. Many people never visit the forest areas, they have heard of them but I do not think that one of them realizes that we have an asset here in the Republic which has been built up by our own people. We did not find it here; we planted it up ourselves, an asset of about R400,000,000 at the moment which is steadily increasing. It is swiftly increasing from year to year.</p>

<p>Until shortly before the Second World War very little was done in regard to the secondary use of timber. Timber was then used chiefly for sleepers, building purposes and to some extent for fruit packing although we imported many of our fruit boxes from Sweden up to the Second World War. From the Second World War practically only private industry began to realize the other uses to which timber could be put. We now have large industries&#x2014; and I want to tell the House what the production in this regard amounts to Mr. Speaker; I think it will also surprise hon. members&#x2014; which have grown up since the war and which now make good use of our timber. As our timber production increases&#x2014;and it is increasing very swiftly; I have graphs in this regard but unfortunately I cannot show them here; they reflect future production&#x2014;we find that more and more secondary industries can make use of that timber. Take the case of cardboard which in many respects has taken the place of wood for packing purposes. Every lorry on the streets is fully packed with cardboard boxes. All those cardboard boxes are manufactured here. This is another industry which arose as a result of the timber which was available. I think of plywood and the great use which is made of it. I think of hardboard, large quantities of which are being exported at the moment. I think of telegraph poles and poles for carrying electric cables. Whereas we always used imported steel or cast iron, and later our own timber to some extent, for this purpose, we are now chiefly using our own timber which in many respects is just as effective and as hard-wearing as the iron poles which we had previously. I think particularly in terms of pulp. I do not know whether hon. members know that all the newspapers which they read on the Witwatersrand are made from South African timber. Very few people reading the <i>Star</i> and the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> to their detriment or the <i>Transvaler</i> or the <i>Vaderland</i> to their advantage, realize that those words of wisdom are printed on South African paper, which fact has in some cases apparently not penetrated through to the editors of those newspapers. This paper on which these Minutes of Proceedings are printed, is made in South Africa. The best writing paper which we use in this House is made in South Africa. These are all secondary industries which arose after the last World War.</p>

<p><span class="col_1465-1466" refersTo="page_0747"/>Notwithstanding all this we in South Africa are very small consumers of timber in comparison with other countries of the world. The <i>per capita</i> consumption of timber is less than 13 cubic feet per person in the Republic of South Africa. The <i>per capita</i> consumption of timber in the United States is 220 cubic feet per person. The most important reason for this is that in North America many of the houses are built of timber. Here, as the result of regulations framed by municipalities in the days when timber, at least our timber, was not suitable for the building of houses, it is practically impossible to build wooden houses within municipal areas. But other countries have discovered that timber is not only durable but has other excellent features as well. It is cool in summer and warm in winter. It is just as durable as a brick home, just as good and even better. This is one of the matters which I discuss continually with municipalities and the provincial administrations in order to get them to change those regulations. I can take hon. members to wooden homes here in South Africa and they will be surprised at their comfort, their compactness and their beauty and cleanness.</p>

<p>I stated that I would mention the value of the timber processed in South Africa Mr. Speaker, the total value of the timber which we get from our forests, whether it is sold in its raw slate as firewood, in the form of poles, as building timber of in its processed state. In 1960-1 the value of this timber was no less than R60,000,000. This does not include timber used in the manufacture of plywood. I am speaking now about its final value. I think this will surprise hon. members, namely, that timber products to the value of no less than R20,000,000 are exported every year. They will also perhaps be surprised to learn that the timber industry pays no less than R18,000,000 in wages annually. And an industry in South Africa which pays R18,000,000 in wages is not a small industry; it is an important industry. If one confines oneself more the State forests, in order to appreciate the increase in sales and the increase in the value of the timber which is sold directly from the State forests one find that the value prior to the last war was considerably less than R400,000, that is the value of sales. Last year, in 1961-2, timber to the value of R5,000,000 was sold and it is estimated at more than R6,000,000 for this year. If hon. members will look at this graph they will see that the estimate for the future shows an increase of nearly R1,000,000 per annum in the anticipated sales of timber from State plantations. The State plantations have grown in many respects. I will give only the percentage increase and not the figures. The only available figure prior to the war is that for 1936 and this is now compared with the figure for 1962. The surface area has more than doubled&#x2014;it has increased by 113 per cent and production has increased by nearly 500 per cent. Revenue has increased by 2,260 per cent. This is the revenue of the Department because we are now starting to derive the benefit from the good sense of our predecessors. I think those are the most important figures. I have other figures here, if hon. members are interested, and I shall let them have them on demand, but I do not want to bore the House by quoting too many figures. I merely wanted to mention those three, that our surface area has increased by 113 per cent, that our production has increased by nearly 500 per cent and that our revenue has increased by 2,260 per cent over a period of less than 30 years.</p>

<p>As far as building timber is concerned, we are producing at the moment only 40 per cent of our requirements in South Africa; 60 per cent of our timber for building purposes is still being imported. Hon. members may ask why 60 per cent is being imported. Partly because we do not have sufficient timber available but partly too&#x2014;and this is an important reason&#x2014;because there is a prejudice against South African timber. This prejudice arose as a result of historical circumstances. During the war years when it was difficult to import timber, all sorts of people started in the sawmill industry and they put a great deal of timber of a very poor quality on the market. That poor quality timber spoilt the name of South African timber in the building industry. We now have a prejudice against South African timber which we must try to remove. I am continually having discussions with the Bureau of Standards. We drew up standards first and last year we worked out a new code which was approved by the Bureau of Standards. The position is to-day that if timber bears the stamp of the Bureau of Standards it is for all practical purposes as good as the building timber which is imported from other countries, and we must now dispel the prejudice which exists on the part of builders. It is unfortunately a fact that we receive very little support from architects and engineers. These people do have a spirit of enterprise to a certain extent, but it appears to me as though this is disappearing because they are only too inclined, in preparing their specifications, to draw up those specifications just as they learnt to draw them up when they were still students. They write down &#x201C;Oregon Pine only&#x201D;, without asking whether there is a South African wood which is good enough. They know that Oregon Pine is good and they write down Oregon Pine because they do not have the necessary imagination or energy to find out whether we have timber here in South Africa which is just as good. I may say that I have waged a campaign against my own colleagues in the Cabinet&#x2014;I have been very successful in this regard&#x2014;to persuade them to use our own timber. I may say that there is very close cooperation between the timber industry and my Department, a far closer co-operation than ever before. I have told the timber industry; Every time a State Department orders timber in a contract which is not South African timber, and South African timber is available, you let me know. They do let me know, Mr. Speaker, and I deal with the other State Departments. I now have them where I want <span class="col_1467-1468" refersTo="page_0748"/>them. But I must still persuade the private contractor, I must persuade the engineer and I must also persuade the architect and we can only do this by way of advertising. We now have two institutions doing advertising work in connection with timber. The one is the Timber Advertising Board and the other is a movement called Tanga. We are working well with them and where this year we have an amount of R40,000 on the estimates for advertising, about half of that amount will be going to these two aforementioned organizations for the work which they are doing. But we are not restricted to R40,000. We have an assurance from the Treasury that if we need more than R40,000 for advertising purposes this year, they will be willing to let us have it. But these two bodies are bodies which know their job. They not only advertise by means of newspaper advertisement but they advertise by visiting the large building contractors, by visiting architects, by visiting engineers, and producing practical proof to show that our South African timber is just as good as the imported product. When our future production increases to the extent shown on our graphs, it may be necessary for us to go even further and to obtain protection for our local timber against the importation of foreign timber but if one applies protection in connection with the importation of timber, it may mean that the price of one&#x2019;s own timber will then rise resulting in increased building costs. A better method may perhaps be to make use of import control as long as it exists by limiting permits for the importation of timber if we have timber available in South Africa. Then the price will not rise but the same result will be achieved.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) and the hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit) all spoke about research. I want to add to what I have already said that we are very much aware of the necessity for research. Research is being done in three ways. We have first of all the research which private enterprise is doing in connection with the processing of timber; the other is the research being done by the Department, particularly in connection with the growing of timber, the cultivation of better varieties, the improvement of the soil, the question of climate, the question of the improving of trees and so forth. The hon. member for South Coast called it field work. The hon. member once invited me to Natal and he was a wonderful host and I think that I must invite him to the Eastern Transvaal to show him the field work which we are doing there in regard to improving trees in order to find the best varieties. You see, they move around the forests and they may find a certain type of pine tree. The hon. member does not like pines very much, but they might find one particular tree which has grown taller than the rest, and they take young branches from that tree and graft them to small seedlings so that from that one tree they will eventually have hundreds all producing seed and the seed can then be used further, and all this seed is seed from the improved tree.</p>

<p>It is actually &#x201C;budding&#x201D;. They are not precisely the same. &#x201C;Budding&#x201D; means to insert an eye and &#x201C;grafting&#x201D; means that a branch is grafted. We are improving our tree varieties in this way. I want to invite the hon. member to go there during the recess. I think that he will then be convinced of the fact that the field work that we are doing is comprehensive. But we are doing research work in all our plantations. I come now to the third type of research which is being done by our universities, particularly the two which have faculties of Forestry, namely, Natal University and the University of Stellenbosch. When I became Minister of Forestry, the amount made available to these two universities for research was R20,000 per annum and I increased this amount to R60,000. I intend approaching the Treasury next year and convincing them that with a view to the swift development of the timber industry in South Africa this amount should be further increased, and I have no doubt that they will do so. I do not want to boast about the amount. Hon. members may say that the amount should be larger. I am merely indicating the course we are adopting and the fact that the amount has trebled over the past three years&#x2014; the amount made available to our universities for the very valuable research which they are doing there.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wakkerstroom spoke about the desirability of forming a utility company. I must honestly tell him that I am a bit wary of a utility company. I am a person who in the first place believes in free trade; the Government believes in free trade and it believes that the State must not interfere in private business or private trade except in certain essential cases. It has been justified up to the present and will be necessary for a long while&#x2014;this is where I differ from the hon. member for South Coast&#x2014;for the State to continue to plant trees. But as regards the further use of that timber, I think that this must be left more and more in the hands of private enterprise. As a proof of my <i>bona fides</i> in this connection, I want to point out that the sawmill industry in South Africa was started by the State; private enterprise did not want to participate in it; eventually they started participating and then one had a continual bickering between the millers and the State in regard to how much milling work the State should do and how much private enterprise should do. Then my predecessor, the present Minister of Transport, concluded an agreement with them whereby this would be done on a fifty-fifty basis. This satisfied every one for five or six or eight years. When I became Minister those people again approached me and I then said that it was time <span class="col_1469-1470" refersTo="page_0749"/>to go a step further. I said that the State would build no more sawmills and that all further developments would be left to private enterprise. I even went further by saying that certain of our mills which were not paying propositions should be closed down, and quite a few of them were closed. With the development which is now taking place, the State&#x2019;s share in the milling industry will become smaller and smaller in proportion to the whole. I think that this is the policy which the people and the general public want and it is also in conformity with the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member also spoke about the export of timber by the State. We are exporting timber at the moment but it is chiefly timber which is exported for experimental purposes. It is timber which is chiefly being exported at the moment to rayon factories in Italy and we are hoping to build up a good trade in this regard. But they do not want to buy from private undertakings, only from the State. Certain difficulties arose in connection with the export of that timber. At the start the timber which we sent them arrived there blue and was unsuitable for the purpose for which it had been purchased. We were able to send our experts over with a consignment of timber and they conducted tests for dampness in storage, temperature and so forth, to ensure that the timber arrived there in a suitable condition. Now the Italian interests want to buy from us because we render those additional services. But once we have finally worked out the way in which the timber can be sent over from this country, I am convinced that they will start buying from private producers. We have therefore to do pioneering work in this connection.</p>

<p>We have cultivated many forests in South Africa. When I became Minister I realized that no one knew precisely whether we were planting a sufficient number of trees or too few trees, whether we would have a use for all the trees or whether we should plant more or what the position would be in the future. It is very difficult to estimate what the future consumption of timber will be. One can quite easily estimate what one&#x2019;s production will be, but it is very difficult to estimate what the consumption will be. We know one thing, however, and that is that if we have good timber available, we will find a use for it, and all the other uses for timber such as pulp-making, rayon pulp-making, plywood and hardboard, are all industries which came into being because timber was available. I feel that if we had the timber available we would have more of these industries in South Africa. We must however have a certain measure of security, and I put this problem to the industry. We then decided to appoint a committee of officials of my Department and representatives of the millers and other consumers of timber, and this committee is at the moment correlating all the information to give us a pattern for the future production of timber and the possible consumption of timber. We will never be able to say with any certainty whether we are growing sufficient timber or not, but I think that once we have all this information available, we will in any case have more certainty than we have at the moment. They have collected some very valuable information and there is hearty co-operation between the private sector and my Department in this regard.</p>

<p>The important point was raised that there should be more freedom for the Department of Forestry to conduct its activities. I want to make it clear that the Department of Forestry now has two functions. The one is the production of timber in our forests. In this regard it is practically a business undertaking like our Railways. But the other function is in relation to forestry more or less as agricultural technical services is in relation to agriculture. We have to deal with all the problems, with research, with propaganda, with assistance to private growers, large and small, to supply them with information; we have to deal with the stabilizing of sand dunes along the coast, with the combating of fires and with a hundred and one other things, in connection with which we bear the same relationship towards forestry and the mountain owners as agricultural technical services bear towards the farmers. But at the moment everything is rather confused in this respect. Here you have a State Department which has the usual functions of a State Department and on top of all this it is also a business. But it is still subject to the old Exchequer and Audit Act of 1911, and where the hon. member for Wakkerstroom said that this must certainly hamper our activities, I can give him the assurance that it does aggravate our problems. There is the question of the appropriation of capital; it fluctuates; it does not come from our revenue and it fluctuates according to circumstances and in forestry one must have a consistent pattern as far as possible; we have to deal with the employment of staff and in this regard we have no trouble with the Treasury but with the Public Service Commission. To give an example: We recently had an enormous fire at George. It was necessary to convey timber almost immediately to the State sawmills before it deteriorated. We had however to follow the usual procedure which a State Department follows in connection with the employment of lorry drivers, of mechanics and of other people whom we needed, even in connection with Bantu, and we had to approach the Public Service Commission to obtain approval for the creation of so many new posts. It can easily happen that before all these posts are approved of, a large amount of that timber will have been lost. There is the question of the accommodation of the labourers in the forests. We set up small townships in the mountains, in distant spots. I want to do far more for those people than the State usually does for its people when they live in cities and so forth. I want to build halls for them, swimming baths, perhaps acquire a portable film unit, and get people to give talks there. They are <span class="col_1471-1472" refersTo="page_0750"/>deprived of the usual entertainment and recreation of a town and city and we must give them something in its stead, just as private enterprise does, but under the set-up as we now have it is particularly difficult for us to do so. The only consolation that I can give the hon. member is that we are giving consideration to the matter and as forestry develops as an industry, the need for these services will become greater and greater and I hope that the hon. the Minister of Finance will agree with me that they are necessary.</p>

<p>My time has nearly elapsed but I just want to say that the high regard which hon. members on both sides of this House have for the Department of Forestry is not restricted to people in South Africa. We have recently experienced the fact that people have come here from all parts of the world. We are at present expecting a representative of UN, a man from their forestry branch. We have had people here from the United States, and even from Sweden; we have had two or three people here from Australia and people from other African states, and they have all been very pleased with what we are doing here. Without wishing to bore the House I would like to read an excerpt from a letter from Mr. Nelbeck who is manager of sylviculture in an undertaking in Sweden which controls forests equal in size to all the State plantations in South Africa. He writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am now back in Sweden full of forestry impressions from my journey around the world. My stay in South Africa convinced me that you have reached the word top in sylviculture. The countries with dominating nature forests seem to change their manner of sylviculture very slow &#x2026; they have too many trees per acre, too light thinnings, too long rotations.</block>

<block name="quote">Up to now the forestry people in Sweden have had very little knowledge about the South African forestry. I am busy telling them&#x2014;in speech and writing&#x2014;about your forestry success and fabulous production per acre.</block>

<p>I have many similar letters. I have here a letter from someone in Nyasaland who writes as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In conclusion, we have returned with the most favourable and happy impressions of forestry in South Africa and of the spectacular results achieved by your very fine Department.</block>

<p>Then I have one here from Dr. Lindgren of Madison in the United States, a man who was on a forestry mission to Africa and he states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I must thank you again for the wonderful help and attention. Without you the productiveness of the mission would have been greatly reduced, let alone the interest and pleasure that the trip had for us. There was no question in any of our minds about your leadership in Africa in the wood protection field. Following and making use of this leadership, and the information it has provided, was evident in every country we visited. You and South Africa have a record that was fortunate for us and of which you should be very proud. Everyone of our group kept referring to you (the Department) and the South African work, so that I was not an admiration society of one.</block>

<p>These letters are from important people and they echo the sentiments of all of us here that our Department which perhaps does not advertise itself sufficiently and push itself forward, has done wonderful work here in South Africa and that practically without our being aware of the fact, has built up something here of which we can all be proud.</p>

<p>Will we get the report of that committee in full? And when are we to be given the Schoeman Report so that we can see what that report contains?</p>

<p>It is important that the State should carry on research for the reasons given by my colleague, the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). He gave very good reasons why it was so essential and why the Government are the only people who can carry out research into the whole question of timber development and improvement of the industry for the future. Private industry has done a lot in the past with limited capital. The timber industry is only coming into its own now after many years. The wattle industry has brought much exchange to South Africa and was developed entirely by private enterprise; it has been an example of what can be done economically for the good of the country as long as they get help and support in the field of research. It is essential that there should be research into the development of new varieties of timber to be grown in other parts than the very high rainfall area of South Africa. The high rainfall area has been developing the timber industry very successfully in the last few years through private enter-rise, but we still have so much to learn as far as timber is concerned when it comes to the use of timber and the processing of timber. At the South African Timber Growers Association&#x2019;s meeting last year a very enlightening <span class="col_1473-1474" refersTo="page_0751"/>paper was read by one of our big industrialists in the timber world, and he opened the eyes of many people when he said: &#x201C;Up to now the standard laid down for timber and the grading of timber has been on the wrong lines. I as an industrialist am never quite sure what I am going to get when I get a first-grade timber log, because we grade on size and not on age.&#x201D; He said: &#x201C;When you get to certain types of pine it is more important that it should be 25 years of age, and the smaller log is very much preferable to a bigger log that is perhaps 17 or 18 years of age. Having processed that younger timber it warps and gives trouble because it is not completely mature.&#x201D;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSE</person>:</from>

<p>Last Friday the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) moved an amendment to this amending Bill which was introduced by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) and the amendment reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be referred to a Select Committee for inquiry and report, the committee to have power to take evidence and call for papers and to have leave to bring up an amended Bill.</block>

<p>I support the amendment because if it is adopted, certain difficulties which were mentioned by members on both sides will then be resolved. It was said amongst other things that the Law Revision Committee did not have the opportunity of expressing its opinion on this amending Bill and also that the law societies had no opportunity of expressing themselves in this regard. By referring the Bill to a Select Committee they will have the opportunity of giving evidence if they require any amendment of the Bill.</p>

<p>At the present stage there are only four grounds on which divorce can be obtained in our country. The first is adultery, the second malicious and deliberate desertion, and the third and fourth are set out in Act No. 32 of 1935. I would like to express an opinion as to why changes should be effected in connection with these grounds for divorce. I take first of all the case of adultery. Adultery is the only ground on which the Bible permits a divorce to be obtained. In this connection I want to refer to Matthew, Chapter 18, where the Pharisees put certain questions to Christ in connection with marriage. Amongst other things they asked: &#x201C;Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?&#x201D; To this Christ answered: &#x201C;What God has joined together, let no man put asunder.&#x201D; From these words it is apparent that no other grounds are actually permitted and that these amendments which are being proposed should not be effected. A separation <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is no termination of marriage and therefore the position must remain as it was. But I want to go further in connection with the questions which were put to Christ. The Pharisees again asked Him why Moses commanded that she be given a divorce. The reply to that was: &#x201C;Because Moses, by reason of the hardness of your heart, permitted you to divorce your wives; but it was not so from the beginning. And I say to you, that whoever divorces his wife except for immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries a divorced also commits adultery.&#x201D; You see therefore that originally there was only one ground for divorce, namely, adultery. Earlier, up to the year 1756, adultery was a crime, but since that time there has been no prosecution in this regard and the practice of considering it a crime has fallen into disuse and no longer exists. I have already wondered whether it would not be desirable to make it an offence punishable by law again. It will probably solve many domestic troubles if adultery is regarded as a crime. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) said that our gaols would become too full. That might be so, but when it is a crime and is punishable, people will take care to see that they do not commit that crime. It is interesting to see what the penalties for adultery were when it was still a crime. I quote here from Green v. Fitzgerald and Others, a case which was decided in the Appeal Court in 1914, and in his <i>obiter dicta</i> the Judge said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">During the last century a great change has come over men&#x2019;s minds and adultery is no longer regarded in this country as an offence to be visited with criminal penalties. According to Van den Linden, page 354, the punishment of adultery in Holland between two married persons was banishment for 15 years and a fine of 1,000 guilders and the man could be declared infamous, deprived of office and declared incapable of holding any post for the future. For the first offence a married woman was kept on bread and water for 14 days, and for a second offence she could be banished for 50 days. In the Cape the punishments were no less drastic. In 1756, for instance, a couple was tried for adultery, and on being convicted the male prisoner was sentenced to imprisonment with <span class="col_1475-1476" refersTo="page_0752"/>bread and water only for a month and to payment of a heavy fine, and the female prisoner was sentenced to stand for three consecutive Sundays before one of the church doors, with a card on her breast inscribed with the word &#x201C;Whore ",</block>

<p>You see therefore that 200 years ago it was still a punishable crime in this country and if one goes back into history one finds that at the time there were very few, if any, divorces, but since we have hardened our hearts and since this change has taken place in our attitude and it is no longer a crime, we have many more divorces. I wonder therefore, if the hon. the Minister deems it desirable to refer this matter to a Select Committee, whether this question could also not be investigated.</p>

<p>I come now to the cases which are mentioned under Act 32 of 1935. These provisions state that divorce can be granted besides the other grounds which exist, if a person has been subject for seven years to the provisions of the Mental Disabilities Act and is incurable. It indicates the procedure which has to be followed. Changes can also be effected to this law. Doctors have progressed so far to-day that it is no longer necessary for a person to be detained for seven years under the Mental Disabilities Act. They can very soon say whether a person is incurable and then a divorce can be granted if two doctors sign a certificate to this effect. This will also avoid many difficulties. The hon. member for Heilbron said that where a separation <i>a mensa et thoro</i> exists, there are often cases where the innocent or the guilty party cannot marry again and so lives with some other man or woman and children are born illegitimately who cannot be baptised and he said he was very sorry for the children. That is also the case under this law, and it should also be investigated by the committee to see whether any changes are necessary.</p>

<p>I go further. The fourth is the case where under the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Act a person is declared to be an habitual criminal and sentenced to imprisonment for a period of at least five years; that is to say, that if a person has already been in gaol for five years his or her spouse can apply for a divorce. But we know that a habitual criminal is usually imprisoned for longer than five years, usually for ten years, and my opinion is that where such a person is already a criminal and it is not easy for the innocent party to be married to a person who has been declared a habitual criminal, when such person is sentenced as a habitual criminal the spouse should immediately make an application for a divorce and should no longer have to wait for five years.</p>

<p>I do not have very much more to say in connection with this legislation. It has already been discussed on two previous occasions. I support the motion of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) and will be pleased if the hon. the Minister will consider referring this matter to a Select Committee which can investigate the whole question and effect changes in all our divorce laws. It has also been said here that in England a commission of inquiry sat for four years on the divorce laws question and could not reach finality. I want to say that the English law was in a hopeless mess. The procedure followed here is good; it should merely be improved and therefore I am pleased that the hon. member has moved this amendment. I ask the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to it and, if necessary, to accept it.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will not be long on this matter, but I want to say something about the Bill proposed by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) and also the suggestion made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) that this matter be referred to a Select Committee before the second reading. When the hon. member spoke on this last week, he referred to the fact that in 1953 he had actually made his maiden speech on the subject of the Matrimonial Affairs Bill and that I had followed him in making my maiden speech on the same subject and that I had complimented him on the speech he made. Well, to some limited extent history will repeat itself this afternoon, because I do agree with some of the things the hon. member said last week, one of them being that I, like him, reject the suggestion of the hon. member for Heilbron that we should simply abolish the system of judicial separation, but I do agree with him when he says that there are many anomalies in the existing law and that the matter needs investigation. I had originally intended to support the amendment of the hon. member asking for a Select Committee before the second reading and I said so, as he mentioned in his speech, but I have had second thoughts about it. I have gone into the matter more thoroughly now and it is much more complicated than it appeared at first sight. The other thing which made me change my mind is the fact that the official Opposition is fighting this on party lines, because both the hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) and the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) mentioned that they were speaking on behalf of their party, and this puts a different completion on the whole matter. I intend no reflection on Select Committees of this House, but I do not feel that one can get a really impartial inquiry especially into a matter as complicated as this if it is conducted on party lines in the Select Committee. Our past experience of Select Committees has been that if there are party considerations the tendency is for one party to vote one way and the other party to vote the other way. For that reason I think it is necessary to have a judicial commission of inquiry which <span class="col_1477-1478" refersTo="page_0753"/>will be completely impartial and will not be bound by party considerations. Therefore I have had to change my mind because of the attitude of the official Opposition, but I want to say that I am to-day speaking on non-party lines. I am not putting forward the views of my own party, but my own personal views.</p>

<p>Judicial separation used to have a more useful function than it has now. It had at least an additional function before the passing of the Matrimonial Affairs Act of 1953 in that it gave secure financial support to the innocent spouse in the case of judicial separation in so far as no alimony was granted on divorce. Now the situation has been changed and the innocent spouse can get alimony under that Act. So that particular function fulfilled by judicial separation has disappeared. But the other functions it still continues to fulfil, and that is that it still allows a reasonable period for reconciliation to take place before the final divorce order is granted, and I think that is a useful function and therefore I am against the abolition of the system as such. I think it should be retained, but that the Commission should investigate certain aspects of the law which require amendment.</p>

<p>In arguing the case against changes in the existing law, particularly the hon. member for Musgrave, and also the hon. member for Pinelands, mentioned the British Royal Commission on Divorce, which sat for four years, the Morton Commission which had eighteen members on its panel, and which finally came forward with several conclusions. Both hon. members mentioned that the Commission had finally rejected the suggestion to abolish judicial separation and that is correct, but what they did not mention was that there was considerable discussion and considerable disagreement amongst the members about the whole question of judicial separation, and indeed they went so far as to recommend far-reaching changes. For instance, the Morton Commission stated in para. 313 that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While we consider that the remedy of judicial separation is to be retained, we think it should be available only in respect of grounds for which it is a suitable form of relief. In our view there are circumstances where it is right to allow the marriage to be dissolved, but where judicial separation is not appropriate. In deciding on what grounds judicial separation should be available as an alternative remedy to divorce, we have adopted the test of the safety and protection of the injured spouse.</block>

<p>The Commission thereupon recommended that adultery, cruelty, rape, sodomy and bestiality should be retained as existing grounds for judicial separation, but very significantly, they recommended that the other grounds for judicial separation, namely insanity, desertion and failure to comply with a decree of restitution of conjugal rights should be abolished, because they did not consider that there was need for a protective remedy in those cases, in view of the fact that the insane spouse would be locked up and there was no need for physical protection for the remaining spouse in the case of desertion. But in the other cases they thought there was a need to retain it as a protective device. They went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With regard to desertion it seems to us anomalous that a deserted spouse who, having rejected the remedy of divorce, may be condemned to wish to keep the marriage alive, yet is able to obtain a decree, the primary purpose of which is to entitle him to refuse to take back the deserting spouse if that spouse decides to return to married life.</block>

<p>I think that is a very important argument and it is something which I believe a judicial commission should examine very carefully. I think that would be a positive proposal in regard to any changes which should be introduced in regard to judicial separation.</p>

<p>There are other proposals. I am not recommending them <i>per se,</i> but I put them forward because they are also mentioned in the Morton Report and nobody else has mentioned them. All that has been mentioned is that the Morton Report ruled against the abolition of judicial separation. I think it is important to know that the Commission made further proposals, although it did not recommend them. But there are other possibilities which were examined, and certain members of the Commission were in favour of those proposals. Out of eighteen members nine members voted one way and nine the other way, and the nine in favour of one of these suggestions split up again and four members were in favour of even more far-reaching changes. So there was no unanimity on the whole question. I think a Commission should examine an adaptation of the existing New Zealand system. The adaptation I recommend is a system whereby either spouse may apply for a dissolution of the marriage after a period of not less than three years&#x2019; separation by an order of judicial separation or a notarial deed, and the marriage then can be dissolved by the courts&#x2014;not shall be&#x2014;unless (a) the other spouse proves to the court that he or she genuinely wishes to resume cohabitation, and does not simply spitefully say, &#x201C;I am never going to live with you again, but nobody else can marry you either &#x201D;. So if a genuine desire to re-establish the marriage can be proved, I think the courts should have the power to decide whether the judicial separation order may then become a final order of divorce. The other alternative suggestion which is also an adaptation of the New Zealand system is that after a period of not less than three years&#x2019; separation by either an order of court or a notarial deed, the marriage can be dissolved&#x2014;not shall be&#x2014;unless the other spouse objects to the dissolution and the applicant fails to satisfy the court that the separation was in part due to the unreasonable conduct of the respondent. In New <span class="col_1479-1480" refersTo="page_0754"/>Zealand the onus is put on the respondent. I am changing that to make it more difficult for the plaintiff, who will have to prove that the respondent was partly responsible for the original separation. I think that is an improvement on the New Zealand system, but I am not giving this as a firm proposal; I think it could be profitably examined by the Commission.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this sort of proposal might meet with two major objections, the first to the law as it stands, because the hon. member for Heilbron and others have stated here that the law as it stands does lead to cases of hardship and misery where a spouse actuated either by spite or malice has no intention whatever of ever restoring conjugal rights but can continue to condemn the other spouse to a life of eternal celibacy or to the indignity of an illicit union. On the other hand, I think it meets another objection, and that is the major objection to the hon. member&#x2019;s Bill, namely that it opens the door wide to a guilty spouse profiting by his or her misconduct in order to force an innocent spouse into divorce against his or her will. In other words, if it can be proved in the court that the respondent had no part whatever to play in the original separation, I think that person is entitled to retain the existing situation.</p>

<p>I know there is another difficulty in regard to this whole suggestion, and that is whether or not this should be made retrospective. I think it may validly be said that persons who enter into judicial separation under the existing law should not be put in the position where, if this is made retrospective, they may ultimately be forced into a divorce, even the person who is partly responsible for the original break-up. Being partly responsible is not grounds for divorce at present. So there is possibly a valid objection to retrospectivity, and I know that what I am proposing that the commission should examine does not necessarily meet the case of existing victims of spite under judicial separation. It may be that the commission can come up with a better suggestion, but I think it is difficult to make this retrospective because of the fact that people entered into judicial separation under different circumstances and they should not be penalized now. I also realize that this may not meet the position of future spiteful people, because as Professor Hahlo pointed out in his article, such people can simply sit tight and not take advantage either of a notarial deed of separation or of judicial separation or of divorce, and that leaves the position as it was before. In other words, the man is bound forever and cannot get his freedom to re-marry. Of course I do not speak as a legal expert, but I am told that there has been one case at least where a precedent was set, in the case of Daniels v. Daniels in the Appellate Division in 1958. It is quoted in Professor Hahlo&#x2019;s book on divorce. I understand a precedent was set whereby an initially guilty spouse who has reformed and is now leading a blameless life can ask for restitution of conjugal rights and if that is unreasonably refused he may then be held to have grounds for divorce. I think this would deal with the retrospective cases in the case of a reformed spouse. If this becomes law, I think it can deal with the purely spiteful person who is for ever condemning the other spouse either to a life of celibacy or living in adultery, simply because of one simple act in the past. I know the hon. member for Musgrave disagrees with me about any additional grounds for divorce, but I believe that certain additional grounds for divorce should be provided in our law, and one is cruelty. I could never understand why habitual cruelty is not a ground for divorce. As far as I can understand, one of the reasons why judicial separation is made use of instead of divorce is because cruelty is in fact a ground for judicial separation.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but I am talking about physical cruelty, which is a ground for divorce in England. I think that physical cruelty, which actually makes it physically dangerous for the wife to live with her husband and which at the moment is a ground for judicial separation, must be made a ground for divorce also, and I suggest that that be examined very closely by the Commission.</p>

<p>Hon. members may complain that perhaps I am suggesting widening the grounds for divorce, but speaking for myself, I agree with the views put forward by those members of the Morton Commission who said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We see no benefit to society, to the individual and to the State in maintaining marriages in name which are no longer, and on all foreseeable estimates will never be, marriages in fact and which secure few or none of the purposes for which marriages were designed.</block>

<p>It is because I agree with these views that I make these proposals, and I suggest that a judicial commission examine the whole question of divorce and perhaps also some of these proposals I have advanced.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, in view of the fact that there appears to be very little interest displayed in this subject this Friday afternoon I will not speak for very long and want to content myself with one or two remarks only.</p>

<p>I was very grateful to the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) for introducing this Bill because it gave us an opportunity of discussing this question. I feel that hon. members will all agree with me that it is a good thing that Parliament should discuss institutions of this nature from time to time and that opinions should be freely expressed without <span class="col_1481-1482" refersTo="page_0755"/>having regard to party affiliations. That is why I welcome the fact that this subject was raised.</p>

<p>I also listened with great attention to the standpoints of various hon. members. I found it rather a sad thing that hon. members on the other side saw fit to make a party matter of it. I would have liked to have seen a free discussion on that side, as was the case on this side, because after all, this subject has no connection with any political view.</p>

<p>An amendment was also moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) and in my humble opinion its weakness lies in the fact&#x2014;that is why, as the law now stands, I am neither in favour of the amendment nor of the Bill&#x2014;that if it is adopted, it will mean not only the very wide opening of a door but that additional grounds for divorce will definitely be available, as it were, by means of a back door to our legislation, and I am most definitely not in favour of that. I do not want to hold a long dissertation on marriage, but I think that I would be neglecting my duty were I not to say at this stage that if one studies divorce figures in this country and considers family life in South Africa, one will not seek further grounds for breaking up marriages but rather seek grounds to keep families together! In this connection it never ceases to amaze me that there are a large number of preparations for every marriage that takes place. There are the best things to eat and to drink; the bride&#x2019;s trousseau costs a great deal of money and no stone is left unturned in this connection to make all the preparations in the best way possible. But it always amazes me how little spiritual preparation there is in respect of the pair who are going to be married. How few people indeed are concerned whether these people are spiritually equipped for marriage. I still remember very well when I was still in practice &#x2014;and hon. members in the House who are or have been in practice will know that this is true&#x2014;the trivial matters which people sometimes brought to my office expecting those matters to serve as grounds for divorce. I remember that one young mother wanted to divorce her husband and came to me with her tale of woe. Her reason was that her husband took her to task when the baby cried. She was disillusioned when I informed her that that was the normal thing in any family because husbands expect their wives to see to it that the baby does not cry. She did not take her divorce proceedings any further. One also of course thinks involuntarily of the marriage counsellor who reached the very ripe old age of 80 years. On his 80th birthday he was asked whether he had ever thought of divorce in all the years of his marriage, and his reply was: Never of divorce, but often of murder! I would therefore very definitely not be in favour of additional grounds for divorce being made available. If they must come, they must certainly not come about in this way but that does not mean to say that I take it amiss of the hon. member for Heilbron for having introduced this Bill. I think that he has done us a service by introducing this Bill so that we have been able to exchange opinions freely in this connection.</p>

<p>But before one can go any further with a matter of this nature, even before one can refer it to a Select Committee, I think that because of the importance of the institution of marriage in any organized Christian society, one owes it to everyone who is interested in this matter to be given the opportunity to express their views, that is to say, the Side-Bar, the Bar, the Bench the various social organizations which are closely connected with the matter, churches and marriage guidance officials and organizations. I feel that one has first of all to hear the views of these people, whether by way of a Commission or otherwise, before one can reach any conclusion in connection with a matter of this nature. I can also tell hon. members that the Law Revision Committee discussed this matter in detail in 1951 and came to the conclusion that the time was not ripe to do anything in this connection and that the matter should rest there. I also think that if one wishes to do anything in connection with the matter, before one does so one is compelled to refer the matter to the Law Revision Committee. I want to express the view that we should not proceed with this Bill any further, either as it stands or to continue with it by way of a Select Committee, until such time as this matter has first been referred to the General Law Revision Committee so that their views can be obtained in this regard. I will also undertake to contact some of the bodies that I have mentioned here in order to ascertain whether there is any real need to do anything in this connection and not only in this connection but also in connection with our divorce laws in general. I may say that at the moment I am not aware of any great need existing for a measure of this nature. Public interest in the Bill also appears to be of such a nature that it compels one to believe that no great interest is taken in this matter. But whatever the case may be, I on my part will mention the matter to the Law Revision Committee and I will also have discussion with some of the bodies that I have mentioned here. But I think that we are all in agreement that it is very difficult to discuss one facet of this problem and in my humble opinion this fact has become very clear from the discussion. One has to see the problem as a whole and if one takes action, one has to take action in respect of the whole matter. Because this is so, I want to take the liberty of moving at this stage&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with leave of the House, I wish to make a statement in regard to the message of the State President which has just been conveyed to this House convening a Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Assembly for Monday the 25th instant. The proposed Joint Sitting is in connection with the proposed Bill to grant a certain form of self-government to the Bantu of the Transkei.</p>

<p>I wish to make known that I intend to introduce a Bill on the occasion of the Joint Sitting to amend Section 108 of the constitution by adding a further sub-section, namely a sub-section (3) after the existing sub-section (2) to the following effect, viz.&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1) an Act of Parliament whereby a Bantu area is declared to be a self-governing area in accordance with the provisions of that Act, may provide for the recognition of one or more Bantu languages for any or all of the following purposes, namely&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) as an additional official language or as additional official languages of that area;</li>

<li>(b) for use in that area for official purposes prescribed by or under that Act; or</li>

<li>(c) for sole use in that area in such circumstances and for such limited purposes as may be so prescribed, <br/>and may contain provisions authorizing the use of any such Bantu language outside the said area for such purposes connected with the affairs of that area and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by or under that Act.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>I deem it advisable to give these particulars concerning the proposed Joint Sitting at this stage so that it will be clear that the Government does not intend to pander to the desire of certain critics that the Transkei Constitution Bill should be submitted to a Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Assembly, but that the Government will follow the course indicated above.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In the absence of the hon. the Minister I assume that the hon. the Deputy Minister will deal with the matter and I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsections (1) and to substitute &#x201C;is indecent or obscene or harmful to public morals &#x201D;.</block>

<p>Clause 12 has been taken over from Section 9 of The Entertainment (Censorship) Act, No. 28 of 1931. Changes have been brought into the substance of the provision. Firstly, it has been drafted in the positive instead of in the negative form as it appears in the 1931 Act. That, of course, is a possible advantage. But there are other material changes in this <span class="col_1485-1486" refersTo="page_0757"/>clause. The word &#x201C;calculated&#x201D; is being replaced by the words &#x201C;may have the effect What was implied by that change in the wording was argued, and I think ably argued from this side, under Clause 10. Because the committee has decided upon that particular issue I do not therefore move again that the word &#x201C;calculated&#x201D; be inserted in place of the words &#x201C;may have the effect &#x201D;. But it is a very substantial change because the word &#x201C;calculated&#x201D; can and would be argued as being calculated by the person who produces the matter&#x2014;the film or the picture&#x2014;whereas there is an extreme limitation on the interpretation of this section if the words are &#x201C;may have the effect of offending other persons&#x201D;, As I say, Sir, this is a material change. It is even made more material because of the provisions of Clause 6. Clause 6 was also argued as showing that it in effect changes the principle of our law as far as the onus of proof is concerned. When you read Clause 12 with Clause 6 then the true extent of this change is to be seen. It is in my view a very substantial change and it has therefore brought a big change to the original provisions as they are contained in the existing Act which we are purporting to be taking over but which in fact are being changed. The purpose of my amendment is therefore to get rid of words and to make it perfectly clear that as far as this side of the House is concerned, we stand by the provision that any matter which may be indecent or obscene or harmful to public morals should be in the power of this board to prohibit. But we are opposed to this addition of words as set out in the clause because of the change which the provisions of the Bill bring about.</p>

<p>I also wish to move the amendment standing in the name of my colleague, the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (3).</block>

<p>This is a new provision and there is in effect really no need for it. No need for it was felt in the past. Since 1931 when the existing Act was passed no need has arisen at all and the Minister has not indicated why a provision of this nature should be incorporated in the present legislation. It is obviously an unnecessary invasion into privacy, because as it reads it will extend the prohibitions to a club or an association of persons who, merely because they are associated with such a club or some other body and have to pay, either directly or indirectly, subscriptions to this association or club, will have their privacy invaded by this provision. They will be subject to the provision of the clause itself. That, as I say, is an unnecessary invasion into the privacy of people and I move that it be deleted.</p>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>There are very good reasons why this clause has been drafted in this way. It clarifies Section 1 (a) (i) (ii) and (b). In the memoranda which were submitted to the Select Committee it was very expressly asked that those particular aspects should be covered. To replace it now by a general clause which deals only with certain matters which are indecent or obscene and harmful to public morals, does not at all cover the field which we have been asked to cover. I just want to refer to the memorandum which was submitted by the African Jewish Board of Deputies. They clearly stated, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As the representative organization of the South African Jewish community, this board has for many years been concerned at the publication and dissemination from time to time of material, either originating in South Africa or imported from elsewhere, intended or calculated to incite ill-will or hatred against the Jewish community.</block>

<p>They went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Jewish community is not the only section exposed to such attacks. The heterogeneous population of South Africa with its diversity of races, Coloureds, nationalities and creeds, provides a fertile field for the incitement of prejudice and hostility against particular groups or sections of the population.</block>

<p>You see, therefore, Sir, that here they specifically asked that we should not only prohibit things which are indecent or obscene but certain things which are calculated to incite ill-will between certain racial groups, to bring certain racial groups into contempt. The Jewish Board said further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the same time we believe that any curtailment of or interference with freedom of speech is undesirable and should be avoided, except in circumstances which make such curtailment or interference essential for the welfare of the state as a whole or of its constituent elements.</block>

<p>They say the following in paragraph 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cognisant of these facts this board accepts that legislation is required which is designed to prevent or discourage dissemination of matter intended or calculated to stir up racial or religious hatred, or calculated, by exploiting racial or religious prejudice, to incite hostility against any particular section or group of the population.</block>

<p>You will notice that they do not say things which are intended to stir up such feelings. They clearly say things which are calculated or intended to stir up ill-feelings between various racial groups. That is why we say here that anything which may have the effect, that is calculated or intended, of</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) giving offence to the religious convictions or feelings of any section of the inhabitants of the Republic; or</li>

<li>(ii) bringing any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule or contempt.</li>

</ol>

<p><span class="col_1487-1488" refersTo="page_0758"/>This clause has been taken over practically word for word from the 1931 Act where the same applies in respect of films. There are very good reasons, therefore, why we should state clearly that it is not only anything which is obscene, but anything which is calculated or intended to bring any section of the population into contempt or to incite ill-will between various sections of the population. I wish to add that the Jewish Board of Deputies is perhaps the body in our country which have for years and years exerted themselves to have legislation in South Africa against giving offence to the feelings of a section of the population. For example, if somebody were to say that the Jews were crooks or offensive any Jew should have the right to institute a prosecution. If somebody were to say that the Afrikaners were backward and contemptible, as is sometimes said, any Afrikaner should have the right to institute a prosecution. That has always been the contention of the Jewish Board of Deputies. In view of that we cannot do otherwise than to lay down a minimum as provided for in this clause, namely that any person or any group of persons who writes anything or says anything to place a section of the population into contempt or to sow hatred between the sections of the population ought to be liable to prosecution. That is a very sound rule. That is a rule which we ought to have in South Africa. To replace that with a general formula which will only guard against anything indecent and obscene will not cover the objects of this Bill at all. That is why I think we are bound, Mr. Chairman, to give effect to this memorandum which was submitted to us&#x2014;and there were others as well which insisted on the same thing&#x2014; and to state specifically in the law that these things should be regulated.</p>

<p>I shall not talk long on this clause because the amendment moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) is very similar to the one which appears in my name on the Order Paper. I just want to say a word or two about the statement which the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) has just made. It is quite true that the Jewish Board of Deputies put in a memorandum asking that anybody who is aggrieved by the decision of the board or who considers a decision of the board&#x2019;s to be inimicable to the community can in fact appeal. But I think the hon. member might also have told this committee that that memorandum also stated quite unequivocally that the definition clause was far too wide, both the one applying to Clause 5, which was the one to which the hon. member was largely addressing his remarks &#x2026;</p>

<p>The hon. member says it has nothing to do with this clause but his speech concerned this particular clause. In fact, as far as Clause 12 is concerned, it does of course apply to this clause in a limited way in so far as it defines what sort of public entertainment might be considered offensive. To that extent the memorandum also applies to this, but it is obviously largely aimed at publications or documents and therefore not public entertainment <i>per se.</i> I think the hon. member should have told the committee that in the same memorandum criticism was in fact levelled against the definition clauses in both Clause 5 and this clause by the Jewish Board of Deputies, which, in fact, asked for very much more limiting phraseology to be used. They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whilst appreciating the sentiments underlying the above provisions, it is believed that they are too wide and too vague, and that in practice difficulties might be encountered in their application.</block>

<p>They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In particular the phrase &#x201C;a section of the inhabitants of the Republic&#x201D; appears to be too wide and is likely to create difficulties in application.</block>

<p>They asked for a narrower definition altogether. They were referring to undesirable publications but it does, of course, apply here because the definition of &#x201C;offensive to a section of the inhabitants of the Republic&#x201D; comes into this clause as well. That is all I wish to say about that aspect.</p>

<p>There is a considerable query in the minds of many people as to the right of appeal in this case. I know Clause 14 is actually the appeal clause but I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister, if he can, to clear up this difficulty here. If there is indeed an appeal in Clause 14 as far as public entertainment is concerned, as well as for the rest of this Bill, then I want to introduce the second part of my amendment, which has the effect that while an appeal is pending, people shall not be subject to the very heavy penalties which are prescribed in this Bill. That is why I have added a clause at the end of sub-section (2) to read</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or unless the board&#x2019;s decision is subsequently set aside under the provisions of Section 14.</block>

<p>In other words, Sir, pending an appeal, if anybody does defy the board&#x2019;s edict that such public entertainment falls within this very wide definition of what could be offensive, will that person still be subject to penalties or will such penalties only apply if an appeal, if allowed, is set aside in terms of Clause 147 I move&#x2014;</p>

<from><span class="col_1489-1490" refersTo="page_0759"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Clause 12 is a considerable improvement on the old Section 9 of the Censorship Act. Firstly, as far as this clause is concerned, the improvement lies in this that it gives a wider definition of the norm in order to bring it in conformity with the norms laid down in the rest of the Bill. Another very important improvement contained in this clause is the procedure which is laid down when anybody wishes to lodge an objection in regard to an undesirable entertainment. Let me just remind the committee how the present Act functions and then we will be able to appreciate the improvement in this clause all the more. As the law stands at the moment anybody who wishes to lodge an objection to a performance or film which he regards as undesirable can approach the Minister in that connection. The Minister can then order that performance to stop. As a second step the Minister then refers the matter to the Censorship Board to investigate that performance which has been stopped and to give an opinion. If the board does regard that performance or film to be obscene the promoters have the right to appeal to the Minister again. Whereas he initiated the inquiry in the first instance they can now again appeal to him. If the Minister then gives his decision there is no further appeal from the Minister&#x2019;s decision to higher quarters; that is. nobody can appeal to the courts. It is suggested in this clause that the Minister be deprived of that power. The Minister can no longer put an end to such a performance. What he can do is to refer it to the board and the board must first investigate it before it can be stopped. It is clearly stated here &#x201C;if the board is satisfied; the board must be satisfied that the public entertainment suffers from these defects. Then they can stop it. In other words, we cannot stop a performance immediately. That performance must first of all be thoroughly investigated by the board and the board has to decide whether it falls within (a) or (b) of this clause. If the board finds that that performance is obscene in terms of the provisions of this clause and they prohibit its continuance the promoters now indeed have the opportunity of going to court. That is a very important improvement in this clause. That is why I am sorry that I cannot accept one of the amendments of the Opposition in this connection.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) wants to limit the definition. he actually wants to limit it in such a way that it will not be in conformity with the rest of the Bill. In this regard we have the Censorship Act of 1931 and that Act after all has stood the test of time sufficiently long for us not to limit it but rather to make it wider.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) is concerned about the appeal to the courts. Fortunately her concern is unfounded. As I said a moment ago, this matter can indeed be referred to the court if the promoters of such a performance are not satisfied with the decision of the board. I hope that will reassure the hon. member.</p>

<p>Then I wish to refer to something which was also raised by the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) during the second reading. The hon. member, who I do not notice here, had a great deal to say about this clause. He expressed the fear that it would do harm to the live theatre. Actually, as this clause stands at the moment, it will promote the live theatre more than the old clause because as I have explained in regard to the procedure, such a performance in the live theatre cannot be stopped arbitrarily. It has to be subjected to a very thorough investigation by the board and thereafter the promoters can lodge an appeal if they are not satisfied with the decision of the board. Consequently this clause affords greater protection to the live theatre than that provided for in the existing Act. Perhaps I should just explain why the protection is greater. The board will in this case, as in all other cases, continually be conscious of the fact that its decision is subject to a court decision. I think that thought will cause the board to act very carefully in this case, as also in all other cases, before judging a performance harshly.</p>

<p>Lastly I wish to refer to the powers which are sought in sub-section (3). In terms of this sub-section the board will in future be empowered to prohibit stripteasers. If the board feels that it is obscene they will have the right to prohibit it. We do not make any apology for this because our attitude in this country has always been to place the woman on a high pedestal. I also think it is the duty of the Government and of the state to do everything in their power to maintain the woman in that high regard. If there are people who feel that this will deprive them of their livelihood, I can only say to them that there is enough work in this country for them to do if they wish to earn their daily bread in a more decent way than that. In the light of these considerations I cannot accept the amendments of the Opposition. I hope that like us they will regard this clause as a great improvement on the old Section 9.</p>

<p>I read a letter in the <i>Burner</i> only this morning in which two South African writers, Miss Freda Linde and Mr. W. A. de Klerk, allege that if they write anything in a book which may offend one of the hundreds of religious societies in South Africa, they will be committing an offence.</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;hear, hear &#x201D;. He has, of course, read this Bill as little as these two writers have who wrote about it. They do not read it properly and then they think they are so very clever. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) is already in the Transkei. She must be careful that Drakensberg <span class="col_1491-1492" refersTo="page_0760"/>does not also fall into the hands of other people &#x2026; [Interjections.] Drakensberg will fall into the hands of the Nationalist Party at the following election. Mr. Chairman, hon. members are trying to distract my attention but it is very easy to reply to their stupid interjections.</p>

<p>I just want to point out to the lady and gentleman who have expressed that assumption in the <i>Burger</i> that it says clearly in Clause 5 (4) (b) (iv) that &#x201C;any matter in any publication of a <i>bona fide</i> religious character&#x201D; is excluded from the provisions of this Act. It does not say any publication. It does not mean, therefore, that it must be a book or a tract which deals solely with religion but any matter in a publication. Any portion, therefore, of a publication which is <i>bona fide</i> of a religious nature does not fall under this legislation. I want to give you an example, Mr. Chairman, of what can indeed fall under this legislation and which I think should fall under it. I had the opportunity the other day of referring to it. I want to do so again in some greater detail. It has become customary for certain newspaper reporters or people who write to the newspapers&#x2014;even members of the United Party and of the Progressive Party&#x2014; when they talk about offensive material or pornography or anything obscene, to drag in the Bible and to say that in that event certain sections of the Bible should be banned. I made an appeal that we should please refrain from doing that, that we should not place God&#x2019;s word on the same plane as the indecencies and obscenities with which we are dealing here. If anybody should write and try to place the Bible on an equal footing with what is intended here with &#x201C;obscene&#x201D; and &#x201C;offensive&#x201D; he would be offending against the religious convictions of a large number of people, not only of one denomination but of many denominations and I should say the feelings of all Calvinists and even more than the Calvinists. I should say. without trying to prescribe to the board what they should do. that they must be on a strict look-out for that sort of thing because by doing that the religious feelings of a very large section of our population will be offended. That is the sort of thing which we have in mind here, but where the matter is <i>bona fide</i> of a religious nature or where religious matters are dealt with in a section of a book, but in a <i>bona fide</i> way, that is specifically excluded in this legislation.</p>

<p>On Clause 14,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (1), and substitute the following new sub-section:</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) Subject to the provisions of Section 11, any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the board on any matter in respect of which it is empowered by this Act to make a decision, may within 30 days after the decision of the board was given, appeal against that decision by <span class="col_1495-1496" refersTo="page_0762"/>way of application on notice of motion to any provincial or local division of the Supreme Court of South Africa.</li>

</ol>

<p>The object of this amendment is to make it clear that an aggrieved person shall have the right of appeal to the courts in respect of matters which have been dealt with in terms of the provisions of the Bill which is before us, and the whole object to substitute the provision which I propose for the existing subsection (1) is to widen the class of persons who may appeal, in order to make it perfectly clear that a person who is aggrieved by a decision under the Act, may by giving notice of motion appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Sir, if you look at the provisions of Section 14 as it stands, it is clear that only those who fall within the provisions of sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of sub-section (1) have a right of appeal, and my object is to extend the right to other persons who are interested. I can give one simple example which will show how necessary it is that the Bill should be amended in this way. It is clear that an importer may have imported goods into the country in respect of which a decision is taken that they fall within the provisions of goods objectionable under this Act, and the distribution is prohibited. That importer is the only person who has a right of appeal, and yet he may have disposed of the whole of the consignment which he has acquired from overseas and which may be in the hands of an innocent third party, and that person would have no remedy before the courts whatsoever&#x2014;only the original importer has the right of appeal and he would not be interested in the matter because he has already disposed of the consignment. I do submit to the hon. the Minister also that there are other cases, but I am sure that the hon. the Minister will agree, and I hope it is his intention, that there should in all circumstances as set out in this clause be a right of appeal to the courts. If that is so. it is very difficult to see what the reason was for confining the class of persons who can appeal. It is quite clear that it is only those who fall within sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c), who are aggrieved by a decision of the Board, who have the right of appeal. It seems so obvious that any person who has a real interest and who is aggrieved should have the right of appeal to the courts. The Minister may tell me that it is intended to prevent frivolous appeals, but I would draw his attention to the fact that this is not an appeal in the ordinary sense. It is an appeal by way of application on notice of motion and the remedy would lie in the hands of the courts if any person is acting irresponsibly. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment which I believe will improve the Bill. Certainly it will ensure that there would not be circumstances in which through a technicality an aggrieved party is prevented from taking his case to court.</p>

<speech by="#durr_ant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Throughout the discussion of this measure we have had from the Minister and hon. members opposite the statement that the acid test of the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government is that there is the right of appeal against a decision of the board, but I submit to the Minister that his acceptance or his rejection of this amendment will be the test of his <i>bona fides,</i> and I will tell him why. Sub-section (1) (c) makes the position clear. Sub-section (1) (b) gives the right of appeal to the importer of the goods. Anyone who imports a publication which the board finds undesirable clearly in terms of this provision has the right of appeal to the courts. In respect of (1) (c) as read with Clause 8 (3) there is also clearly a right of appeal in respect of a person who has submitted a manuscript for the decision of the board and who feels aggrieved by the decision. Therefore there is clearly a right of appeal in this clause in the case of printers and publishers of books and newspapers. In terms of Clause 7, which we have already passed, a prosecution can be instituted against any printer or publisher and he has the right of appeal against any decision given by the court. But this is the point, that the court would not be bound, in giving any decision on appeal, by any decisions of the board as to whether the matter is undesirable. In other words, the court has a free right to decide on the merits of the case and to give a ruling as to whether the board gave a wise decision as to whether the matter was undesirable or not. But the court will decide that issue for itself, and after all, that is the kernel of the Bill. But when one looks at the wording of Clause 8, special powers are given to the board in respect of the granting of licences and the issue of permits, and what is more, in the imposition of a prohibition in regard to the importation of certain publications, and it would appear to me from the wording of this clause that that is not subject to appeal.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter which is not subject to appeal. It does not appear clearly from the wording of this provision that, for instance, when the board at the request of some person investigates his work, e.g. where the writer submits his work to the board for an opinion, if the board had to rule that the manuscript was undesirable he has no right of appeal against that decision.</p>

<p>Read the Bill. The only time that the writer has a right of appeal is if he, ignoring the decision of the board, publishes the work and is prosecuted. Then he has a right of appeal against such a conviction. If this is not going to be pre-censorship, if this intimidation is not going to exist, there must at the same time be a feeling as far as the board is concerned that it cannot act haphazardly and that its actions will be subject to appeal to the courts. I do not want to cover the whole terrain again, but I would say to the Minister that this amendment is the test of the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government as to whether or not pre-publication censorship will <span class="col_1497-1498" refersTo="page_0763"/>be applied, because I think it is quite clear from the wording of the provision that it is not intended that there shall be a right of appeal to the courts on all aspects of the Bill, and this amendment places it beyond all doubt that any action of the board can be challenged in the courts. I hope the Minister will accept it.</p>

<p>I differ completely from the hon. member for Germiston (District) when he says that only the importer has the right of appeal in terms of 14 (b). If he reads the Bill properly he will see that clause (c) provides that anybody who, in terms of subsection (3) of Section 8, submits a specific issue of a publication or object to the board, also has the right of appeal. In other words, any distributor of this publication or publisher has the right of appeal in terms of 14 (c). It is not only the importer, but those people as well. I differ completely from him in this respect. Where he says that the publisher will not have the right of appeal and the importer will already have disposed of his imported goods to the publisher and because of that it will not pay the importer to appeal because he no longer has the goods on hand to sell&#x2014; 14 (c) also makes provision for those publishers who still have the banned goods on hand to appeal.</p>

<p>I want to point out something else. If we accept the amendment I want to ask the hon. member for Germiston (District), when he thinks of the second-reading speech of the hon. member for Middelland in which he referred to Graaff&#x2019;s Pool as being indecent, whether the young ladies who stand on chairs with binoculars to their eyes will also have the right to appeal if the men are prohibited at Graaff&#x2019;s Pool? Is that what the hon. member wishes to achieve with this amendment?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein comes along and says that Clause 8 makes provision for pre-censorship, as he calls it. In other words, according to him we will have the position under Clause 8 that a person whose manuscript has been banned will not have the right of appeal until such time as he has taken that manuscript to a publisher, it has been published and he has been prosecuted. But that is not the position. It states clearly that an appeal can be lodged against any decision of this board.</p>

<p>I wish to move an amendment which does not appear on the Order Paper. It covers the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) completely but goes one step further and that is to grant the right of appeal also in respect of works which appear on the existing banning list. I think that is a reasonable request. As the hon. the Minister knows since 1956 about 7,500 books have been banned. Considerable criticism has been voiced in regard to the banning of a number of those and if the Government is really anxious for people who feel aggrieved to have the right of appeal it ought to accept the amendment. It reads exactly the same as that of the hon. member for Germiston (District) except for this additional provision that after the passing of the law people will have 90 days within which to lodge an appeal in respect of works which were banned by the Minister before the law came into operation. I move it as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (1) and to substitute the following new sub-section:</block>

<p>I might perhaps have thought that the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) was an innocuous one if the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) had not also started talking on it. but now I am becoming suspicious. The hon. member for Turffontein said that the author of a book would not have a right of appeal if he had submitted his manuscript to the board and the board had disapproved of it and he had then gone ahead and published it. But that is quite wrong. In that case he has no right of appeal. In such a case the board will probably go to the Attorney-General with a request that he be prosecuted and then he will appear before the <span class="col_1499-1500" refersTo="page_0764"/>court. The hon. member confuses the prosecution against the author with the appeal of the author. Who has the right of appeal to the court? It is clearly provided in Clause 14 that any person who feels aggrieved by a decision of the board in terms of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Clause 8 may appeal within 30 days. Just look at Clause 8 (1) (a), which is referred to. It clearly provides that the board has the power, at the request of any person and against payment of the prescribed fee, to investigate any publication or object and to declare whether it is in the opinion of the board undesirable or not. Therefore the position is that the author writes a book. He does not submit it to the board for approval but publishes it and anyone who notices anything undesirable in it can go to the board, and on payment of a fee say that it is undesirable. Then the board has the power to go into the matter and if it finds it undesirable the book can be banned, and then the author can appeal in terms of Clause 14. It therefore seems to me&#x2014;and the hon. member for Germiston (District) agreed with the hon. member for Turffontein&#x2014;that this whole amendment is based on a misconception. The case for which they are pleading is fully covered in the Bill. Therefore whilst I first thought that there was some substance in the amendment, the hon. member for Turffontein has now pulled the dressing off it so that it looks just like Graaff&#x2019;s Pool.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I feel the same way as the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker), that it is wider than simply (a), (b) and (c) of Clause 14 (1), but this is definitely a very ambiguous clause and I have heard different expert legal opinions on it. For that reason I think that any clarification of this right of appeal would be welcomed, although we all agree on the principle. The right of appeal should be allowed not only in the case of a person in charge of a public entertainment and not only in the case of the importer of goods and not only in terms of Clause 14 (1) (c), but in every case where a writer&#x2019;s books have been declared undesirable. I can see no harm in adopting a clearer version of this clause and I do not think the personal dislike of the hon. member for Fort Beaufort for the hon. member for Turffontein should be allowed to interfere with the impartial decision of this committee. Therefore I support the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) simply because I believe it will clarify the whole issue.</p>

<p>But I have another difficulty in regard to this clause, other than this difficulty as to whether the appeal is limited in the way the hon. member for Germiston (District) thinks it is, or is not limited, as was stated by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort. My difficulty is this. If the case goes to appeal, is it a proper appeal or just a review? In other words, is the Appeal Court entitled to call for evidence as to the reasons for undesirability? The hon. member for Fort Beaufort says yes, but one of the foremost legal authorities in the country, the Professor of Roman Law at the Cape Town University, has expressed exactly the opposite opinion.</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot accept the amendment. The intention in the clause is clear, viz. that if anyone applies for a permit to import a book, if the board refuses the application, the prospective importer has the right of appeal. We need have no doubt about that. That is the considered opinion of the law advisers. It is clearly provided in the Bill that the court will investigate the matter thoroughly. Let me read the English version&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(2) The Division of the Supreme Court to which appeal is made shall inquire into and consider the matter and may confirm, vary or set aside the decision of the board, or give such other decision as in its opinion the board ought to have given.</li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, that leaves the court of appeal a very wide sphere in which to exercise its discretion. It is not simply compelled to support the decision of the board; it can vary it, and it has the right thoroughly to investigate the circumstances and the nature of the matter. I therefore feel that the further definition proposed is really unnecessary.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has not answered the substance of the case I put to him. In any normal statute the provision relating to appeal is a very simple one. It provides for an appeal, whatever the circumstances may be, arising from the provisions of the statute. But what I cannot find out here is why the Minister and his advisers are not prepared to make it abundantly clear that there is an appeal in all circumstances. It provides that any person who falls within one of three categories is in charge of a public entertainment or intended entertainment, or is the importer of goods referred to in Section 21 (3) of the Customs Act, or thirdly, as in terms of Clause 8 (3), submitted a specified edition of a publication or object to the board&#x2014;any one of that very limited class of persons who is aggrieved by a decision of the board has the right of appeal, and then it goes on to introduce a fourth category, those mentioned in Clause 8 (1) (a). Now Clause 8 (1) (a) is itself very limited. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1501-1502" refersTo="page_0765"/>The board shall have power&#x2014;(a) at the request of any person and &#x2026; on payment of the prescribed fee to examine any publication or object and to state whether that publication or object is in the opinion of the board undesirable or not.</block>

<p>Again it is limited. There are four categories of persons who have the right of appeal and any person who does not fall four-square within one or other of those four heads will have no right of appeal, however serious the decision taken in regard to him may be. I find it very difficult to understand why the Minister, who claims that this wording covers everybody who could possibly have an interest, cannot accept the amendment, which merely makes it clear that any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the board may appeal. I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that this is on notice of motion to the court. I have no doubt that the court would grant costs against such a person in an appropriate case and there is therefore no risk of frivolous appeals being taken to court. I say to the Minister that the Bill needs qualification as it stands, and that has not been disproved yet. There are classes of persons who may have a very real interest and who do not fall within the four limited categories set out in this clause and they will not be able to take the matter to court.</p>

<p>No, he is not the importer; the importer has disposed of the goods; they have been sold; they are in the hands of a third party and that third party has no right whatsoever to take that case to court. I think an author may be covered, but what I cannot understand is why, when the accepted way of preparing an appeal clause is to make it clear that the aggrieved parties have a right of appeal, is it necessary in these circumstances to say that A, B and C shall have the right of appeal and to leave out the other cases? We do not know what is going to happen in the administration of this measure, but I do submit that it is much more likely that justice will be done if the provisions providing for an appeal make it clear that any person who has a real right can appeal, and not only persons within the limited classes which are set out in this measure. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be prepared to consider this matter seriously and to consider amending this Bill. I believe that if the hon. the Minister will go to the root of the matter and find out from those who are responsible for the drafting of the Bill why they drafted it in this way, he will find out that it was because they did not feel that in certain circumstances there should be a right of appeal. I believe that the acceptance of the amendment can only improve this Bill.

The importer must act with so much discretion and judgment that he will not import things which will land third parties in unnecessary financial and other difficulties.</p>

<speech by="#durr_ant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) is not here because he took me to task a minute ago for my submission that if manuscripts are submitted by authors for a decision by the board before publication that such authors have in fact no right of appeal. The hon. member referred me to Section 8 (1) (a) but Clause 8 (1) (a) is quite clear; it refers to publications. Then one has to look at the definition, and the definition makes it quite clear that &#x201C;publications&#x201D; refer only to matters which are distributed. For example, it refers to manuscripts and typed scripts: &#x201C;Publication or object is any writing or typed script which has in any manner been duplicated or made available to the public or any section of the public&#x201D;, so an opinion can only be obtained from the board in respect of the manuscript that has already been made available to the public. We have heard from the Minister throughout all these discussions that nobody need be afraid: that the standards are going to be upheld; that authors and writers will be able to submit these matters to the board for an opinion. But if that is so, which we accept, then as the provision now stands, without the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), the position is that where an author has submitted a manuscript to the board and the board regards it as undesirable, he has in fact no appeal against the board&#x2019;s decision unless he has first published it and been prosecuted. In fact, under other provisions of the Bill prosecution can be instituted on the recommendation of the board, but prosecutions may not be instituted if the board has once said that a manuscript is desirable. Even though a complaint may be lodged, once the board has expressed the opinion that a manuscript is in fact not undesirable no prosecution can be instituted <span class="col_1503-1504" refersTo="page_0766"/>against that person; that is correct; that is what the Bill provides for in the clauses which we have already passed. Surely then there should be a right of appeal on the part of the author who has pre-submitted his publication to the board, -if the board says that in its opinion the publication is undesirable surely that author or artist should have the right to appeal to the court and to contest the findings of the board so that he will not run the risk of prosecution. I have put the position as clearly as I can and I can assure the hon. the Minister that this is the opinion of very learned counsel in respect of the provisions that I am dealing with here.</p>

<p>Then there is the other aspect which the Minister has not dealt with and that is the question of the right of appeal in respect of the powers of the board in regard to prohibitions, the issue of permits, the distribution of publications under licence. There is a great doubt here and I will explain to the hon. the Minister why I say that. As the clause now stands, it is stated in (1) (b) that any person who is the importer of goods referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 21 of the Customs Act, shall have the right of appeal. Now, who is that person? In terms of the Customs Act he cannot be an importer of goods if the board has once prohibited the importation of the goods. If the board has examined publication &#x00D7; and decided that it is undesirable, then he cannot be an importer; he has no right of appeal. He first has to import the publication against the ruling of the board before he can go to the courts and then the court may find him guilty and he may be prosecuted, he first has to be prosecuted. The position is perfectly clear. A publisher has no right of appeal unless he has first imported the publication against the ruling of the board. It is perfectly clear that in terms of Clause 8 the board has these wide powers of prohibition in respect of paperbacks which constitute 90 per cent of the imported publications. No paperback can be imported without a permit from the board. In other words, the board first has to rule, by licence, that that particular publication is not undesirable. The moment the board has issued that permit or licence, then only the publisher may import; he becomes an importer and then he has the right of appeal in terms of this clause, but there is no right of appeal against any general prohibition of any publication which the board has declared in the <i>Gazette</i> to be a prohibited publication. The board&#x2019;s decision cannot be disputed. That is why I ask the hon. the Minister to consult his law advisers again, because if as has been stated by the Deputy Minister and by other hon. members on the Government benches, there is no intention here of pre-publication censorship, that the courts are available freely, then what are my hon. friends screaming and shouting about? Let us then have an open appeal to the courts on all aspects of this matter; then there can be no doubt whatsoever. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter because on the advice of outstanding counsel as far as these two aspects are concerned there is certainly very grave doubts as to whether the right of appeal in fact exists.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I have tried to consider this clause carefully, and the first point I want to make is that there are not three categories who lodge an appeal but in fact four categories. The Bill was simply drafted rather strangely. It refers in the first place to any person in charge of any public entertainment, in the second place to importers and in the third place to persons who in terms of subsection (3) have submitted a manuscript beforehand. and then reference is made to the fourth category in Clause 8 (1) (a). As far as the various examples which have been mentioned here are concerned, I just want to say that in the case of a South African manuscript I have no doubt in my own mind that there are two stages of appeal; the one is that the manuscript may be submitted under Clause 8 (3), and if it is rejected there is a right of appeal; or after it has been published somebody may come along and complain about that publication under 8 (1) (a), and at that stage the board may find that the publication is undesirable and then it is perfectly clear that there is a right of appeal. Any person who is aggrieved by a decision of the board in terms of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 8, has that right of appeal. In other words, any South African publication is very clearly covered in both respects, either prior to publication if it has been submitted to the board in manuscript form by the writer or publisher, in which event they can appeal against the decision, or under Clause 8 (1) (a) there can be an appeal after publication. As far as 8 (1) (a) is concerned I want to show how wide this right of appeal is. It is perhaps too wide. It reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Or any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the board in terms of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 8 &#x2026;</block>

<p>It does not limit the right of appeal only to a writer or a publisher or a person with a financial interest. I submit that this is an enormously wide description. Let me put it this way: If, for example, in a competition writers are to submit novels and a certain person acts as judge in that competition and the winning novel is later on prohibited under 8 (1) (a), then I should say that such a judge may feel aggrieved in that having praised the novel publicly by recommending the award of a prize, he will now be confronted with the fact that the novel has been banned. It is an absolutely wide appeal therefore. Now we come to imported goods. Here we have a certain degree of uncertainty, although I do not want to hold myself out as an expert on this matter. The Bill provides that &#x201C;importer&#x201D; has the meaning assigned to that word in the Customs Act and the definition, a negative definition, is &#x201C;*importer&#x2019; shall not include a person outside the Union, If we go according <span class="col_1505-1506" refersTo="page_0767"/>to the definition, which has to be interpreted here, then I think the terra &#x201C;importer&#x201D; has been defined here as widely as it possibly can, and on the example given by the hon. member for Germiston (District), I think that a person who has acquired an imported article will possibly be able to represent himself as the importer and as such he will have the right of appeal. But we come back again to this important Section 8 (1) (a). He will most certainly have a right of appeal under 8 (1) (a) because here we are dealing with an article or object which has already been imported. The original importer has sold it to second and third parties who might have re-sold it. If a certain work is declared to be improper, then under 8 (1) (a) the then owner may feel aggrieved and he may have an appeal under 8 (1) (a). The only way in which the board would be able to avoid an appeal under 8 (1) (a) would be to state specifically that the board condemns this work on its own accord and not at the request of any outsider. This is a trick which the board might be able to employ to avoid an appeal, but I cannot imagine that the board would avoid an appeal on such a pretext, with the result that the only person who would not have an appeal&#x2014;and there the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) was correct towards the end of his speech&#x2014;would be the overseas publisher whose work is prohibited <i>en bloc:</i> he would not have the right of appeal. I do not agree, however, with the hon. member&#x2019;s interpretation on the question of importation; I do not agree with his statement that a person who has ordered a publication from abroad and who applies here for a permit, would not have the status of an importer. I think that is a fatuous, theoretical argument. The hon. member for Turffontein argues that a prospective importer cannot fall under the definition of &#x201C;importer&#x201D; until such time as his goods have in fact been allowed to enter the country; that up to that stage he would simply be a prospective importer. There I have no doubt that he would be an importer in terms of the Customs Act if he has imported the goods, up to the stage where they can be considered. He would therefore have a right of appeal. The only person who would not have a right of appeal would be the overseas publisher whose goods are prohibited <i>en bloc.</i> That person would have no right of appeal. He would have to get a South African prospective buyer who can act as importer, and that prospective buyer would have a right of appeal. If I am correct in this approach of mine&#x2014;and I think hon. members will concede that I am at least very close to the truth except that possibly there may be some doubt as to the question of importation&#x2014;then I think the hon. member for Germiston (District) will have to concede immediately that his amendment is hopelessly too wide. &#x201C;A person who feels aggrieved&#x201D; may be a person who may feel ideologically aggrieved by the prohibition placed on a certain book. On that subjective test practically any person can go to court and lodge an appeal provided he simply tells the court that he feels aggrieved. The hon. member for Germiston (District) argues that people would not appeal recklessly because they might tie mulcted in costs if their appeal is unsuccessful, but that would not be the position as the amendment reads at the moment. If we accepted this amendment, the court would not be able to award costs against a person who comes to court in response to this invitation, because this measure specifically gives the right to any person who feels subjectively aggrieved to go to court. In any event this amendment is framed far too widely. If we wanted to provide for a wide right of appeal, we would have to define some interest or other that the appellant must have in the matter. The appellant will feel aggrieved, but he must have a financial or material interest in the matter in regard to which he appeals either as a writer or as a publisher or as a distributor, or something of that kind. His interest in the matter must not be too slight either, otherwise we may find, for example, that a communistic work is prohibited and that a person who alleges that he imported and bought two copies of the book, may say that he has a financial interest and he would be able to take the matter to court. I think therefore that amendment moved by the hon. member for Germiston (District), viewed in the most favourable light, has in any event been formulated in a completely unacceptable way. Even if we should wish to achieve his object, we could still not accept his amendment. But I support the hon. the Minister unreservedly that this right of appeal has been framed widely enough. If further attention is going to be given to this matter, however, then I too would like this important provision in respect of paragraph 8 (a) (i) to be tabulated in paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) dealing with appeals from decisions of the board, because up to this stage the South African Press and the general public have lost sight of the fact that any person who is aggrieved by a decision under 8 (1) (a) has the right to appeal. [Interjection.] The case which the hon. member for Turffontein mentioned, where publication has not yet taken place, is covered by 8 (3). The document can be submitted before publication under 8 (3); there he has a right of appeal.</p>

F. Steyn) dealt with the matter. It has been an exception which it has been a pleasure to listen to. The hon. member concedes that this right of appeal is a circumscribed right of appeal. I accept his argument that the form of the amendment which I have moved is very wide indeed. It was moved in that form because here we are dealing with a piece of legislation which can easily harm the name of this country, and I believe it is a good thing that in those circumstances we should make it perfectly clear that anyone who has a genuine interest should be able to appeal. The court is there to protect the State against any abuse and I believe that it is wise that the appeal should be in that form. If, of course, the Minister says that it should be limited to any person who has a direct interest of some sort, I would not raise the slightest objection, but it is quite clear that there are circumstances in which there will be no right of appeal whatsoever, and the hon. Minister cannot get away from that. I would draw his attention to the fact that when in a statute of this nature there is a departure from the normal, the court always looks for a reason. If there is a right of appeal given to all interested parties, well and good, but I believe that it is common cause&#x2014;and I think the hon. member for Kempton Park will agree; he was fair enough to say so&#x2014; that this is a most unusual form to use in an appeal clause. The court would undoubtedly place a restrictive interpretation upon &#x201C;classes of persons&#x201D; who fall within these categories. I am certain that there are many persons who would have a direct interest in the matter who would have no right of appeal whatsoever. There is, for example, a case of a person who may be the author of a book which has been banned. If he is outside the country he appears to have no right of appeal whatsoever. That seems to us to be quite unjust and I do hope that the hon. the Minister, if this amendment is voted down, will refer this matter back to his legal advisers in order that a suitable appeal clause can be inserted. I am certain that under this appeal clause a very grave injustice can be done to persons who are interested. I am sure that that is not the Minister&#x2019;s intention and I hope that he will agree to widen the appeal clause to put it beyond any doubt that anybody who has a real interest in the matter will have the right of access to the court.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>This question of appeal is of great interest and it is as well to argue it thoroughly because it is a matter to which we on this side attach great value. It may be argued that the wording is perhaps different from what hon. members opposite would have desired, but the intention and the wording of 8 (1) are very clear, namely that if the board in terms of 8 (1) regards a publication as undesirable then it should be regarded as undesirable until such time as the court decides differently. If the court does not regard it as undesirable the board is obliged to issue a permit. Therefore there is the right of appeal which hon. members want.</p>

<p>The other matter in regard to which the hon. member for Germiston (District) also has strong feelings is the total ban in terms of Clause 8 (1) (d). It is true that there is no appeal in respect of the whole series. Supposing it is a green series of books which is prohibited. It is true that there is no right of appeal in respect of that whole series, but what is much more practical is that there is in fact a right of appeal in respect of a particular book or books in that series. If an importer feels that in respect of any of those books in that series he wants an import permit, he can lodge appeal in respect of that book in terms of 8 (3) and 14 (1) (c). Therefore whilst they have no right of appeal in respect of the whole series, there is in fact a right of appeal in respect of a particular book, and I think that ought to satisfy hon. members.</p>

<p>I do not think it is necessary for me to elaborate on this amendment; it is self-explanatory. The idea is to return the discretion of imposing sentences to the courts and to remove the minimum which is laid down in the Bill in Clause 15. A further intention of this amendment is to reduce the maximum to what it was in the original Bill, because I believe that these penalties are far too high. Particularly do I believe this because the criteria which have to be examined by the board in deciding what is undesirable, are so very wide that it will be possible for the board to rule an object, in terms of the definition of this Bill, as undesirable which most modern countries will not consider undesirable. So I think the penalties are far too high. I am against the principle of limiting the discretion of the court by imposing minimum fines and I therefore move the amendment as it stands.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. the Minister knows this side of the House always objects to minimum penalties. We believe that it is utterly wrong that the discretion of the court should be limited in this way.</p>

<p>The particular matter which may be the subject of a prosecution may not merit a sentence nearly as severe as that which is provided here and the court will have no discretion whatsoever. The amendment which stands in my name on the Order Paper is designed in the first place to remove the provision for minimum penalties but that has already been moved by the hon. member <span class="col_1511-1512" refersTo="page_0770"/>for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). I would say, Sir, that in relation to the proposed amendment to Clause 15 (1) (c) something has gone wrong with the amendment as printed because it does not make clear exactly what was intended. As the whole of this question will be tested on the amendment moved by the hon. member for Houghton, I do not propose to move the amendment standing in my name.</p>

<p>I rise to record once again, Sir, the opposition of this side of the House and also the protest of this side of the House against this further inroad in the rights of our judiciary. I have the fullest confidence in our magistrates and in our judiciary and I believe it will be a happy day for this country when all minimum sentences which have been placed on the Statute Book have been swept into oblivion.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) in the last part of his speech created the impression that what is being done here is in fact something new. The hon. member will agree with me that it is a common practice in our legal system that where statutory offences are created, provision is made for penalties, and an indication as to how serious the offence is given by laying down either a minimum penalty or a maximum penalty. In numerous cases provision is made for a minimum penalty to indicate that this is a serious offence. If the suggestion of hon. members is accepted and minimum penalties are to be omitted, there is no indication that it is a serious offence. I therefore feel, Sir, that in view of the fact that all these contraventions are not only serious but contraventions in connection with which large amounts of money may be involved, it is essential also to provide minimum penalties. If it is provided that the court cannot impose more than a specified amount in fines, it means that the court may impose anything below that, even a ridiculous amount. I have as much confidence in our courts as the hon. member for Germiston (District), but I feel that this indication should be there, that this is a serious contravention. There is only one way of doing it and that is by laying down a minimum. If this amendment were to be accepted, this whole idea would be removed from this clause.</p>

<p>The proposed amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) deals only with minimum fines, but the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) deals not only with the minimum but also with the maximum which may be provided. The hon. member now tries in her amendment to reduce these minimum amounts. I feel that in these circumstances, as I said a moment ago, such large sums of money may be involved that it is quite justifiable to apply heavy fines.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>May I point out to the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) that he is destroying his own argument. The court will know if large amounts are involved and the court will decide what is a reasonable penalty. But what is involved here is of a very minor nature and the court has no discretion to impose anything other than a very heavy sentence.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to reply to one point, which was also dealt with by the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller), namely the allegation that the court is left without any discretion where a minimum penalty is prescribed. The court of course always has the discretion to suspend any portion of the sentence. The court can suspend any portion of the minimum sentence. I hope hon. members do not doubt this. I can just refer to the numerous decisions in the Transvaal given at the time the Game Ordinance provided minimum sentences. You must remember, Sir, that the court in any case has that discretion. The court may suspend the whole or part of the fine. We must view the importance of the heavy penalty, a portion of which may be suspended, in relation to this crime. When there are so many moral offences&#x2014;I do not now necessarily want to compare the publishers of obnoxious material with other moral misdeeds&#x2014;one finds a repetitive trend. The man who has once kept an immoral house does so again; the person who has once tried to make money out of unsavoury matter does it again later. There it is very desirable to have a heavy minimum penalty which may be suspended wholly or in part. For the rest, I cannot really add anything to the sound argument of the hon. member for Ceres, except for this point. May I ask the Opposition how they suggest that legislation should give an indication to the court of when an offence is regarded as serious, except by imposing a minimum penalty?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>By their maximum penalty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The maximum is not always sufficient indication. I concede that there are decisions where the maximum penalty was accepted as an indication that the legislator wanted to impose a heavy penalty, but there is no pertinent expression of the will of the legislator. When we as legislators entrust the judiciary with the very difficult task of punishing an offence, is it not our duty to give an indication here to the judiciary of what we think the penalties should be? In regard to these minimum penalties, as the hon. member for Ceres has indicated, this is the class of offence where unsavoury material is published in order to make money. Only by making uneconomic the transactions of a man who wants to exchange obnoxious material for money, will one discourage him from doing it. I support this provision.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>This plea for the abolition of a minimum penalty almost stirs one, but if one thinks of the scope of this obnoxious material and the eagerness of all of us to restrict it, it <span class="col_1513-1514" refersTo="page_0771"/>really appears to be the only deterrent. Experience has shown that if the deterrent is not strong enough or the fine is too small it is regarded by many of those people as a good advertisement for that product and as part of overhead costs, with the result that the fines really have the opposite effect. Hence the minimum and maximum fines provided for here. I therefore think that in those circumstances, and taking into consideration the right which the court still has, as the hon. member for Kempton Park indicated, to suspend the sentence, the clause should remain unchanged.</p>

The purpose of the amendment is simply to provide Parliament with a means of supervision, which is not only a reasonable request, but a very necessary one. We are dealing here with a board which deliberates in secret and which, when announcing a decision in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> will give no indication to the public whatsoever of the reasons for such decision. Parliament, which should be the watchdog of the public in all matters affecting the administration of the state, will have no means of determining the measure of responsibility or the lack of responsibility with which this board is performing its duties towards the public. True enough, an appeal to the courts has been provided for. Unfortunately, only a limited right of appeal as far as the Act as a whole goes; because, for the millions of people who attend cinema performances (I think I am right if I say that many millions more go to the cinema than read books) everything will be clouded in secrecy. The film industry will naturally be reluctant to offend the Minister in respect of any of his decisions. What he decides, will in any case be final; and because in terms of this law the matter can never go further in the case of films than the Minister, public opinion will never be able to make itself manifest and apply suitable pressure where necessary. Because of this state of affairs alone, in respect of the film industry. Parliament should insist on a form of supervision.</p>

<p>As far as publications are concerned, from time to time a list of books will be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> giving the names of the titles banned by the board, but when giving the list of titles banned, there will be no indication at all of the reasons for classing them as undesirable. Time will show what use publishers and writers are going to make of their right of appeal to the courts. It is a good thing that it is available; but we shall have to wait and see whether writers and publishers will use this right of appeal as often as necessary. My own opinion is that publishers who normally sell from a few hundred to a thousand volumes in South Africa of a book, on which the profits are normally small, would prefer not to enter into an expensive court case, but rather use the privilege of selling many thousands more overseas by announcing on the jacket that the book had been banned in South Africa. In fact, I am inclined to think that local writers and publishers who can contrive to get a work banished in South Africa, will for that reason alone find publishers overseas, whereas otherwise they may never have succeeded. So, the right of appeal to the courts in respect of books is a necessary thing, but I am afraid that that will play a very limited part in the effect of this Act. But quite apart from the argument that the right of appeal is available to aggrieved persons, what I am asking in this amendment is quite simple, namely for the board of publications to report to Parliament annually: to present the Minister, and through him to Parliament, an annual report of activities; and I do think that it would be most undemocratic of the Minister and the Government to use its political majority to deprive Parliament of a right to which it is entitled as a Parliament.</p>

<p>Little more than a year ago, the hon. the Minister of the Interior addressed the Congress of the Association of Civil Servants in Pretoria, and in his address he severely criticized the exaggerated secrecy which exists in the administrative affairs of the State, and this is what he said according to a report which appeared in the <i>Burger</i> on 26 October 1961. It is relevant to what I am proposing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Pretoria&#x2014;De Klerk Kritiseer Oordrewe Geheimhouding:</block>

<block name="quote"> &#x201C;Die oordrewe geheimhouding deur staatsamptenare is een van die redes vir die onkunde by die publiek oor die lands-administrasie,&#x201D; het senator Jan de Klerk, Minister van Binnelandse Sake en van Ar-beid gisteroggend hier ges&#x00E9; toe hy die kongres van die Vereniging vir Staatsamptenare toegespreek het &#x2026;</block>

<p>This speech impressed me, and it was warmly welcomed by the public, and I am now asking the hon. the Minister that there should be a limitation to the secrecy of a public body such as the publications board, and that Parliament should have a right to know. The Minister has an opportunity here to start with his own Department and to practise what he was preaching; and if he does not see his way clear to accept what I regard as a very reasonable amendment, then I am afraid that his speech to the Association of Civil Servants will be without meaning whatsoever. I ask that the Parliament should have the right to receive a report annually of the activities of the board and to know what is going on.</p>

<p>*The DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR; I am afraid that this proposed new clause of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. I. D. du P. Basson) is not only unpractical but is also useless, and therefore it cannot be accepted. It is useless because if effect is given to it, it will really mean that Parliament will receive the report a year after the events happened. It means that things that happened in say the year ending March 1962 will only be submitted to Parliament in March 1963. I also fear that the hon. member is in the dark if he thinks that there is any idea of secrecy. In the first place, the reason why it is useless and impracticable is because the announcements in regard to banned books must continually be published in the <i>Government Gazette</i> in terms of a clause we have already adopted.</p>

<p>Yes, but are we to give a series of reasons in regard to every book we ban? Surely it is a ridiculous suggestion to publish in the <i>Government Gazette</i> the reasons in respect of every passage or page or expression or quotation. That is quite impracticable. It is stated in the <i>Government Gazette</i> what books have been banned, and that becomes known to everybody, and that is exactly one of the methods used to make the public understand what the standard and the level are and what the norm is for judging whether books should be allowed or not. But if the hon. member is so interested in the activities of this board, he is at liberty to ask questions in this House. It is not a matter for secrecy. The hon. member may put questions here, and with reference to the replies he gets he can voice criticism in this House under the Vote concerned.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I think that this suggested new clause is one of the most important to be incorporated in the Bill, and I regret that the hon. the Minister has cast aside the whole suggestion with such very scant courtesy. The Minister seemed to be listening with some impatience to what the hon. member who was moving the amendment had to say. I do not think it is impracticable at all. We have in a number of measures that come before Parliament a precisely similar clause providing for the laying on the Table of a report by the body concerned, so that Parliament should be kept informed, and amongst these matters which are designed to be controlled by Parliament there are few which have greater importance than this measure. I think it will be a most valuable report, and that it is absolutely necessary if Parliament is to do its job properly and perform its duty, that should get such a report. To my mind there could be nothing more wholesome than to have a report of this kind laid before members of Parliament so that the work of this board can be seen and we have a chance of debating anything that in the opinion of members may call for debate and which may call for publicity. The idea that a body of this kind can in effect only have its work brought to the notice of the public if there is an appeal to the law courts, to my mind is absolutely wrong. Because that is what it virtually amounts to at the present time. There is virtually no other means of bringing to the attention of the public and of Parliament what is happening, unless some firm or person or group of people is prepared to take the case to the law court.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize one point that was made by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout and that is that as things are standing at the present time, it is abundantly clear that a book banned here in South Africa is going to be given almost world-wide publicity and a vast market that the author or the publisher could never have dreamt of.</p>

<p><span class="col_1519-1520" refersTo="page_0774"/>Surely the least that can be expected is that a report in connection with such works should be laid before us in Parliament by the board, so that we shall know precisely what actuated them in coming to the decision that they did. If they then submit reason which will stand the test of public scrutiny, they have got nothing to worry about. Surely there is nothing impracticable about it. If this particular new clause is accepted, then in fact it will be shown that there is nothing impracticable about it. The report will be prepared every year, and will be laid before us here in Parliament. And so it should be! If we are to keep in line with the assurances that we have repeatedly received from the hon. Minister of the Interior, this should be done. I have no doubt that the hon. Deputy Minister has discussed the matter with the Minister before the Minister left us&#x2014;I am saying nothing about his absence, because I happen to know that there is good cause for his absence to-day, and we quite understand the circumstances of his being away&#x2014;but surely the hon. Deputy Minister must have discussed this new clause fully with the Minister before he left, and now he seems to be taking up a stubborn attitude, and he is not going to listen to arguments from this side of the House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Then I withdraw it and say that the hon. member has the ability to play his political role in this House with great seriousness. This role he is playing in the first place concerns books which may be prohibited, and they are books which can be prohibited in terms of the Customs Act which for more than 30 years already has made it possible to do so in the unfettered discretion of the Minister of the Interior. In the 1930&#x2019;s when the United Party was in power the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) was not concerned about the lack of parliamentary control, and in the forties, up to 1948, he gave no thought to this urgent requirement that Parliament should know what obnoxious imported publications should be prohibited. Then everything was in order. And during the years of National Party regime, the past 15 years, when the Customs Act was being amended, this point was not raised either. But now it is suddenly raised as a weighty political principle which is at stake. That is the first aspect of the approach of the United Party. Secondly, what is it really all about? It concerns the prohibition of publications which will generally be regarded as improper. There are certain sub-categories which may possibly be regarded as constituting a danger to the State and in regard to which an argument could be advanced for the submissions of the reasons for such prohibition. But the hon. member says that it would be a very wholesome, a very sound step if Parliament could read every year the report in regard to the books which have been banned. Now, if a report has to be submitted giving reasons for the steps taken, then at least an indication will have to be given of the nature of the obnoxious material and its scope which led to the banning of the book. It will now be a wholesome duty for this highest council in the land to have a re-hash of the extracts of obnoxious material which came to the notice of the Board of Control. How that can be advocated seriously I just cannot understand. The point was put that if the Board bans a book written in South Africa, it will afford an enormous amount of favourable publicity for such a book overseas, and that this may be an additional motive for receiving such a report and reading it here. But if this amendment is accepted, take the position of an author whose book has not only been banned but has been discussed in this Parliament. Just imagine what publicity it will receive then. Is the whole matter not based on a misconception, that this is an administrative activity in regard to which a report must be submitted to Parliament? Where does the practice emanate from of certain administrative functions being given to the executive authority without a specific report being submitted to Parliament, but not in the case of others? There are two classes of executive functions which are generally made subject to a report to submit it to Parliament. The one is an executive function where a substantive economic activity is entrusted to the executive arm, as e.g. in the case of a marketing board. That activity is excised from the body of parliamentary administration and entrusted to that other body, and it must report regularly. The second category where one expects <span class="col_1521-1522" refersTo="page_0775"/>a report from the executive arm is usually where the executive arm acts as a semi-legislative body, in which case Parliament wants to know how they have used their powers. But here we are establishing a body which at the most can be described as a quasi-judicial body, because in view of the appeal provided for against all its decisions, it is not even a quasi-judicial body; it is merely a board of control and its decisions can be appealed against, but apart from that its decisions are not secret. If there is an aggrieved importer who wants to import a book and he is prohibited from doing so, surely that person can convey his complaints to any member of Parliament and we can have a debate about it under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote just as well as we can debate a detailed report which is submitted.</p>

<p>But has the mover of the amendment considered what such a report comprises? The Board must submit a report of its activities to the Minister. I take it this will be a general report. But then the report must contain, <i>inter alia,</i> details in regard to every matter submitted to the Board for a decision, as well as the reasons for such decision. In other words, it is necessary to give details of the matters submitted to the Board for a decision. I think this report will in many cases have to contain the whole manuscript or a description of the whole article concerned, because the matter submitted for a decision is surely the whole of a book or the whole of a film, and details must be given as well as the reasons for such a decision.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes me here is that this amendment does not even accept the matters which have in the meantime been decided by the court and in regard to which a report need not be submitted again. No, the United Party is so concerned with advancing superfluous amendments and the accusation that the Minister is too impatient to listen to their arguments that they have not even thought of excluding these things which during the course of the year were decided by the Board and then went to the court on appeal, which gave a decision. Details of these matters must also be given, as well as the motives of the Board. But let us leave this superfluity there for the moment and let us accept that the report will deal with all the details of those matters which were not heard by the court. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kemp-ton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) has spoken about the records that the court will provide. I sincerely hope there will not be many appeals to the courts. It is a clumsy manner of carrying out the work of this Board. We do not wish to have appeals and I hope they will not be necessary.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout moved an amendment the other day in which he asked that Parliament should be informed of what the Board was doing and be suggested&#x2014; a very wise suggestion&#x2014;that a record of all banned books should be kept here, the actual books themselves, so that hon. members could read the books and see how the work of the Board was carried out. What is he asking now? Simply that there should be a report to this House. The Deputy Minister has said that we can ask questions in the House, but we cannot. The hon. member for Vereeniging and Fort Beaufort have been telling us now for days that the Minister is handing over his authority to the Board, and we shall be placed in the same predicament in which we are to-day with the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. When we ask him a question about the S.A.B.C., he thinks of the three monkeys: He sees no evil, he hears no evil, and he thinks no evil. He refers us to the Act, and that is exactly what will happen here. The Minister will say: I have no authority over this Board; I appointed them and I can ask them questions but I cannot reply to questions in the House. I can imagine the kind of report we will receive. This Board will report to the House annually on modern tendencies in literature, the type of book against which they have had to take action. They will be able to give us information, because this Board is a new creation and surely it is the duty of this House to keep its finger on the pulse of this Board&#x2019;s activities and to know what they are doing. I think the amendment is a very reasonable one and the Deputy Minister should accept it. Perhaps he has been instructed to refuse all amendments, but if that is so I suggest that he accept the suggestion of the hon. member for South Coast: to think it over and perhaps to readjust it in Another Place. It is a simple request and I think we are justified in making it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say that in no similar circumstances are such reports submitted to Parliament, and for various reasons. Firstly, as the Minister has indicated, everything which is disapproved of by the Board is advertised in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> The hon. member for Bezuidenhout then interjected and said that that is all well and good, but that does not give the reasons and he wants the reasons. But is it not the most ridiculous thing in the world to ask that the reasons for the rejection of everything which is obnoxious should be set out and published to the world? [Interjections.] The hon. member expressly asks in his amendment for a report on the activities of the Board which must, <i>inter alia,</i> contain details in connection with all the books submitted to the Board and the reasons for their decisions. The hon. member wants the reasons why a book was not approved of. The net result will be that an explanation will have to be given as to why the book was banned. The hon. member wants an extract of everything which we cannot expose to the public.</p>

<p>But there is another reason as to why this report is quite unacceptable and unnecessary in practice. It will in any case be an unwieldy report and I am afraid none of the hon. members opposite would read it. The other reason is that there is a right of appeal to the court. It will have the result that a standard <span class="col_1523-1524" refersTo="page_0776"/>will in the course of time be laid down by the court, and hon. members at least have those court reports available. Everybody can go and listen and the court reports are published, and that will give the Board a norm. If a magistrate gives a decision which is appealed against and the magistrate&#x2019;s decision is not upheld by the Supreme Court, then he will know that next time he must not give the same decision in similar circumstances, because the Supreme Court has given an indication. In those circumstances, seeing that the Supreme Court will lay down the norm, not only the Board but also the public will know what that norm is, and this House will also know. Therefore I feel that a report like the one asked for is not only undesirable but unnecessary. This Board only has power of control. It has no legislative or semi-legislative powers granted to it by this House. And those powers of control are not unlimited. Some guidance is given to it in the Bill itself, and the powers are not unlimited because they are subject to appeal to the court, and a norm will be found and every hon. member will know what the norm is. Therefore I regard it as unnecessary.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Ceres and Kempton Park have a very strange approach to the work of this Board, and they give me the impression that they have a poorer concept of the Board and its work than anyone on this side. The Deputy Minister commenced by saying that this suggested amendment was useless and impracticable, and I regret that he did so. On the contrary, I find it a very commendable addition to the Bill before us. It is the usual practice of Parliament to include a provision of this nature whenever a statutory board or body is set up by Act of Parliament to carry out certain executive functions of Government. It is the normal procedure. The hon. member for Ceres talks glibly about wanting another example, but he gives none himself, whereas on this side of the House many instances were quoted.</p>

<p>Whenever Parliament creates a body such as this it has a duty to see that its functions are carried out. Otherwise it simply creates a body, the creature of statute, and leave it the master of the situation. Surely Parliament must be master of the situation in a case such as this where it creates a body to carry out certain functions. The normally accepted method is that such a body of persons presents a report to Parliament annually, which gives Parliament the opportunity, firstly, of seeing that the functions of the Board are properly carried out. but more important, it secondly enables Parliament to question the responsible Minister. During the debate on one of the clauses in which the delegation of powers was discussed the point was made that a delegation of that nature leaves the House without any remedy, and the Minister&#x2019;s reply was that he of course remains responsible. Now here is an instance where unless you have information before you that aspect of the matter is lost to Parliament, because Parliament is entitled to have before it annually a summary of what has taken place in carrying out the functions bestowed on a body like this. Let us have no doubt about it. The powers which are being conferred upon this body are extremely wide and important and should constantly see the light of day; it should not be left to the privacy of the boardroom. Hon. members opposite make great play of the right of appeal to the court. I have asked repeatedly at whose cost is this to take place? Who pays for all this? But I have not had a reply yet.</p>

<p>That is not the way to legislate, to leave the burden with the court; you must ease the burden of the court by saying precisely what the law is. You are placing a burden on the business community of going to court. Every time one voices criticism, hon. members say: The courts will put that right. Let us accept that that is so. Then surely the board should work to some set principles. The hon. member for Ceres says the courts will lay down standards. Therefore the amendment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout becomes very important, because it is the duty of Parliament to know that those standards are being adhered to by the board. One does not expect all the &#x201C;smerigheid&#x201D; to be published. Surely the board works on principles and accepts the standards laid down by the court. The nature of the report, I would have thought, would be extremely helpful both to the board and to Parliament. One of the objections is that the matter will already have been published in the <i>Gazette.</i> Surely that is a fact which helps the board to carry out the provisions of this amendment. But the principles on which the board operates are not set out in the <i>Gazette.</i> It is just a statement Chat they are undesirable. This report will give the opportunity of setting out the principles on which the board acted and enumerate the type of thing which falls within those principles. I started by saying that the amendment seemed to me a very commendable provision to add to the Bill, and I conclude by commending it to this honourable House.</p>

<p>If this Committee accepts the amendment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. it will amount to this Committee wanting to ensure that annually we will get the most pornographic publication imaginable at State expense. [Laughter.] The hon. member says in his motion that in this report details must be given in regard to every matter submitted to the board for its decision, as well as the reasons for such decision. Now I want to ask whether it will satisfy hon. members if <span class="col_1525-1526" refersTo="page_0777"/>in that report it is simply stated every year that this number of books, of which notice has already been given in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> have been prohibited because they contain obnoxious material? [Interjections.] No, according to the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment, reasons must be given. We shall have to quote those passages containing the offensive passages from book after book. It will have to mention the parts dealing with sexual activities which constitute the real reason for the book having been banned. All that will have to be contained in the report, because these are the reasons that have to be given to convince Parliament that these books were properly considered. Therefore I am afraid that if we accede to this request we will be responsible for publishing a bestseller, and the only question will be whether the same board will not have to ban that also! The more I think about it, the more impracticable the suggestion appears to me, because if the intention is, as was stated by the hon. member for Kensington, that the report must indicate the tendency in literature, I credit everyone with enough intelligence to infer from the <i>Government Gazette</i> what the tendency is in literature. I have here lists of titles of books which have been banned and which can indicate to anyone with a little intelligence what the tendency is amongst the authors of these yellow books, and a study of the <i>Government Gazette</i> will also indicate what that tendency is. It is not necessary for the State at its own cost to publish the greatest pornography of all.</p>

<p>Last week we heard some exceedingly feeble answers from the Minister in reply to some of the questions put to him &#x2014;that is, when he answered at all. It is therefore fitting that the Deputy Minister, who is below the Minister, gives the kind of answers which fall even below the level of the Minister&#x2019;s answers. One of the reasons he gave for not agreeing on the need to publish the report as such is that such a report is useless because it comes after the event. Now, I have asked someone here to go and fetch me three reports, at random, of various boards, control boards&#x2014;because this is a control board&#x2014;and I got information that the Clerk of the Papers could not part with them, but that I could see them in his office. I refer to the Mealie Control Board, the Chicory Control Board and the report of the Cape Town Milk Board, and when I have finished, I hope the Minister will say the same about these three reports as he said about the proposed report of the publications Control Board. Here is a report of the Mealie Control Board, for the year 30 June 1962, the latest one available. The Minister may say it is at least nine months old and therefore of no use. In the case of the Chicory Control Board the latest report is for 1961, so it is <i>2j</i> years old, and it gives statistics about the dried chicory root handled by the board for that year and the preceding 20 years. According to the Deputy Minister, that is very valuable information, and it is proper that that board shall report to Parliament! In the case of the Cape Town Milk Board, the annual report was tabled in the House on 6 February, 12 days ago. It is brand new, but it deals with the year ended 31 December 1960. Surely no responsible person can say: The report you asked for will be useless because it will deal with something after the event. The Deputy Minister knows better than I do that almost every member of the public over the age of nine is likely to have attended a cinema during the year, but who knows or cares about the use of dried chicory root? Therefore I say&#x2014;with respect&#x2014; that his first answer is completely unacceptable. In his second answer he said that this report will be the most pornographic publication, and the board might have to ban it&#x2014;but look at the situation in practice. I said last week that apparently it did happen from time to time when the Chief Magistrate of Cape Town had the delegated powers from the Minister and could not make up his mind about a film, he asked the Minister to see the film. And that was not denied because the Minister told us that that did happen to him from time to time; he had to see such a film. It is a remarkable thing, Sir, that in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of yesterday there is a report under the heading, &#x201C;De Klerk will vet * immoral &#x2019; Italian film this report deals with a film to which I referred last week in the course of my discussion of the matter, a film called &#x201C;Boccaccio &#x2019;70&#x201D; which has been banned by the board. Here in a public document, a newspaper, the reasons are given as to why this film has been banned and why the importers have seen fit to appeal to the Minister as they are entitled to do. It is &#x201C;offensive to decency &#x201D;. That is clearly a reason given by the board. Does that make the <i>Sunday Times</i> pornographic, or, at least, more pornographic than it was? It has also been banned because of &#x201C;its passionate love scenes and loose morals.&#x201D; Does that make this newspaper any more immoral than it was, simply because it refers to such reasons? But what also comes out of it is this: that the importers of this film, not being satisfied with the decision of the present board that&#x2014;according to the board&#x2014;it was offensive to decency, that it contained passionate love scenes and scenes of loose morals, they appealed to the Minister, and&#x2014;lo and behold&#x2014;the Minister now has to go and view this film in order to decide whether the ban imposed on it should be retained or lifted.</p>

<p>I want to put it to the Deputy Minister of the Interior that if he is afraid that the public of South Africa may be exposed to pornography and for that reason it requires the activities of a film censorship board, then clearly he is not going to find very much sympathy amongst those people who want to view films in their original form, and as they were imported. But the moment he says that a report that has been asked for <span class="col_1527-1528" refersTo="page_0778"/>in the amendment of the hon member for Bezuidenhout is going to be a pornographic document, and that he wants to protect us, the members of this House, from the influences of pornography, then he should remember that his own Minister, perhaps this very afternoon has been victimized&#x2014;according to him &#x2014;and subjected to the same pornography which occurs allegedly in this film &#x201C;Boccaccio &#x2019;70&#x201D;, that the poor Minister has to sit there and watch all these things which are offensive to decency.</p>

<p>Who, Sir? That &#x201C;gentleman &#x201D;!? I was about to say that our Minister of the Interior, who is a member of the Upper House, is this very afternoon, I understand, being subjected to the pornography contained in scenes which are offensive to decency and in scenes which according to the newspaper, quoting the decision of the board, are passionate love scenes showing loose morals. I want to say with great respect to the staying power of the Minister of the Interior, that if he can take it, so can we! In other words&#x2014;not that I am looking for an invitation to see this film&#x2014;it may be very nice to be able to go off in the afternoon and see a film which is offensive to decency and so on; but if the Deputy Minister does not see anything wrong in the Minister of the Interior being called upon to view such a film, then certainly, Sir, you must agree that there would be nothing wrong in a report submitted by the board saying that &#x201C;Boccaccio &#x2019;70&#x201D; was rejected, and that a certificate was refused because it contained scenes which were offensive to decency, because it contained passionate love scenes which were offensive, etc., etc. That is all that they would have to say. They are not required to give an expose of the entire film. I want to say this if there were a proviso under which the board would have to report, quite apart from the fact that it has much greater public importance than a report of the Chicory Control Board, then in banning a film like &#x201C;Inherit the Wind&#x201D;, to which I referred last week, the board would be obliged to say that since it has no love scenes, since it cannot be offensive to decency, since it has nothing to do with loose morals, &#x201C;we banned this film because it was anti-fundamentalist that it did not condemn the film because of &#x201C;loose morals&#x201D; etc., but because it refused to allow anybody in South Africa the right to believe in the Darwinian theory! Then the public of South Africa would know where we stand in relation to this Government, and in regard to this board. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to come back again to the argument that it is quite impracticable to give the reasons why a book has been banned. I think that hon. members on this side have made it quite clear why one cannot in a report give those reasons clearly to the public and also to this House. Therefore we need no longer argue about that.</p>

<p>But I want to raise a different matter, namely that I think that this will make the work of the board impossible. This board will have to give their findings in regard to thousands of books throughout the years, and those findings may be used against the board in any future litigation. In other words, when the board publicly gives reasons for having banned a certain work, those reasons which it has put into writing may be used in any future court case. Therefore I think it will make the work of the board impossible. I want to go further and say that public opinion is continually changing. I have here, for example a book named &#x201C;The Banned Books of England &#x201D;. From that it can be seen that books which were at first banned were later accepted as classics. Things which were banned previously are not regarded to-day as things which should be banned. The fact that a new Act has been placed on the Statute Book in England shows how public opinion has changed. If one makes the public acquainted with the findings of the board and the grounds on which it arrived at its decisions, it means that one is really creating a position to which public opinion cannot adapt itself. Therefore I think it is impracticable to expect this board, which has to give decisions in regard to thousands of books and films, to reduce those decisions to writing so that in future they may be quoted against the board. I say that it will obstruct the functioning of the board instead of the board adapting its functions to the form and the development of public opinion as it has progressed through the years. I therefore think that it is simply impossible to accede to it. The question is whether people will make use of the right of appeal to the courts. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) said that people would not go to court. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) also said he hoped they would never go to court. But if one takes the position in England, one finds that certain cases there lasted for years; that a battle was waged for years to have the banning of a book rescinded. In other words, even in England people go to court to appeal against the decision to ban a book. I am quite convinced that the correct course is to take the decision out of the hands of the Minister and to place it in the hands of the court, and that one would be applying the rule of law here. In that way the political influence, which hon. members opposite do not want to have, will be removed entirely.</p>

<p>I am dealing with the amendment that the board shall report.

When one realizes the implications of that clause, one sees how essential it is that Parliament should be advised what the activities of the board has been. There is a complete misunderstanding here of the activities of this board, and I believe that until we get a report of the board in this House of Parliament, we and the public will not know what the ramifications or the functions of this board are. In terms of this measure nobody can, for example, import any periodical because every periodical will be sold at less than 50c.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I am speaking on the amendment which provides that the board shall report to the House, and I am trying to point out that the ramifications of this Bill are so wide, much wider than the question of pornography and indecency, that it is going to be very important in the implementation of this measure that the House should know what is going on. Sir, I can point out a hundred things that nobody can import in terms of this Bill, and we want to know from the board what is going on, otherwise this thing is going to become farcical. There is no periodical that can be imported unless a permit is applied for and the House will want to know what is happening as far as applications for permits are concerned. Sir, the commercial industry in this country imports millions of pamphlets per annum, and in terms of this Bill not a single pamphlet can be imported. It has a soft cover; it costs under 50c and nobody can import a pamphlet. The Minister or the Department has no right in terms of this Bill to exclude, by advertisement in the <i>Gazette,</i> any particular item that falls within the category of pamphlets. We feel that it is only right that the Minister and the board should come to Parliament and tell us what is going on. If somebody wants to import a prohibited soft-cover book costing under 50c. I would like as a member of Parliament to be told by the board in a report how it is going to be done, because you are not allowed to import a soft-cover book unless you have a permit from the board. How do you get a permit from the board? You have not got the book, so you cannot go to the board and say, &#x201C;Please give me a permit to import this book,&#x201D; because if I am in possession of the book and I have not obtained a permit I have committed an offence if it is a soft-cover book costing under 50c. How do you go about getting a permit to import a soft-cover book? These are the things which are underlined in this particular Bill and which hon. members opposite seem to have forgotten about altogether. We are not dealing with pornography or with indecency. We are dealing with tens of thousands of items which fall under the category of soft-covers under 50c which come into this country day after day and month after month. Sir, when the ramifications of this Bill are felt and known, it becomes as clear as daylight that not only we on this side, but hon. members opposite will want to know how this Bill is working, because it is so all-embracing, it is so wide, it gives so much power because it is in the negative sense. Nothing can be done except by means of application for a permit. There are going to be hundreds and hundreds of organizations, institutions, businesses and persons applying to the hon. the Minister for permits. I have to apply to the Minister for permission to import this pamphlet which I have before me; every single motor firm in this country that issues a brochure on its motor car will have to apply to the Minister for permission to import. We will have to pay a fee and will have to apply on the prescribed form. I repeat that the Minister cannot alleviate the position because he has no right to do so under this clause, which is so far-reaching that we want the Minister and the board to report to this House.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) has raised certain points which have to be replied to. His point was really this, that this measure may have such wide ramifications, in terms of the provisions of Clause 5, that it would be desirable to submit a report to Parliament in connection with those wide ramifications. In the first place I just want to show that the hon. member&#x2019;s premises were completely wrong. The hon. member makes the submission that the Minister cannot allow the importation of broad categories except upon specific application. But Clause 8 (1) (c) clearly provides that the board shall have power &#x201C;subject to the provision of sub-section (2) to approve of the importation by any person during any specified period, of any publication or object referred to in paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) of Section 5, which (l) is published by a specified publisher; or (ii) falls within a particular class of publication published by a special publisher; or (iii) deals with any specified object, if in the opinion of the board that publication or object is not likely to be undesirable and at any time in its discretion to withdraw any approval granted under this paragraph &#x201D;. Under 8 (1) (c) these categories dealing with any specified subject or falling within a particular class of publication or are published by a specified publisher may be <span class="col_1531-1532" refersTo="page_0780"/>given a blank permit or a blanket exemption from the restrictions laid down in Clause 5 (c). It is perfectly clear that advertising material in the motor industry, for example, can be described as a category; that would dispose of the matter then; that category would be exempted. My contention is that Clause 8 gives the Publications Board permission, where goods have been excluded generally under the 50c prohibition, to allow any defined category of those goods to enter the country without a permit; that the board has the power to define a category of goods.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will find it in Clause 8 (1) (c) (ii) in the Afrikaans text: &#x201C;Binne &#x2019;n besondere kategorie van publikasies val &#x2026;&#x201D; The English text reads: &#x201C;Falls within a particular class of publication published by a specified publisher,&#x201D; and (iii) is much wider: &#x201C;deals with any specified subject &#x201D;. A &#x201C;specified subject&#x201D; may be advertising material in respect of motor vehicles or advertising material in respect of any other specific commercial article. The hon. member is harbouring imaginary fears. The board has the power to exempt these broad categories which the hon. member mentioned. The hon. member also raised the question of magazines and said that everybody who wished to import a magazine would have to obtain a permit. The board is being authorized here in very specific terms to authorize the importation of a series of magazines which may be published in the future under a particular title by a particular publisher, and that disposed of the matter. So much with regard to the factual basis on which the hon. member based his speech. The hon. member misconstrued the way in which this Act will work and the concessions which may be granted under the Act. In the second place he stated that unless the amendment was accepted we in Parliament would not be able to get information as to how these far-reaching powers are used, and the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) made a similar statement. Mr. Chairman. I want to suggest that these hon. members are entirely wrong. The Minister will be fully responsible for all questions which may be put to him as Minister arising from this matter. Clause 16 (1) gives the Minister the power to promulgate regulations with regard to the conditions of office, <i>inter alia,</i> under which the members of the Control Board will serve. These regulations can legitimately include the instruction that the members must furnish information to the Minister on any matter about which the Minister asks for information. I cannot speak here on behalf of the Minister and say that he will exercise that right, but since the Minister has the right to prescribe the conditions of office of members of the board, the Minister can never come before this Parliament and say that he is unable to obtain this, that or the other information. The practical position therefore will be, as far as this <i>en bloc</i> prohibition of articles costing 50c or less is concerned, that the board will have the necessary power to grant concessions, but if the board does not grant those concessions, then there are two remedies. In the first place the prospective importer of the article costing less than 50c can, in terms of Clause 14 (1) (b), take the matter to court on appeal where he has applied for permission to import and that application has been refused. His second remedy is this: If he does not want to take the matter on appeal to court, he can write to his Member of Parliament and say, &#x201C;I have been unable to obtain permission to import these particular articles costing less than 50c; please ask the Minister what the reasons are and take the Minister to task &#x201D;. The Minister, without the slightest doubt, would have to reply to this question. The hon. member for Kensington has suggested here that information may be refused just as in the case of the Broadcasting Corporation which is an independent body. In making that statement he sought to bring the Broadcasting Corporation under fire once again but that statement is obviously not in accordance with the facts of this Act. The Minister is fully responsible for the administration of this measure by the Publications Board.</p>

<p>Finally I do want to ask hon. members on the other side what they seek to achieve with their amendment. When we on this side suggested that in terms of the amendment the board would be required to motivate its decision to reject certain works, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout shook his head and said, &#x201C;no. it is only the article &#x201D;. I take it that in saying that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout indicated that in using the words &#x201C;the reasons for such decisions&#x201D; he simply meant that the board will have to say: &#x201C;I found under</p>

<p>Clause 10 (c) (iv) that it depicts human figures in an offensive manner &#x201D;. The mover of the amendment which emanates from the United Party has therefore helped us now by saying that as far as the reasons for the decisions are concerned, he virtually wants a reference by the board to the section of the Act under which it gave its decision.

The position appears to me to be that the board can give relief in respect of specified publications, specified subjects or a specified publisher, but it is governed by (2), and that is why we come back to the point that we want the board to report to Parliament so that we will know what is going on. In terms of Clause 8 (2) application has to be made for a permit. Somebody will apply and will be granted a permit for a particular reason but there will be no general publication so the <span class="col_1533-1534" refersTo="page_0781"/>world at large and Parliament in particular will have no knowledge of what is going on.

<p>I wish to appeal to the hon. the Minister. I am sure he has had some time to reflect. I do believe that this Bill can only be improved by accepting the amendment now before this Chamber. The hon. the Minister and others on the Government side have advanced arguments of inconvenience&#x2014;I cannot put it higher than that&#x2014;why the proposed new section moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) should not be accepted. Here is a provision where power is being vested in a non-judicial body subject to appeal which will not cover all circumstances I do hope that the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment which will ensure that where action is taken under this clause Parliament will be informed. The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) and others have raised questions as to the efficacy of this provision. That may be so. It may be that there is not an adequate opportunity for debating some of these matters but that is a matter for Parliament to deal with at the proper time.</p>

<p>We have one piece of legislation after another in this country in terms of which it is necessary for reports to be submitted to Parliament. I submit that that is an adequate safeguard. Especially in a case such as this where very wide powers are being given to a board notwithstanding that there is a limited right of appeal and notwithstanding that it is a requirement that the board shall make its decisions known in the <i>Gazette,</i> I do submit to the hon. the Minister that a case has been made out for the acceptance of this amendment. The hon. Minister says it will serve no purpose. At least, Sir, it will be on record I believe that it will serve a purpose in two respects: Firstly, it will be possible, not only for the Government but for this House, to see how the board is discharging its functions. Secondly, I believe that a provision of that sort will give great satisfaction both inside this country and outside this country as to the fact that there is a check on arbitrary action under this provision. I do hope that having come back from his dinner this evening the hon. the Minister will be prepared to reconsider his earlier decision and to accept this amendment.</p>

The argument of the hon. the Deputy Minister is superficial. Furthermore, I should like to reply to the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn). This Bill specifically provides for what reasons the Control Board may ban books, and all that this amendment now asks is that in terms of the same Bill the Control Board should give the reasons for its decisions. I ask nothing more of the Control Board than that it should say: This series of books, or this particular book, was banned &#x201C;because it was offensive to public morals&#x201D; or &#x201C;because it is blasphemous&#x201D;, or &#x201C;because it will disturb the relations between the population groups&#x201D;, so that Parliament may judge in what category of prohibition a particular banned work falls. It need not be a voluminous report. In fact the Control Board has the advantage of itself deciding how to frame its report. The hon. member objected to the word &#x201C;details &#x201D;. He asked how I defined it. It is easy enough for the board to report that it received a complaint in regard to publication &#x201C;&#x00D7;&#x201D;, that it was considered and that it was banned, e.g. because it was offensive to public morals. If the Deputy Minister objects to the wording of the amendment we can change it; but we ask that that side of the House should be willing to accept the principle. But what is happening in fact is that they do not want to reject the wording only, but the whole idea of any supervision by Parliament over the activities of the board.</p>

<p>It is a pity that there are such suspicious members in this House who suspect everything. The only danger is that before long the hon. member&#x2019;s party may become suspicious of him, but I leave it at that. I am always perfectly willing to consider amendments, particularly from the Opposition, because I remember that there was a time when we too were in the Opposition, and it is a good thing if an Opposition can be consulted, but in that event the Opposition must make out a case in support of its proposition. And I say with all due deference that no case has been made out here to-day for this amendment moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. A hullabaloo has simply been raised here. After all, it is nonsensical to say that this provision as it stands here means that we are maintaining secrecy, that Parliament is not being kept informed and that the public is not being kept informed. These publications which are prohibited are publicized in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and all the hon. member has to do is simply to keep a record of the names and to tabulate them and he will then have a clear indication as to what has been prohibited. He will not have much trouble in determining what kind of books have been banned. If he is still not satisfied with that, then the hon. member is at liberty to put questions in this House. Under the Interior Vote he can then react to the replies <span class="col_1537-1538" refersTo="page_0783"/>to his questions and criticize this board, and the responsible Minister will have to answer that criticism. There is no question of secrecy therefore. The point has also been raised that the banning of a book will serve as an advertisement for the book overseas. If that is so I am surprised that the Opposition now discovers for the first time after 50 years that it will be an advertisement, because this has been the position since 1913. The 1931 legislation is based on the 1913 legislation; the two measures are parallel. This provision has been known since that time and I am surprised that the Rip van Winkles are discovering it now for the first time. All that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout has to do, with his customary diligence, is to make a study of the <i>Government Gazette,</i> and then I think the reason for his suspicion will disappear.</p>

<p>The Minister has, on two occasions I think, sought to prove that this amendment was unnecessary, and one of his reasons, supported by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) was that it was open to a member of the House to put a question to the Minister about such matters as we say the board should submit in its report to Parliament. Sir, it is therefore relevant to explain to the hon. the Deputy Minister something which he should know, and that is what happens in the case of a question which the Minister cannot or will not answer? With your permission, Sir, I want to cite one example in my experience. In regard to the establishment of a medical school for non-Whites, I have directed four questions to the Minister of Health and on Friday, in replying to those questions, he said, &#x201C;No, No, etc., etc.&#x201D; When I put a supplementary question, he told me to put that on the Order Paper.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I merely want to say, Sir, that having taken the advice of the hon. Minister&#x2014;I think this is relevant&#x2014;I immediately approached the Assistant Secretary of the House to put that question on the Order Paper and, of course, I was told that it could not be put on the Order Paper. The Rules of the House make it impossible sometimes to elicit the answer which this side of the House wants, by way of a question.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the suggested procedure in regard to films, particularly that which is envisaged in the amendment moved by the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). On a previous occasion this afternoon I tried to indicate what was happening at the moment, under the existing legislation, and therefore what must happen in terms of the Bill before the House in terms of the particular clause we are discussing; and how this situation could be improved considerably if the Deputy Minister accepted the amendment of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout. As I said, I dealt with a film which, according to a reply given to me by the Minister last week, had been banned. It should be borne in mind that over the last five years the number of films banned annually by the Board of Censors has been between 20 and 30&#x2014;an average of 21 per annum. This film which I cited last week and which is germane to the discussion now, &#x201C;Boccaccio &#x2019;70&#x201D; is the last on the list for 1962. Therefore, presumably, that was the last film to be banned, because these names do not appear in alphabetical order. That happened sometime last year but right now, possibly at this very moment, the Minister having been asked by the Chief Magistrate to view &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>New arguments. Sir? That is precisely why I rise to speak. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has come along with a new illustration as to what His interpretation is of the details and the reasons which have to be submitted to the House of Assembly in terms of his proposal. The hon. member has now told us for the first time precisely what he seeks to achieve with this amendment. I just want to say to the hon. member that Clause 8 (5) where provision is made for publication in the <i>Government Gazette</i> would have been the proper place to achieve his purpose. The hon. member failed to avail himself of that opportunity. It would have been a very simple matter to have moved that if the rejection of any work is advertised in the <i>Government Gazette,</i> reference must at the same time be made to the section of the Act under which the work in question was found to be improper. Now that the hon. member has drawn attention to this I want to say that I am sorry, really, that he did not move that. It would have been desirable in the public interest perhaps if together with the original announcement of rejection, reference was made to the relevant section of the Act. The only good reason that I can advance as to why provision was not made for it is that to a certain extent it was done for the protection of the writer. A rejection under certain provisions of the Act may be regarded as carrying with it a special <i>odium</i> which one would want to spare a writer or a publisher. But the real point that I want to put to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is that he did not consult with his own party members as to what they seek to achieve with this amendment. He has now given his own version as to what it seeks to achieve. We have now had three other points of view. The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has intimated that he views the report to this House as a general report which will more or less offer comments, on a group basis, on the nature of the works submitted to the board, on the tendencies revealed in them &#x2014;as he put it, a general, somewhat educational report in the nature of a summary, which would have been just as interesting to me as to him. That was the point of view put forward by the hon. member for Kensington.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) held a different view. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth stated in reply to the argument that the judgments given by the court would in due course give a lead to the Publications Board that the purpose of the report should be to enable Parliament to test the decisions of the Publications Board in the light of court decisions given in the past. These decisions of the court, in the nature of things, would be public property.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is now repeating an argument which the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) advanced.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I mention it merely to bring out the difference of opinion within the same party on the same matter. The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin), on the other hand, sought the motivation for this amendment in the commercial interest in certain under 50c articles which may be prohibited. <span class="col_1541-1542" refersTo="page_0785"/>Collectively I come to the conclusion then that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout failed to consult his own party sufficiently so that we could get to know what that party contemplates with this amendment. The hon. member has now finally come along and said that if the hon. the Minister accepts the principle we can deal with the wording later on. My reply to that statement is simply that we do not know which principle to accept so as to be able to adapt the wording to it. Must we accept his principle or that of the other three members? That in itself is an adequate and final reason as to why this amendment cannot be accepted.</p>

<p>The last point with which I want to deal is the argument advanced by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) that what is being asked for here is the customary type of report to Parliament. At a very early stage of the discussion on this clause the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) asked the movers of this amendment to give us examples of comparable reports which are submitted to Parliament. Although very many general observations were made, the comparison which was nearest to the mark was made by a member who might perhaps link up his name with this commodity, who referred us to the report of the Chicory Board. If anybody thinks that the Report of the Chicory Board, which deals with a section of our economic life, is comparable with this sort of report, then he is thinking in terms of chicory.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>May I put a question? Is the hon. member for Kempton Park not aware of the fact that I only cited those reports because they had expired as to time in regard to the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s argument? Why does he couple me with chicory?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to reply to the argument put forward by the hon. member for Germiston (District). The function of the Publications Board can really be compared with that of a certain type of licensing board. It is a board which allows or refuses an activity which has an economic implication. I would say that it is not unfair to compare it with the Liquor Licensing Board, or to compare its function with that of the Road Transportation Boards in this country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#chairman">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member is again discussing the function of the board which is not relevant here. It should have been discussed under Clause 3.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I mention the functions of the board because the argument was advanced in support of this amendment that boards of this nature have to submit reports to this Parliament. It is in this context that I want to reply to this argument to show that comparable boards do not report to this Parliament. But I gladly bow to your ruling.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I do believe in covering a new field in legislation and also in administrative practices but the motivation advanced for this particular amendment by the other side is not that this is a new pattern of State administration that we must accept because it is an acceptable new field, but the motivation advanced is that it falls into line with what has already been done so often in the past. All I want to indicate is that we are not dealing here with one of the maize or chicory lands which are already known to us. If we seek a parallel, that parallel will be found more readily in the case of boards which grant concessions, boards such as the-Road Transportation Board and the Liquor Licensing Board, for example, where it is not customary to submit a report to this House on every application and the reason for granting or refusing it. Since that has been our administrative practice, my submission is that no substantial reason has been advanced here as to why an exception should be made in this case. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Following on the lengthy address to which we have just listened, I would like to draw the attention of this Committee to the second paragraph of the amendment. In terms of that second paragraph the mover of the amendment calls for a report to be submitted and to be laid on the Tables of both Houses of Parliament within seven days or if Parliament is not in Session, within seven days after the commencement of the next session. All we have been trying to do for the last couple of hours has been to impress upon the Minister the importance of not hiding the facts in this most important Bill. The Minister has for days been most careful to assure us that there was no necessity to be concerned as to any difficulties which might be contained in this Bill, that it was in fact nothing different from the other Bills which it attempted by and large to consolidate. The objective here is to enable Parliament to scrutinize what this board is doing and if necessary to raise issues with the Minister in the House on the report to enable the House to get information. That is not an unusual procedure in this House where numerous reports are Tabled every Session. They are laid on the Table of the House and they can be dealt with by members in the form of questions or they can be discussed in relevant debates. There seems to be some peculiar reason why the hon. the Minister and his supporters are doing everything in their power to evade the normal, reasonable suggestion that the report of a statutory body should be Tabled in this House.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister has not yet given a clear satisfactory answer as to why he is not prepared to accept an amendment of this nature. He talks about pornographic documents which are completely irrelevant to the amendment. The Minister himself has introduced irrelevancies all the way in the replies which he has given to various hon. members <span class="col_1543-1544" refersTo="page_0786"/>on this side of the House; he has evaded the issues which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has brought to his attention and he was supported by gentlemen who themselves have tried to draw red herrings across the particular resolution with which we are dealing.</p>

<p>Sir, what we would like to know from the hon. the Deputy Minister is some sound constructive reason why he is afraid to accept an amendment of this nature which will enable Parliament and the country to know how this Act is being administered and that nothing is done which will preclude the country from keeping abreast with modern-day knowledge, whether it be on the screen or through publication. That, Sir, is the reason why the hon. the Deputy Minister talks all the time of suspicion on this side of the House.

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>On behalf of the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) I beg to move the amendment standing in her name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 68, after &#x201C;conditions&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and period &#x201D;.</block>

<p>In doing so, it would appear that the clause as it stands now would in any case include &#x201C;period&#x201D; as a condition of service. It states in sub-section (1) (e) &#x201C;the conditions of office, remuneration and allowances of members of the board &#x2026;&#x201D;, but in an earlier clause, Clause 2, sub-section (4) the words used are &#x201C;the period and conditions of office, remuneration and allowances of members of the board &#x201D;. It is my contention that this phrase &#x201C;condition of office&#x201D; does not include the period of office, and if we insert &#x201C;period&#x201D; here it would bring it into line with the previous clause. It is quite obvious that it has been omitted for some special reason. I do not think it is an omission which was not intended, and I think the feeling on this side of the House is that the Minister has decided that he cannot fix the period of office of any of the people that he appoints either to the board, or any of its committees. It is an important matter. It is important firstly for the Minister himself to know who his panel is going to be. He can always call on this panel either for the board or for one of the committees, and then it is also important because he can get continuity of service from a group of people who know how long they are going to serve. The members who are going to be appointed will have some security of position. They will have more interest in their work if they know for how long they are going to be appointed. With their stay on the committee or the board they would gradually get more knowledge of the work of the board and be far more useful than if there is no fixed period of service. I feel that this board and its committees are going to be a very important group of people, and they should be treated as such, and therefore they should know whether they are going to be appointed for one meeting or for a period of the life of the board. It is very important for this person who is appointed on the board or one of; the committees to know that his services are required not in a temporary capacity, but <span class="col_1545-1546" refersTo="page_0787"/>as far as possible that they will be required for as long as possible. If this omission, that we find here, has been done intentionally, it would mean that this deliberate omission makes us again suspicious of the whole Bill.</p>

If that is not the case, then it is for the hon. Deputy Minister here this evening to say that the omission has not been deliberate and that he will be prepared to accept the amendment as it stands and to add &#x201C;period&#x201D;, to make sure that we on this side of the House have got suspicions which are not well-founded.</p>

<p>On Clause 5,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This is the most important clause in the entire Bill; it is the definition clause, it is the clause that determines the prohibition of, and the production and dissemination of certain publications and objects. A great deal of discussion has already taken place in this committee on definitions on various other clauses, and a good deal of the arguments which one would use against the widening of the definition in this clause have of course already been advanced. But I wish to move the amendments standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In lines 51 and 52, to omit &#x201C;or produce any undesirable publication or object; or in line 53, to omit &#x201C;(b)&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;produce &#x201D;; in line 57, to omit &#x201C;(i) &#x201D;; in lines 57 and 58, to omit &#x201C;in respect of an offence under paragraph (a)&#x201D;; in line 59, to omit &#x201C;or&#x201D;; to omit sub-paragraph (ii) of paragraph (b) of sub-section (1); to omit paragraph (c) of sub-section (1); to omit all the words from the commencement of paragraph (b) of sub-section (2), to the end of sub-section (3); in line 53, page 6, after &#x201C;science&#x201D; to add &#x201C;or of other objects of general concern to omit sub-section (5); and to add the following proviso at the end of sub-section (6):</block>

<block name="quote">Provided that a person shall not be convicted of an offence against this section if he proves that he had not examined the article in respect of which he is charged, and had no reasonable cause to suspect that it was such that it would make him liable to be convicted of an offence against this section.</block>

<p>I am afraid they are rather complicated amendments. I have put them all together and I propose to explain each part of the amendment one by one. Now as I propose to amend the clause, it will read as follows: (a) and (b) would go altogether, and then it would read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1547-1548" refersTo="page_0788"/>No person shall print, publish, manufacture, make or distribute, display, exhibit or sell or offer or keep for sale any publication or object if that publication or object has in a prosecution been found to be undesirable.</block>

<p>Now although that is rather complicated, the object of this amendment is very simple. It is in effect simply to leave the decision as to undesirability to the courts so far as everything is concerned, in other words, not only as far as printing, publishing and manufacturing, etc., are concerned, but also as far as distributing, displaying, exhibiting or selling are concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>That was decided at the second reading.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether this is a particular principle that both the publishing and printing and the actual distribution should fall under the same test of undesirability. The question is here whether the final test of undesirability shall be left to the courts, or whether simply the gazetting by the board is sufficient in one case but not in the other. Because as it stands at the moment there is a most extraordinary position: In the case of a printer, publisher or author of an article, the court alone, and then only after a prosecution has been brought, shall decide whether the article is undesirable, and the court in this particular case is not bound by any decision of the board. The court itself can make the finding as to undesirability. But as far as the person who distributes the object is concerned, or exhibits, or sells the same, simply the gazetting as &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; by the board means that the person is bound by that decision; in other words, the board&#x2019;s gazetting as &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D; is sufficient, whereas in the case of the man who actually writes the book, it is only after prosecution and where the courts have actually found that such an object is undesirable that indeed it is so. This is a most extraordinary position, because it provides a certain licence for the man who writes the book, but it does not provide the same licence for the man who distributes the book. In other words, anybody can write the book and keep it at home, and apparently this is all right until a prosecution is instituted against such a person. But where somebody is distributing an object, then as long as the board has gazetted the object as &#x201C;undesirable&#x201D;, anybody who distributes that object is in fact committing an offence. I think this is an anomalous position, and it certainly does not help the writer of an article or the painter of a picture, because after all unless one is producing entirely for arts&#x2019; sake, one produces to sell also. Most artists I presume produce books in order to have them printed and distributed and most painters paint pictures not only for the joy the painting actually gives, but also to exhibit those pictures and to have them sold. I propose therefore to bring both the printer, who is in fact the writer, or the painter and the person who distributes the article under the same test of &#x201C;undesirability &#x201D;.</p>

<p>The second part of the amendment, Sir, to omit sub-section (c), is of course a matter which we have argued <i>ad nauseam</i> in the Committee, and I do not want to go over all the arguments again. Very briefly, this is again that section that bans all paper-backs with the exception of those which are allowed in under certain exemptions. I object to this very strenuously, for the same reason I have advanced on other clauses when this particular subject was under discussion. In other words, it is absurd to ban all paper-backs; we all know how many excellent books come in in the form of paper-back books; we know that universities require these as text books for their students, and so on, and it is no answer to me, any way, for the hon. Deputy Minister to tell us that these good classics and text books will be allowed to come in under permit. I do not consider that that is the way democracy should function that the people&#x2019;s reading matter should only be allowed in under special permit from the Minister&#x2019;s board. What are we trying to produce in this country, Sir? A nation of people who cannot read, cannot afford to read, illiterates? Why? Because people who read can be dangerous? As far as I am concerned this is a far-reaching and absurd provision and should most certainly be removed from this Bill.</p>

<p>The latter part of my amendment deals with a change in the actual definition of what is to be considered undesirable, and here I want to move a small addition to my amendment which is not printed on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>I want to delete &#x201C;or any part of it&#x201D; in line 79. I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 79, to omit &#x201C;or any part of it &#x201D;.</block>

<p>The reason for this is also something that we have discussed before, namely that it is absurd to allow boards to deem an object undesirable because of &#x201C;any part of it &#x201D;. A book should be read as a whole, and unless it is read as a whole it is quite impossible for anybody to judge that book on its merits. To allow the extraction of offensive passages in a book and then to say that because the book contains these passages the book as a whole is undesirable, as far as I am concerned, is the very worse type of narrow-mindedness. For that reason I want to omit those words.</p>

<p>The rest of the amendment is printed, and of course it means that I want to omit all the sub-sections from (b) to (f), all those sub-sections which deal with blasphemy, or offensiveness to the religious convictions, etc., of any section of the inhabitants of the Republic. I think that is a dangerously wide definition. Neither do I like the sub-section which speaks about bringing any section of the population into ridicule or contempt, because that also is dangerously wide and the same also applies to sub-section (d) which speaks of &#x201C;being harmful to the relations between sections in <span class="col_1549-1550" refersTo="page_0789"/>the Republic This sub-section about ridicule I believe is particularly dangerous. Are we to stop laughing at ourselves in this country. Sir? Are we going to be deprived of cartoons of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development decked out in his karosses? Are we going to be deprived of the high fidelity tower worn by the hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs? And are we going to be deprived of the high-hat worn by the hon. the Minister of External Affairs? These things might be said to bring ridicule on inhabitants of the Republic, and I think the country is getting to a sorry state indeed if we are getting to the stage where we have to define what is &#x201C;offensive&#x201D; or &#x201C;intolerable&#x201D; in terms of ridicule. I would say that one of the hall-marks of a sophisticated nation is its ability to laugh at itself.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. L. H. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>This clause actually brings us to the main provision of the Bill. It forbids the printing, publication and distribution of publications which are unstable, indecent or obscene. It lays down the norm as to what is undesirable and indecent and obscene. Take this clause out of the Bill and we take away its heart. Water this clause down and we make a farce of all control. The amendment of the hon. member for Houghton is aimed at doing precisely that &#x2014;at watering down this clause. It is a roundabout sort of way of striking at the heart of the clause. I know that she does this in the name of&#x2014;as she calls it&#x2014;the freedom of the individual, but in my view she does it in the name of her distorted idea of the freedom of the individual. It becomes clearer day by day that the Liberals in our country&#x2014;it makes no difference on whose side they are, whether they belong to the United Party or are members of the Progressive Party&#x2014;can no longer distinguish between freedom and licentiousness. Every law imposes some restriction: every law contains a suppressive element: &#x201C;Thou shalt not steal&#x201D;, &#x201C;Thou shalt not commit adultery&#x201D;, &#x201C;Thou shalt not kill &#x201D;&#x2014;all these laws contain restrictive and suppressive elements. But on the other hand they do hold a guarantee for the freedom of the community as a whole, the protection of the individual and property of all sections of society. I am convinced of the fact that the hon. member for Houghton will agree that this must be done. I think she will agree that no person should be allowed to be poisoned. And whether that poison is physical poison or whether it is spiritual poison, I take it that she will agree that we must prevent that poison being administered, not only the poisoning of the body of an individual but the poisoning of the public mind. And that is what we envisage with this clause which institutes this control. Does she not want us to stop this process of infection? This clause is the heart of the Bill. We are banning those morally undermining publications. In his monumental work &#x201C;Der Untergang des Abendlandes&#x201D; (The Decline of the West) Oswald Spengler comes to the conclusion that the West will be ruined not as the result of destruction on the battlefield, but as the result of moral collapse, moral degradation and inner decay. We are seeking to halt this process by means of this clause and we want to prevent it from happening in our country. We realize only too well that the true strength of our nation lies not in its military power but in its inner moral strength. It is this inner moral strength which has always carried our nation through every crisis. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>It is not my intention to hold a conversation with the hon. member for Turffontein. He is always trying to hold a conversation with me and he cannot do so because he does not know what it is all about when I talk about an inner moral strength. I say that all literature which undermines that inner moral strength must be combated with all our might, and, if necessary, by means of legislation, which we are doing here now. I know it will be argued that one cannot change a man&#x2019;s heart by legislation, but people who argue in this way do not know how that inner moral law develops. An inner moral law develops in this way: First of all, a law is imposed from outside by an external authority. That is followed by reflection and meditation and then one finds that people become reconciled to it once they are satisfied that that law is in the interests of society as a whole and therefore of themselves too. The same thing will occur with this Bill. It will be obeyed first of all because of fear of the penalty which may be imposed by an external authority and afterwards we will obey it because we will believe that it is in the best interests of our society as a whole, and therefore of ourselves as well: in other words, it becomes an inner, self-imposed law. That is why I support this clause wholeheartedly and I want to give this House the assurance that the public will be grateful to the hon. the Minister and the Government once this clause is on the Statute Book. As a former secretary of the Federasie van Afrikaanse Kultuurverenigings I can say that the whole nation is grateful to the hon. the Minister for this Bill and for this clause and that this is what they have always wanted. I know about the representations which were made to the F.A.K. for control to be instituted and I repeat that I am sure that the people of South Africa will be sincerely grateful to the hon. the Minister and the Government for this Bill which guards against any threat to our inner moral strength.</p>

<p>I am astonished at the speech which has just been made by the hon. member for Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk). The hon. member indicated that this nation simply cannot exist unless this clause is passed. If that is so, then tire hon. member has been a member of a party and of a Government in South Africa for 15 years, which has been neglecting his duty very seriously indeed. I am not prepared to accept that sort of argument. If the hon. member felt that it was his duty during the last 13 years to force the Government to take such action, he should have done so, therefore I am not prepared to reply to the arguments of hon. members opposite. I cannot accept that this hon. member really feels quite as deeply as he would have me believe. If I am wrong, I think he should do the right thing and announce his resignation from the Government Party.</p>

<p>But I wish to come back to the Bill and I propose to move the amendment standing in my name of the Order Paper, to omit paragraphs (b) to (f) of sub-section (2).</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>If it has already been moved, I would like to support the deletion of these provisions from the clause. In the Select Committee I moved the deletion of the same sub-section. It is my belief that the clause as it stands is long and involved and would be immensely improved if there were a simple provision dealing with what is undesirable and if those particular provisions were omitted from the Bill, sub-section (2) will read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A publication or object shall be deemed to be undesirable if it or any part of it&#x2014;(a) is indecent or obscene or is offensive or harmful to public morals.</block>

<p>I believe that if that provision only were enacted it would adequately deal with the position and would enable the board to see to it that only desirable publications can be distributed in this country. Everything which is undesirable would be fully covered if we have this simple definition. Especially when you have a board such as this board, I believe that it is most important to have a simple and clear provision on which to judge the matter which comes before it. It is my sub<i>mission that if the</i> remaining provisions are deleted and we have this simple provision which I have read out, the interests of the country will toe fully protected. I hope that the Minister, who I hope is going to be reasonable to-night, will accept it. *</p>

<p>1 only have ten minutes and the hon. member will have another opportunity to speak. Why does he want to permit blasphemous things to be said? That is what it amounts to. [Interjection.] And if the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) knew the people of South Africa better and did not only move in Houghton circles, she would never have made the speech which she made here this evening. But she does not know the people of South Africa. Paragraph (c) says, &#x201C;Brings any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule or contempt &#x201D;. Why does the hon. member for Germiston (District) want to make it possible for a section of the people of South Africa to be ridiculed, and what section does he want ridiculed? The hon. member must tell us. Paragraph (d) says, &#x201C;Is harmful to the relations between any sections of the inhabitants of the Republic. Does the hon. member for Germiston (District) not want peace amongst the various sections of the population? They are opposing these provisions and they cannot take it amiss of me if I accuse them of seeking to create racial friction. Paragraph (e) states, &#x201C;Is prejudicial to the safety of the State, the general welfare or the peace and good order &#x201D;. Why do they want to make it possible for us to experience unrest and disorder in South Africa? Why do they refuse to close the loopholes? By opposing this Bill they are trying to make a monstrosity of this <span class="col_1553-1554" refersTo="page_0791"/>Bill, a measure full of loopholes. They want to leave loopholes by means of which the enemies of South Africa will have the opportunity of undermining public morality, peace and harmonious relations. That is the only reason why the hon. member is opposing this clause. Let us look at paragraph (f): &#x201C;Discloses, with reference to any judicial proceedings any matter which is indecent or obscene or is offensive or harmful to public morals &#x2026; I need take only this one sentence. The hon. member is a lawyer. Does he want to tell me that it is in the interests of the people of South Africa to publish everything that takes place in court? Does he want to tell me that that will redound to the benefit of public morals? The Opposition, by opposing this clause, cannot take it amiss if I accuse them of wishing to undermine the foundations of South Africa.</p>

If there are two members of the Opposition whom I thought would support this clause they are the hon. member and the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). I know that he feels in his heart that this is the correct thing and that is why he is not participating in the debate. These are the two conservative members on that side whom I thought would support this Bill. But they have allowed themselves to be taken in tow. The one has said nothing and the other has been compelled to participate in the debate and in doing so he has exposed the United Party. But I will tell you why he has participated in the debate. His party compelled him to do so that the hon. member for Houghton would not steal all their thunder. They always watch the hon. member for Houghton to see what she is going to do and once she has taken her stand they try to get in ahead of her instead of putting their foot down and following the dictates of their conscience.

J. Potgieter). We have been given a discourse on morality by the hon. member, and one of the allegations he made was that by our opposition to this clause we were undermining the morality of the people. But may I remind the hon. member for Vryheid that he sat on the Government benches during the earlier discussion of this Bill, when in the definition we moved to include the words &#x201C;morally objectionable&#x201D; to cover issues of this very nature, he voted against it. [Interjections.] It is no use the hon. member for Mossel Bay making these insane observations, because he does not know what we are talking about. Let me come to an issue a little bit further than the morality referred to by the hon. member for Vryheid. This sub-section which I want to delete now states that no one may import any publication written in any language if its retail price is below R1.</p>

<p>Then I want to support the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton. The effect of this clause as it stands is that everything, no matter what language it is printed in, if it comes from abroad and whether it is in French or in English, will not be permitted to enter the country without a permit from the Board, and that covers magazines, periodicals and everything. Publications printed in the Republic are not subject to the same provisions. No permit will be required for printing any publication in paperback form. The hon. member says that because of our opposition to this clause we are seeking to admit into the country reading matter of a most undesirable nature. I wonder whether <span class="col_1555-1556" refersTo="page_0792"/>the hon. member for Vryheid realizes that the majority of paperbacks circulating in the Republic and printed here is of a most undesirable nature, printed in Afrikaans? Then he talks about morality. I have a publication in my hand&#x2014;I have quite a number of them&#x2014; which I would be ashamed to read out to this House. I would like to send it to the hon. member and hear whether he considers it to be moral.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>There is a whole range of this type of literature, but because we are now told that there is literature of this type which is immoral and undesirable, everything printed in the English language can come in only by way of permit, but this kind of thing can only be stopped by a prosecution being instituted and a declaration from the Board after examination and after it has been distributed, and there has never been any prosecution of that nature. I hope that when this Bill becomes law the hon. member for Vryheid will draw the attention of the Board to this type of publication, and then we will hear whether the hon. member for Vereeniging and other hon. members opposite will defend it. I am tired of these protestations of morality.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eter">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. J. POTG</person>:</from>

<p>Do you suggest that the hon. member for Vereeniging is publishing and distributing such literature?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I am not suggesting; I am saying where it comes from. I may tell the hon. member that this is published by a firm called Pronk Boeke, which is owned by a firm called Goeie Hoop Uitgewers, and I suggest to the hon. member for Vryheid that he examine the directorate of Goeie Hoop Uitgewers. Then perhaps he will apologize for the accusations he has made against the Opposition.</p>

<p>But there is another undesirable aspect of this matter that through a system of licences and permits monopolies can be established for certain publishers and distributors, because these powers are so wide that the Board will be able to say that &#x00D7; series of publications is generally satisfactory and they will give a blanket permit for that, but the Y series, which is of an undesirable character, cannot come in without a special permit and examination. We had that evidence before the Select Committee, and I do not want to mention the names of those firms, because they have had enough undesirable publicity already. Accusations were made which were entirely unfounded in many cases. But what I cannot understand is that when a reputable body such as the Booksellers&#x2019; Association without fear is prepared to publish to the world at large the circumstances surrounding the conditions and the effect of this provision and what it will do to the bulk of the reading matter in South Africa&#x2014;the bulk of it is in English and none of it can come in without a permit because none of it is printed here&#x2014;the Afrikaans publications are in such a privileged position. It can be published and it does not need a permit. It does not have to get the approval of the Board. The effect of this provision will indeed be profound, because I repeat that you will have a Board appointed by the Minister which will be the sole determining factor as to what may be read in any language medium if it is imported into the Republic, and in fact 90 per cent of the reading matter will be subject to a permit in terms of this clause. I do not know whether the Deputy Minister has been given strict instructions by the Minister as to what he may or may not accept. I am surprised, knowing the Deputy Minister as a man of strong character, that he has permitted himself to be placed in this position where he has to act without being able to use his own discretion in accepting amendments, because that is the impression I have gained. When we come to discuss an important matter of this nature which is fundamental to the whole freedom of thought and expression in this country, the Minister cannot even consider accepting any amendment. I think that is disgraceful.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to assist the hon. member for Turffontein. The hon. the Minister did not ask me to reject all the amendments which would be moved, neither did he ask me to listen to arguments which were not well-founded. Before I reply to some of the misrepresentations of which the hon. member for Turffontein was guilty, I would like to move two amendments, one of which already appears on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 62, after &#x201C;under&#x201D;, to insert &#x201C;subsection (31 of &#x201D;.</block>

<p>This is a textual amendment. It is only designed to bring the English text into line with the Afrikaans text. The second amendment reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 61, after <i>&#x201C;eight",</i> to insert &#x201C;(not being a statement under (b) of sub-section (1) of that section)&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The first amendment merely ensures that a statement under paragraph (b) of sub-section fl) of Clause 8 will only be for the information of the person investigating an offence under this Bill or of the Customs Act, and will have no effect upon the publication concerned. Only <span class="col_1557-1558" refersTo="page_0793"/>after the court has found a person guilty under Clause 5 (1) can that publication be further distributed. The crux of this matter is that it is intended that if a person investigates an offence, his investigation will merely serve as an opinion and as advice to the Board and his investigation and advice will not mean that the work which he is investigating will immediately be banned. This is a concession.</p>

<p>I fear that as far as the other amendments which have been moved here are concerned, I can unfortunately not accept them and this is so not because I am under any instruction, but because they really do not improve the measure. The hon. member for Houghton raised a few matters to which I want to refer. The first point that she raised was that the purpose should be to leave the decision regarding undesirability to the court, and, as it were, to leave the Board out of the picture. I am afraid that I cannot accept that amendment because the principle contained in this clause and in previous clauses as well was adopted at the second reading.</p>

<p>I would like to say something about the further amendment of the hon. member which is to omit the words &#x201C;or any part of it&#x201D; in line 79. An argument which one hears from time to time is that a book should be judged as a whole; that one should not concentrate upon certain passages from the book and because of those passages ban the entire book. At first glance there appears to be some substance in an argument of this nature, but one has the position where a banned book has paragraphs in it which are so smutty that they really spoil the nature of the whole book. It has been my task to do that work over these past months and it has been really shocking to see the filth which appears in certain books, and sometimes in many good books such as the book which the Opposition have already mentioned, &#x201C;Uhuru&#x201D;, which deals with the freedom movement of the Black people of Africa. It is a good book but contains so many unwholesome references to sex that it makes the whole book unfit for circulation. If the publisher had left out those sections, it could have been published in our country with its mixed population. The point is, therefore, that we are compelled to ban a book merely as a result of certain passages in it because it is those parts which actually form a canker which can infect the whole body. That is why we will have to bear this fact in mind at all times, although another norm may perhaps be fixed in the future if cases are taken to court. Then the Board will have to be guided by those cases. If the court decides that a book must be considered as a whole, that will be a different matter, but at the moment the position is as I have described it and I can only say from experience that there are very good reasons for banning a book because of certain undesirable passages in it.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the aspect that certain sections of the population should not be ridiculed, and the question was asked whether we were so naive that we could not laugh at ourselves. I think that we in this country, Afrikaans-and English-speaking people, have reached a stage of maturity where we can laugh at ourselves, and I want to mention just one example in this regard. Those who have seen the film &#x201C;Lord Oom Piet&#x201D; will realize how we can laugh at one another&#x2019;s idiosyncracies. We are sufficiently adult to be able to do so, but that does not mean that one should allow groups of the population to be exposed to deliberate ridicule. One has always to maintain a balance, and unfortunately it is the task of the Government and the court and the Board to maintain that balance. Amendments have also been moved advocating a lifting of the ban on books imported into this country at 50 cents each. I am very sorry that the hon. member for Turffontein, who is a very hard worker, has now resorted to this cheap type of propaganda of trying to play off English against Afrikaans. It does not behove a responsible member of this House to do that sort of thing. It is true that this ban deals with imports and I want to repeat why the ban has been imposed. It is quite unfair to give a wrong interpretation of the position by saying that the Government is taking action against the English-speaking people while the Afrikaans-speaking people are allowed to read any rubbish at all. The Afrikaans books do not come from abroad, that is true, but in the future the books which are printed locally will, as everyone knows, be subject to the provisions of Clause 5. Anybody who wishes to draw attention to any obscenities which are published, is aware of the machinery which can be put into operation to combat this sort of thing. Actually it is this measure which enables us for the first time to apply internal control&#x2014;or &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; to use the Opposition&#x2019;s word, a word of which the hon. member for Bezuidenhout is so fond&#x2014;in order to prevent filth which can be detrimental to the whole of our society being published locally. I take it amiss of the hon. member for Turffontein for trying to make out that any trash can be published in Afrikaans; that that is all well and good, but that the poor English-speaking people, as he tries to make out, cannot read that kind of filth. I deprecate that approach on the part of the hon. member. But I want to go further. It may perhaps appear that our prohibition of books costing less than 50 cents&#x2014;they will be sold at higher prices on the local market, perhaps even at 70 cents each&#x2014;is unfair. But the members who served on the Select Committee&#x2014;the hon. member for Turffontein was one of them&#x2014;are aware of the fact that a very strong case was made out in evidence before the Committee in favour of such a ban. The Select Corrimittee was told by Customs&#x2019; officials that the volume of literature coming through the customs was so great that Customs&#x2019; officials could not sift it properly. It was also put to the Committee that this work of the Customs&#x2019; officials, namely to screen this type of book, is actually a task which goes beyond their primary function. They actually do this over and above their normal work. The Select Committee was also told that as a result of the volume of work which the Customs&#x2019; officials have to do, they <span class="col_1559-1560" refersTo="page_0794"/>are forced to make use of the services of junior officials to look through the books which come into the country. There are simply not enough senior officials to do this work. Now, because of the fact that junior officials have to be used to do this work we have various standards being applied in judging such a book. For example, a junior official in Cape Town may consider a specific book to be most indecent and therefore reject it, while a junior official in Durban may regard the same book as being a suitable book and accordingly let it through.</p>

<p>The question which Parliament now has to ask itself is whether we are really in earnest in wanting to combat this inflow of filth. Indeed, this principle was agreed to when the Bill was read a Second Time. Moreover, the Select Committee on which members of the Opposition also served, decided that it was necessary for legislation to be adopted in this connection. Two methods were suggested to combat the inflow of this indecent literature.</p>

<p>It was contended that 90 per cent of the undesirable literature entering the country was made up of paperback fiction. This is a disturbing fact. Another aspect which had become known over the years is that there are certain publishers overseas&#x2014;it is not necessary for me to mention their countries; in any case, this information appears in the reports concerned&#x2014; which concentrates upon the publishing of this undesirable literature, whether by way of sex fiction or material for the promotion of Communism. The Customs&#x2019; officials feel that there are two methods by means of which one combat this influx of undesirable literature and at the same time limit the work which they have to do because they maintain that it is an impossible task for them to control the influx of all this undesirable literature.</p>

<p>The one way which they suggested was that books costing less than 50c should be prevented from coming into the country because 90 per cent of them contained undesirable material; the other way was that those publishers who had a reputation for publishing poor material should be placed on the list under this clause. The evidence of the officials to the effect that it was an impossible task for them to stop this stream of indecent literature is evidence which hon. members have before them. It has also been their task up to the present to intercept the works which have been regarded as obscene. Only works in regard to which doubt arises are referred to the Board of Censors. They cannot however refer all this literature to the Board of Censors because they will then swamp the Board. This is the undesirable state of affairs which exist at present and which the Opposition, by way of their amendments, seek to perpetuate. It is a pity that an Opposition which ought to be just as anxious to maintain file moral standard of our people should make our task here more difficult when we seek to take action to protect that moral standard. They also come forward with the story that we also want to keep the classics appearing in these series out of the country. That is a stupid and nonsensical reaction.</p>

<p>I admit that there are some good works amongst the series which will be banned, but I can give you the assurance that we will always have those good works on our bookshelves. If the publishers of a banned series wish to publish a good work, I take it that the importers in this country will inform the exporters in England or America or whatever the country may be, in good time in regard to the new provisions holding sway here. Those publishers can then send a copy of that good work to the Board of Control in South Africa and in that way the Board can obtain a permit to bring that book into the country. In that way a good book falling into the yellow or green category and which can be banned in terms of the provisions of this clause, can still find its way on to our bookshelves.</p>

<p>If it appears that the proposed new Control Board is so unreasonable as to ban a good work, then the importer has the right to go to court to have the matter settled. We often hear the argument in this connection that litigation is expensive. I agree with that statement. Therefore, cases will not be taken to court that often but on the other hand I want to say this: If the decision of this Control Board is taken to court on one or more occasions and the court rules against the Board, that will certainly have the affect of establishing another norm on which the Board can operate. Indeed, that is the way in which a norm should actually be determined.</p>

<p>It is all very well for the hon. the Deputy Minister to protest too much, but let me once more bring to the attention of the House the provisions of Clause 5 (2), namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A publication or object shall be deemed to be undesirable if it or any part of it&#x2014;and sub-clause&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(c) brings any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule&#x2026;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Here this Bill contains a definite prohibition. Ridicule can, to my mind, be an extremely healthy thing in many cases. There is &#x201C;ridicule&#x201D; and &#x201C;ridicule&#x201D;. It must not be offensive&#x2014;with <span class="col_1561-1562" refersTo="page_0795"/>that I agree. Particularly am I against any ridicule which has as its object to hurt the feelings of an individual or of a section or of a religious group. Everybody is against this type of ridicule and we are, therefore, entirely with the Government as far as this is concerned. On the other hand, however, ridicule in the ordinary sense can be a healthy political weapon. The hon. the Deputy Minister said just now that he thought we were capable of laughing at ourselves. But are we? That is the trouble. In many cases ridicule is the only weapon to deal with a bumptious individual or a hyprocritical section of the people.</p>

<p>Before the Second World War there was a movement in England by Mosley called the Black Shirts. He once had a huge meeting in the Albert Hall where all his Black Shirts were lined up round the stage. He himself came in his black shirt and with the spotlight shining on him he walked down the stage and put up his hand in deadly silence and shouted &#x201C;Heil&#x201D;. Then a Cockney voice from the gallery remarked &#x201C;It is all right. You can leave the room!&#x201D; The result was laughter and the entire show was killed by ridicule. But under this Bill that Cockney would have been guilty of ridiculing a particular section of the population. The only way, Sir, in which to deal with unctuous rectitude and the sanctimonious utterings of the hyprocrite, is by means of ridicule. Most often you find that the section which talks the most about patriotism, is the first to let the country down. The only way to deal with this sanctimonious talk, is by way of ridicule.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister also referred to the argument of his Minister, namely that 90 per cent of the cheap paperbacks imported into this country contains pornographic material. It is, however, outrageous to stop, because of that, the importation of the good books issued in paperback form. We make ourselves ridiculous if we say to the world that no book which costs under 50c can be imported without a permit. As I said before when we were discussing another clause, it is perhaps true that 90 per cent of pornographic material comes in cheap paperback form but against that it must be remembered that 95 per cent of all sound, technical, cultural, classical, etc. books also appear at some stage or another in paperback form. The only chance the poor man has of having access to these books, is to buy the cheap editions. In America you will find that people rise to the highest executive positions in the financial and executive world who had risen from nothing. But if the youngster is willing to learn and to save a few shillings, he has available to him cheap editions of works in the English language. English is a world language and every book which is worth anything and which appears in another country, is at some stage or another translated into that language. In that way the youngster I am talking about is able to educate himself. Because most books are available in cheap editions, he has all the necessary literature available to him, and in that way he can educate himself and rise to the highest positions.</p>

<p>But for us to tell the world that we are going to lay down that a permit must be obtained by anybody wanting to import a paperback valued at under 50c is entirely wrong. I am having the prestige of this country in mind. I look upon ourselves as a highly civilized people and as such we should not do silly things like this which will cause the rest of the world to laugh at us. But yet we stipulate here that any classic, for instance, coming into this country in paperback form, cannot be bought unless the publisher or the private importer of one copy first produces a licence for its import. And the position is that this licence can be refused. The Minister of course says that it will not be refused, but why then give somebody the right to refuse it? Surely, that is not necessary&#x2026;.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_byl">

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>Please do not provoke me to wander from this clause. I should perhaps just say that time after time we see things being done by the other side of the House, things which we thought would be utterly unreasonable! I am not prepared to give the Government power such as that asked for in this clause.</p>

<p>Another point is this: A classical or cultural book, is usually very expensive when it is first published. So the individual who wants to read it, has to get it from the library. He then reads it and hands it back. But he would very much like to have one for his own library. Yet he cannot afford to go and buy these expensive books at from R3 to R5 a piece? So he waits for a cheap edition and procures one for his own use and future reference. But now the Government is proposing to step in and say that he is not allowed to buy that book unless it is valued at over 50c or an import permit was granted in respect of it. That, Sir, makes us ridiculous in the eyes of the world. It is no use arguing that the Board will not do this or that. We should never have a clause of this nature in this Bill. Surely, it ought to be quite easy to keep out the pornographic dirt without such a clause.</p>

<p>Accordingly I suggest that this is not a clause which should be passed by this House. I repeat what I said earlier, namely that 90 per cent of youngsters not having the means to afford an expensive education, have risen to the top because of the fact that they wanted to learn and were able to lay their hands on cheap editions of classical and technical works necessary for their education. It is, therefore, entirely wrong to take this chance away from them.</p>

<p>No, that is what the hon. member wants to make out. I want to tell the hon. member the difference between good fun, satire and humour. For example: The hon. member has never taken it amiss of anyone who has referred to him as the &#x201C;little goat farmer of Green Point&#x201D;. On the contrary, he likes it. He also likes the cartoons of himself which appear in the <i>Burger.</i> Indeed, I think that he buys all the originals! Any other member will also act in the same way because that is the nature of the people of South Africa. But if the hon. member for Green Point were to come along and say&#x2014;as he did during the war years&#x2014;that Dr. Malan made a special trip to Pretoria so that he and the other Afrikaners could hand South Africa to Hitler on a plate, then that would be offensive; then it would no longer be fun, satire or humour but then he would be ridiculing a part of the nation of South Africa.

<p>There you are, Mr. Chairman; because I illustrate to the hon. member the difference between fun, satire and humour, he becomes annoyed! When I said that he did not mind us calling him the simple little goat farmer of Green Point, he laughed. I know that he likes that. Indeed, I know him as a person with a keen sense of humour, but because I illustrate to him the difference between good fun, humour and satire and the ridiculing of a section of the population, he becomes annoyed!</p>

<p>No, Mr. Chairman, the Afrikaans people have a keen sense of humour. We can poke fun at one another and be most sarcastic, both written and oral, about one another. And we are not annoyed about it but we prefer to laugh about it. Let me mention another example in this connection. When the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was recently caricatured, in a newspaper which is opposed to this party, seated on an ox and swathed in a kaross, the hon. the Minister acquired the original. He laughed about it and he enjoyed it! The Opposition are really not trying to paint a true picture of the position because they seek to make out that anything which can be regarded as light and good fun and satire will be rejected by the control board and that we are indeed a surly nation who cannot tolerate anything of that nature. But nothing of that nature exists at all!</p>

<p>No, Mr. Chairman, the hon. member for Green Point is merely trying to create a smokescreen. I want to ask him to stop that sort of thing. They must stop making the members of the control board suspect in advance amongst the public. These people will be people with a sound common sense. It is even possible that the hon. member for Green Point may himself serve on that Board! Why not? And I do not think that he will ban good fun and satire from the country. He has too keen a sense of humour for that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Vryheid has serious objections to our amendment to delete certain paragraphs of sub-section (2). In fact, he discussed each paragraph seriatim in an effort to show us that we should not delete them. But our objection to them is that they are really unnecessary. Sub-section (2) (a), in our opinion, covers everything. We do not need the other definitions of what is undesirable. Let me give the House an example. The hon. member has referred to sub-section (2)(c)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; brings any section of the inhabitants of the Republic into ridicule or contempt.</block>

<p>But to our way of thinking this Bill is bringing this Parliament into ridicule. I certainly think that this clause is doing that. There is no country in the world which would tolerate a clause such as this one &#x2026; no civilized country would do so. Has anybody ever heard of a country which judges the value of a book by its colour and its price?</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister says that the Customs&#x2019; officials find it to be an impossible task to carry out their instructions in this regard. I agree that they are not. So, it was suggested to them in the Select Committee that we should exclude all books at a price under 25c. Asked whether that would help them, they said it would because it would take away a great deal of their work. Then someone on the Select Committee suggested that we increase the price to 50c. That would still be better they said because it would reduce the volume of work still further. But one may go on like this until a point is reached where you say that no book may come into the country!</p>

<p>The fact is that it is quite absurd to exclude books solely on the ground of their colour or price. The sooner we realize that and delete (1) (c), the better it will be.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister got quite emotional in saying that we had passed the stage of immaturity. We do not have the Nationalist Party in Opposition and a daily argument about language as a result! Those were the days! The extraordinary aspect about sub-section (1) (c) is that only English-language books will be excluded, whilst all Afrikaans books will be accepted. [Interjections.] Let us look at the wording of this sub-section (1) (c). It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall &#x2026; import any publication &#x2026;</block>

<p>And not&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No person shall &#x2026;&#x201D; publish&#x201D; any publication ..</block>

<p>If it did say this, we would be dealing with that type of undesirable literature which the hon member for Turffontein spoke about.</p>

<p>But the paragraph says &#x201C;import&#x201D; and 99 per cent of the books imported are books in the English language. I submit that of those imported a very small percentage is undesirable. Now, who is going to read these books? Not the Afrikaans-speaking child but the English-speaking child. So, if we are going to have a publications board, I suggest to the Minister that we should have two: one for English-language books and one for Afrikaans.</p>

<p>But we are not now discussing our prejudices in South Africa, but censoring books in two languages.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Deputy Minister should discuss the matter with his Minister overnight and delete Clause (1) (c). Then we would be able to make some progress and discuss the rest of the clause. To the hon. member for Vryheid I want to say that we object to Clause (2) (c), etc., on account of the fact that it is prolix, superfluous&#x2014;unnecessary. Once having described what is undesirable, all this, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) has told us, is unnecessary. That is why we are objecting. We see the things which members of the other side do. Why do you try to tell the Judges and the courts what is undesirable? Judges have been interpreting the word in terms of this subsection. So why have all these words? And when the hon. member for Vryheid comes here and says that we want blasphemous literature, it is quite beside the point.</p>

<p>We have spent quite a considerable amount of time on this and I think when the hon. the Deputy Minister reconsiders this he will delete Clause (1) (c). If he will accept what the hon. member for Turffontein has suggested, then we will make some progress. *</p>

<p>It is strange that the Opposition should reason in this way and argue in favour of amendments which they actually do not want themselves. They do not want these amendments themselves because it is clear that they do not want the clause which they are trying to amend. Indeed, it has already become clear that they do not want the Bill at all. Nevertheless, with tears in their eyes they can argue in favour of amendments which they do not want! The best proof of this is that when earlier this evening a division was called on Clause 23, namely, the clause making provision for the coming into operation of the Bill, they voted against the clause. Therefore they do not want this measure to become law. Why then move amendment after amendment if they are not in earnest in what they are doing?</p>

<p>I want to agree wholeheartedly with the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to the proposed omission of paragraphs (b), (c), (d) (e) and (f). On a previous occasion the principle was accepted that these provisions should be maintained and it is therefore a waste of time to elaborate any further in this regard. Because amendments have however been moved to this clause by the hon. member for Houghton and the hon. member for Germiston (District), it will be worthwhile for us to examine each of these paragraphs. We think it is shocking that the Opposition do not want action to be taken against blasphemy, whether in writing, in a painting or in any other form. In this connection one thinks&#x2014;and one is hesitant to say it&#x2014;of a painting which was made public recently, a painting of the crucified Christ with the following heading: &#x201C;Forgive Christ, for He knows not what He does.&#x201D; It is terrible to think that we as an Afrikaner nation cannot be moved by something of this nature to say that there should be control over this sort of thing.</p>

<p>As regards the ridiculing of persons, for example, the cartoon of the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, I can say that it gave me so much enjoyment that I want this sort of innocent thing to stay. In the first place, it illustrates a complete lack of imagination on the part of the persons who try to make our Ministers look ridiculous in this way, and on the other hand, it is a good thing that they make space available in their newspapers for something of this nature because if we prevent it, they will use the space to libel South Africa and slander her name abroad. (Laughter.] So we have no objection to these cartoons. Let them continue with them. Moreover, the fact is that the Ministers concerned are also amused by them.</p>

<p>In regard to paragraph (d) I want to say that I feel that its provisions are aimed, amongst other things, at the Suppression of Communism Act and nothing else.</p>

<p>At 10.25 p.m. the Temporary Chairman stated that, in accordance with Standing Order No. 26 (1), he would report progress and ask leave to sit again.</p>
