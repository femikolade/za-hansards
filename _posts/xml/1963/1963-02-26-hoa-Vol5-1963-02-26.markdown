<p>asked the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his Department has sent a circular letter to civil pensioners dealing with the P.A.Y.E. system of income-tax collection; if so, what are the contents of the letter;</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS;</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. A circular letter, dated 19 November 1962, was issued to all civil pensioners, the contents of which reads as follows:<br/>In consequence of the introduction of the payment of income-tax on a &#x201C;pay-as-you-earn&#x201D; (P.A.Y.E.) basis, the accompanying form I.R.P. 2 must be completed and returned to the Secretary for Social Welfare and Pensions, Private Bag, Pretoria, with the least possible delay but not later than 31 December 1962. The particulars furnished on these forms will enable this office to calculate the amount of income-tax (if any) to be deducted monthly from your pension.<br/>Failure to complete and return the form as requested will necessitate the deduction of income-tax at the rate applicable to unmarried persons without dependants.<br/>Should you be liable to tax deductions the first recovery will be made at the end of March 1963.<br/>Your pension reference number F22 / must be inserted on form I. R.P. 2 in the small block at the left-hand top corner headed &#x201C;For use by employee. Pension/Provident Fund Number</li>

<li>(2) Yes. Pensioners who made inquiries have been given the information which they required, either verbally or in writing. In some cases, where the I.R.P. 2 forms were not completed in full, they have been returned to the persons concerned under cover of an explanatory letter.<br/>The Commissioner for Inland Revenue was requested to cover certain aspects in regard to form I.R.P. 2 in his publicity campaign in so far as civil pensioners were concerned. The Commissioner gave the assurance that all possible steps would be taken and on 9 and 10 November 1962 statements were published in the Press. Several radio talks were given in regard to the general application of the scheme and general publicity has also been given to the scheme by means of prominent posters in post offices and other public places.</li>

<li>(3) No. In view of the foregoing it is not considered necessary to furnish civil pensioners with any further information or to issue any further Press statements in regard to the matter.<br/>The majority of the pensioners concerned reacted favourably to the circular letter and the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions is at present corresponding with those persons who have not yet complied with the request to complete the form I.R.P. 2.</li>

<question by="#de_wet" to="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<num>*X.</num>

<from>Dr. DE WET</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a leading article in the <i>Daily Dispatch</i> of 19 February 1963, in which it is stated that Chief Kaizer Matanzima has expressed no disapproval of violence in the Transkei and the murders at Bashee Bridge; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development" to="#de_wet">

<from>The MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<p>(1) and (2) Yes. The allegation in the sub-leader of the <i>Daily Dispatch</i> of 19 February 1963 that Chief Kaizer Matanzima expressed no disapproval of the violence in the Transkei and the murders at Bashee Bridge, whereas the Dalindyebo Regional Authority expressed such disapproval, is devoid of all truth.</p>

<p>The facts are that on 7 February 1963 (two days after the murders) Chief Matanzima condemned the murders in a personal statement which was broadcast over all the Bantu news services. The abovementioned transmission which speaks for itself and in respect of which I obtained the text from the S.A.B.C. was as follows:</p>

<block name="quote">The brutal killings of the innocent White workers on the Bashee River by Natives in that area was an unprecedented act of savagery in this area. It is the beginning of the programme set by the P.A.C. or Poqo to annihilate the White people in South Africa together with all those who work with the Government in the position of Chiefs, Headmen and Heads of authorities. The terrorism is now centred around the Transkei because of the set-up here. It is stimulated by the communists and the liberals who are the virulent opponents of the Government and will go to any length to subverse the policy of separate development. The murder took place in Paramount Chief Sabata&#x2019;s area. It follows a sequence of other murders on people&#x2019;s lives. It is hoped that the Paramount Chief will do all in his power to stamp out this lawlessness. On behalf of my people, the emigrant Tembus in particular, I wish to extend our deepest sympathy with the bereaved families in their tragic loss.</block>

<p>For the sake of completeness the following facts are supplied: The murders took place on 5 February. On 6 February Paramount Chief Victor Poto denounced the murders. On 7 February followed the statement of Chief Kaizer Matanzima. On 14 February Paramount Chief Botha Sigcau issued a condemnatory statement and on the same date the Dalindyebo Regional Authority of which Paramount Chief Sabata Dalindyebo is the Chairman, denounced the murders in a statement.</p>

<p>In the light of these facts the attack made on Chief Kaizer Matanzima in the above-mentioned sub-leader as well as the motives therein subscribed to him over the alleged omission can be seen in true perspective.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to express my deepest disapproval over this untrue and objectionable sub-leader which can only cause harm. It is shocking that a newspaper can sink to such depths.</p>

Separate lists for the different races are not maintained and it is, therefore, not possible to say what the total amount was in respect of Bantu workmen only. As at 31 December 1962, the gross amount of unclaimed moneys totalled R721.000, which is an insignificant fraction of the total compensation awarded under the present Act since its inception and it includes unclaimed amounts under the 1934 Act. A considerable proportion of workmen involved is non-Bantu.</li>

<li>(2) No. Although awards of compensation are made by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner, the payment thereof and the trading of the payee in the case of Bantu workmen is the function of the Bantu Affairs Commissioner or the magistrate, as the case may be. of the district concerned in terms of Section 83 of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, 1941.</li>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit sub-section (3) and to substitute the following sub-section:</block>

<ol>

<li>(3) Every inquiry held in terms of this Act shall be held in open court: Provided that where, in the opinion of the presiding officer, special circumstances exist in any particular case, he may order that no person whose presence is not necessary shall be present at the inquiry.</li>

</ol>

<p>The proposal which is contained in the clause as it stands is that inquiries under the Act should in all circumstances be held in closed session or <i>in camera.</i> This Bill deals with a section of our administration of justice in this country and while it deals with personal relationships it is our belief that the sound principle that legal proceedings should be held in open court should not readily be departed from. We believe that in the overwhelming majority of cases it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings should be held in open court. We have conceded that there may be circumstances in which the presiding officer may decide that no person whose presence is not necessary shall be present at the inquiry. We believe that that is an adequate safeguard. We believe that there are various reasons, which we believe good reasons, why this amendment should be accepted. In the first place it is my firm belief that if parties who are finding it difficult to reach agreement in a maintenance matter know that the inquiry would be held in open court, they might very much more readily agree to come to a sensible settlement and thus avoid unnecessary and unpleasant legal proceedings. In addition, where the matter goes to an open court, a recalcitrant husband, for example, would be very much more ready, we believe, to be sensible about the matter; he might be encouraged to come to a sensible arrangement, and we believe that there would be far fewer contested cases if the proceedings were held in open court. We do not believe that there are good reasons why the very sound rule of our law should be departed from in this case. I move the amendment and I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I had occasion to consider the amendment of the hon. member and whilst it is perfectly true that that is the general rule of our law, I want to say to-day&#x2014;and this House has said so before&#x2014; that we have every reason and for that matter every right to depart from that rule if and when there are children to be considered in the matter. The hon. member will agree with me that in most maintenance cases there are children to be considered. It is for that very reason that, as the hon. member will remember, when we dealt with the Children&#x2019;s Act in 1960 we inserted a very similar provision to this one and that was approved of unanimously by all members on both sides of the House. I refer the hon. member to Section 8 (3) of the Children&#x2019;s Act which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At any sitting of a Children&#x2019;s Court no person shall be present unless his presence is necessary in connection with the proceedings of that court, or unless he is a parent or the guardian of a person <i>in loco parentis</i> of a child whose presence is necessary as aforesaid (or the attorney or counsel of such a child, parent, guardian or person <i>in loco parentis</i>) and he is present with that child, or unless the commissioner presiding at that sitting has granted him permission to be present.</block>

<p>We adopted this very same principle in the Children&#x2019;s Court and if it was right then I submit that it is right that we should adopt it in this Bill since it is a similar provision. I have given serious consideration to the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment but for that very reason it is not possible to accept it.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The number of maintenance matters that come under the Children&#x2019;s Act are, I would say, relatively limited. And above all I want to stress that in the maintenance matters that will come before this Court of Inquiry, there will be a very few in which there will be a dispute as to the amount that should be paid for a child. The parents are usually willing to agree upon an amount for the child. It is only in respect of the maintenance to be paid to the wife that the husband may feel that he is being bled. Therefore I suggest that there should be a very different <span class="col_1965-1966" refersTo="page_0997"/>approach here. Sir, the fact is that the magistrate still has a discretion where it is an appropriate case. We would be accepting a principle here, against which this legislature has. set its face very resolutely down the ages, for very substantial reasons, if we pass this clause as it stands. It is a good thing that these things should be done in public; that justice should be dispensed in public; that people should be able to clear their name in public. A man may come before this court and it will not be known how the proceedings went and what arrangements were made.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, this legislature has been careful to protect the interests of children in matters which more intimately concern children, not in mere money matters but. for example, where a crime has been committed by a juvenile or where a juvenile gives evidence. In cases of that description our Code does contain exceptions. But may I remind the hon. the Minister that the Code lays down that, for example, criminal cases shall be held in open court, save in certain circumstances. And as far as civil cases are concerned, there again the rule is that the proceedings must be held in open court. The argument against it is simply that there is this unfortunate publicity particularly affecting children. What great degree of publicity has there been?</p>

<p>If one accepts the principle that maintenance matters are to be heard <i>in camera</i> as a general rule, where will one draw the line? Why in maintenance matters only? Why not matters of divorce; why not adultery cases? Where will one draw the line? I do submit that we are tampering here with something which is very fundamental and a rule which has not given difficulty in practice. I think it is only when we tamper with it that we will realize what forces, which hitherto have been dealt with successfully, we have unleashed.</p>

<p>I suggest that there is no substantial advantage to be gained from this provision as it now reads, and I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment, particularly since the magistrate has the discretion to exclude people whose presence is not necessary. I would say too that it is possible to exclude the Press even in certain circumstances and still leave the proceedings open to the public. If one is going to hold the proceedings <i>in camera,</i> then both the public and the Press are excluded. It is possible for a court to exclude the Press in certain cases and still admit the public; that is another possibility.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister will remember that when the question of holding a trial <i>in camera</i> was mooted in the Press, there was a big reaction from all sides, and it was pointed out that all kinds of unexpected consequences might follow. I would therefore ask the Minister to consider very seriously the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) and rather to leave this position where it has been, which I again suggest has not been unsatisfactory.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member I just want to say that when it comes to the hearing of a case <i>in camera</i> and the avoidance of publicity until such time as the person is found guilty, I think 1 have more people on my side when I adopt that attitude than I have against me, to judge from the reaction which there has been. But that is not relevant at the moment. What is relevant at the moment is whether members of the public should have access when a case is heard in which the intimate and personal affairs of two people are being openly discussed. I am convinced&#x2014;and the hon. member will not get me to change my mind&#x2014;that it is not at all necessary, not for the sound administration of justice nor for any other reason whatsoever, for outsiders to be present and to revel in the intimate and personal relationships between a husband and wife and perhaps their children. I think those individuals are the only people concerned and nobody else. That does not mean that cases cannot be published in newspapers, because as the hon. member knows it is very clearly stated here that while the public can be excluded during the hearing of a case, nothing prevents the Press from having sight of the record of the proceedings because the record of a court case is a public document and the Press may publish it with due consideration of the fact that they may not reveal anything which may disclose the identity of a child. The Press, therefore, does not come into the picture either. I want the House to understand clearly what the principle is that is involved and I have exceedingly strong feelings about that principle. I feel so strongly about it that even if the entire House were against me, I would still adhere to it. The principle with which we are concerned here, in my opinion, is that you are dealing with the intimate woes and sorrows of two people and that that is not a case in which the public in general have or <span class="col_1967-1968" refersTo="page_0998"/>ought to have any interest. It has nothing to do with the administration of justice; we are dealing here with a maintenance court. The hon. member said quite rightly that decent newspapers did not report these things but it is for the very reason that there are newspapers which are not decent and which revel in that sort of thing &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; that I am quite determined that this clause must remain unaltered so that, if possible, I can spare those people this unnecessary flocking of strangers to the court who want to revel in the misery of others. Our experience has been that the more spicy a case is the greater the publicity which it receives. I did not insert this provision without any reason. It is a case of conscience and conviction with me that I should spare those people this misery and if I do so I am not violating any principle whatsoever. I cannot be accused of closing the law courts to the public because this is not a court of law in the ordinary sense of the word. We are trying to solve the difficulties between a husband and wife in the way in which provision is made in this Bill. I make bold to say that the public have nothing to do with the problems and difficulties of these people and that is why I adopt this attitude.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that we doubt the sincerity of the Minister&#x2019;s motives in this matter, but I do not think that the analysis given by him is really sound. Many cases come before courts in which the personal details of people are disclosed. Even in actions concerning ordinary commercial transactions, and in actions arising out of breach of contract, you have a considerable amount of intimate details of people disclosed in open court. I do appreciate that the hon. the Minister has had certain advice in this matter with regard to what takes place in these maintenance courts. In Johannesburg particularly where a considerable amount of investigation and inquiry takes place in the maintenance court, we possibly have the best example of how lurid details which should not be published are disclosed to the public. All that we are asking for here is that a permissive right should remain in the hands of the presiding magistrate to clear the court when he feels that it is necessary. I do not think that these maintenance cases very often involve any intimate details with regard to children. Most of them are concerned not only with the failure of the husband to provide maintenance for his wife and children but very often a stubborn refusal to do so. In these cases you often get the type of individual who avoids working in order to avoid paying maintenance. The fact that these cases are heard in open court is an important deterrent. I say that the hon. the Minister, who has been advised in this matter, has taken the matter a little too far. In the case of the Children&#x2019;s Court one can well understand that in cases in which children themselves may be exposed to the public glare, the proceedings should be held <i>in camera</i>.</p>

<p>No, it is not a question of the woman being exposed; the person who is really exposed is the person who fails to pay the maintenance. We who have experience of these cases realize that it is necessary on the rare occasions only to clear a court because the details become a little too intimate and a little too lurid. In general, however, the position is no different from that in any other civil action where an individual claims payment from another.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>In what way does it concern the public?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Everything concerns the public. One might as well close all preparatory examinations and all inquiries under the Insolvency Act and all inquiries under the Companies Act to the public. If the Minister wants to argue that way, of what concern are these cases to the public? The whole principle which is at stake here is that justice must be dispensed and be seen to be dispensed. All that the Minister is concerned with is to protect people from the glare of publicity, and in the case of children one can quite understand that. We are not having a controversy with the Minister to score a point against him; after all, he is the Minister of Justice. We are dealing with an important principle in the dispensation of justice, but I do not think that it is. necessary to have this type of case heard <i>in camera</i> unless the magistrate is prepared to admit persons whom the Minister says either of the parties may ask should be admitted. The principle here in my view does not differ from the principle in any other case. If in terms of the amendment the magistrate had the discretionary power to clear the court, then I feel that the difficulty of which the Minister has been advised would be fully met. We are not disputing the motive of the Minister or his sincerity. But we do feel that in this type of case this is a serious intrusion into the important principle of justice that justice must be dispensed openly&#x2014;to the knowledge and to the view of the public. For that reason, Sir, an appeal is made to the Minister to reconsider this matter and to view it in that light namely that in most cases it will be purely a dispute between two persons, a dispute of a commercial nature, the question of whether the individual can pay, why does he not pay and what penalties the magistrate should impose to oblige him to carry out his duty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>We are dealing here with two apparently conflicting principles. The one is a principle with which the hon. the Minister agrees, a principle which has been the basis of our administration of justice in the Western world for hundreds of years and that is that we are against secret tribunals of any kind and <span class="col_1969-1970" refersTo="page_0999"/>that the courts must perform their functions openly so that justice can be seen to be done. On the other side and apparently opposed to that&#x2014;I say this advisedly&#x2014;is the desire of all of us that no child in particular or person should be harmed through adverse publicity or through his affairs being exposed to public gaze when that can be avoided. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that we must try to reconcile those two things in respect of this piece of legislation. I would suggest with great respect that this amendment does that very satisfactorily. Whilst it upholds the first principle, upon which all our courts have functioned for a very long time, namely that justice is seen to be done between parties, it makes provision at the same time for the proceedings to be held <i>in camera</i> where there is a danger of children or parties being injured through their affairs being made public. That is exactly what this amendment is designed to do. I do suggest that you cannot accommodate those two principles better than is done in this particular amendment.</p>

<p>I would ask the hon. the Minister to think back to his own practice. The &#x201C;spice &#x201D;&#x2014;for want of a better word&#x2014;which one reads about in regard to matrimonial affairs emerges from proceedings not in the maintenance court but in the divorce court. It is largely matrimonial cases which provide that sort of sensational information. I am sure you will agree, Sir, that the proceedings in a maintenance court usually involve how much is to be paid; not whether there is a liability to pay but simply how much should be paid for the maintenance of the wife. That is not a subject which, in nine cases out of ten, involves any sort of &#x201C;spicy&#x201D; evidence at all. It is a simple issue of &#x00A3;. s. d. and what the needs of the parties are. If you look at the type of proceedings with which we are dealing here, you will see that we are not concerned with the more extravagant type of evidence, not with the more spicy type of evidence, but with the more mundane type of evidence in the maintenance court.</p>

<p>As the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) pointed out if one places too much emphasis on this question of protecting people from their affairs being made known, then one must hold <i>in camera</i> a good half of all the cases that appear in court. A great many criminal trials involve this type of evidence; a great many defamation actions do and a great many matrimonial actions do. Even many apparently simple commercial suits involve the court delving into the private affairs of the parties. We cannot do anything about that if we are to maintain the principle of our courts acting on the basis that justice must be seen to be applied. But so far as humanly possible in maintenance actions we have made provision for that by giving to the presiding officer the discretion to exclude the public and the Press where intimate affairs are being discussed and where it will be detrimental for those affairs to be aired abroad.</p>

<p>I would suggest so far as the Minister has suggested that the Press can get to the documents, that there is a practical difficulty involved. We know the principle is that these <b>documents are public documents. But there</b> again, if the hon. the Minister thinks back to his practice he will realize that in many of these courts the evidence is taken down mechanically or in shorthand. I believe the position to be that that evidence is not transcribed unless there is an appeal or a review or some further proceedings.</p>

<p>But I think the hon. the Minister will agree that the tendency is to increase the artificial taking down of evidence in the magistrates&#x2019; courts because it saves so much time. If that is done, Sir, the Press, although it has access to those documents, will not in fact have access to them. That is a minor point, Sir; I merely add it as a pebble on the pile. But I do suggest that if the Minister reconsiders this amendment he will come to the conclusion that it is a very happy reconciliation of these two apparently conflicting principles.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true what the hon. member for Zululand (Mr. Cadman) has said, namely that the principle of the case is merely how much is to be paid. Let us take this honourable House as an example. The principle of a Bill is very often very minor and easy but hon. members discuss that very minor principle for days and days on end and bring in all sorts of extraneous arguments. That is exactly what is happening in every maintenance case. Let me give the hon. member an example. He will remember there was a maintenance case involving a university professor in the Western Cape last year. For days and days it was frontpage news in all the newspapers in Cape Town. It all depends on the amount of spice that can be had out of any case.</p>

<p>*My argument is that I am not closing the door. Those people who want to have their affairs broadcast are at liberty to do so. They can ask the presiding magistrate whether the public can come and listen to the case. If they direct that request to the presiding official I do not believe for one moment that he will refuse it. But I do believe that as a general principle&#x2014;and I feel very strongly about this &#x2014;it is not necessary, as far as these intimate matters are concerned, that there should be other people as witnesses. To say the honest truth, Sir, I am more and more inclined to think that the difficulties and problems of the whole world which confront us to-day are due to the fact that the one person is too inclined to poke his nose into the affairs of the other person. If everybody would attend more to his own affairs and less to somebody else&#x2019;s <b>I believe</b> it would be much better. I notice the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) agrees fully with me. He is a man of the world; he knows what this is all about.

<p>I appreciate the Minister&#x2019;s position and that he will not budge from it; that he himself mentioned a point which, I think, shows how necessary it is. He said that the public and the Press had access to affidavits and those documents. It is in those very documents that you get the most scandalous statements made about people which they can then refute in an open court. The court weighs up the evidence, finds those statements entirely without foundation and that fact then becomes well known. If on the other hand you give access to affidavits and documents which can be completely false, as I have said, that will get into the Press and the person concerned will have no opportunity of refuting them. That is just the kind of unexpected result which may flow from this course upon which we are embarking in this Bill.</p>

As the Bill stands at the moment any maintenance money which a husband has to pay in respect of his wife has to be paid to an officer, an organization or an institution as ordered by the magistrate. As I understood the hon. the Minister he pointed out at an earlier stage that one of the difficulties which arose as far as paying the money to the wife herself was concerned, was that it was sometimes difficult to prove that the money had or had not been paid. I can understand that as a difficulty in certain cases. The proposal here is to include the word &#x201C;person&#x201D; in addition to the words &#x201C;officer, organization or institution&#x201D; so that in a special case, in the magistrate&#x2019;s discretion, he can order the money to be paid to the wife personally rather than to some institution which will in turn account to her for that money. I have in mind the position of a woman living in the country remote from any suitable organization in which case it would be more desirable for the money to be paid to her direct. I think it is right that the magistrate should have the discretion to make an order that the money be paid to her direct in that kind of case. Where, of course, there is an institution near by who can receive the money on her behalf he will no doubt make an order that that institution should be the recipient of the money concerned. But it is not difficult to visualize a case where it would be inconvenient and difficult for the woman were the money to be paid to an institution. I want to emphasize that the magistrate should have a discretion. Should difficulties arise in connection with the payment of the money direct to the woman then, of course, a change can always be made. It might involve in any one instance both expense and inconvenience for the woman concerned and this amendment will make it easier for the odd case where an order made in terms of the Bill as it stands may be inconvenient.</p>

<p>There is a great deal of substance in what the hon. member has said. The position is, however, that we have received so many complaints in the past that those people who know much more about these things than the hon. member and myself, have advised us to word the clause as it is worded here as an experiment. If it appears that it does not work in practice, that we experience any difficulties or problems, I shall not hesitate to return to this House and to ask that we insert &#x201C;person &#x201D;. But experience has taught us that if you insert it the persons to whom the maintenance is payable will on every occasion ask that the maintenance be paid to them. Welfare organizations and other people who know much more about these matters and the Department which has had years of experience, feel&#x2014;and I share that feeling&#x2014;that with a view to the difficulties which we have had in the past we should leave the clause as it is worded at the moment. Hon. members have not the vaguest idea of the amount of correspondence which has been conducted on this subject, the number of court cases which have followed and that is why it was very deliberately inserted in this clause that in future the money must not be paid over to the individual but that it must be paid to an organization. As it says here, &#x201C;official, organization or institution &#x201D;. If a person lives in a distant part of the country and it is paid to an organization it can easily be paid over by way of a cheque. Let us leave it at that for the moment. Let us see how it works in practice. We have been asked to do this by people who have much more experience of these matters than hon. members and myself. If we find that it does not work the way they told us it would, we can make the change. The hon. member knows that very often these people who receive the maintenance are the very people who have to be guided and advised by the welfare organization. If we can give them the opportunity by means of this to give guidance and advice to those people I think much more of that money will be saved. Hon. members on both sides of the House continually receive complaints from a husband who says: &#x201C;I am paying maintenance to my wife and she is spending the money on totally different things; my children do not get the money; the money is not spent correctly.&#x201D; It is as a result of representations made to us that the clause provides what it does.</p>

<p>Oh, then I am not correct in my assumption, Sir, because I was going to suggest to the hon. the Minister that the precedent which he quoted as relevant, namely the Children&#x2019;s Act, would be a proper precedent had this clause been confined to children.

<p>If the clause said only where children were involved, then the rule will be that where children are involved no one will be allowed in, and it would have been a different matter. If it said that in other cases the magistrate had a discretion, it would have baan a different matter. But it does not say that. Sir. As the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) said, what happened between a husband and wife in a maintenance case is no different from what happened between a husband and wife in a divorce case. As the hon. the Minister said the sort of publicity you would get would depend on what spice there was. It is very difficult, Sir, to conceive of any cases, except criminal cases which is a matter between the State and the individual and in which everyone has an interest, which do not fall in the category mentioned by the Minister, namely cases which concern only the parties before the court. Most civil cases certainly fall within that category; you may find an exception in cases where a principle is involved, such as insurance or hire-purchase cases. So I do ask the Minister to reconsider the position even if he only does so before this Bill goes to the Other Place.</p>

<p>Before I move the amendment standing in my name there is one matter to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister.</p>

<p>Very well, Sir, I move the amendment which stands in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 38, after &#x201C;as&#x201D; to insert "<i>prima facie</i>"</block>

<p>I do not think it needs much elucidation. The clause is in any event an extraordinary clause; without the provisions of this clause it would not be possible to do these things. My amendment is merely to insert the words <i>&#x201C;prima facie &#x201D;</i> which I think was the intention in any event.</p>

<p>Before my time expires I wish to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to one aspect of this clause. The hon. the Minister has already pointed this out in his second-reading speech. I refer to the fact that the magistrate&#x2019;s court would be able to act as a court of review in respect of a Supreme Court order. In this respect one appreciates the difficulty which is involved and, as the Minister put it in the second reading, it is a question of balancing the one up against the other. I think the balance falls, as the Minister has suggested, in favour of having such a situation. There is a situation which could arise and which disturbs one. One very often finds that a wife will agree to divorce her husband&#x2014;it is not a connived divorce; she has proper grounds for divorce&#x2014;if she is properly provided for. It may well be that her husband will make all sorts of promises. He may sign an agreement; they then go to court and the court orders that he pays so much maintenance, an amount which he cannot really afford, but he has promised that to her for the purpose of getting the divorce. That agreement is then made an order of court. After a month or two he goes to one of these maintenance courts and says: &#x201C;My circumstances are such that I cannot really afford to pay this amount.&#x201D; There is really nothing that can be done. I want to mention this difficulty to the hon. the Minister so that his Department will have cognizance of this sort of thing. It may well be that something can be done within the Department.</p>

I had hoped that he would also have accepted the other amendment and insert the word &#x201C;person &#x201D;. This is of course experimental legislation. I must say that there are other points which the Minister might consider further. If he will look at line 6 on page 4 he will find that it almost appears as if the court has a right to make an order against a person who is not before it. I think the wording is a little unfortunate. It reads that the court can make an order against &#x201C;any person&#x201D;. In parenthesis, if there are two ex-husbands. the court may come to the conclusion that the one who is appearing before it is not the one who is liable to pay maintenance.

<p>The present position is that it is usually the position of the husband that changes. As things stand, where there is a maintenance order issued, for example by the Cape Court, any variation must be referred to that court. The law is now being altered, and where the wife who is being maintained has moved to Durban, for instance, the inquiry will occur in Durban. I am very glad to see that in Clause 8 some consideration is given to the position of the husband. He will be entitled to be paid on the basis that a witness for the accused in the case of criminal proceedings is paid. As I understand the position under this Bill, it will not be possible for that husband to be tendered his travelling expenses, for example, from Cape Town to Durban. It is clearly in the interests of justice that he should be heard. I do not intend moving any amendment, but I do hope that some arrangements will be made, at any rate administratively, whereby such a person can have some comparable allowance tendered to him so that he may be able to go to Durban to attend the inquiry.</p>

<p>The position at the present moment is that any variation of a Supreme Court Order shall be made in the court in which it was issued. Consequently if a wife moves to Durban and she wants an increase in her maintenance, she has got to come to Cape Town where presumably the husband is. As a result of this law the husband will be placed in a less favourable position. I am very glad that thought has been given to that point.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>Not as far as answering the claim for increased maintenance, for example, is concerned. He has got to make his way from Cape Town to Durban, whereas at present if he is living and working in Cape Town, his wife has got to institute the action in Cape Town where he can easily answer the charge; he just goes to court from his work here. I appreciate the thought that has gone into it, which has in fact made provision for his getting a certain payment, but it must be noted that that payment is subject to this provision, &#x201C;the officer presiding at such inquiry may direct &#x2026; that that allowance be paid In other words, the matter must be over and done with virtually, before that allowance can be paid Consequently a chap who is hard up and is not paying his maintenance is unlikely to be able to find the money to travel all the way up to Durban, and therefore I think you will find that you will not get the husband&#x2019;s case, shall I say, put adequately, unless some thought is given to this particular aspect. I am not able to say precisely what should be given. Very often in the case of witnesses in Supreme Court trials, and so forth, the travelling expenses of the witness are tendered in most cases so that they may attend the court. And I simply draw attention to this aspect so that something may be done, probably administratively, or perhaps by way of an amendment at a subsequent <span class="col_1977-1978" refersTo="page_1003"/>stage, which will take account of this difficulty. Otherwise I think you will have the position that a lot of defendants will not appear in court and you will probably therefore get a lot of unwise maintenance orders made because it will all go the wife&#x2019;s way&#x2014;I am using the case of a wife as an example.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will know that under the Women&#x2019;s and Children&#x2019;s Act, even if a wife deserts her husband here in Cape Town and she goes to Durban and lives there, and he does not maintain the children, then she can lodge a complaint in Durban, and then he must come all the way from Cape Town to Durban. If he does not go, he is arrested here and brought there under escort. That has been the position all the time since Union. So now we alleviate the position by giving the Commissioner the discretion, to pay that man as if he were a witness in that case where necessary. Up to now it was impossible to pay him anything at all, even if he was found not guilty. When he was an ordinary accused, no witness fees or any money could be paid to him. So in fact we are making the position better for the defendant under this Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I must say that the ordinary position is that where a man is charged, he is brought before the court in the district in which he resides. It may well be, as the hon. the Minister says, that so far as the Deserted Wives and Children Protection Act is concerned, the position is different.</p>

<p>That of course we can easily solve by looking at the books. But even assuming that the hon. the Minister is correct. we still have got a new class of case, and I suggest that this is the main class of case where these matters arise, namely, a variation of a maintenance order previously made by the court. That type of order in my opinion will much more occupy this new inquiry system than any approach to the courts under the Deserted Wives and Children Protection Act. because under the Deserted Wives and Children Protection Act it was not possible to change an order of maintenance. Under this new arrangement we are going to be able to vary a maintenance order made by the Supreme Court following a divorce action, which will be the main type of case, and in such cases it was essential for anybody seeking to vary that order to go to the court in which the order was made. Now, because of this Bill, that inquiry need not be held in that court but wherever the person being maintained resides. And so that situation will remain requiring attention, and I hope that some further thought will be given to it.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 15</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 54, to omit &#x201C;and rules of evidence &#x201D;.</block>

<p>The amendment seeks to delete these words in Clause 15 (a). As the clause stands, the Minister will have power by notice in the <i>Gazette</i> to make rules prescribing the procedure and rules of evidence to be followed at an inquiry under this Act. We are perfectly content that he shall have power to prescribe the procedure, but my amendment seeks to deprive him of the power to make rules of evidence. We feel that it is a new advance to make rules of evidence. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister is prepared to accept this amendment, but since he may not be, I might perhaps advance my arguments in favour of the amendment. I have here two Acts which I just looked at at random; the one is the Railway and Harbours Service Act, No. 22 of 1960, and in Section 32 (1) (f) the Administration, subject to the approval of the Governor-General, may make regulations (f) &#x201C;regarding the procedure to be observed in dealing with charges of inefficiency or disciplinary contraventions &#x2026; &#x201D;. No right there to make rules of evidence. Again I glanced at the Factories. Machinery and Building Work Act, No. 22 of 1941, and there too, in Section 51 (m), we see that there is the power given to the Governor-General to make regulations dealing with the procedure to be followed, but again nothing in regard to evidence. These were the two Acts that just came to my mind where inquiries involving evidence are held. It is conceivable that there are cases where the power to make rules of evidence is granted, but I doubt it very much, because that would mean that by ministerial order you would be changing what is the substantive law of this country, and I suggest that that is the principle against which this House would have set its face. I may say upon this point that there are in the present Bill before us certain alterations in the law of evidence. They are quite far-reaching and we have not hesitated to support them. But what we feel is that if the Minister has certain things in mind, let him come and bring them before this House by way of amendment so that they can be approved. But simply to delegate powers to alter the substantive law of our country by way of rules is. I suggest, something that we should not embrace, and I hope therefore very much that the hon. the Minister will see his way clear to agree to an amendment.</p>

But I <span class="col_1979-1980" refersTo="page_1004"/>am told by the law advisers, and I must accept that position, that this is in fact a hybrid Bill. It does not deal with the civil trial and it does not deal with the criminal trial. It is a bit of both, as the hon. member will readily understand. That being the position, I am told by the law advisers that we must expect to run into quite a few snags as the Bill is put into practice. I know the usual practice is that you say in your Bill, as you have it in the Children&#x2019;s Act and in the Act quoted by the hon. member, that you can make regulations as to procedure. I am told, however, and I must accept that notwithstanding what the hon. member has said, that we are going to run into some snags if we have not got that provision in the Bill, and until such time as this new court, which is a hybrid court, has worked in practice, I am told that we must have this provision, and therefore unfortunately I cannot accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment.</p>

I do appreciate what the hon. the Minister has said that this is a hybrid court inasmuch as it deals with civil cases and criminal cases. It may very well be that the person who appears before the court at an inquiry may be facing both a criminal and a civil charge, or one rolled up into the other. But in seeking to prove the case against the person whom it is alleged is liable to pay maintenance, evidence must be adduced, and the manner for the adduction of that evidence surely must be the rules of evidence which our law and the English law have known for centuries. In other words, if a man disappears, and he will be represented, there must be some limitation to the sort of evidence that can be brought forward, there must be some rules prescribing how it is that one can prove or disprove any fact. Otherwise one would not know where one was.</p>

<p>The previous speaker has asked me to repeat what I said by way of interjection, namely that the hon. member did not know what he was talking about. He has held a long dissertation and nobody on earth could follow what he wanted to say. What the hon. the Minister told him was perfectly clear, namely that this court would have two functions, it would be a court which would require certain rules of evidence to be applied to criminal cases but that there was also a civil element in this court and our rules of evidence applicable to civil cases would come into operation. It has to be decided which rules of evidence will apply, because not all the rules of evidence applicable to civil cases are applicable to criminal cases and the court is faced with this difficult dilemma: Which set of rules should be applied in a certain case? That being the position the Minister is being empowered to make regulations and those regulations will lay down which rules of evidence will be applicable. The hon. the Minister told him by way of interjection that the court could not, as it went along, lay down rules of evidence. It will be done by way of regulation. No, I think the hon. member should sometimes think before he speaks but he is so addicted to speaking that he does not know what he says.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down made some rude personal remarks, but I want to address the hon. Minister. I do not think the hon. the Minister has <span class="col_1981-1982" refersTo="page_1005"/>made out a case at all. Our rules of evidence are of long standing. Now the worst that could happen is in a case which has both civil and criminal consequences, and the most serious of those is of course the criminal case; then quite obviously the laws relating to the position under our criminal law will have to apply. If it is a question whether the measure of proof is sufficient, and if it is to be for a criminal case, it would be utterly wrong if whatever is required for proof of the matter is left to be dealt with in terms of a regulation on a matter which does not measure up to the very high standard which applies under our criminal law.</p>

<p>I cannot very well take it much further than I have done already. I think the hon. member for Germiston (District) understands my problem. This is a new court that is being created, and either I must say in this Bill that the rules of evidence of our criminal courts shall apply, or I must say that the rules of evidence in civil cases shall apply. I cannot come along and say in this Bill, as the hon. member wants me to do, that the rules of evidence in criminal and civil cases applicable in South Africa shall apply to this court. Then I have absolute chaos, because it is a hybrid court, and this is a hybrid Bill dealing with both civil and criminal matters. Therefore I must leave this back door open. Candidly, I do not think that we will use it very much, because it stands to reason that the rules of the magistrate&#x2019;s court as the hon. member knows will be applicable in cases of this kind in 95 out of 100 cases. I am very candid with hon. members when I say that I am not in love with this clause myself, but that is my advice that it is necessary and I cannot possibly go beyond that.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister mentions the case of a man who has a certificate from his employer.

I submit <span class="col_1983-1984" refersTo="page_1006"/>there again that the person representing the other party can say &#x201C;I am prepared to accept that certificate &#x201D;. But if the other party is not satisfied with the certificate, they can say &#x201C;No, I am not prepared to accept the certificate, I want the employer here himself&#x201D;.

Let me take this position: Supposing the civil aspect of a case crops up but if it is a criminal case there is a rule which lays down that in a criminal case the proof must be such that it is completely conclusive, it has to be absolute proof. In a civil case it is the balance of probabilities which counts. Which rule should apply. If it is the civil aspect the balance of probabilities must be the deciding factor but if you apply the rules applicable to criminal cases, the proof must be conclusive. Which set of rules must be applied in such a case? Or you can reverse the position. Let it be a criminal case. Must the civil rules of evidence apply, namely must the balance of probabilities count? There are many complicated difficulties which hon. members cannot anticipate. Even the amendment which has been suggested will not offer a solution. You will have to draw up a separate set of rules, Sir. I can well imagine that neither the hon. the Minister nor hon. members like this but from the nature of the case we must simply reconcile ourselves to the fact that it is a sort of dilemma which we will only be able to overcome in this way.</p>

<p>I am sorry to take up more time of the House, but I am encouraged by the hon. Minister himself, and also by the fact that he has said that he will look into it when the Bill goes to the Other Place. But I want to say that I do believe that the hon. Minister may possibly be relying on what I think is a misconception. It seems to me that this Bill does not really create a hybrid court <span class="col_1985-1986" refersTo="page_1007"/>in any way. In all these clauses, except Clause 11, it creates a court to hear civil matters. In Clause 11 it deals with the criminal aspects, and the only point at all where there is overlapping as far as evidence is concerned is in Clause 13 where you may have a normal criminal charge, as it were, converted into an inquiry. Only in such a case could there be any question of hybridness as far as the evidence is concerned. Consequently you would have quite clearly on the civil side the civil rules of evidence applying, and on the criminal side the criminal rules, and that being so I suggest that there is nothing to be frightened of and therefore to make a special reservation such as Clause 15 contains. I say further that this Bill has been carefully thought out, I think, and the Department has not in fact suggested to the Minister any other changes in the rules of evidence beyond these already incorporated, notwithstanding that they went into it carefully.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the Minister is reluctant to do so and I therefore suggest that he would do well, before departing from such a sound attitude, to take the advice also of his other advisers, the Law Societies and the General Bar Council, who are particularly experienced in questions of evidence. One has to be a practitioner in the courts to have a full knowledge of the rules of evidence and I suggest that people less well placed may not always be the best advisers. So I will not take it any further beyond saying that since the Minister has said that he will look into the position and come forward with an amendment, if necessary, in the Other Place, I will not press this amendment.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the House adjourned last night, I had stated that the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) had based his arguments almost entirely on the financial position of the provinces. He put the case as if without money it would be impossible to implement any of these promises which the Minister makes in the Bill. I said last night, and I repeat, that the financial position of our country remains the same, whether the provinces or the Government pay for the education of the Coloureds, and to me this legislation is nothing else than pure apartheid legislation. The effort that the Government is. making to separate the races one from the other is brought out again in this piece of legislation, but more forcibly than ever because the Coloured people to us on this side of the House should be kept together with the: White people.</p>

<p>In the schools, too?</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>There are two groups affected by this Bill, firstly the provinces and secondly the Coloured people. If this Bill is passed it will be another form of erosion of the powers of the provinces. It will make their powers less than they are now, and especially in the Cape where the province plays such a terrific part in the education of both the White and the Coloured people. Because of the large numbers of Coloureds in the Cape, this province will feel it more than any other province. Then it would seem to me that in the very near future the whole of the educational activities of the province will be taken out of their hands. The sign is that to-day we take away Coloured education from the provinces <span class="col_1987-1988" refersTo="page_1008"/>but in the near future we will take away White education. It means that the provincial council will become less and less effective.</p>

<p>Now, what about the Coloured people? Is there any evidence that the Minister has given us, is there any evidence from any of the men on the Government side, that the Coloured people have asked for this? The very best that can be said for the Minister is that one or two groups of Coloured people have said that they would agree to it under certain conditions. But what is the position of the Coloured people? Can they resist this Bill? I feel sure that if they were represented in this House themselves they would stand up and fight this Bill.</p>

<p>Well, let us see what their representatives have done. They have done exactly the same as the Coloured people would have to do. They will accept this Bill only under certain conditions, which are laid down in the amendment moved by the hon. member for Peninsula. Those are the conditions which the Coloured people will have to accept; they have no alternative. What do we expect them to do? To stop teaching in the schools and go on strike? Do we expect the little Coloured children to remain away from school? No, these people will go there and try to compromise, against their wishes. There is no reason in the world why the provincial councils should not continue the good work they are doing now. The groups of people who have said that they would agree to this Bill under certain conditions are only two in number. They are the Union Council for Coloured Affairs and the Coloured People&#x2019;s National Union. The T.E.P.A. have stated categorically this morning that it is not true that the proposal for the transfer has the support of the Coloured people. Why give the House the impression that this Bill is going to be accepted with open arms by the Coloured people?</p>

<p>This follows the natural apartheid pattern that has been carried out over the past 15 years, and here we must remember one very important statement that hits the nail on the head. It was made by the Prime Minister in Pretoria on 16 August 1961 when he said that when he speaks of the nation of South Africa he speaks of the White people of South Africa. We on this side say that the Coloured people belong with the White people of South Africa and they must not be separated from the White people.</p>

<p>This is then my question. Are we going to take the Coloured people along with us on the road to our united South African future, or are we going to leave them on a by-pass, as the Minister intends doing? That is the position. It is not a main road; it is a by-pass, and that is where they will be left to fend for themselves. I say the time has come where every single person who can be educated should be educated as well as possible and I do not think that this is the best way of doing it. The reason for it is that we have a tried system. It is efficient. It has been accepted in South Africa. It has proved over and over again that it is an efficient system and one which should be nurtured and encouraged and not one which should be destroyed, and by this type of legislation only one thing can happen, that education as a whole will be taken away from the province.

<p>What possible good can come to the Coloured people that cannot be given to them now if we remain as we are but only increase the Government subsidies to the provinces? The whole argument of the hon. member for Parow was based on finance, and it became quite obvious that if the Government improved the financial position of the provinces this Bill would be redundant; it would be of no value at all. Why then does not the Government do it the easy way and leave the machinery functioning, and give the money that is needed to the provinces? No, rather than that they will take it away from the provinces and give it over into another little sphere so that the country can use its old manoeuvre of divide and rule.</p>

<p>Is it a good thing for the Coloured people to be separated entirely from the White people in South Africa, where we have such a growing necessity to increase the population that can take part in our development? I feel that with the machinery the provinces have and with the access from the provincial schools to the universities the time has come for us to encourage through the easiest of channels every single person irrespective of his colour to go to a university to fill our needs which are growing day by day.</p>

<p>The whole future of the country depends on the education of its people. The whole future of the Coloureds depends on their education now, and if any process should be introduced at any stage, now or later, which will prevent the Coloured people from fulfilling the duty they have to this country and for us to prevent them from taking the opportunities that are offering, it is pertinent to this Bill. I feel we are going backwards instead of forwards, and that the time has come to educate every single Coloured person we possibly can so that they can fill these vacancies in the ranks of the higher educated people, in the professions and in technology and commerce. Now is the time for us to help them along in their growth and all that we are doing is to change horses in midstream and we are going to set back this clock of progress.</p>

<p>Another thing is this. We have been hearing so much about the cost. Will it be cheaper to have a duplication of services, to have education under three headings, Bantu Education, Coloured Education and White Education? Is that economical? The Minister must tell us how he will save on it and how he will perform the duties the provinces have been doing. But what is much more important, the Minister must be honest and tell us why he is doing this. I do not think these promises which the Minister made will be carried out in the near future. I do not think there will be a sudden rise in salaries for every Coloured teacher, or a sudden uplifting and up-grading of the Coloured teachers so that they will all suddenly become inspectors of schools. The changes will have to be very gradual indeed and I think those Coloured people who are going to accept this Bill as a gift from the Gods will be very disappointed. They will soon find that they will be treated as civil servants and that their movements will be restricted and that their jobs and their positions will be changed from place to place without their having a say in it and that the Minister will be the one to decide whether a man who has lived all his life in the Cape shall not be transferred to the Transvaal. It will be the Minister who will decide whether or not a teacher shall be made an official in the Department. Those are the things which will happen and which do not happen now. The difference is this, that in the future someone from Natal may be shifted to the Cape. At present a Natalian can only be moved to some other part of Natal, and the same in the Transvaal, but now he will be able to be taken from one province and sent to another province. The Minister smiles as if that does not mean anything, but to those people who have lived their lives in one province, this sort of thing can be almost tragic.</p>

<p>Another thing is that I do not know where the Minister will get his personnel from, unless he takes it from the provinces, and there will be a shortage either in the new Department or in the provinces, because it is known to us that the people who are working in the provinces to-day look after both sections of the population, the Whites and the Coloureds. But here a totally new Department will arise and a whole new set-up and a whole new staff will have to be found, and if the Minister can tell me that he has sufficient people to duplicate this service throughout the country I say he has no cause at all to talk about financial difficulties. We on this side of the House are a little tired &#x2026;</p>

<p>In this debate we have the remarkable phenomenon&#x2014;I would almost say the &#x201C;anomaly &#x201D;&#x2014;that the representatives of the Coloureds, the legal representatives of the Coloured population, the people who are the mouthpieces for the Coloureds, support and subscribe to the broad principles of this legislation, but the measure is opposed by the official Opposition. The people who have the interests of the Coloureds and of their children very much at heart are the official representatives of the Coloureds. It is true that they have come along with requests that certain assurances be given and they have come forward with certain demands, but nevertheless as far as broad principles are concerned they support this Bill. I was struck particularly by the fact that the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) who has just sat down, made an attack yesterday evening on the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux) because the latter had given his support to the motion of the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. (Bloomberg). The hon. member for Karoo, who knows the Coloureds particularly well, who knows the circumstances under which they live and who also knows the circumstances connected with their schools, spoke with approval of the work which has already been done by the Department of Coloured Affairs, and in the light of what has already been done he anticipates that this new venture will be crowned with success. That was how he put it, but the hon. member for Rosettenville reproached him and said, &#x201C;If he wanted to approach the subject in the manner in which he did he had no right to second the amendment of his Leader.&#x201D;</p>

<p>What can the official Opposition gain by opposing this legislation in this way? Their only object is to make political capital out of it. I regard none of the arguments which have been advanced from the other side as valid arguments, as arguments which convince me that the <i>status quo</i> of divided education as far as the Coloureds are concerned should be maintained. I think the arguments advanced by the Opposition impel me even more to believe that it is a good step to place education for the Coloureds under the Department of Coloured Affairs.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to certain observations which the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) made on Thursday evening when he was discussing his amendment. The hon. member talked about duplication; he said that this whole venture would lead to duplication. Unfortunately the hon. member is not present but I should have liked to have heard from him what he means by duplication. This Department is going to control approximately 298,000 Coloured pupils who will be transferred from the various provinces if this legislation goes through, and in addition to that it will also control the other pupils at the various schools which have already been placed under the jurisdiction of this Department. I cannot see how there is going to be duplication. This will be a big Department. One need only think of the small Department of Education in the O.F.S. and the still smaller department in South West Africa, where there are far fewer pupils, and then ask oneself whether there is any duplication in the case of these smaller departments. In addition to that, the hon. member for Hillbrow also stated, amongst other things, that there would be four or five directors. Surely the whole idea is to consolidate and to obtain uniformity. The argument has also been advanced, more or less along the same lines, by the hon. member who has just sat down that there are not enough officials to cope with the administration of this Department. But surely it is obvious that some of our most capable officials will be drawn to this Department to take over the control&#x2014;officials who in due course will be replaced by capable Coloureds. We heard here yesterday from the hon. member for Karoo that there is not a single Coloured occupying an administrative post in the Cape Education Department, in the section which controls Coloured education. After all, it is the intention to appoint Coloureds in due course to those administrative posts. Let us accept that there will be a transition period, but surely the idea to work along those lines is the right one.</p>

<p>The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell), in discussing this Bill on Thursday evening said: &#x201C;It is not a matter for figures&#x201D;. That is what the Opposition want to do; they continually want to run away from facts which are supported by statistics and they refuse to take those statistics into consideration. Hon. members on this side, and even the hon. member for Peninsula, have disclosed statistics here which are significant and very revealing. Then the hon. member for South Coast also talked about &#x201C;generalities &#x201D;. That is precisely what the Opposition are doing; they are generalizing in connection with this whole matter.</p>

<p>May I go on to deal with the observations made a moment ago by the hon. member for Rosettenville. Amongst other things he said, &#x201C;The Coloured people should be kept together with the White people &#x201D;. Again we ask him: Are they to be kept together in the same schools? The hon. member who moved the amendment on behalf of the Opposition went into the history of this matter and pointed out that separate schools existed in the Cape in the previous century already and also in the Transvaal. That arrangement was confirmed in the Transvaal by Ordinance No. 7 of 1903 by none other than Lord Milner. It was also followed and confirmed later on by General Smuts. It is perfectly clear therefore that this separation at school was introduced <span class="col_1993-1994" refersTo="page_1011"/>a very long time ago, and under this Bill that separation will continue to be maintained.</p>

<p>Just as in our approach to our national problems, so too in connection with this attempt to place Coloured Education under the Department of Coloured Affairs, the Government is guided by sound judgment, by a sense of fairness, a sense of balance and a sense of justice and above all it is guided by its conscience. As against that the Opposition&#x2019;s attitude is stimulated by the desire to gain cheap popularity, temporary advantage; it is motivated by political opportunism and the hope to make political capital out of a particular situation and also out of this situation. I shall not be surprised if one of these days the member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) goes along to one of his meetings and talks about this Government, in pursuance of this legislation, as a Government of &#x201C;Kleurling-boeties &#x201D;. The Opposition have always opposed the obvious, positive developmental pattern of the Government&#x2019;s policy. The opposition, the obstruction, on the part of the Opposition in respect of this legislation has once again revealed &#x2026;</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw that, but I say that this opposition on the part of the Opposition in respect of this legislation is a manifestation once again of its obsession to oppose all positive and all constructive legislation which is designed for the benefit of a particular group. I want to emphasize at once too that this legislation is in no way discriminatory; it rather seeks to differentiate and to consolidate.</p>

<p>The Opposition have never in the past done anything positive and constructive for the Coloured with a view to uplifting him in the social and economic spheres. They have always been so obsessed with their policy of integration that the Opposition have never adopted a positive policy; they have never had a real programme of upliftment of the Coloured in the sphere of education and in the social and economic spheres. The attitude that the Opposition adopts reminds me very much of the story of the White missionary who was serving a congregation of Coloureds and who did very little in the way of visiting the homes of members of his congregation but who preached at great length on Sundays. When the missionary left, one of the Coloured elders said, &#x201C;dear members of the congregation, our parson was a very good person but in the course of the week he neglected his sheep; he did not look after the scab-infected sheep and on Sundays he killed them by overdipping.&#x201D; That is precisely what the Opposition are doing now. They neglected the Coloureds and now they come along with long speeches and try to give the impression that they are overflowing with goodwill towards the Coloureds.</p>

<p>As against that, the Government drew up a clear programme and, step by step, after very careful consultation, the whole of that programme is being implemented. The hon. member for Hillbrow, in the course of his speech, reproached the Government for not having given sufficient subsidies to the provinces in order to be able to place Coloured education at a sufficiently high level. That argument has already been refuted in a very capable way by previous speakers on this side. I do not want to repeat the data and the statistics which have already been used, but I just want to refer to a period of five years under the rule of the Opposition, from 1940 to 1945. In those years the number of Coloured pupils did not increase at the same rate at which the population increased as was the case in the five years during which the National Party ruled from 1950 to 1955. On a percentage basis, the increase during this period of five years under United Party rule in the Cape Province was 23 per cent, and under the National Party Government the increase was 28 per cent&#x2014;and that was in the initial years of the National Party rule. The State subsidies, which increased proportionately of course, increased more during the period when the National Party was in power.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that the Transvaal has the second largest number of Coloured pupils, I should like to mention a few facts in connection with this province. The background in connection with Coloured education has already been given by other speakers and I do not want to weary the House with further facts in this connection. There is one aspect that I should like to emphasize. In spite of the fact that there have been separate schools for Indians in the Transvaal since 1911, there are still mixed schools to-day for Indians and Coloureds. In 1962 there were 42 schools for Coloureds only in the Transvaal and 38 mixed schools where Coloureds and Indians receive their education together. In the 42 Coloured schools there were something like 18,849 pupils; in the mixed schools there were 12,810. The latest statistics in connection with the number of pupils in schools which are for Coloureds only and in mixed schools show there are 31,659. If the Indians are not added, the number will be considerably smaller. At the moment the educational institutions in the Transvaal are divided as follows: One teachers&#x2019; college, two secondary schools and 77 primary schools, a total of 80 institutions. The Transvaal Department, as we know, has full control over all these schools since there are no State-aided Coloured schools in the Transvaal.</p>

<p>Why can&#x2019;t you do better?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>The instruction in the schools in question is not inferior; it is equal instruction. What I should like to emphasize here is the fact that in spite of the good services which are being rendered by the Transvaal Education Department, the Coloured group, as far as the Transvaal is concerned, constitutes a small percentage of a very large number of White and non-White pupils. In June 1962 there were about 220,000 pupils in Transvaal primary schools and 105,500 in the secondary schools, <span class="col_1995-1996" refersTo="page_1012"/>a total therefore of 325,500. Of this number, the Coloureds, both in the schools for Coloureds only and in the mixed schools, constitute 9.6 per cent, and when it is borne in mind that a large number of those pupils are Indians, then the percentage of Coloured pupils is possibly even as low as 7 per cent. The point that I want to drive home here is that under this divided system of control with the best will in the world full justice cannot be done to the Coloured pupils, constituting as they do such a small percentage of the total number of pupils. Their curriculum and methods of instruction are fashioned on the same pattern as that applying to the vast majority, that is, the White pupils, and that pattern is one which not suited to the character and the requirements of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>In certain secondary schools in the Transvaal, instruction is only given by White teachers, and generally speaking the instruction of the child must surely be purposeful and have a definite object in view. That is an axiom which is accepted in education. This object can best be achieved if the education of Coloured children is provided by Coloureds to Coloured, because the Coloured teacher is best able to reach the soul of the Coloured child. This ideal cannot be achieved sooner and better under the system of divided control of education; it can best be achieved when there is no longer divided control of education. Under this new legislation there will be greater opportunities for adaptation to the requirements of the pupils; to take into consideration the individual aptitude and capability of the pupil and to offer, in addition to the academic courses, a more practical course, the object of which is to prepare the child for a calling; to send out into the world a better equipped and more balanced individual and to guide him in the direction for which he is best equipped so that he can become a great asset to his community. Mr. Speaker, who are the people who are most strenuously opposed to this legislation? They are persons who are protesting because their minds have been poisoned politically, on the one hand by certain newspapers and on the other hand by liberals who in season and out of season oppose the idea of transferring Coloured Education. One can well understand that the attitude of the official Opposition as such adds grist to their mill. Then there are those individuals who attribute the wrong motives to the Department in its praiseworthy attempt to take over Coloured Education. There are certain persons who refuse to co-operate because in their particular areas they would like to pose as heroes. Then there are also those persons, amongst whom there are also teachers, who try to obstruct this measure because they personally do not like certain clauses contained in it.</p>

<p>By means of this legislation the Government seeks to lay a sound basis for Coloured education, even better than in the past, so that in due course the Coloured will be able to make his contribution in the professional, the commercial and the industrial spheres. In this way the Coloured, in his own way, will be able to make a positive contribution to his own development and therefore to the development of the Coloured community in general. Moreover, in due course the Coloureds will be given the opportunity also, as a section of the population, to make their contribution in various spheres to the Republic&#x2019;s further development. It will also provide the greatest incentive to patriotism and the Coloured will continue to feel that he can make his contribution on an equal basis with the White man.</p>

<p>Finally, this Bill provides for the central administration of all educational institutions &#x2014;universities, training colleges, secondary and primary schools, vocational and special schools. I maintain that this is a far-reaching improvement on the fragmentation that we have heard so much about that exists under the provincial systems of control and even under the systems of State-aided schools. It is even an improvement&#x2014;and I say this as an educationist&#x2014;on the existing system of divided control of White education in the various provinces and under the Department of Education, Arts and Science.</p>

<p>The reasons which I am going to give for opposing this Bill are not the reasons which have been mentioned by the hon. member who has just sat down. I am going to quote some other reasons given by another hon. member on a different occasion. That hon. member at that time said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The aim of education is to make rational human beings out of children.</block>

<p>That is one good reason why I am opposed to this Bill. The other reason is this: The hon. member at that time said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Education is indivisible and international. It is a science and the only place where it is different from what I have just said is in Communist Russia and the only place where it was different was in Nazi Germany. Their education was not an objective science. It was an instrument, a subjective instrument of the authority of the State to have the school deliver certain products. (Hansard, Vol. 83, Col. 3652.)</block>

<p>The hon. member went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Bill &#x2026; is an educational Bill and should be treated as an educational Bill and it should remain under the control of those bodies which deal with education. As long as the Provincial Council are entrusted with the substantive powers of controlling education, Bantu education should also fall under their control and only when all education is taken away from the provinces can it go to the Union Education Department.</block>

<p>The hon. member who gave those very cogent reasons for leaving education under the control of the existing authorities for not dividing education, for not making education the scientific instrument for turning children out the <span class="col_1997-1998" refersTo="page_1013"/>way the State want to turn them out, was none other than the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) when he spoke in 1953 and made what I consider to be by far the best speech on the Bantu Education Bill when it was introduced in this House.</p>

<p>I agree 100 per cent with what the hon. member for Fort Beaufort said in 1953 when he was still talking as an educationist, and for those major, cogent reasons which he advanced in opposing the take-over of Bantu education from the provinces and handing over Bantu education to the Bantu Administration Department (now the Bantu Education Department) I oppose the transfer of Coloured education from the provinces to the Coloured Affairs Department. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Coloured people, the Coloured teachers or the Dutch Reformed Mission Church, which controls more Coloured schools in fact than the State, want this transfer, despite the statement made by the hon. Minister when he introduced this Bill. On the contrary, there is ample evidence that they opposed any such transfer, and they only accepted it finally because it was a <i>fait accompli.</i> As far as they are concerned they know that this transfer is going to take place. They know that despite any arguments that are advanced in this House this is going to happen, and therefore they have decided to make the best of a bad job. Thus the Synod of the Dutch Reformed Mission Church at its meeting in October last year, by a large majority, re-affirmed the decision which was taken by a previous Synod against the transfer of Coloured education to the Coloured Affairs Department. The Moderator on that occasion reiterated the unanimous view of the people with whom the matter has been discussed, and that is that the Coloured people did not support this transfer. It was made clear that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since the transfer of Coloured Education was an accomplished fact, that State machinery for it was already in motion, the Synod would approach the matter realistically and constructively in order to get the best education for the Coloured child in the circumstances.</block>

<p>That is to say, in view of the fact that they knew that it was going to be a <i>fait accompli.</i> The Teachers Educational and Professional association, which has been referred to on several occasions during this debate, also made it clear in its statement that it was opposed to the transfer as such but that it simply had to accept the transfer because they knew it was going to come about, and it stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While striving to maintain recognized standards of education, it will seek to protect the teacher&#x2019;s freedom of expression and to guard against any attempt to regiment the minds of Coloured children.</block>

<p>In this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times</i> there was a reiteration of the opposition of the T.E.P.A. to the transfer of education and they stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The T.E.P.A. has at all times opposed and still opposes the transfer of education to the Coloured Affairs Department. It is not true to say that the transfer has the support of the Coloured people or of the teachers.</block>

<p>It then goes on to quote a whole list of organizations and associations which are dead against the transfer of Coloured education. Sir, the Coloured Affairs Council was prepared to accept the transfer under certain very specific conditions and the first of those conditions was that Coloured Education should be made compulsory; also, that the school leaving age and the standard should be raised; that Coloured teachers should be paid on the same basis as White teachers; that Coloured parents should be given the right to decide on the language medium, and that parallel-medium education should be adopted in all Coloured schools. Those are the conditions which the Coloured Affairs Council laid down prior to their accepting this transfer of education. I maintain that this Bill in no way fulfils any of those conditions, nor, incidentally, does the Bill reflect the undertakings and the assurances that were actually given by officials of the Coloured Affairs Department when consultation with Coloured teachers took place&#x2014;the assurance given, for instance, by the Director of Education in the Department of Coloured Affairs who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Existing conditions of service at least would be enforced after the transfer. Present rights and privileges would be secure.</block>

<p>If we look at Clause 14 of the Bill we find that after the Bill becomes law, teachers may be transferred from any post to any other post at any other school whether or not such is a transfer to a post of a lower grade; so not even the assurance that the conditions of service at least would remain the same, is in fact being carried out in this Bill. Clause 14 (4) (a) of this Bill lays down that the teachers may be moved to non-teaching posts anywhere within the Republic or South West Africa in the service of the State.</p>

<p>Well, Sir, I have the greatest respect for Dr. van der Ross&#x2019; knowledge of Coloured education. I dare say there are very few people in this country who know more about it than Dr. van der Ross. I would be prepared to receive any assistance which he would be prepared to give me. Unfortunately no contribution has been forthcoming in this debate. I make a public announcement that all contributions will be gratefully received in future.</p>

<p>Under Clause 15 any person may be discharged from a school if, in the opinion of the Minister, his discharge will promote economy in the school in question. The Director of Coloured Education in the Coloured Affairs Department also gave another assurance. He said that present rights and privileges would be secured. He also stated that appointments would be based solely on academic merit. If a teacher was anti-C.A.D., he said that was his business. I have the quotation here if the hon. the Minister wants it. If you look under the misconduct clause, Clause 16, you will find that a teacher may not be a member of a political party, may not take any active part in party political matters, may not belong to any organization to which the Minister decides he may not belong, may not publicly criticize the administration of any department, office or institution of State. This is great freedom of action and freedom of thought on the part of the teachers! [Interjections.] I would have thought that after all the speeches I have made in this House over the past ten years it would have been obvious to the hon. member that I dislike emphatically any control of an individual from above. I dislike this interference in every single facet of one&#x2019;s life. I like individual freedom. I hope that sums up what I stand for.</p>

<p>Then we had another assurance and this time it came from the hon. the Minister. I might say that it is not a reassuring statement; it has a sinister undertone. This is what he said. When the Minister was addressing a Nationalist Party Congress at East London last year, he is reported to have said that when the education of the Coloured people was taken over by the Government, measures would be available for dealing with certain undesirable elements in the Coloured teaching profession.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister has asked me to draw my own conclusions and I wanted to tell him why I have drawn those conclusions, but I will not take that matter any further.</p>

<p>The other assurance that was given was that the syllabus would not be changed nor the examination system; it was said that these would remain under the existing authorities and that they would only be changed if those authorities decided on a change for everyone, Whites included. If you look at Clause 21 of this Bill you will find that these are matters entirely for the Minister to decide, and only until the Minister otherwise determines, will the existing authorities remain in control. So once again the Minister has taken complete power in this respect and the assurance given that existing conditions would be maintained has gone by the board if one looks at the actual wording of the Bill.</p>

<p>The Director of Education gave another specific assurance. He said that Church schools would certainly not be compelled to transfer to the Department. He said that the Department was grateful to the Churches for what they had done in the field of education&#x2014;and so they should be, Sir&#x2014;and did not want to interfere with bodies which had done such outstanding work. But Clause 5 of this Bill gives the Minister the power to transfer the management and control of any school to the Department. He need not have their agreement or their consent. He only needs to consult them. He does not have to have the consent of the governing body. The Director also told the representatives of the Married Teachers&#x2019; Association that when Coloured education was transferred to the Department of Coloured Affairs he expected provision to be made for the appointment of married women teachers for a few years. There is no such provision in this Bill. The Minister has complete power to discharge a female teacher if she marries. All I can say is that such support which has been forthcoming for this Bill &#x2014;it was support based entirely on the knowledge that the transfer of Coloured education was in fact a <i>fait accompli,</i> whether anybody accepted it or not&#x2014;and it was obtained largely under false pretences. Because the assurances given prior to the introduction of this Bill into this House have not been carried out in the language of the Bill.</p>

<p>We have other experiences which lead us to draw unhappy conclusions and one obvious and glaring experience is the experience of <span class="col_2001-2002" refersTo="page_1015"/>Bantu education. All of us know what that has done to the education of Bantu children. It has sacrificed quality for quantity.</p>

<p>I do not intend to, Sir, but I think you will agree that this is at least an analogy since Bantu education which used to fall under the ordinary Department of Education was transferred to the Bantu Education Department. The same sort of thing is happening as far as the Coloured children are concerned. The hon. Minister when introducing this Bill said that to the extent to which progress was made with the quality of socio-economic uplift&#x2014;a favourite term of the Government&#x2019;s&#x2014;&#x201C;the Coloured people would in an ever-increasing measure make a direct contribution towards their own education and towards the expenditure involved &#x201D;. The same thing happened in the case of Bantu education. In the case of Bantu education the amount was pinned at R13,000,000 per annum from State Revenue and the balance the Bantu people had to find themselves. If this is the sort of thing which the Minister envisages in view of the statement which he has made as far as the financing of Coloured education is concerned, I cannot protest strongly enough. I want to point out the basic fallacy in this statement that the Bantu and Coloured people do not pay for their own education whereas White people do. The non-White people pay taxes according to their capacity to pay and in that respect they finance their education to their best possible financial ability. It is utterly unfair that additional taxation should be levied on these people to pay for their education whereas White children are educated free. There are poor Whites to-day who also do not contribute much to the revenue of the country but nobody will expect the children of those people not to be educated on an equal basis with the children of tax-paying White citizens of this country. Nobody would expect the parents of those children, because they did not contribute to general revenue by virtue of the fact that they did not have a taxable income, to pay a special levy for the education of their children. Why should we expect the parents of non-White children to pay additional amounts towards the education of their children? It is utterly unequitable that this should be demanded of the poorest section of the community.</p>

<p>The Director did give the assurance that the Coloured people would not be taxed specifically to pay for their education. But in view of the fact that none of the other assurances which were given have been translated into this Bill, one is again entitled to draw one&#x2019;s own conclusions&#x2014;and I admit they are very ugly conclusions. In view of the Minister&#x2019;s own statement that Coloured people would be called upon to make a greater financial contribution to their own education, I think one is fully entitled to expect that the time will come that, despite the assurance given by the Director of Coloured Education, that will be implemented by this Government.</p>

<p>I want to say a word or two about the sort of syllabuses that one can expect. Again I want to start off with a statement made by the Minister when he addressed the Namaqua-land Regional Development Association in November last year. In connection with the transfer of Coloured education he stated the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I will start off by educating the Coloured people to be prepared to work. Industrial institutions will be created and tuition in elementary agriculture will eventually serve the Coloureds better than their Std. &#x00D7; Certificates with which they now roam the streets because they cannot find work.</block>

<p>I want job reservation to be removed, Sir, that is what I want. I do not want academic education to result in a frustrated human being simply because another Minister imposes job reservation which is stopping intelligent and educated people from carrying out skilled jobs by virtue of the colour of their skin. So I say, Sir, that education is indivisible; that everybody should be educated to the fullest possible capacity of his natural ability and that he should not thereafter be restrained from his complete and utmost productivity by virtue of job reservation. And that, Sir, is my reply to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>We have had similar statements made by other people when the Bantu Education Act was introduced. There was the famous statement by the hon. the Prime Minister who was then Minister of Bantu Affairs. When he introduced the Bantu Education Bill he also made that famous statement about not wanting the Bantu children to be educated above the level and the status which they could expect to occupy in later life. We are getting the same sort of statement from the Minister of Coloured Affairs in regard to the sort of status which the Coloureds must be expected to occupy later on in life. As I say, Sir. there are very good reasons for one to harbour fears about this particular Bill. The Minister has asked us to accept that this Bill is a great step forward. Well, with the best will in the world &#x2014;and I must admit that I did not start off scrutinizing this Bill with a very good will&#x2014; but with all the good will that I could possibly muster in examining this Bill, I cannot see it as the tiniest little toddle forward, let alone a great step. The provisions governing compulsory school attendance, for instance, which are supposed to be part of the bargain to the Coloured people, if they would accept this transfer, do not differ at all from the existing position under which for nearly 20 years it has been possible for provinces to make attendance of Coloured children compulsory. In fact that was never done in practice and I make bold to suggest that when this Bill becomes <span class="col_2003-2004" refersTo="page_1016"/>law, Coloured education will equally not be made compulsory. The provisions of Section 25 relating to the payment of school fees, if any, seem to me to leave the door wide open. That is a retrograde step and not a step forward at all, from the existing position of free education for Coloured children. Another retrogressive step is that the existing say which parents have through their committees over the appointment of those who will teach their children are now severely curtailed by the provisions under which the Department will be able to transfer teachers from post to post and from school to school without any consultation with those school committees.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, I want to sum up by saying that it is the policy of the party which I represent to have free compulsory education available to all children as far and as fast as financial resources will permit, in order that those children may develop to the fullest of their capacity and that all restrictions on employment on those children thereafter should be completely removed. I am completely against any splitting of administration of education in this country on the basis of race. I am against this control and the basing of education on colour lines. That is wrong. I think that the splitting of education&#x2014;the control and administration of education&#x2014;on colour lines, will lead to a dangerous sort of separate nationalism. The Government is trying to turn every Coloured child into a sort of Coloured nationalist&#x2014;I do not mean Nationalist Party supporter&#x2014;but a nationalist in the accepted meaning of that word, instead of developing the Coloured child as an ordinary South African patriot which should, of course, be the aim of this Government. For these reasons I view this whole idea of transferring Coloured education with the gravest misgivings not only because of the effect which it will have on the Coloured children themselves and the Coloured people themselves but on the whole of South Africa. I shall vote against the Bill.</p>

<p>In so far as our large Coloured population is concerned, we now have a totally new set-up. A dispensation which will ensure a greater and a richer future for the Coloured community. It is this Minister and this Government and this Department who are in the first place responsible for this new dispensation&#x2014;this new future pattern towards which our large Coloured community is developing. Viewed against this background, the standpoints we have had from the Opposition&#x2014;I leave the hon. member who has just resumed her seat aside for a moment; she really stands alone; she is quite a likeable member and she is at least honest in her standpoint in so far as the Coloureds are concerned, although her standpoint is a dangerous one&#x2014;are really not important any more in the present dispensation. I say so for two reasons. This is not a statement I just take out of the air. The first reason is that the ignominious past of the United Party in the days when they governed this country and also thereafter <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> our Coloured population will always stand on record against them. It is an ignominious past. The interest of that party in the Coloured population then only came to the fore during elections. That was the time when hon. members of the Opposition also crept into hovels and slums to catch the Coloured vote and to use it against their White opponents. That was where their interest ended. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) laughs, but from time to time during elections and also during by-elections he picked up lice whilst searching for Coloured votes.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I have already withdrawn it. The fact is that the interest displayed by those people in the Coloureds ended there. They showed interest only periodically during elections, and thereafter the weal and woe of our large Coloured population did not matter to those people. I say it is the ignominious past of that party which renders the arguments they advance in this debate really worthless.</p>

<p>In regard to the future also, the United Party's outlook is equally sterile, because that party wants to keep the Coloured in a shadowy and equivocal position on the edge of the White community. It does not visualize any rights for the Coloured; it does not visualize for the Coloured his own inalienable residential areas; it does not grant the Coloured his own mouthpieces; it does not grant him his own local Government, or his own education system. On the one hand this ignominious past of that party in respect of the Coloured, and on the other hand this sterile conception of the future of the Coloured renders the arguments advanced by that Party to-day really worthless. If there is a party which is really obsolete to-day in South African politics in regard to its Coloured policy, it is the United Party, the official Opposition.</p>

<p>The arguments in regard to the transfer of Coloured education deal with two aspects. The one was very thoroughly expounded last night by the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;), namely the financial aspect. This financial aspect was of particularly great importance until 1957; it was of decisive importance. The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden), the other evening painted a very clear picture of the period up to 1957. He told us how voices were raised, particularly in the Cape Province, asking for a new pattern for the Coloureds. The argument has been advanced that the hon. the Minister has in mind only the financial aspect in regard to <span class="col_2005-2006" refersTo="page_1017"/>this transfer. That is not so. The hon. the Minister has never said that the financial aspect is the most important aspect of this whole matter. I will concede that judged from the narrow financial aspect one would be able to argue that if the Government now has to grant the funds, what difference will it really make how they are given? It has to be paid for; the Coloureds must be educated. If the Government were to subsidize everything through the Treasury or spend the money directly through the Department of Coloured Affairs, what difference would it make? But the matter is not as simple as that.</p>

<p>This brings me to my really important argument, next to the financial aspect which in my opinion at this stage is not necessarily the most weighty argument in regard to this transfer. As I said in the beginning, in regard to our Coloured population, we are standing on the eve of a completely new dispensation. I do not think even any hon. member of the Opposition, or any Coloured Representative, will deny it if I say that the last few years will one day be characterized as one of the most important periods in the development of our Coloured people. Just look at the legislation passed during recent weeks; look at the legislation introduced by the hon. the Minister, the Development Corporation, the Coloured Rural, Areas Bill, and take the Provincial Council which sat last week and passed an ordinance to grant local Government to Coloureds, and take the other legislation which will still be passed this Session. All this indicates that in so far as the Coloureds are concerned, we are moving towards a totally new dispensation. I say that the last few years, particularly under this Minister and his Department, will one day be regarded as historical in the development of our Coloured people. to-day, at a totally pew tempo and in a dynamic forward movement, numerous bodies are shaping the future of our Coloured people. In the Coloured townships which are being established and in the Coloured communities we already see in every respect the fruit which is being plucked as the result of this new dispensation which is leading the large Coloured community to a greater future.</p>

<p>I say that it is this new set-up which demands of us now that we should also use this mighty weapon of education to take our Coloureds further along this road.</p>

<p>The fact is that we are dealing here with a mainly under-developed community, a community with its own problems. I just want to mention two of them in passing. The first is the question of the tremendous increase in our Coloured population. This situation results in the fact that 45 per cent of what we devote to-day in the socio-economic sphere to the upliftment of the Coloured community is absorbed by their increasing numbers instead of being enjoyed in the form of a higher standard of living. This is a deep human problem, and it is a problem for which a solution will not easily be found. You see what is taking place in the Eastern countries. Take a country like Japan. We recently saw the reports of the Chairman of the World Bank in which he referred to the assistance given by the developed countries to the undeveloped countries and points to this problem. It is a problem which is unique to our Coloured population at this stage. It is a problem which we can only tackle if we are prepared to take in hand the education of our Coloured with more purposefulness and greater adaptation, as well as to apply it with greater differentiation.</p>

<p>There is the other problem I want to mention, namely that the Coloured communities from place to place have their own troubles, and that is clearly reflected in their examination results. Just in passing I want to deal with the results for the past ten or 12 years in regard to Coloured children I refer to the results of the Senior Certificate examination. In 1950 258 candidates sat for the Senior Certificate; only 4 per cent passed in the first class, 55 per cent in the second class and 41 per cent failed. After we had done everything we could in the way of granting educational facilities, such as increased salaries, we had the position at the end of 1950 that 41 per cent failed. In 1951 4 per cent passed in the first class, 49 per cent in the second class, and 48 per cent failed. In 1952 .5 per cent passed in the first class, 49 per cent in the second class and 50.5 per cent failed. In 1953 4 per cent passed in the first class, 56 per cent in the second class and 40 per cent failed. In 1954 42 per cent failed, in 1955 43 per cent, in 1956 43 per cent, in 1957 42 per cent, in 1955 45 per cent, in 1959 39 per cent, in 1960 37 per cent, and in 1961 45.3 per cent, and in 1962 52 per cent failed. I do not want to weary the House with further figures, but if we compare it with the figures for the last few years in regard to the Whites we see that in the year 1960 6,210 White candidates wrote their Senior Certificate examination. I am talking now of the Cape Province only. That is approximately seven times the number of Coloured candidates in the same year. Of the Whites, 15.2 per cent failed, whereas in the case of the Coloureds 38.3 per cent failed. In 1961 6,920 White candidates sat and 14.8 per cent failed, as against 962 Coloured candidates of whom 45.3 per cent failed.</p>

<p>If we look at other standards, we find, for example, that in regard to the Junior Certificate in 1960 there were 13 per cent of failures amongst the Whites, and amongst the Coloureds there were 36 per cent of failures; in 1961, amongst the Whites, it was 14 per cent, as against 38 per cent for the Coloureds. Where can one find a better indication or a stronger argument that there should be more purposefulness and greater differentiation, and that the Coloureds have certain problems which we will have to bear in mind? Therefore we will have to differentiate to a greater extent in the education of the Coloureds. Otherwise the results will remain the same as those I have just given.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>No, if one analyses the position further, one finds that there were certain schools (I do not wish to mention the names) where there were up to 62.2 per cent of failures in the Senior Certificate examination. that is a clear indication that we are still dealing here with problems which we will have to face, and we shall have to adapt education to it to lend greater force to this mighty medium which we can take in hand in respect of this almost under-developed group, the Coloureds.</p>

<p>To this I want to add the following argument: It has been said that we should retain the provincial authorities as administrative bodies because they have the knowledge and the experience. One has respect for the pioneering work done by the Provincial Administrations, but the fact remains that we are faced here with the position that we practically have two channels under one administration, or one body, viz. the provincial bodies, education which has to be given in one direction to a highly developed White community, as compared with the education which has to be given to an under-developed community. Now it is a fact that we all want to have better race relations in the country. But what is happening now? These two channels of education are constantly being compared&#x2014;that of the Whites as against that of the Coloureds. This has just one result, viz. greater racial friction because comparisons are made from time to time. It is further said that the Provincial Administrations have all the facilities and all the knowhow. As I say, no one wants to insult the Provincial Administrations, but I want to say that one can talk all day about the specific problems of this under-developed Coloured group, and the question then arises which body is the best able to judge of the problems and the difficulties of the Coloureds. I maintain it is the Department of Coloured Affairs. That Department has in recent years won the confidence of the Coloureds in a fantastic way. The Coloureds to-day trust that Department, and where can one find a better body to guide Coloured education and to advance it than the Department of Coloured Affairs?</p>

<p>Another argument advanced here was in respect of consultation. The impression was created that this Government is just haphazardly forcing the poor Coloureds into a certain course. It was said that not enough attention was given to the teachers&#x2019; associations. If we look at the pattern which was followed to get co-operation and to give information to the large Coloured community, then I want to say that we can only take off our hats to the officials concerned and to the Department for what has been achieved in this direction. I have here a list of what was done to contact these people, to put this whole matter of transfer to the people. The interest evinced by the Coloureds was remarkable. I refer to a town like Malmesbury, where 150 teachers were present at a conference. I am mentioning round figures only. At Stellenbosch there were 200, Paarl 300, Caledon 120, Vredendal 200, Clanwilliam 190, Riversdale 300, George 400, East London 120, Beaufort West 300, Calvinia 150, Springbok 250, Upington 220, De Aar 190, just to mention a few. What willingness existed on the part of the Department in making contact with these people! If we analyse the picture further and look at the six areas in which these people met and the results which were achieved, we find that in the Cape Peninsula 2,285 of the 3,100 teachers attended the conferences. In the Boland, out of the 1,800 teachers no fewer than 1,500 attended, and in the whole of the rest of the Cape Province there are approximately 4,100 teachers, of whom 2,410 travelled long distances to attend these conferences. In the Free State 135 out of 155 teachers attended the conferences. The only province in which the reaction was weak was in Natal, probably as the result of the bad influence of the hon. member for South Coast, and there out of 489 Coloured teachers only 35 attended the meetings. In the Transvaal 460 out of the 1,086 teachers attended. If we take the picture in the Cape we see that of the 9,000 teachers 6,195 attended these meetings. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister consulted any teachers&#x2019; associations, but viewed in the light of this picture, would it have made any difference? Here we have a wonderful picture of the interest taken where the Department took the initiative in meeting these people.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by making two statements. The one is that the Minister in his speech thanked the various Provincial Administrations for what they had done over the years, for the pioneering work they had done in the sphere of Coloured education. But I want to put it more widely, and in the first place I also want to pay tribute to the large corps of White taxpayers who throughout the years accepted that great responsibility in regard to Coloured education in this province. I think it is a splendid thing, something which came from the White people and which they did for the large Coloured population in this province, so much so that in many cases the education of their own children had to suffer because of what they were prepared to give to the large Coloured population. Even in these times we still find that many of our White children attend school in prefabricated buildings, whilst in the new Coloured communities permanent buildings are being erected. What a picture of what the Whites were prepared to do for Coloured education by way of paying extra taxation! I think it is a pity, from the point of view of good race relations, that we have the position that in recent years there has not been greater recognition by Coloured leaders and Coloured teachers for what the White man was prepared to do for the Coloured in this respect.</p>

<p>The last aspect I would just like to touch on is the subject of the new facilities which are now being given to the Coloureds under this new dispensation. In this regard I want to <span class="col_2009-2010" refersTo="page_1019"/>suggest to the hon. the Minister that we should not be too hasty. It is good for the human spirit to have to adapt, for it to learn to adapt itself, and sometimes to be tempered by difficult circumstances. I am one of the youngest members of this House and it seems only the other day that I was still at school, and every day I had to walk three miles to school, and three miles back in the afternoon, and very often there was no water to drink at the school on the farm. But I maintain that was a good thing. As far as the educational facilities of the Whites are concerned, we also had to start in a small way and develop to the position in which we are to-day. Whereas in the future the financial aspect here will disappear and whereas we are nor embarking upon a new dispensation, I nevertheless want to ask the Minister, as far as the provision of educational facilities for these people is concerned, that they should not be given everything at once, that we should not allow them suddenly to find themselves in a new elysium, but that we should have due regard for the above factors.</p>

<p>When we have done all that, then as I said at the beginning of my speech, a completely new dispensation awaits the Coloured people, and I want to conclude with a quotation from the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Coloured Education, to which reference has also been made in the interim report, namely these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Education should create for the child opportunities by means of which his whole being is so nurtured that he will grow up into a person who attaches the greatest value to some ideal in life and who will strive towards those things in life which contribute towards his own happiness as a responsible, useful and honourable person who will be prepared, according to his ability, to play his part in serving the community of which he is a member, who will find pleasure in promoting the well-being of his fellow-man, particularly that of his own racial group.</block>

<p>If these are our ideals and if we have the cooperation of the great education corps of the Coloured people towards attaining these ideals, towards this vision as far as the future of the Coloured people are concerned, then I believe there is an even greater future awaiting them.</p>

<p>Nobody has illustrated the difference between the two sides of the House in regard to White-Brown relations better than the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. In 1943 I was a candidate for the House of Assembly in the constituency now represented by that hon. member. At that time the Coloureds were still on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. I was prepared to advance their interests also; I was prepared to represent them also, and it was an honour for me to have enjoyed the confidence of those people and that they voted for me. But what is the outlook of the hon. member who to-day is the hon. member for Moorreesburg now? His outlook was that the man who went out to get Coloured votes went to pick up lice. That is the great difference in outlook between the two sides, and let me tell that young member that as long as that is his outlook, which he reveals repeatedly, and as long as that is the spirit of members on the Government side, all their talk about a new dispensation will not help and we cannot take them seriously.</p>

<p>It is obvious that I am not going to try to talk as an educationist here. Just like the hon. the Minister, I am talking as a political representative, and I apologize to nobody for that, because in its origin this Bill really has little to do with education and everything to do with political ideology and the relationship between White and Brown. The hon. the Minister and the speaker who followed him based their support for this Bill on four arguments, as I summed it up. The first is that Coloured education is a burden on the Cape Province which financially it cannot continue to bear. The second argument is that those who are interested in it were properly consulted. The third argument is that the measure grants benefits to the Coloureds and is in their interest, and the fourth argument is that the Government party was always in favour of it and that this is a further essential step in implementing the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid.</p>

<p>The task of the Opposition is consequently simple. It must decide for itself to what extent these arguments justify the Bill, and on that basis it must determine its attitude towards the Bill. Now, of all the arguments advanced by the Minister I think the first one, viz. that it is an intolerable burden on the Cape Province, is the weakest; and therefore I am surprised and disappointed that the hon. the Minister made this his main argument, as it were. He quoted, <i>inter alia,</i> with approval from the report of the Schumann Commission. Now I do not know whether he noticed that the two quotations he used were in conflict with each other. He quoted from page 91 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It goes without saying that if Coloured education does not remain the responsibility of the Cape Provincial Administration, the financial burden on the province will be eased considerably.</block>

<p>It will be eased &#x201C;considerably &#x201D;. Then he quoted from page 89&#x2014;</p>

<p>Very well, I accept that. In any case, I had not intended making a debating point of it. I use it just to indicate that the argument of its being a financial burden weighed so heavily with the Minister that he even relied on the Schumann Commission for assistance. What surprises me is that the Minister used this argument at all. Surely it is obvious that if one takes a service, of whatever nature, away from a province it reduces the expenditure of that province to some extent. But that does not apply to Coloured education only; it applies to everything, also for White education, hospitalization, roads and divisional councils. So what sort of argument is this now really? If Coloured education is to be taken away from the province because it is a financial burden on the province, must White education not be taken away also because it is an even greater burden? And must the Government then not be consistent and carry on until nothing remains of the whole idea of provincial government? The first argument advanced by the hon. the Minister is therefore one which should not be brought into the picture at all, for the simple reason that it applies to everything which falls under the provincial administrations. If the Cape Province as a province finds it difficult to finance its services on the existing basis, the solution is obvious: Then a more effective basis of subsidy by the Central Government must be found (which I think is the answer), or it must increase its taxation, or else it must simply curtail all its services and not make a scapegoat of one particular service and just try to blame that one only.</p>

<p>When once the Cape Province accepts the principle that for financial reasons it must hand over its services and powers to the Central Government, the provincial government as such becomes a farce and it becomes time to review the whole provincial system.</p>

<p>But let me say that there is a deeper reason why I as a White man felt disappointed because the Minister advanced this argument in the way he did. Was it really necessary again to drag in colour antipathy here? Why should Coloured education be singled out and be stigmatized as a financial burden? Why only Coloured education? Why is hospitalization not treated in that way? Why not roads? Why not the education of the Whites? Why must Coloured education be singled out and be stigmatized as a burden? The whole argument is unfortunate and unnecessary, and for that reason the Synod of the N.G. Mission Church totally rejected this particular argument in 1958. It hurts the Coloureds, it makes a painful impression on them, the more so because it is always accompanied by the reproach, which was again made by the hon. member for Moorreesburg, &#x201C;that the White man has to carry the Coloured&#x201D;, This statement that the White man carries the Coloured is based on the fact that it so happens that the Whites as a group pay more in taxation than the Coloureds as a group. But do you know how the Coloureds react to that? They say that this is a completely misleading argument. The Coloured admits that as a group he is poorer than the White man and that in this respect he occupies an inferior position to the White man, but he blames the White man for it! He points out that the White man managed to get all the political power into his hands and kept the Coloured away from all effective influence and participation in the political machinery of the country, and that one Government after another used that political power in such a way that for generations already there has been compulsory education for the White child but not for the non-White child, and that therefore the Whites as a group could advance, but not the Coloureds as a group; that the Public Service is reserved for the White child, but closed to the Coloured child, and that he therefore never had the opportunities that the White child had and still has; that in the services of the State in general <b>the</b> Coloureds have had no opportunities, and that the Coloured teacher, e.g. receives a considerably smaller salary than the White teacher, even though he has the same qualifications and has the same work.</p>

<p>Do you agree with that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Those are facts. And what conclusions does the Coloured draw now? He says that as the result of the unequal opportunities enforced on him, and still being enforced, his standard of living, his growth as a community and his capacity to earn and therefore to pay taxes have been artificially restricted, and that the White man derives the benefit from it. And his further conclusion is that it is therefore not the White man who carries him, but really he who, at least to a large extent, carries the White man and subsidizes the prosperity of the Whites.</p>

<p>I do not want to base my own arguments in regard to this Bill on this conclusion, but what I want to object to is the spirit and the outlook revealed here, which marks Coloured education as a burden on the province, and the reproachful way in which it is said that the Whites have to carry the Coloureds. Apart from the fact that this is a faulty proposition, I think it is in bad taste continually to remind people, and in fact to reproach them with the fact, that they belong to the poorer classes. Nobody does that in respect of the poorer sections of the Whites; and this argument that we carry the Coloureds gives rise on the part of the Coloureds to the most bitter reproaches and ill feeling against the White man because he feels that the White man should really bear much of the responsibility for the conditions in which he finds himself. Therefore <b>I</b> want to ask that <b>we</b> should get away from this attitude as soon <span class="col_2013-2014" refersTo="page_1021"/>as possible, and the hon. the Minister ought to give the lead to his side in this respect. A year or two ago he held a meeting at Sea Point and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is true that we should not talk about the Coloured as a problem. If we talk about him in that way, then he has the right also to call the Whites a problem. (The <i>Burger, 2</i> September 1961).</block>

<p>There the Minister sounded a good note, and the same applies in respect of Coloured education, that we should not stigmatize it as a burden to the province or to the White man.</p>

<p>We therefore totally reject the Government&#x2019;s first reason for this Bill, viz. that Coloured education only should be selected and stigmatized as a burden on the provinces which they cannot bear, and that for this reason the provinces should transfer to the Central Government the governmental powers they have.</p>

<p>The second proposition relied on by the Government side is that the Government had the broadest consultation possible with the Coloured teachers in every part of the country. For years this side of the House has been pleading that before legislation is introduced affecting the interests of any Coloured group which is not represented here, or which is only indirectly represented here, it should be preceded by the greatest possible measure of consultation for those people, firstly in regard to the desirability of the measure and then in regard to the details of the step envisaged. Now the hon. the Minister in this case has moved in that direction, and I think he should be given credit for having gone so far, perhaps as far as it was possible for him to go, in his consultation in respect of certain details with regard to this measure. I just want to add that I think he should congratulate himself on the fact that in performing this task he had services at his disposal of a man like Mr. Kobus Louw, who is an excellent negotiator. In fact, I should like to say that the Department of Coloured Affairs, under the leadership of Dr. I. D. du Plessis, has a number of senior officials who have succeeded wonderfully, in spite of the destructive effect the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid has day after day on the relations between the White man and the Coloured in keeping alive the hope that sometime in the future ordinary civilized and human relations will be established between White and Brown in South Africa. Mr. Louw is one of these men, and I want to tell the Minister that I do not think he could have made a better choice to fill the post of Director of Coloured Education than him.</p>

<p>But there is one overriding reason why the consultation the Minister and his Department had with the Coloured teachers cannot serve as a recommendation for the acceptance of this Bill, and that is that the consultation did not cover the point which it should really in the first place have covered. It did not cover the principle of this Bill; it did not cover the desirability for the transfer. After the Nationalist Party majority in the Provincial Council of the Cape Province decided in 1957 as a matter of policy that Coloured education should be transferred to the Central Government, it was obviously just a question of time and organization before this step would be taken, and the result was&#x2014;in the consultations with the Coloured teachers, the teachers knew all the time that they were faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> and that their opinion was merely being asked in connection with the supplementary details and general circumstances. In fact, the Minister himself in his speech pointed out that already during last year&#x2019;s parliamentary session he officially announced that Coloured education would be taken over, and as he himself explained in his speech, the main conference of Coloured teachers took place only between that time and 14 December last year. The Director of Coloured Education, Mr. Kobus Louw, according to the report of this final two-day conference which was held in Bellville, which was published in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 2 October 1962, told the meeting of teachers&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are facing the inevitable. It has already been decided that Coloured education is to be transferred. Now it is the duty of every teacher he gives us the benefit of his experience and ideas.</block>

<p>His consultation therefore was not in regard to the desirability of this Bill and its principle, and therefore it cannot be used as an argument in favour of the second reading. The Minister himself was also quite honest in regard to the matter. Nowhere in his speech did he even pretend that the Coloured community as a group approved the principle of transfer, or that they were keen to have it. Therefore the argument in regard to consultation falls away, because the consultation was not in regard to the question which is the main principle on which we have to decide here.</p>

<p>The third argument of hon. members opposite is that transfer creates new opportunities for the Coloureds and is therefore to their best interests. Undoubtedly Coloured education is in the position that certain changes have to be made, which changes must necessarily be improvements. My own attitude has always been that the Coloureds in general have the same desire to go forward in life as any other normal person, but that they lack the opportunities, and that it is our duty as the group which is at the head of affairs, in our own interest and his, to grant him all the opportunities we claim for ourselves as White people. If this was not done 20 or 30 years ago, it was due to neglect, and it does not matter which Government was in power then; although the simple explanation is that times have changed radically, not only in respect of race and colour, but also in respect of the State&#x2019;s social responsibilities. We are simply living in different times. But I cannot support the contention that the transfer of Coloured education to the Central Government is an <span class="col_2015-2016" refersTo="page_1022"/>essential prerequisite for the creation of such new opportunities and for the improvement of his education. I repeat that new opportunities have to be created for the Coloureds, but there is no reason why new opportunities are only possible when coupled with the transfer of his education to the Central Government. They can be created if the will is there, and if the intention honestly is only to create new opportunities. If that is the honest intention, it can be done without transfer.</p>

<p>But whatever we here think about the matter, our outlook is that of Whites, and I think the real test as to whether this Bill is in the interest of the Coloureds is what the Coloureds themselves think of it. None of us can judge the matter as well as the Coloured can himself. Now what is the evidence before us about how the Coloured himself feels about this transfer? In the first place, we have it that the hon. the Minister himself, after all the consultation he and his Department had, did not in the least pretend that the Coloured himself was in favour of the transfer, and that by itself is an indication of how the wind is blowing amongst the Coloureds. I want to say this in passing: I am glad the Minister did not come along with that musty old argument that it is due to agitators that the Coloureds are not enthusiastic about this Bill. We are all agitators in some or other respect&#x2026;.</p>

<p>I do agitate for the things I strongly believe in. Any man who strongly advocates a matter is an agitator in that sense. But the agitator attains little success if he does not interpret the deeper feelings of the masses from which he comes. In the second place, there is no available evidence that the Coloureds as a group voluntarily asked for this transfer. We know the Coloureds. They are very quick to promote their own interests and to ask for what they think is due to them. If they think something is in their interest, they ask for it, and if they really thought that the transfer of their education was in their interest they would of their own volition have asked for it years ago already.</p>

<p>But in the third place there is enough positive evidence that they are opposed to it. Listen to this, for example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Missionary Synod of the N.G. Church of South Africa last night by an overwhelming majority decided to reaffirm its policy of the past in regard to the transfer of Coloured education &#x2026; The Synod of 1958 decided against the transfer of Coloured education from the Provincial Administration to the Central Government.</block>

<p>This was reported in the <i>Burger</i> of 25 October 1962. Who is in closer touch with the inner feeling of the Coloured community than the church? But church opposition went much further than this. I read the following from the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 27 March 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Eight churches in opposition to education move: A Coloured Education Consultative Council formed in Cape Town and composed of eight churches has opposed the taking over of Coloured education by the Government. The churches represented are: The Church of the Province, the Dutch Reformed Mission Church of the Cape, and the Methodist, Moravian, Roman Catholic, Congregational, Lutheran and African Methodist Episcopal Churches.</block>

<p>I have no doubt that the Moslems feel the same about it, because apartheid is in direct conflict with their faith. I can give numerous further quotations to show how prominent Coloured leaders and teachers spoke against it. Where people did promise their co-operation, they did so on the basis that they were faced with <i>au fait accompli</i> and only certain details would still be discussed. And they have already learnt that when once the Government is busy with party politics, the wishes and feelings of those for whom it legislates are simply pushed aside. It sits in an elevated position and knows what is good for all the people under it! Even the Union Council for Coloured Affairs, the majority of the members of which were appointed by the Government, evaded the crucial point and adopted a conditional resolution without approving the principle of transfer. And what were their conditions? It was that they wanted the immediate implementation of compulsory education for Coloured children from six to 16 years, or until they have passed the Junior Certificate; that Coloured parents should have the right to decide on the language medium, and that the salaries should be the same as those of White teachers.</p>

<p>Judging from the reports of the deliberations of the Coloured Council, they also regarded transfer as <i>au fait accompli</i> and then tried to negotiate the best possible conditions.</p>

<p>As I understood the Minister&#x2019;s speech, he did not give a decision on any of these matters and a reassurance to the Coloureds. Therefore on the basis of all the evidence we can come to no other conclusion than this, that, however good the intentions of the Minister might be, the Coloureds as a group, and certainly the majority of them, are not well disposed towards this measure. If the Coloureds themselves then do not want the transfer, nor accept that it is in their interests, how can we be expected to accept it?</p>

<p>Therefore there remains only the fourth argument of the Government members, and that is a political one, viz. that the transfer is a further step in the Government&#x2019;s policy of separatism, of segregation, of the greatest measure of separation from top to bottom, but not below the level where the Coloured is allowed to work for the Whites. Viewed from the Government&#x2019;s angle, this is the only real reason for this measure. It is in line with its policy and with its conception of a shadow state within a state, whatever that might mean. But that being so, this reason, which is the main reason given by hon. members opposite, <span class="col_2017-2018" refersTo="page_1023"/>in fact becomes the main reason why the Opposition must oppose the measure.</p>

<p>When it comes to minor details in the Bill, the Opposition is on different terrain. But here, in the initial stage, it must oppose the Bill. We on this side follow a policy of closer association with the Coloureds, a policy of building up contacts as far as possible. The Government, on the other hand, believes in ever-decreasing association and the breaking down of existing contacts. That is the basis of the difference between us. The hon. the Minister likes to talk about &#x201C;good neighbourliness&#x201D; with strong fences, but that is a misleading description. A good neighbour does not erect notices prohibiting his neighbour from entering his front gate. I think we stand much nearer to the concept of &#x201C;the partnership of White and Coloured&#x201D;, as the <i>Burger</i> put it in a leading article on 13 December 1961 on the basis of the view it expressed in a leading article on 30 November 1959 that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Afrikaner realizes that the Coloured population culturally is linked to him &#x2026; obviously a policy should be followed which will draw the Coloured nearer to the White man in South Africa.</block>

<p>In regard to this Bill, we therefore have a fundamental contrast between the two parties. The Government believes in legally enforced apartheid in everything. We reject it. We also reject enforced integration, because the one is as unnatural as the other. We stand for the ordinary, natural human relations between White and Coloured, and the recognition of each other&#x2019;s full human dignity. And we believe that only when we recognize each other&#x2019;s full human dignity&#x2014;which can only take place when we have removed the humiliating basis of enforced apartheid&#x2014;and when on that basis we have created normal human relations, will the tensions and the suspicion disappear and the White man and the Coloured man, as man to man and as group to group, be able to decide how matters should be regulated administratively in order to promote to the fullest extent the welfare of both groups.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that the Government will use its majority in this House to force through this measure. In so far as the Minister&#x2019;s good intentions are concerned, I do not doubt them. He has already made great improvements, but he is part of a machine and must act accordingly. Therefore I would like to bring this to the notice of the Minister: In his attempt to make this transfer acceptable to the Coloureds, he has raised high expectations on their part. Recently the Government, owing to pressure both internally and externally, has started to adopt the slogan of &#x201C;separate but equal&#x201D;, and of &#x201C;in your sphere you can have everything that I have in my sphere &#x201D;. That aroused great expectations on the part of the Coloureds, particularly when this Bill was submitted to them during the consultations. In particular the pamphlet issued by the Department of Information saying that transfer opens the way to improvements like compulsory education, transfer leads to positive results because the salary scales of teachers will be increased, and that parents will have a say in regard to the education of their children, created very high expectations on the part of the Coloureds. The two chief expectations created are compulsory education for Coloured children and the same pay for the same qualifications as White teachers. These things were also greatly stressed by the Union Coloured Council. I believe that the first obligation we have in South Africa towards ourselves is to educate everybody as fast as possible, so that whatever happens to the history of South Africa our standards of civilization will be retained. to-day there is no single reason why the Government cannot grant these requests.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by telling the Coloured community this: We know that the Coloured is in a serious dilemma. As things are administered to-day, there is continual pressure on him to accept apartheid as the price for material concessions. Our advice to him is to distinguish between principles and a practice which may be changed. We think that he should grasp every weapon possible and use every channel of expression available materially to improve his position and politically to state and to promote his cause, whatever might have been the motives for the provision of such weapons or channels. He can do that without abandoning his principles. Every nation experiences times of difficulty and obstacles. The Coloureds at the moment are passing through such a stage. But there is clearly a revolution taking place in the mind of the White man in regard to the position of the Coloured as a citizen in his own country. This revolution has already received significant support from the Government side, even though it is still largely a revolution of individuals. But on this side of the House, which represents 50 per cent of the White voters, that revolution has already completed the full cycle and the Opposition will do everything in its power and keep on fighting so that the Coloured will be given his freedom as a citizen in his own country, whose human dignity will be recognized by the State to the same extent as that of the White man.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned I was replying to the speech of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). I do not propose to go through the whole of his speech, but there are nevertheless a few statements made by him to which I want to draw attention. He began by saying that he rejected the argument that the Cape Province could no longer afford the expenditure on Coloured education. I want to remind him again of the fact that the Cape Province is responsible for 86 per cent of the total Coloured population of the Republic. They are accommodated in 90 per cent of the schools and served by 80 per cent of the teachers. The Central Government pays a little more than half of the cost. The rest comes out of provincial taxation which in this province is higher than in any other province in the whole of the Republic. The hon. member admits that the Coloureds do not contribute much to the education of their children, and I contend therefore that Coloured education should be a national service and not a provincial service. He compares the service with a purely provincial service such as provincial roads, because amongst other things he asks why we do not also transfer the cost of provincial roads to the Central Government. Does he ask that because of ignorance or wilfullnes or both? I want to ask the hon. member to do his homework; then he will see himself how ridiculous this comparison is. If he cannot qualify as an educationist, and if we doubt his status as a politician, he is always still a good businessman. I want to remind the House of the fact that just recently he exchanged his party consisting of two members for two parliamentary seats from the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, I call that good business.</p>

<p>His second submission was that the Government was simply extending its apartheid policy further. He then went on to compare the Government&#x2019;s policy with that of the Opposition and he stated that the Opposition rejected statutory apartheid and also compulsory integration. That is precisely the position. Their policy is a sort of qualified integration <i>cum</i> segregation, segregation for the time being in order to retain the White man&#x2019;s vote, but then they hold out the prospect of integration for their liberal followers, both White and non-White, until they come into power and thereafter they will be marching to Little Rock, to compulsory school integration. I am just wondering whether the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) will be marching with them or whether there will be a &#x201C;Natal stand&#x201D; once again.</p>

<speech by="#stander">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>This is a second-reading debate&#x2014;or is the hon. member not aware of that? The United Party policy reminds me of what Shakespeare said about his unfaithful sweetheart&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One foot in heaven and one foot in hell, To one thing constant never.</block>

<p>He then goes on to explain to her what I also want to explain to the United Party and that is that they too will land with both feet in the warm place along that road.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that it surprises anybody to find that the United Party opposes this legislation. They have consistently done that whenever we have sought to implement the policy of parallel development and in this respect they have a long list of sins. I want to mention a few: Their opposition to separate voters&#x2019; rolls and the separate representation of Coloureds in this House; their opposition to a Coloured Council; their opposition to local government in Coloured towns and Coloured areas; their opposition to the establishment of the Cape Western University College and to the taking over of vocational, technical, commercial and special schools by the Department for Coloured Affairs. Why then should they not also oppose this Bill?</p>

<p>I was waiting to see whether one of them would have the courage to stand up and say, &#x201C;We, the United Party, are opposed to this <span class="col_2021-2022" refersTo="page_1025"/>Bill because we believe in integration, in the total integration of the Coloureds. We have fought for economic integration and we are now fighting for political integration, and if this eventually results in social and even biological assimilation, we will also accept it. We regard school integration as an essential part of our policy, and that is why we oppose this Bill.&#x201D; Such a confession would at least have been honest, and that is what I expected from the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), but I do not expect it from the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) because he is too much of a politician. No, they are out to create dissatisfaction in the minds of the Whites with a view to future elections, and as far as the Coloureds are concerned this must lead to disobedience and opposition to the law.</p>

<p>Let us look at the amendment which has been moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow. He began by saying that we were restricting the power of the provinces and lowering the status of the Education Departments. But does the hon. member want to tell me that he is prepared to sacrifice the educational interests of the Coloureds to the so-called status and the powers of the Provincial Administrations? It is a favourite theme of his Leader&#x2019;s that the National Party Government is inclined to make the interests of individuals subservient to the interests of the State. Now he comes along and he wants to make the educational interests of 1,5000,000 people subservient to the status of the provinces. Surely he cannot be serious.</p>

<p>A third objection is that this will entail unnecessary expense and duplication of administration. To my mind it is an open question as to whether there will really be such a big increase in costs, but if there is, what about it? You will then simply be paying a highter price for a better article. Our object is to make the education of the Coloured more efficient and more useful to him. He says that this will lead to further alienation between the Whites and the Coloureds. I have never known the meting out of justice to result in opposition and alienation; on the contrary, it leads to co-operation and gratitude.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member again comes along with the story&#x2014;I am sorry that he did so&#x2014; that we are afraid of the educated Coloured and that we are now going to lower the standard of education for Coloured persons.</p>

<p>When did I say that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#stander">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>We heard the same argument when the non-White colleges were established and when Bantu education was taken over. At that time that cry was strenuously supported, amongst others by the Black Sash which accused us of wishing to establish &#x201C;colleges in the bush&#x201D; and &#x201C;Education for Slavery &#x201D;. The initial success of these institutions has been such that it refutes those accusations. I shall come back to this later on.</p>

<p>The Opposition admit that Coloured education under the control of the provinces is everything but satisfactory, but they say that all that is needed is more money; that the Administrations should simply be given bigger allowances and then everything in the garden will be rosy, money buys everything. I wish the position were as simple as that. But I want to say in parenthesis that the National Party Government has not done so badly in comparison with the United Party as far as contributions to Coloured education are concerned. Here I have a few figures. In 1925-6 the cost per Coloured pupil was R8 per annum. In 1947-8 it was R26. That was the year in which the National Party took over. Seven years later, in 1954-5 it rose to R44, and in 1962-3 it rose to R66. The argument that Coloured education has been starved is one which does not hold water. The question is whether the solution will be to give more money to the province. My reply is &#x201C;No&#x201D; and I say that for the following reasons: Under the provinces there will still always be divided control; there will be five Departments of Education, each with its own policy, and a situation similar to that which exists to-day in the case of White education. Hon. members will recall how we had to struggle in this House last year to establish an Advisory Council to undo some of the harm caused by this divided control. Under the provinces the curriculum for Coloured schools will still be an appendage of the curriculum for Whites. All educationists are agreed that a curriculum should do the following things: Firstly, it should be adapted to the socio-economic requirements of the pupil; secondly it should make provision for vocational, commercial and technical training, and in the third place it should make provision for academic training which leads to education at university level. Because of the fact that education forms one integrated whole, these requirements can only be complied with effectively if education is placed under one and the same control, and that is precisely what this Bill has in view. As the result of the taking over of all other Coloured education&#x2014;vocational, technical and commercial education and university institutions&#x2014;we have now reached the same position in the case of Coloured education that we have in the case of White education, and that is that primary and secondary education falls under the provinces and technical and higher education under the Department of Coloured Affairs. What the United Party is now asking is that as in the case of White education we should leave this divided control undisturbed, not because it is educationally sound but for the sake of the status of the provinces. Divided control over secondary education has bedevilled the position in the case of White education, and my plea to this House is to see to it that Coloured education is spared this.</p>

<p>One of the problems which will have to be tackled immediately by Coloured Affairs is adequate provision for vocational commercial and technical training for Coloureds. In this connection I should like to refer to an inquiry that was undertaken in 1954 by the Coloured Education Commission which was appointed <span class="col_2023-2024" refersTo="page_1026"/>by the Cape Provincial Administration. It went into the distribution of Coloured labourers over the various occupations. Their finding was as follows: As far as male employees were concerned, there were 36 per cent in industry, 36 per cent in agriculture, 9 per cent in transport, 4 per cent in personal services, 2 per cent in commerce, 2 per cent in the professions, 1 per cent in the mines and 10 per cent in what were described as other occupations. As far as women were concerned, 17 per cent were employed in industry, 6 per cent in agriculture, 64 per cent in personal service, 1 per cent in commerce, 3 per cent in the professions and 9 per cent in other occupations. It will be seen therefore that 72 per cent of the male Coloured workers were employed in industry and in agriculture, and 81 per cent of the female workers in industry and in personal service. The question may be asked what training these people had for their work and what facilities existed for their training. Hon. members will agree with me that we did not educate these people for their life-work. Here I probably have the support of the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan), who in an agricultural debate the other day spoke feelingly about the need to give the labourer the necessary training for his work. He was thinking particularly of farm labour. I just want to ask him not to echo the sentiments expressed by the rest of the United Party in the future when they talk again of &#x201C;Education for Slavery &#x201D;. In the professions there were 2 per cent to 3 per cent, and they undoubtedly benefited by this academic training, but the interests of the other pupil were sacrificed in order to accommodate them. More work has become available in the clerical and professional spheres in recent years as the result of the Government&#x2019;s policy of parallel development and service to one&#x2019;s own people, but the fact of the matter is that there is still a great scarcity of white-collar jobs. I should like to see similar comparative figures drawn up with regard to the distribution of White workers over the various occupations. One would then be able to determine whether the curricula for Whites, at this stage of the development of Coloureds, will meet the requirements of Coloureds in every respect. Let hon. members determine for themselves whether we on this side of the House are only obsessed with the colour of people. The other day when the hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) expressed the opinion that the curriculum should be adapted to the requirements of the pupils, the hon. member for South Coast jumped down his throat boots and all. I want to say to the hon. member for South Coast this afternoon that that is <i>a</i> commonplace which in education is as old as Plato, but I should say that the hon. member is not a disciple of Plato&#x2019;s: I would rather regard him as a disciple of Machiavelli&#x2019;s. The Opposition admit that under the provinces Coloured education is anything but satisfactory, but they say that all that is needed is more money for that purpose. I shall come back to that later on.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). This amendment flows from the discussions between the Coloured leaders, under the leadership of Mr. George Golding, and the four representatives of the Coloureds. After Mr. Golding had put the matter to them, they were instructed to support this measure on certain conditions. Let me read out the report which appeared in the <i>Banier</i> with regard to this meeting. On that occasion Mr. Golding said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These were reasonable expectations from educationists and Minister Botha has expressed the view that he felt that much of what was asked could be met. The Members of Parliament were asked to give their fullest support to the Bill provided they can make their arguments felt and receive an assurance that their case will be met. Mr. A. Bloomberg on behalf of the M.P.s thanked the delegation and asked for a memorandum embodying the request.</block>

<p>I take it that this amendment moved by the hon. member for Peninsula contains all the points that were submitted to them by Mr. Golding. The first assurance that they want is that there will be no lowering of standards under the new set-up. Let me say at once that we do not have in view a Brown matriculation next to a White matriculation, nor Brown degrees next to White degrees. Even assuming that the Government had such evil intentions, one would still have to reckon with the Matriculation Board, which controls both the content and the quality of the secondary curriculum, and at university level we would have to reckon with the University of South Africa which controls the examinations and the content of the courses and their quality.</p>

<p>But I want to say a few words in connection with the curriculum. The primary curriculum for Coloureds, as far as content is concerned, will not have to differ from that of White pupils, because here we are concerned with elementary things like reading, writing and arithmetic. But in the case of all the elementary little things in education, the things that we usually leave to a good home to take care of, there will have to be a difference in emphasis, where necessary, just as in the case of White education. It would possibly have to be included in the curriculum. That is done every day in White education too. But the curriculum for secondary education will differ materially because there will be an opportunity to introduce differentiated curricula, which, because of the divided control, we cannot have in White education, and which is something that we will still envy the Coloured in the near future. All secondary education will now be under the same control, which will make reorganization possible. At the end of the primary curriculum or at some stage in the junior high school it will now be possible to guide Coloured pupils, according to aptitude, in one of two recognized directions, that is to say, in the direction of vocational, <span class="col_2025-2026" refersTo="page_1027"/>technical or commercial training, or in the academic direction for training in clerical services and the learned professions. That is the crux of the recommendations of the de Villiers Commission. The hon. member for Peninsula can safely take it for granted now that this fear of a lower standard in Coloured education is unfounded and that on the contrary there are prospects of an improved standard.</p>

<p>The second assurance for which he asks is in connection with compulsory education. That will definitely come but it cannot come overnight. It will come gradually, just as in the case of White education. There are certain difficulties in the way. In 1954 there were 37,000 Coloured children who were still receiving no education. I do not know what the number is to-day, but I should imagine that having regard to the increase in the population the position is not much better. In 1954 the Cape School Board, for example, told us in response to an inquiry that they needed at least R600,000 just to provide the buildings and the equipment for the children in Cape Town who were still receiving no education, and that until such time as that had been done they could not think of introducing compulsory education. The third difficulty is that the vast majority of primary pupils are to-day still in mission schools. In 1954 there were 160,000 and to-day the number is 192,000. I simply cannot see how we can saddle the missionaries with the burden of compulsory education even if we made every missionary who controls a school an attendance officer. Secondly, we would have to think twice before forcing a parent to send his child, who belongs to one denomination, to a school run by another denomination. And even if those denominations are prepared to allow it&#x2014;and I know that there are two big churches in the Republic who will not hear of it&#x2014;it means that before we can introduce compulsory education, we will have to take over these mission schools on a large scale. In 1954 when this commission sat we were told that in buildings alone it would cost this province R 17,000,000, and to-day I am afraid the figure will be much higher.</p>

<p>The next assurance for which they ask is uniformity in education. Well, that is precisely what is going to happen and it is not necessary for me to enlarge upon this. The result of this transfer will be more uniformity in education. The next assurance which is sought is that the salaries of Coloured teachers will be put on a par with those of the White teachers. Well, I cannot speak on behalf of the Treasury, but I do want to say that it will be much easier under the new set-up than under the provincial set-up to bring about improvements in the salaries of Coloured teachers. But Mr. Golding realizes that this cannot be brought about overnight and that is why he said that they would be satisfied in the first instance with 80 per cent of the salaries paid to White teachers. The last request was that more administrative posts should be created for Coloureds. On every single occasion that the idea of parallel development has been extended it has resulted in the creation of more posts for Coloureds, and that will also be the case here. Under this new set-up the Coloured intelligentsia will be offered the opportunity as never before to serve their own people, both administratively and professionally. A large number of posts will be available to them. In my opinion, however, the contribution that they are able to make will depend on the extent to which they are prepared to accept that policy of separate development. Any flirtation with the United Party idea of integration or assimilation will detract from the contribution that they are able to make. This will also give the parents the opportunity to take an active part in the education of their children, and I hope that they will make the best use of it. I hope that in the future there will be many more Coloured labourers who will be able to enter the labour market as skilled labourers and not as unskilled labour. I have just indicated a few reasons to convince the representatives of the Coloureds that it is in the interests of their own constituents to support the Government in this effort.</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I trust that the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) will excuse me if I do not follow his trend of thought very far. He speaks as a politician and as a past educationist while I hope to approach the subject in a practical spirit, imbued with a deep interest in all matters educational affecting all races and unhampered by the bias and ideological prejudice which dogs the thoughts and actions of so many hon. members opposite.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prieska admitted that the cost of education, if it came under control of the State, would increase, but he said, &#x201C;What of it? A higher price for a better article.&#x201D; Then later he went on to say that he could not speak on behalf of the Treasury, and for that reason alone I believe that the question of costs becomes one of paramount importance and that as far as Coloured education is concerned one would have to cut one&#x2019;s cloth according to one&#x2019;s purse. I submit that at this stage the take-over of Coloured education by the State is both illogical and inconsistent, and it would appear from some of the remarks made by the hon. the Minister when he made his second-reading speech, that the impression he conveyed is basically different from many of the facts which I will try to bring before the House. I believe that basically the Coloured people of South Africa do not favour the divorcement and separation from Western standards in so many ways. Already we have these differences; we have them in living conditions, we have them in labour and in employment and now we are to have them in education. I do not believe that it is the considered opinion of all the Coloured people in South Africa, although it may apply to certain people in certain parts of the country or even in certain provinces. In so far as the province of Natal is concerned, I do not <span class="col_2027-2028" refersTo="page_1028"/>believe that that is the position and I wish to substantiate that by quoting the remarks made by the chairman of the Durban Coloured Federal Council in a letter to me dated 19 February. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">However, for all practical purposes Natal will not really gain anything which they have not enjoyed up to now. In a nutshell the people of Natal are not enthusiastic about the proposed transfer.</block>

<p>Then I would like to refer briefly to a report which was submitted last July to the Director of Coloured Education, also from the Durban Coloured Federal Council, in which they made it clear that attendance at the discussions must not be construed as co-operation with the Department. They said in this memorandum that they were fundamentally opposed to the transfer of Coloured education from the provinces; they were against the establishment of a separate department because they felt it was inimical to the interests of the Coloured people who had not surrendered the right to be regarded as South Africans. They feared also that there would be a deterioration in the standard of Coloured education and they quoted Bantu education as an example. They were against segregation in education on the grounds of race and they felt that the present limitations in so far as Coloured education was concerned could be remedied by the provinces, and then later, as late as 20 February of this year, these opinions were endorced&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do believe that education should not be balkanized because civilization is enshrined in values which know no racial paths.</block>

<p>They conclude their communication by saying&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We cannot but feel that the whole transfer is not for the upliftment of the Coloured community but for the entrenchment of the Coloured child&#x2019;s role of servitude as envisaged by the Government.</block>

<p>At this stage I would like to refer to some figures. I have chosen the figures submitted to the commission by the Natal authorities because by virtue of Indian education it gives a picture of the expense involved in the education of the four races. I quote the <i>per capita</i> amount of money spent on educating the four different races from 1956 to 1957: White R116; Coloured R77; Indian R45. and the Bantu figure for 1955 was given as R17. Then again in 1960-1 there had been an increase in the amount spent <i>per capita,</i> except in the case of the Coloureds. The figure for Whites had risen to R137; the figure for Coloureds was R71, Indians R49, and the figure given for the Bantu had decreased to R13; that was the figure for 1962. I quote in round figures.</p>

<p>Another section of this Schumann Commission indicates that Coloured teachers received salaries equal to 72.1 per cent of the salaries of their White counterparts and the report indicates in detail what funds are needed to increase the salaries of Coloured people. I submit that this aspect is one which deserves priority, no matter who implements education for the Coloured people. Sir, the Minister quoted from the Schumann report. He referred to pages 136 to 138, and I understood him to say that no additional expenditure worth mentioning would be caused by this transfer, but on page 138 of this report there is a footnote which indicates, I think in a very difinite way, that additional expenditure may not be incurred, but the figures quoted on that page, according to the footnote, do not include increased salaries, compulsory school feeding, etc., and from Table 33 on page 137 of the report it appears that approximately R3,000,000, on the basis of the 1961-2 figures, will be needed to provide for the three items mentioned. Sir, the Minister referred to sections of the report, but I think what is most significant is that he did not refer to the conclusions arrived at by the commission and detailed in the report. I should like to quote one of the concluding paragraphs because I believe that it has a great bearing on the whole matter under consideration. On page 143 the commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Your commission must therefore emphasize that from the point of view of the consideration of all the financial implications of the transfer of Coloured education it considers it advisable to defer a final decision until its main report has been completed. This standpoint was clearly taken in Chapter 1, paragraph 13. It is repeated here.</block>

<p>Then after the concluding paragraphs of this report there were supplementary comments by Dr. Malherbe where he indicates that if Coloured education is to be transferred to the Department of Coloured Affairs the Treasury will have to find a total of almost R 17,000,000. He made it clear that that figure of R 17,000,000 did not include the R3,000,000 which it was estimated would be required to provide for increased teachers&#x2019; salaries, compulsory education, school feeding, etc. This is what he said too on page 144&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should therefore be seriously considered whether it would not be much more economical for the State as a whole to leave Coloured education under the provinces and then to adapt financial arrangements in such a way that the extra cost connected with improvements, expansion, etc., will be made available to the provinces and especially to the Cape Province.</block>

<p>Sir, the expenses of this particular Schumann Commission amounted to approximately R11,000 last year. Why appoint these commissions if we are not going to accept the recommendations put forward by them?</p>

<p>I could not help gaining the impression from the debate, particularly from the re <span class="col_2029-2030" refersTo="page_1029"/>marks from some hon. members opposite, that the Coloured people, particularly in the Cape Province and particularly with regard to education, were standing at the threshold of a land flowing with milk and honey. But, Sir, where is the money coming from to provide the facilities which are so urgently needed? The Minister of Finance, when he addressed the House earlier this Session, made it clear when an appeal was addressed to him in regard to the difficulties under which pensioners were labouring that any extension of the benefits to pensioners was contingent mainly upon finance and that finance in some instances presented a great difficulty. In terms of figures it would seem from the report that the most satisfactory and most economical manner to deal with Coloured education would be for the State to accept the financial responsibility but for the provinces to retain control and administration based on a State subsidy. I believe that the work which this commission has done has provided a very good platform from which such a scheme could be implemented, because so many figures are now available that it is possible to assess the need of a particular province in regard to education of. for example, the Coloured people, based on the estimated <i>per capita</i> expense multiplied by the number of pupils and I believe that in that way the cost of education could be spread evenly amongst the taxpayers of the Republic and that there would be no need for hardship for any one particular province.</p>

<p>Sir. I should like to digress for a moment</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to do so merely to deal with what appears to be a discrepancy in the figures given in the report. I hope that perhaps the hon. the Minister will be able to give us an explanation later on as to how this discrepancy arose. On page 14 of the report the numbers of Coloured scholars in the provinces are listed and on other pages which I will quote certain numbers are given. There is quite a big disparity between these numbers. I feel that this matter is sufficiently important to raise because these figures are used to assess the need for finances to be supplied in the year 1970-1. If we base our conclusion on figures which are wrong now, the ultimate result could be considerably out. With regard to the Cape, the figure given on page 14 is 283,770, whereas on page 26 the figure was given as 264,000. With regard to the Transvaal, the figure was given as 28,400 on page 14 and on page 31 it was given as 22,100. In the case of Natal, the figure was given as 12.510 on page 14 and on page 33 it was given as 11,694. With regard to the Free State a similar disparity exists because on page 14 the figure was given as 4,180 as representing the number of Coloured students in the Free State, whereas on page 34 the number was given as 3,320. I trust that the hon. the Minister will give some explanation as to how that apparent disparity arose. If we take Natal and the question of Coloured education there, I find myself in some difficulty in arriving at the actual number of scholars because in one case it is 12,500 and in the other case just over 11,000. I believe that the people in Natal are on the whole satisfied with Coloured education as presently administered. They claim that the salary scales could be higher, and with that the commission itself agrees. I would submit that a Government subsidy on the basis of <i>per capita</i> costs times the number of scholars would eventually overcome the difficulty and provide higher salaries and better facilities. Sir, what would be the position in Natal were the State to take over the control of Coloured education? We would have. I submit, management by remote control or it would be necessary to establish a new Department of Education to deal with the 12,000-odd Coloured scholars in Natal. I submit that that would entail unnecessary expense which could be aggravated by the intrusion of Parkinson&#x2019;s Law and make for further wastage of public money.</p>

<p>Last year we dealt with the contentious matter of the National Education Advisory Council Bill. While I wish to dwell only very briefly on this, I would refer to the fact that when the Select Committee met to frame this Bill for the consideration of the House, they received evidence from 25 different bodies. It is very significant, I think, that of those 25. 17 were put the proposition: Should the National Advisory Education Council deal with the education of Whites only? Seventeen bodies, as I said, commented. Five said that it should deal with Whites only and 12 said &#x201C;no&#x201D;. Of the 12 who said &#x201C;no&#x201D;, I should like to refer to one in particular because I believe it has a great bearing on the decision which this House may make on this particular Bill. The quotation which I make comes from page 156 of the English version of the report; it is question 464&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(Dr. Venter): Do you envisage this Council only looking after the educational interests of the White child?</block>

<p>This is the answer&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, but only at this stage. To me it is something which has not been settled. As a matter of fact I believe that as regards administration, control, etc., we cannot keep the education of the various races separate as we are doing at present. I think the education of the country forms a unity and the Council in due course will have to acknowledge this.</block>

<p>The man who gave that reply was none other than Professor Dr. Bingle who gave evidence on behalf of Potchefstroom University and who has now been appointed by the Minister of Education, Arts and Science to the executive committee of this National Advisory Council for Education, and the Minister of Education, Arts and Science was very definite <span class="col_2031-2032" refersTo="page_1030"/>and at great pains to indicate the supreme confidence which he had in Professor Bingle, so I believe that these remarks are important and worthy of consideration. If we consider the Act itself which lays down certain conditions concerning this National Advisory Council, we find that Clause 7 (1) provides that the Council is to advise the Minister or any other Minister generally in regard to the policies to be applied in connection with education, and Clause 7 (2) makes it clear and charges the Council to endeavour to determine &#x201C;the broad fundamental principles of sound education for the country as a whole, but with due regard to the advisability of maintaining such diversity as circumstances may demand &#x201D;. Sir, the personnel of this Council was gazetted late last year. It is due to commence functioning in May of this year. It has already been indicated in reply to question that for this Council to operate it will cost the State over R30,000 per annum. Here is a Council which is going to deal with the broad aspects of education. Surely the Minister should at this stage withdraw this Bill and submit this whole matter for the consideration of this Council. But what do we find in this Bill? We find in Clause 30 of the Bill that another Council is to be set up, an Education Council for Coloured Persons; it is to be separate; there is to be no liaison with its White counterpart except through the Ministers concerned. Sir, what is this mania for setting up bodies and then so often refusing to accept the advice which they give? There is a certain amount of expense involved in the setting up of these bodies. This money has to come out of the pockets of the taxpayer.</p>

<p>Sir, I crave your indulgence to refer briefly to the question of Indian education because I believe that it impinges on the question of the principle involved in this Bill and that is the separation of education into ethnic groups. Where we have the position in the Cape that there is an almost overwhelming preponderance of Coloured scholars in relation to European scholars, we have a similar position existing in Natal where the Indian scholars outnumber the White scholars. Briefly the figures are the following; In 1960-1 there were 67,000 Whites and 105,000 Indian scholars, and in the ensuing year, 1961-2, the figure for Whites was given as 75,000 and for Indians as 109,000, so the ratio there is almost 3 Indian scholars to 2 White scholars. Only 16 years before, in 1946-7, the numbers were equal and were approximately 35,000. Sir, the Schumann report refers to Indian education and it says that in 1961-2 an amount of R5,500,000 was spent by the Natal Province on Indian education. The amount estimated for 1970-1 is R12,000,000. The Natal Provincial Council has accepted the responsibility and has made serious endeavours to provide the necessary facilities. I believe that the Indian community is aware of and appreciates the efforts that have been made on their behalf but&#x2014;and this is where the inconsistency appears to arise&#x2014;the Minister of Indian Affairs only a few weeks ago stated that the Government had no intention of taking over Indian education. I submit that if the cost of education of non-White races is to become the responsibility of the State, it seems both logical and economical that the cost of Indian education should not be borne by a section of the population of the Republic. As in the case of Coloured education, a State subsidy could provide the means whereby a very great burden can be taken off the shoulders of a particular province. In conclusion I say that at this stage the introduction of a Bill of this nature is illogical, inconsistent, ill-conceived, ill-timed and ill-fated.</p>

<p>The Bill which we have before us is being attacked by the Opposition on purely political grounds. I have not yet heard any educational grounds of any nature whatsoever being advanced to show why this Bill is not necessary at the moment or why it is wrong. On the contrary, their attack is identical to their attacks on all the legislation which we have passed up to the present in connection with parallel development. I do not want to mention further examples but when we placed the Coloureds on a separate voters&#x2019; roll they also opposed that legislation and yet since the adoption of that law we have for the first time heard the opinions of the Coloureds through the medium of the Coloured Representatives here in the House, who are in reality the spokesmen for the Coloured voters, as we have witnessed time and again in various debates. In previous years we have never been able to obtain the actual views of the Coloured from all the members who have represented them. It appears to me that this system has been so effective that the Coloured Representative in the Provincial Council to-day is the Leader of the United Party. This certainly proves that our system has been the correct one and that they have confidence in the person elected by the Coloureds. This Bill is being attacked on those grounds alone. The two hon. members with whom I wish to deal are the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) because of his notorious fragmentation speech, and the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) because of the amendment he moved.</p>

<p>I want to start immediately with the fragmentation speech of the hon. member for South Coast. The hon. member speaks from his own experience when he talks about fragmentation. Is he not an expert in the sphere of the fragmentation of the United Party? Was it not his proposals in Bloemfontein which led to the United Party breaking up into sections, forming the Progressive Party, and resulting in the fragmentation of the United Party?</p>

<p>That is only the first round. I want to come now to the hon. member for Hillbrow and in his case I will be able to discuss the Bill more specifically because he dealt specifically with the Bill. But I shall deal with that later. Section 85 of the South Africa Act provided that all education other than higher education would be placed in the hands of the provinces for a period of five years and that Parliament would then review the matter. This decision taken in 1910 is easy to understand. From a study of the notes of F. S. Malan in connection with the establishment of Union and also a study of the correspondence between Merriman and Smuts in connection with education and the placing of education under the control of and the retention of education by the Provincial Administrations, it is very clear that at that stage everybody felt that education should fall under the Central Government.

<p>Very well, Field-Marshal Smuts, who was the father of Union, actually felt very strongly at that stage that education should be placed under Central Government control but he left it as it was for the time being for the simple reason that only three years previously, in 1907, he himself as Minister of Education in the Transvaal passed an education law which he very much wanted to see applied in practice first and that was why he did not object to education being placed under the provinces provisionally; his education law could then still remain of force and effect in the Transvaal. At that stage he was not so sure of what its influence would be in the country as a whole. At the same time, in 1906, General Hertzog had a great struggle in connection with language rights in the Free State and because he probably also regarded the matter in that light and was sure of what the position would be in the Free State but was not sure of what the position would be in the Union as a whole, it suited him for education to remain under the Provincial Administration provisionally and that the Free State should have control of that education. John X. Merriman, the Leader in the Cape in those days, adopted the view&#x2014;or so it appears from his correspondence&#x2014;that there would be so many problems to be dealt with immediately in connection with Union&#x2014;Native policy and other matters&#x2014;that he wanted provisionally to leave this question to the provinces for the first few years; that the machine of Government should be made to run smoothly in the first five years and that education could be taken over later. From Merriman&#x2019;s correspondence it is very clear that it was an accomplished fact to his mind that after five years education would be taken over by the Central Government once the initial growing pains of Union had been eased. Because of this attitude on the part of the various founders of Union, all other education except higher education remains provisionally with the Provincial Councils. Because of this fact, Coloured education still remains there. Everyone admitted therefore that it was in the interests of education for it to be controlled by a national body, but under the force of circumstances and for the sake of the great ideal of unity, the unification of the various provinces, they left it at that provisionally&#x2014;I repeat &#x201C;provisionally &#x201D;. In 1913 the Union Education Department was established and it suggested&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There ought to be a general transfer of all education to Union control.</block>

<p>In 1915 the Jagger Commission made a very comprehensive recommendation. As I have said, it was laid down in the South Africa Act that the position would be reviewed after five years. The Jagger Commission recommended that the Provincial Councils should be abolished completely and that the control of education should be transferred to the Central Government. I quote from the Report of the Jagger Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The present arrangement seems to us to cause a most unnatural division of educational efforts. One does not require to be an education expert to realize that the education of the youth of a country should be a systematic whole. The primary, secondary and higher education should all be made to work into each other in an organic scheme and that without such adjustment of means to an end there must necessarily be loss of efficiency and misapplication of effort. The result is that the educational systems of the different provinces, so far from tending to assimilate to a common national type, are in danger of drifting apart.</block>

<p>This was the recommendation of the Jagger Commission in 1915. This was the view of the people who investigated the matter immediately after this question arose in 1915. After this we had numbers of commissions, such as the Roos Commission, amongst others, until we eventually had the de Villiers Commission of 1948. In the report of that Commission too we find recommendations in respect of Coloured education which I shall discuss further just now. It is quite clear therefore that the fact that education was left provisionally with the provinces was a temporary measure. Everyone considered it to be in the interests of education for education to be placed under the Central Government but because of the force of certain circumstances it was left provisionally with the provinces. I want to state most emphatically. Mr. Speaker, that because of the historical course of events thereafter&#x2014;in 1915 we were involved in the First World War: at that time the Government had neither the time nor the inclination to deal with these minor matters&#x2014; this matter was also passed over and gradually the provinces built empires for themselves which could not be broken down without their <span class="col_2035-2036" refersTo="page_1032"/>rights being severely undermined. That is why this problem remains, but it is certainly not in the interests of education, either of White education or of Coloured education. When we established the Department of Coloured Affairs a year or two ago the idea was that this Department would eventually become the political home of the Coloured as regards all his facets of life. There was consultation with everyone concerned in regard to this specific matter of education. As the hon. the Minister stated in his second-reading speech, between 6,000 and 7.000 Coloured teachers were consulted at more than 40 regional meetings. The announcement of the transfer of Coloured education to the State was made in 1962 and that announcement caused the reaction. Various objections were forthcoming but, according to the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux), matters were also rectified in that regard. What is the choice with which we are now faced? We must either leave it where it is and make more funds available, as the Opposition apparently want to do; we can transfer it to the Department of Education, Arts and Science which deals with education; or we can transfer it to the control of the Department of Coloured Affairs. We on this side of course choose the last of the three for very obvious educational, financial and logical reasons, but more about that later.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with the amendment moved by the Opposition and I want to deal primarily with the hon. member who moved the amendment, the hon member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp). How a man of his calibre, with his background and with his past in connection with this specific matter could go so far as to move this amendment is something I cannot understand because what he said here was a complete contradiction of everything that he said in this same House a few years ago, as I will indicate now. At that time he adopted a strong viewpoint on certain matters but suddenly now these have ceased to have any value for him at all. The amendment of the Opposition deals with four points and I want to discuss the first of those points. Their first viewpoint is that this Bill curtails the powers of the provinces. In the first place I want to ask the hon. member for Hillbrow whether he is aware of the fact that the Cape Provincial Administration, which is most affected by this matter, approves of this question and has agreed to it? Is it still a restriction of their powers if they renounce those powers voluntarily?</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member that they approved of it by means of a majority vote, according to democratic law. Is it still a curtailment of their rights? I want to go further. The hon. member said that it restricts the powers of the provincial council, but did the hon. member also consider it to be a restriction of the powers of the provincial council when Bantu education was transferred to the Department of Union Education? I am asking the hon. member a question. On 2 April 1945 (Hansard, Vol. 52, col. 4492) the hon. member had the following to say about Bantu education at that time. He made a long speech advocating that Bantu education should no longer remain in the hands of the provinces but be transferred, not to the Department of Education but to the Department of Native Affairs. The Opposition may well read that speech and then they will be able to ascertain what the standpoint of the hon. member for Hillbrow was at that time. At that time the hon. member was not the frustrated, hardened old politician he is to-day; he was a clever educationist who only two years previously had been awarded his Doctor&#x2019;s degree in Education at the University of Stellenbosch. At that time he was still a man of impartial judgment and a man who could put his viewpoint on purely educational grounds. Now he is a frustrated, front-bench politician who has to echo the sentiments of his party. If the whip cracks, he must obey. What did he say at that time? In a long speech in which he said that education should be taken over by the State and placed under the control of the Department of Native Affairs, he had the following to say&#x2014; almost wistfully, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It seems, however, that the time for such control has not yet arrived and we shall therefore have to wait some years for an opportune time, that time when the provinces will realize, and when we in this House will realize, that all national matters should be and must be in the hands of the Central Government.</block>

<p>Is Coloured education not a national matter?</p>

<p>But I want to go further. The second leg of the amendment states that the transfer of Coloured education will lower the status of the Provincial and Education Departments. I take it that by &#x201C;Education Departments&#x201D; what is meant here is the Department of Education, Arts and Science. If this is so, I want once again to compare the speech and the attitude of the hon. member of to-day&#x2014;that it is a lowering of the status&#x2014;with his speech of 2 April 1945. In col. 4493 he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I honestly feel that the direction of Native education as provided for in this Bill should not be in the hands of the Minister of Education &#x2026; Native administration &#x2026; directs the Native policy, and I feel firmly convinced &#x2026; that the welfare of the Native as a whole could best be served by placing the direction of Native education in the hands of the Minister of Native Affairs.</block>

<p>Now I want to read exactly the same thing and substitute the word &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; for the word &#x201C;Native&#x201D; and I want the hon. member to tell me whether he agrees with me or not.</p>

<p>The argument stands&#x2014;that it is a national matter, as the hon. member <span class="col_2037-2038" refersTo="page_1033"/>said. The argument also stands further that if it is in the interests of the Natives for Native administration to remain in the hands of the Minister of Native Affairs, why ought Coloured education not to be placed in the hands of the Department of Coloured Affairs? I would like to understand the logic of the hon. member in this regard if he can explain it to me.</p>

<p>The third leg of the amendment is &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Are the Coloureds the same as the Natives?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>No. I did not say so. Let us understand one another clearly. I do not say that the Coloured is identical to the Native: I will never say such a thing; but I say that Coloured education and the policy in connection with the Coloured and the control of that policy by one specific Minister is identical to the case of the Bantu where they and their education and their policy have also fallen under a particular Minister in order to have uniformity in that regard.</p>

<p>The third leg of the amendment is that the transfer will lead to unnecessary costs and the duplication of administration. This is what the hon. member says in 1963. In connection with the particular Bill on which the hon. member spoke in 1945 it was going to have precisely the opposite effect. At the moment we have duplication, Mr. Speaker, because part of Coloured education already falls under the Minister of Coloured Affairs and part of it falls under the Provincial Administrations, or does not the hon. member want to deny that? If this is so. Sir, then we do have duplication; then we have a waste of energy and a waste of money; then we already have duplication. This Bill eliminates that duplication. The 1945 Act, on which the hon. member spoke at that time, did not take away any control. On the contrary, the 1945 Act made provision precisely for what the hon. member is advocating now&#x2014; that the Government should merely pay larger subsidies to those Departments and that the control should still be vested in those specific Departments. But in 1945 the hon. member contended that this was wrong: it should not be done in this way; control should also be transferred. to-day he contends that it should stay that way. What was his complaint at the time about the unnecessary expense? I want to quote from col. 4493 of the same Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From experience we know &#x2026;</block>

<p>this is what the hon. member for Hillbrow said at that time&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; that our different departments of State are very unco-ordinated and very jealous of each other&#x2019;s powers and functions, and I fear if this Bill is accepted in its present form, also in regard to Native education as such and Native administration and finance in general, we shall have a continuance of the bickering and the pettiness and the wastage of money which has so often evinced itself in the past.</block>

<p>Under that system he spoke about the waste of money and now that we are doing precisely what the hon. member asked for at that time, he tells us that we are wasting money! Does the hon. member know what he wants? At that time he strongly advocated the transfer of Native education to the Department of Native Affairs and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Native Affairs Administration has been for many years the Ministries of Agriculture, of Public Health, of Public Roads, etc., to the Native. Why cannot they also be the Ministry of Education to direct Native education?</block>

<p>I want to say exactly the same thing; &#x201C;The Department of Coloured Affairs is at the moment the Ministries of Agriculture. Public Health, Roads, Industrialization and so forth to the Coloureds. Why cannot this Department also become the Department of Education for the Coloured people?&#x201D; I want the hon. member for Hillbrow to reply to that and to use his own arguments.</p>

<p>The fourth leg of this amendment states that the transfer will lead to a further alienation between White and non-White. as the hon. member said. In 1945. on the taking over of Native education, in his view it meant the removal of points of friction between White and non-White. It was apparently one of the most effective means of solving the Native problem and of determining Native policy. I want to quote from col. 4491 of that specific Hansard&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Native education, you will all agree, is the chief factor in moulding the Native policy in South Africa and it therefore should be administered by the body responsible for that policy, that is the Union Government. While to-day the Native people will require adaptations of education to suit their special requirements there is need for a unified policy for the country as a whole, and that policy could best be prescribed by the Union Government.</block>

<p>I ask for a unified policy for Coloured education; there is a unified policy for Native education. I ask for it for the same educational reasons as the hon. member for Hillbrow asked for it in respect of the Natives. When I ask for a unified policy I say that there is only one body which can really make a success of it, and that is the Central Government and the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the Department of Coloured Affairs. In his 1963 speech, the hon. member for Hillbrow went further and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Indeed, the general feeling is that the standard will suffer under the new regime, particularly at the start. The Education Departments all have more than a century of experience. &#x2026; The education administrations in the provinces are far better equipped than this new Department can ever dream of being equipped for this task for the next ten to 20 years.</block>

<p><span class="col_2039-2040" refersTo="page_1034"/>Now I want quote again from his 1945 speech, at col. 4490&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I certainly would like to have seen the control of such an important and delicate matter in the hands of the national body. that is the Union Government.</block>

<p>At that stage the delicate matter had to be left in the hands of the Union Government. to-day? to-day it means a lowering of status; the Department does not have the necessary experience and the provinces are the appointed people to undertake this task!</p>

<p>I want to deal finally with the hon. member for Hillbrow by saying that at that time the hon. member was an objective educationist who had the courage of his convictions to such an extent that he even differed from his own party on a matter which to his mind was correct educationally, and that was that the education of the Bantu at that stage should fall under one control. to-day he is a frustrated front-bencher on the Opposition side, a man who is under the authority of the Party Whip and who is not permitted to hold his own opinions on education but has to fall in with party politics. I want to leave the hon. member and his past to his own conscience.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, why do we want to transfer Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs? I want to mention a few reasons why we want to do this. It is necessary. In that same debate in 1945 the then Minister of Education, Mr. Hofmeyr, mentioned, as one of the reasons for taking over the financing, the fact that the levying of taxes, the control over taxation and the spending of the money was at that stage not in the hands of the correct persons. He put it in this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the moment we here in Parliament vote an amount of money each year which is transferred to the Provincial Administration and we have no idea of the way in which it is spent. This is wrong from all points of view, financially and as far as the point of view of control is concerned. The body which levies the tax and which votes the money must also have control over the spending of that money.</block>

<p>If this was right in those days, Mr. Speaker, then surely it is true at this stage too? We have previously heard the view expressed that large subsidies are voted here annually for education, for Coloured education as well, that this money is then transferred to the Provincial Administrations and that this House which votes the money, which collects the money from the taxpayers, has very little authority over the further spending of that money or the way in which it is spent. From the point of view of financial control, however, it is better for education to be taken over by the Department and for this House, which votes the money, also to have a say over the way in which that money is spent. The hon. the Minister can then appear here each year and report upon how that money has been spent so that we can question him in that regard. I want to mention another argument and that is the argument that the source of taxation, the body which collects the taxes, must also be able to spend that money. At the moment, so I am informed, the Coloured pays R2 per annum in taxes to the Provincial Administrations plus the small amount which he pays in the form of income-tax which goes to the Provincial Administrations. But beyond this the Coloured pays his normal income-tax, as required by the Income Tax Act, to this Government and it falls under the control of this House. In other words, the argument still stands very strongly that where we are the collectors of taxes and where we in this House impose taxation, we must also be the people to spend that money. This is a good idea financially and a sound control measure over the finances of the country.</p>

<p>I want to mention a third argument. Education is part of a person&#x2019;s makeup. It is fundamental and it cannot be divorced from the rest of a person&#x2019;s personality. The basis of one&#x2019;s whole personality is formulated by one&#x2019;s education; the preparation for one&#x2019;s employment, the preparation for one&#x2019;s outside life, the specialized study of specific problems are all covered by education. I have here a definition of education which I obtained from Professor Chris Coetzee. He defines it as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Education can generally be defined as the process by means of which knowledge is imparted to the developing being; by means of which values in life are placed in their correct perspective, personal characteristics and particular aptitudes are directed and developed to the highest possible potential, while the whole being is educated to be of service to himself, to his own family, to his national group, to his country, to the world in general and also for the life hereafter.</block>

<p>What a comprehensive but what an enjoyable task! Education cannot be divorced from the rest of man; it is part of man. How can education be given in a certain direction while the person himself goes in a different direction? I want to put this very clearly. I want once again to quote the hon. member for Hillbrow. Unfortunately, he used a very bad anglicism in this quotation which I do not want to have attributed to me. I merely quote it as it stands in Hansard. This is what he had to say about education in that connection (col. 4493)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our policy should be planned on that basis on the recognized principle that youth and its education are part and parcel of the whole man.</block>

<p>I do not want to have &#x201C;part en deel&#x201D; in my vocabulary but from the quotation as such it is clear that the hon. member means that education is undeniably part of the whole man, something which one cannot divorce from the rest of his personality.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>If the hon. member spoke in English&#x2014;I did not check it&#x2014;I want to apologize if this is not his translation. In any case, I want to continue in this vein. The hon. member for Hillbrow and all educationists, including Professor Coetzee, say that education forms an indispensable part of the whole man. One cannot therefore divorce education from the rest of man. If education must prepare man, educate man as a whole and at the same time also prepare him for his future life&#x2019;s task, then it is necessary and in the interests of that man that he should receive his education under that body which deals with the rest of the person, with his opportunities for employment, with his physical education and with the various aspects of life which he has to experience later.</p>

<p>The fourth reason that I want to mention is that this fits in automatically with certain other aspects in man&#x2019;s life&#x2014;with social welfare, with nutrition, with housing, with opportunities for employment, with culture, with tradition and where all those things already fall under the Department of Coloured Affairs and under the Minister, we now ask that the whole should be completed&#x2014;do the logical thing and add education to all these other things that I have mentioned. Then we will have the complete picture in every respect.</p>

<p>There is a fifth reason. By means of this Bill the opportunity will now be created for the Coloured parent to have a greater say in the education of his own child. He can now take a great interest in education; he can prove that interest by setting up school committees and school boards. The bodies will be represented on the Coloured Education Advisory Council. They are now going to take a positive share in the education of their children. They are now going to co-operate in and live with the education of their children. This gives them the opportunity of co-operating in their own education and living their lives to the full in this regard.</p>

<p>A sixth reason why Coloured education must be taken over is the question of technical training. In the composition of our present set-up, the Coloured will eventually have to play his part more and more over the years in various trades. If our policy of separate development is built up gradually over the years which lie ahead, the Black man will gradually be drawn back to his own areas, to the border industries, and as he leaves various avenues of employment, the Coloured will have to be equipped to take his place and to take over that work. It is necessary therefore for the Coloured to be trained. We are training the Bantu to do certain kinds of work but we are not prepared to train the Coloured for those types of work under different circumstances. I think that that is wrong. I have here recommendations of the de Villiers Commission of 1948. Recommendations Nos. 19 and 20 read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">19. That the non-European adolescent especially is in need of educational and social care and guidance.</block>

<block name="quote">20. That the educational and vocational training of the non-European lacks stimulus because of the absence of occupational prospects.</block>

<p>In other words, after a very careful investigation that Commission also arrived at the conclusion that the non-White and the Coloured should be trained for their specific tasks. It also suggested that the non-White. including the Coloured, should be trained for his specific tasks. [Interjection.] Yes, I know the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) will make use of this statement and say that we wish to force the Whites out of employment in this way. I am putting it very, very clearly; that is not our intention. He is already telling the hon. member behind him (Mr. Streicher) to make this fact known in Port Elizabeth (West). I want to say very clearly that it is not our intention to force the Whites out of employment. I have stated repeatedly that as the Bantu are drawn back to their own homelands, the Coloureds will be more in demand for their labour and they will have to play a part which they are not playing at the moment.</p>

<p>I want to go further. That is why we do not want to plan on a national basis in the interests of the Coloureds as a whole. I do not want to deal specifically with the curricula of the Coloureds. These will be worked out at the proper time. I just want to give the assurance&#x2014;I am convinced of this fact and we have a great deal of proof in this regard&#x2014; that the education of the Coloured will not be inferior; that he will not be treated in an inferior fashion at all in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to come to the eighth reason. His training must be adapted to his opportunities for employment. The Department of Labour can have liaison with the Department of Coloured Affairs in this regard. A survey was made of the Coloureds, including male and female, in their employment. There are three main sources of employment for the Coloured people at the moment: 24.2 per cent of them are employed in agriculture, forestry and in the fishing industry; 17.4 per cent of them are employed in factories and 27.6 per cent are in domestic service. These are mainly women. In the factories in the Western Cape alone 48 per cent of all workers are Coloureds at present. The building industry&#x2014;masonry, plastering, joinery and so forth&#x2014;is about 90 per cent Coloured. Over all the years during which Coloured education has fallen under the Provincial Council&#x2014;I knew that they have not had the opportunity&#x2014;has anything specific ever <span class="col_2043-2044" refersTo="page_1036"/>been done to train the Coloured in those particular avenues of employment. Has anything ever been done in this connection? No. On the contrary, because its administration is set up in such a way, the Provincial Council only provides academic training. The Coloured is only trained to know and do the usual things. There is no specific technical or vocational training. Under this Department and with the r&#x00E9;gime as envisaged in this Bill, the opportunity will be created for technical education to be given to the Coloureds. They will be trained positively for the practical requirements of life. Take commercial education. We know that there is an agreement between the Provincial Administrations and the Department of Education, Arts and Science to the effect that the Provincial Administrations will not offer more than two commercial subjects in their Standard Ten. This is a specific agreement because otherwise it would intrude upon the interests of the technical and commercial schools. In other words, the Coloured people of the Western Cape and throughout the country cannot receive commercial training of a comprehensive nature at this stage at all. They can only take two subjects. They can take shorthand and typing but they cannot do &#x201C;snelskrif&#x201D; and bookkeeping as well. The transfer also makes it possible for them to be given a full opportunity in the commercial sphere so that they can live out their lives to the full as far as the commercial sphere is concerned.</p>

<p>I want to mention a ninth reason why we must take over this Coloured education and I think that this is probably one of the main reasons. It will contribute towards our having a uniform policy and uniform control over Coloured education in the whole of the Republic. The Coloured child will then no longer be the guinea-pig of experimenting Provincial Authorities. We will not have a position where we have compulsory Coloured education in one province and not in another. We will not find the position where a great deal is done for Coloured education in one province and less in another province. We will reach the stage where we will be able to treat them all in the same way&#x2014;a position where education as such will be placed in the hands of one body. By this means we will achieve what we want the Coloureds to have. I know that this will have repercussions but I want to say that if we really want to rise above pettiness, if we really want to rise above the historical, rise above everything, we ought to reason purely as educationists and say that it is also in the interests of the White child for this to be done.</p>

<p>I want to raise one last argument in connection with this situation, and this is the question of inferior education. The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) made a speech here which was based on suspicions&#x2014;he did not trust this and he did not trust that; he did not trust the Government in this regard and he did not trust it in that regard; he felt that inferior education would be given to the Coloureds. I want to put this to the hon. member. When the University College of the Western Cape was established for the Coloureds, we heard precisely the same arguments. We heard that it would be a &#x201C;tribal college &#x201D;; that it would be an institution which would be inferior to other colleges; that it would be a &#x201C;bush college&#x201D;, out in the bundu. That college has now been in operation for three years and the persons in control there are people with particular ability. I shall mention a few of the teaching staff in order to convince hon. members that they are people who maintain standards. Dr. J. G. Meiring, formerly S.G.E. of the province, is the head of that college. I wonder whether any hon. member objects to him? Dr. Stopforth teaches English and he is a highly qualified person. Professor J. J. de Jager is head of the Department of Education. Professor Heese is head of the Department of Psychology. Dr. Helgaar Muller is head of the Department of Commerce. Dr. Swart is the head of the Department of History. These are fully qualified people; they are some of the best trained people that we have. They perhaps have come over at a lower salary to assist these people and to set that college on its feet, a college which need stand back for no other college. Have hon. members ever been there? Have they been to see the buildings? Have they seen the plans for the future buildings? A unit is being built up there which need stand back for no other university. The highest standard is maintained in all respects. Even overseas visitors have praised the college and the work that is being done there. The actions of the Government prove very clearly that we are not giving these people less than they deserve.</p>

<p>I want to conclude on this note. The educationist L. S. Steenkamp will probably agree with me&#x2014;although I do not think that the politician L. S. Steenkamp will agree&#x2014;and all educationists who analyse this matter objectively, impartially and in an unbiased manner, will agree that education is a national matter which must fall under a national governing body, which must be dealt with as a unit. That is why education ought to be taken over by the Department of Coloured Affairs so that it can be placed on a unified basis in the interests of all those who are concerned in this matter.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) advanced various reasons why Coloured education should be taken away from the provinces and why it should be taken over by the Department of Coloured Affairs. He mentioned the fact that taxation was in the hands of the Central Government whereas the provincial councils spent the money. He said that control should be in the same hands. He said that the source which collected taxation should also spend that money. He said that education was part of the whole basis, was part of the individual. He spoke about feeding, etc. I shall come to the other points at a later stage. But he said that taxation was in the hands of the Central <span class="col_2045-2046" refersTo="page_1037"/>Government and that the provincial councils spent it. But surely that is also true in the case of White education. Did the hon. member sneak on behalf of his party this afternoon? I want to know whether it is the declared policy of the National Party to take White education away from the provinces? Because surely it is clear that in the case of White education the provincial councils are spending the money and the taxes are collected by the Central Government. The hon. member says that those sources which collect the taxes should also spend the money. What does that mean? I must say that it is a long time since I have heard such an illogical speech as the one which I heard this afternoon and at that one from an educationist! He started off by saying that with the establishment of Union the idea was to leave all education in the hands of the Central Government for five years only and that the position would then be revised.</p>

<p>The hon. member forgot to add that Act 45 of 1934 changed the whole position. The hon. member quoted General Smuts and his private reason why he wanted to keep it as it was and he spoke about General Hartzog and about Merriman and he dragged in the Jagger Commission where they referred to a &#x201C;systematic whole&#x201D;, But that was in the past, in the 1920s and 1930s. Many years have passed and education has remained in the hands of the provincial councils. What is the use of quoting what they considered at the time of Union when the position may perhaps have been liquid, and to advance that as proof of the desirability that a change should be made? All these years the Union Government has decided that education should remain under the provincial councils.</p>

<p>But that is not all. We passed an Act here in 1961, the Republican Constitution Act and Section 144 of that Act says that &#x201C;none of the rights of the Provincial Councils which were granted to the Provincial Councils in terms of Section 84 shall be curtailed, except in pursuance of a petition to Parliament by the Provincial Councils concerned &#x201D;. I ask this: Is there a petition before this House from the Provincial Council of the Cape; is there a petition from the Provincial Council of the Transvaal: is there a petition from Natal: is there a petition from the Orange Free State? Thereafter the hon. member for Randfontein attacked the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp). He based approximately half his speech on what the hon. member for Hillbrow is supposed to have said in connection with Bantu education.</p>

<p>I do not remember what he said in connection with Bantu education but the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) a few days ago quoted what the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker), who is to-day their main educationist, had said and how he had changed his opinion. But the fact which stands out above everything is the fact that the Bantu and the Coloureds are not of the same race. Has that hon. member never noticed that the Coloured person speaks the language which he and I speak? has he never noticed that they speak English and Afrikaans and that they do not know any Bantu languages, unless they have learnt it in addition? Has he never realized that they are part of the White nation and part of the Western civilization? How can the hon. member come along and quote something which was said in respect of Bantu education and then accuse the hon. member for Hillbrow of having said certain things at that time? You see, Sir, I am slowly getting tired of this forceful (kragdadige) Government and the forceful members on the other side. I am slowly getting tired of their somersaulting every few minutes; I am slowly getting tired of the block of granite which somersaults so easily. I wish to quote what Mr. C. P. Swart said in that same debate from which the hon. member has just quoted. As an educationist he should surely have read the entire debate. Surely he did not only read a portion of it, just the portion which he wanted to read? I quote from Hansard, Vol. 52, col. 4536&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hon. members here have, however, pleaded that the matter of Native education should be taken out of the hands of the provincial councils.

<p>The new Constitution Act stipulates that no rights which the provincial councils have shall be taken away other than on the strength of a petition by a provincial council and Coloured education has been in the hands of the provincial councils. Does the hon. member not even know what is dealt with in the legislation which is before us at the moment? Does he not know that the legislation which is before this House at the moment envisages that Coloured education should be taken away from the provincial councils? How can he tell me that it was only taken in 1961? The hon. member advanced a host of reasons and I found the one more peculiar than the other. The eighth reason was that employment would be more plentiful because the liaison between Labour and Coloured Affairs would operate much more easily. He said that 48 per cent of the workers in factories were Coloureds to-day. He also spoke about commercial education and vocational education, etc. But does he not know that that has not <span class="col_2047-2048" refersTo="page_1038"/>been entrusted to the provincial councils? Does he not know that that falls under the Department of Education, Arts and Science? He says that everything will now be right. Why? We still have the same Government which has not done anything for 15 years and we still have the same Minister who has not done anything for 15 years! No, I have never yet heard such a disjointed speech and that happens, of course, when you try to base your speech on the Hansard report of somebody Elbe's speech. The hon. member for Pries' (Mr. Standee) tried to talk away what the hon. Chief Whip of the Government Party let out in a thoughtless moment. He said &#x201C;the syllabus must adapt itself to the needs of the pupils &#x201D;. The hon. member for Prieska then said that it was nothing more than &#x201C;commonplace&#x201D; (gemeenplaas).</p>

We were told that the Provincial Council of the Cape Province could no longer afford to pay for Coloured education. Not one hon. member opposite has told us what the Provincial Council has discussed, and I think I should read that. Mr. Venter, M.E.C. (member for Stellenbosch and a Nationalist) moved the following resolution. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this Council records its conviction that this province has faithfully and successfully carried out its responsibility for Coloured education and that it has over 290,000 Coloured students at schools to-day, but that under the present subsidy system and with regard to the sources of taxation available to the Provincial Administration it will no longer be able to meet the increasing needs in this connection and the Administration is consequently asked to make urgent representation to the Central Government to increase the subsidy in respect of Coloured education to at least 80 per cent of the annual expenditure.</block>

<p>The whole emphasis was placed on the fact that finances presented the difficulty, the subsidy. But not one hon. member has as yet given us the reason why the subsidy could not be increased and the hon. member for Randfontein argues that the body which collects the taxes should also spend that money. The hon. member for Randfontein, therefore, does not want any Provincial Council to receive any subsidy; not one hon. member has told us why the subsidy cannot be increased. Let us study this question of the finances a little closer. Surely that was not the first occasion on which the ques-of the financing of Coloured education was under discussion. That has been under discussion for years and years. Surely that is the reason why for years and years there have always been negotiations between the provinces and the Central Government so that the subsidy could be gradually increased, particularly in respect of the Cape Province and Coloured education. I want to quote what a Superintendent General of Education, Dr. Wouter de Vos Malan, said as far back as 1938&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is unfortunate that I cannot report favourably on the general progress of Coloured education. The expansion which everyone confidently expected after the report of the Coloured Commission did not eventuate. As I mentioned in my previous report, it is clearly not possible for the Provincial Administration to meet the cost of the proposed expansion unless the Union Government revise the basis of its subsidy.</block>

<p>That was in the year 1938, in the distant past years. It was already brought to the notice of the Government at that time and it was emphasized time and again by Nationalist Party members in the Provincial Council of the Cape Province; they asked for an increased subsidy time and again and they merely added an addendum that in case they did not receive an increased subsidy, the education must be taken over. The Administration explained very clearly that the removal of Coloured education would not place the Cape Provincial Council in a very much better financial position. The fact of the matter is that this question which is before this House at the moment has nothing to do with improved education, it has nothing to do with financial arrangements, because they were not insurmountable; it is simply part of the Government&#x2019;s policy of separation and segregation and differentiation. I want to quote an authority, Sir. My authority is nobody else than the Prime Minister who said the following on 7 December 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To begin with you must take certain facts into account. The first is that the four groups in South Africa, the Whites, Coloured, Indians and Bantu are all different.</block>

<p>He then goes on and he gives various reasons in connection with what he thinks ought to be done, and he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the transition period the Department of Coloured Affairs must be seen as a channel to lead the Coloured. The Department of Coloured Affairs will take over education &#x2026;</block>

<p>You see, Sir, there was no reference to the Provincial Council of the Cape Province finding it difficult&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department of Coloured Affairs will take over education and with the assistance of its officials, who will be Coloureds as far as possible, it will organize and establish the machinery in such a way that it can be transferred, just like that, to the control of the Coloured Council when the Council is ready for it.</block>

<block name="quote">The Department constitutes a transitional period to assist the placing of this and other services under the control of Coloureds. Thereafter the Department will only be a link between the Coloureds and the White Government, something like the Minister of Foreign Affairs who is the link between his and other Governments.</block>

<p>But then we come to the finances and the hon. the Prime Minister says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A great deal of suspicion has been sown as to where the money for such development is to come from.</block>

<p>Where is the hon. member for Randfontein now? Because just listen to what the Prime Minister says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These services are to-day financed from ordinary taxation. There need not be two taxation machines therefore &#x2026;</block>

<p>In other words, the machine which levies the taxation will still not have control over education&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but the direct and indirect taxation which is paid by the Coloureds can be calculated, so that a globular sum can be paid over in order to finance the services under Coloured control.</block>

<block name="quote">The taxation paid by the Coloured must be calculated in a globular sum so that it can be paid over to finance the services which are under Coloured control. The Coloured Control Board will then decide how that money should best be spent and will have to account to its own people for it.</block>

<p>Where does that land us? Where does that land us seeing that the Schumann Commission said that by 1970 a sum of R3 0,000,000 would be required only for the buildings connected with Coloured education. Where does that land the Coloureds as far as their education is concerned, if that is the basis of the argument of the Prime Minister? The Prime Minister said that a great deal of suspicion had been sown as to where the money for such development would come from and then he told the Coloureds straight out that they themselves would have to pay for it. We are told that there will be better control as far as Coloured education is concerned. What better control will there be when one Superintendent-General will be appointed who will be sitting here in Cape Town? Will there be better control over Coloured education in Natal which is 1,000 miles away from here? Will there be better control over education in the Transvaal where, according to the hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto), 7 per cent of the school-going children are Coloured? He said that the grand total was 22,500 and he said it was difficult to provide proper education to such a small number as 7 per cent. What is going to make it easier for the Minister of Coloured Affairs? Surely he is not going to huddle all the Coloured children together or is he going to push all the parents into one camp? Surely it will not be any the easier under the new set-up. Do you see the kind of argument which we get from the other side, Sir? But that was not all that the hon. member for Pretoria (East) said. He said that the United Party avoided facts and statistics and then he went on to say that as far back as 1911 they had already established separate schools for Indians in the Transvaal and he said that in the Transvaal there were already 62 schools solely for Coloureds and 38 mixed schools for Indians and Coloureds. Then he says that the United Party is avoiding statistics. Mr. Speaker, since 1911 the province of the Transvaal has not been able to establish schools solely for those 7 per cent Coloured children, because as the hon. member said, it was difficult to provide education to such a small section of the population. I now want to know what is going to happen to that in view of the limited amount of money that will be available to the Coloureds for their education? How will those 12,000 Coloured children in Natal, who have had compulsory education throughout the years and who have had the same syllabus as the White children, fare under the &#x201C;commonplace&#x201D; of the hon. member for Brits who told us that education should be adapted to the needs of the students? We are told that there will be better control. How will that be possible in the circumstances? The Superintendent-General will be in Cape Town, very far removed from the 12,000 Coloured children in Natal and from the 7 per cent in the Transvaal, making a total of approximately 31,000 children. This Government has a record.</p>

<p>Thank you for your ruling, Sir. In 1953 547 children wrote and 249 passed or 47 per cent. The Bantu children who were then in Std. VI went into the matriculation class and 629 of them wrote the examination and only 118 passed, or 18.8 per cent. The following year 716 wrote and 128 passed, or 17.9 per cent. The hon. member <span class="col_2053-2054" refersTo="page_1041"/>for Fort Beaufort quoted figures to show how many more Coloured children had entered schools under the guidance of the Nationalist Government and he quoted the figures in respect of the increased number of Bantu children who were attending school. I admit that, but I refute the allegation that better education will be provided and that the Coloured child will be better off, because I have to look at the record of the Government as far as Bantu children are concerned and in whose case the percentage of passes has dropped from 48 per cent to 17 percent and 18 percent. Mr. Speaker, what does the Coloured really want? I shall tell you. He wants compulsory education. He wants increased salaries for the teachers. He wants the same syllabus as the Whites. He wants his own inspectors of schools. He wants improved medical services and better hostels, and school feeding, and better training in the clerical, administrative and professional sphere. He wants more farm schools. The hon. member for Prieska told us that 36 per cent of the Coloureds in the Cape Province were on the farms. They want more farm schools. When I thought about that it seemed to me that that would require more money than was required for the entire Orange River scheme, but having read everything I still cannot see a single reason why Coloured education should be taken away from the Provincial Administrations. Had there been a 80 per cent subsidy in respect of Coloured education, all these things which I have mentioned, as was said in the Cape Provincial Council, could have been done under an administration which has knowledge and experience and which has a record of which it can be proud. [Interjections.] We even have a better record in Natal. There we have had compulsory education for Coloureds ever since 1943. Everything I have read out here as to what the Coloureds really want they could have received under the Provincial Administrations as in the past, not only without detracting from the powers of the provinces, but without affecting the Constitution Act of the Republic.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that what we on this side of the House regard as a new milestone in Coloured education should be regarded with so much suspicion by hon. members opposite. I should like to quote only a few excerpts from the speeches of senior members opposite. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) asked: What is the destiny of Coloured education? The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) referred to the fear of the Whites for the educated Coloureds, and the estrangement between Whites and Coloureds. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) said that if there really is an honest intention to create opportunities, that also could be achieved without transfer. The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) said: &#x201C;The Minister must be honest and tell us what he intends with this Bill.&#x201D; I am mentioning these few quotations merely to explain why I contend that hon. members opposite regard this Bill with suspicion. I think that if there is a section of our people which can be proud of its past history and the honourable manner in which it has treated the Coloured races during the past 300 years, it is the Afrikaner. I think it is unfair, but I shall revert more particularly to this type of thing at a later stage.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) will not be offended if I do not deal fully with all she said, but I shall not leave her alone altogether; I shall return to her later. [Interjections.] In passing I should merely like to ask her whether she can tell me why it is that Natalians and Transvalers have taken the whole debate in tow on that side of the House, and why the Cape representatives are refraining from participating in the debate for such a long time, in view of the fact that 86 per cent of the Coloured children are resident in the Cape Province? Natal has only 3.8 per cent and the Transvaal 8.7 per cent of the Coloured children. I merely wish to say that it is very peculiar that in this debate the people who are most interested in the debate have refrained from participating in it. Why did they not enter the debate sooner? Because so much suspicion has been expressed by that side of the House, it is as well for me to refer to the object and functions of the Department of Coloured Affairs that was established in 1960. They have a dual object: firstly to be the liaison between the Central Government and the Coloureds in their rural areas and local authorities and secondly to perform certain direct functions in respect of the Coloured community, <i>inter alia,</i> to subsidize cultural and recreational activities, to assist in the organization of vacation courses for the training of Coloured games leaders, and to remain in contact with the Coloureds by means of conferences and meetings. There is a great variety of things they have to do but which are not relevant to this debate. Now it is a very peculiar thing, in view of this position as set forth in this explanatory document that these people are still so suspicious. It does appear quite clearly that the Department of Coloured Affairs has not been established to isolate the Coloureds and to lead them away from the Whites, but on the contrary, to create better facilities and opportunities for them.</p>

<p>I wish to go further in consequence of the insinuations that have been made, and say that the Provincial Administration, as well as the Central Government, did not lightly take this step. I have to say this to the credit of hon. members opposite that they never objected to the reports that were submitted. But now it is a strange thing that after the Provincial Administration, as well as the Central Government, have done their best to have inquiries made as to the actual position, hon. members opposite come along with vehement protests, and they are very suspicious. I refer to the fact that in the early <span class="col_2055-2056" refersTo="page_1042"/>1940s the Administrator appointed a commission in connection with Coloured education, and as a result of that report the Administrator appointed another commission in 1953, which reported in 1956. Now it is remarkable that shortly after that report was submitted the Provincial Council decided to ask the Government to take over Coloured education. After all these years of investigations it certainly cannot be said that this step has been taken lightly. But the Government also appointed a commission to investigate the whole matter, and in 1960 there was a direction from the Minister of Finance, who appointed a commission to inquire into the financial relations between the Central Government and the provinces. After all this splendid co-operation, hon. members opposite are still so very suspicious as far as this matter is concerned.</p>

<p>But I want to go further. I would say that it must be very clear now that the Provincial Administration, as well as the Government, have not lightly dealt with this important matter. We have always said that the Coloureds should develop fully to their full status as human beings, but how can they develop better than along the lines of sound education within the limits of their intelligence? The hon. member for Bezuidenhout has said that there was no consultation. He concedes that the Minister had consultations, but he says that the desirability of transfer was not discussed, nor the method. It has also been argued that the Coloureds were confronted with a <i>fait accompli,</i> but I should like to use this report of the Department of Coloured Affairs to show that the very opposite is true and that the hon. member is not well informed, and that he will have to concede that the Minister went out of his way to consult with the people to whom this Act applies. In the first place, after the Departmental Commissions had produced their reports, the Minister of Coloured Affairs submitted the whole matter to the Coloureds over the length and breadth of the country. The Director of Coloured Education held a series of 40 meetings throughout the country to test the feelings of the people, on the one hand because so few Coloured teachers belong to an organization and on the other hand because the Minister wished to satisfy himself about the true position, so that he could not subsequently be charged with having lightly decided upon these matters. After this series of meetings had been held, the Coloured Advisory Council was informed and asked to express its views. That council appointed a standing education committee that expressed itself in favour of the transfer, and it also furnished valuable information. I shall quote some of the various persons and bodies who made representations and submitted memoranda. Firstly I refer to the Coloured Council. They recommend a uniform system for the whole Republic; the standard should be equal to that of White education; compulsory education from six to 16, parallel medium schools and a feeding scheme. I am merely mentioning this because hon. members have said that the desirability of transfer was not discussed and that the people were confronted with a <i>fait accompli.</i> The Port Elizabeth Liaison Committee: Give every child full opportunities; ensure present standards; recommend Education Council. Uitenhage Liaison Committee: Compulsory education; take over primary schools and Church schools. Orange Free State Education Association: Appointments on merit; introduce vocational education and create opportunities for adult education. Keimoes Cultural Society: No inferior education; improve salaries; vocational education; provide for short courses. Cape Town Teachers: Appointment should receive attention; powers of school committee should be limited; salaries, Education Council. Teacher, Vredendal: Make stricter laws, with compulsory appointment of Coloured teachers as inspectors, Education Council. School Principal, Johannesburg: Be careful with Coloured inspectors; rather retain the Whites. School in Cape Town: Trust that transfer is the right thing and the outstanding event in the history of the Coloured people in South Africa. School Principal, Cape Town: There are several motives for the transfer of education; some are in favour and some are against it. So it goes on. But, furthermore, other aspects of Coloured education were also discussed at these meetings, and views were obtained from people and memoranda were submitted on the various aspects. The first aspect that is involved is compulsory education. This is not practicable; socio-economic conditions have first to be improved, and a greater sense of responsibility should first be fostered among the parents; not only Churches are in favour of this; permit the children to work for parents; introduce it gradually; first let the general wage structure be lifted; advance the age of admission with or without compulsory education. Then in regard to the inspectorate&#x2014;I cannot possibly read everything, but it shows that there really cannot be any doubt at all as to the real intention of the Minister in regard to the transfer. Then the memoranda refer to the inspectorate, and they say: Retain the present White inspectors: appoint only those Coloureds about whom there can be no doubt at all that they can be influenced; appoint Coloureds to work with Whites; ensure that the Coloureds will maintain the standards. I could proceed in this way and also refer to Church schools, and there the position is the same. The people were not confronted with a <i>fait accompli.</i> They had an opportunity to air their views. Some said: Permit the Church schools to expand as in the past; appoint educational experts as governors. Also in regard to school committees they say: Permit Whites also to serve in the committees; permit only the parents of children in a particular school to serve in those committees; let the parents elect three members and let the Department nominate four members. Then we come to the <span class="col_2057-2058" refersTo="page_1043"/>Education Council. I have read enough of this to show that there can be no question of there not having been the proper consultation. I think the hon. member for Bezuidenhout owes the Minister an apology for having misrepresented the position so completely.</p>

<p>As regards the aspect of suspicion: The hon. member for South Coast asks: What is the destiny? If the hon. member will read the Bill, he will find references in it to handicapped children, vocational schools, vocational education, commercial education, domestic science education, special education, nursery schools, primary schools, secondary schools, high schools, agricultural schools, industrial schools, Education Council for Coloureds, training schools, training colleges, special schools, State schools, State-aided schools, technical and vocational education and reform schools. Those are the things that are established in this Act and hon. members cannot ask: What is the destiny? If the hon. member had read the Bill, he would have seen clearly what the intention is. They say we are acting in a dishonest manner by transferring Coloured education to the Central Government, but I can understand hon. members from Natal emphasizing that the <i>status quo</i> should be retained, for they are unaware of the financial burden the Cape has to bear. They have to accommodate only 3.8 per cent of the Coloureds, and the expense is minimal. It amounts to only 3.18 per cent of the total expenditure of Natal, but in the Cape it is 18.51 per cent. We can also understand the Trans-yalers adopting that attitude, for in their case it is only 2.89 per cent, and in the Free State it is only .85 per cent of the total provincial expenditure. It is very clear that those hon. members are unaware of the tremendous financial burden the Cape has to bear, because the vast majority of the Coloureds are resident here, and for that very reason the Cape members have refrained from participating in the debate, for they are in a difficult predicament. They cannot go to the taxpayer and say he has to pay more taxes. What is the position here? In the Cape we are paying property tax and we are paying a health rate, not only the people in the rural areas but also the people in the urban areas. They are paying it to the Divisional Councils. In other words, the people in the Cape have to pay two taxes, one to the municipal council and the other to the divisional council, a matter that is strongly objected to at every municipal congress. In the Transvaal and the Free State they do not pay these taxes, nor in Natal. That is why the Cape representatives do not enter this debate. They cannot go to the taxpayers and say they advocated the retention of the <i>status quo.</i> What are the facts? We are paying all these taxes. That is why the Agricultural Union asked that a portion of the Cape be excised and added to the Transvaal so that they will not have to pay property taxes. I am very sorry for the hon. members of the Cape on the opposite side, but they are embarrassed now. What is more. I could quote how teachers have to walk about and go to the Chambers of Commerce and collect money from the business people for their schools, and the Chamber of Commerce has pointed out that although businessmen generally are sympathetically disposed to charity, it is felt that such requests from school principals in many instances constitute an additional tax. Do you see what it leads to? Every school principal wants to do the best for his children, but they lack the funds, and the provincial authorities cannot provide the necessary funds, and that is why they appeal to the public, to such an extent that these organizations now are complaining about it. That shows that there are no dishonest motives involved when we advocate the transfer of Coloured education to the Central Government.</p>

<p>But we go further. It has been repeatedly stated here: Why cannot a bigger subsidy be paid? But let us see what the true position is, and what the anomaly attached to it is. Let us examine the true position and see whether a higher subsidy will solve the problem. What is the anomaly? The sources of taxation of the Provincial Administrations are limited, and in the Cape those sources of taxation have been tapped to the full. The income-tax source, the personal tax source, motorcar licences, motor tax etc. have been tapped to the utmost extent, yet they are unable to supply the 50 per cent due from the Provincial Administration. From 1913 to 1925 we operated on a &#x00A3; for &#x00A3; basis, but from 1925 to 1945 they based it on a system of school attendance, but that did not work either, and they then reverted to the 50 per cent basis, but by 1956 they realized that this thing also did not work, and it was then decided that the Central Government could make its annual contribution on the basis of 1955-6 plus another 6 per cent annual increase. But that was not yet sufficient. They had to provide a special sum of money for Coloured Education. As a result of those constant manoeuvres they retained the position that the Cape would bear 50 per cent of the Provincial expenditure and that the State would contribute 50 per cent. This has been the position since 1955. But who can give us an assurance that the position is stabilized now? It is envisaged that in ten years&#x2019; time the provincial expenditure will be not R89,000,000, as it is now, but R144,000.000. During this period it is estimated that Coloured Education will increase by 100 per cent. In the report submitted to the Cabinet by the Economic Advisory Council, Professor Schumann says that Coloured education will amount to R34,000,000 by 1972, but then regard should be had to compulsory education, increases in teachers&#x2019; salaries, which will mean another R6,000,000 and add to that a further R20,000,000 to R28,000,000 for land and buildings. If the Cape were then still to contribute on a 50 per cent basis, what are our taxes going to be like? Remember, the 50 per cent remains the same, but it is not 50 per cent of R88,000,000, but 50 per cent of R144,000,000. The amount will be nearly doubled, and the taxpayer of the Cape will be the one called upon to foot the bill. The hon. member wishes to know why <span class="col_2059-2060" refersTo="page_1044"/>the subsidy cannot be increased. It cannot be increased. It will not reduce our taxes to such a great extent, but I should like to assure the hon. member that once this transfer has taken place, there will not be such a burdening of one section of the people year after year, and he can go and tell his constituents that. And if the hon. member is still in doubt on this or that aspect, then I say: Why are you in doubt? Why don&#x2019;t you accept this transfer so that we can at once get rid of all those extra taxes only because a certain section of the population lives mainly in the Cape Province? When doing business, one does business where one will not run any risks, if one is placed in a position to decide. That is my whole approach.</p>

<p>But now we come to the constitutional aspect of this whole matter. Mr. Speaker, if we look at the course of history: Why has South Africa left the Commonwealth? As a result of our racial policy. Why are we constantly regarded with suspicion by all the States of Africa and all the overseas countries?</p>

<p>Modestly I can tell him that this is only the beginning; there is still better to come. The hon. member was much concerned to emphasize that the Government has not gone into this proposal lightly. That I accept, but that does not make wrong right nor does it prove that a better course could not have been followed. We on this side of the House, of course, believe that a better course should have been followed. The hon. member was also much concerned with the question of taxation in the Cape Province. In that regard I will reply to some of his remarks in the course of my speech.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister has in the main justified the introduction of this legislation on the score that the cost of education of Coloured persons has become an intolerable financial burden on the Cape Province; or, as the <i>Burger</i> has paraphrased the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s argument, &#x201C;Kaapland kan dit nie langer be-kostig om Kleurlingonderwys te dra nie.&#x201D; Politically that may appear to be a plausible argument but fiscally and administratively it is no argument at all. What may sound politically ingenious on the part of the Government is factually and practically quite disingenuous. It is obvious that the financial burden which State controlled education places on the fiscus, i.e. on the public purse, becomes the greater as the demand for education by the masses becomes greater. Race and colour have nothing to do with the problem as such. The problem has emerged elsewhere in the world and is by no means unique to the Cape Province. Here, however, it is easier to look upon it as a racial problem instead of a fiscal problem because the masses are predominantly persons of colour. Elsewhere the remedy would be one of financial adjustment by means of fiscal devices. Here this Government can only see the problem as one calling for more legislation, for more apartheid, for more authoritarian rule and for more ministerial power. I say that elsewhere the task of meeting the problem would be an educational one of trying to meet the educational demand of the masses and it would be one for the educational department to settle with the help of suitable financial aids and fiscal devices. Sir, the accepted principle of public finance to regulate a matter of this sort is quite simple. It applies at all government levels and it applies in all countries. In simple terms it requires that contributions to the public purse should be based on ability to pay, while benefits derived from the public purse should accrue according to needs. In other words, the affluent section of the community contributes more in taxes than it gets back in services and in kind so that those who are not so affluent may share according to their needs. In so far as the cost of providing and subsidising education in the Cape Province has become unduly burdensome, the remedy is a straightforward one. The hon. member who has just sat down had a great deal to say about the question of taxation. I say that the remedy is a simple one. It is simply a financial adjustment between the Government and the province concerned.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I will answer the hon. the Minister in the words of the Prime Minister himself. This is purely a fiscal matter and I will demonstrate that by evidence even better than my own. You see, Sir, demands for education are admittedly becoming greater in the Cape Province, as elsewhere, and the tax-raising potential is not keeping pace with those demands. But it is not keeping pace, not because of the racial complexion of the parents, but because of their inability to contribute more to the public purse. Let no one be deluded therefore. The transfer of the control of education of one section of the community <span class="col_2061-2062" refersTo="page_1045"/>from the Province to the Government will not reduce the demands on the public purse. Indeed the setting up of yet another bit of State machinery to control primary and secondary education in the country as a whole, is likely to increase the cost, and unfortunately it is also likely to lower the standard of instruction because of the inevitable disruption which a change of this nature must bring about amongst existing teaching personnel. That is why I say that in practice this scheme is disingenuous, and the Minister&#x2019;s explanation must be recognized for what it is. Politically it is an excuse, not a justification for the introduction of the Bill. At this moment therefore Parliament could be better employed by exercising its financial functions instead of having to exercise its legislative functions. Sir, let no one be deluded. The sovereign remedy of an ill of this kind is not the passing of yet another Act of Parliament, especially an Act of Parliament which will add so extensively to the executive authority of a single Minister. I will come back to that disturbing feature of the Bill later on. Let me first of all refer to another disturbing feature which arises from an address which the hon. the Prime Minister gave to the Coloured Affairs Council in December 1961. My hon. friend, the member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) has referred to this document and I want to read out a quotation from it as well. This is the answer to the hon. the Minister who glibly suggested just now that I had found something which was an answer that nobody had found. Let me tell him that the Prime Minister found it himself. In this document, after stressing the question of the Department of Coloured Affairs taking over the education of Coloured persons, the Prime Minister went on to explain that normal Coloured taxation would finance this scheme. This is how he put the matter himself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Much suspicion has been stirred up as to where the money for such a development would have to come from. These services were at present financed from normal tax and therefore a double taxation machine was necessary.</block>

<p>I pause here to say that it is not quite clear to me what double taxation machine the hon. the Prime Minister was referring to, since whilst there are two bodies that imposed taxes, the Provincial Council and Parliament, the actual machinery for collection is the same. The Department of Inland Revenue does the collecting. The Prime Minister then continued in these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The direct and indirect taxes which were paid by Coloureds should be calculated so that a global sum could be paid over for the financing of the services under Coloured control. The Coloured control would then decide what could best be done with the money and would be responsible to their own people.</block>

<p>That quotation confirms that at least in the mind of the Prime Minister the matter before the House is essentially a money problem and I hope therefore that the Minister in his reply to this debate will answer two Questions that I want to put to him. The Bill itself, of course, is completely silent on this tricky question of finance, but this House and the persons mainly concerned, i.e. the Coloured community are entitled to know how the Prime Minister&#x2019;s financial scheme or vision of December 1961 is to be fitted in and is to be applied in practice under the provisions of this Bill. My questions to the hon. the Minister are these: Firstly, is it the intention of the Government when applying the appropriation provisions of this Bill to regulate the amount of money to be spent annually on Coloured education according to some predetermined ratio of the &#x201C;global sum&#x201D; which the Prime Minister has said can be easily calculated as being the total direct and indirect taxes paid into the public revenues by the Coloured community; and, as a supplement to that question, if that is so, will the hon. the Minister tell this House what proportion of that &#x201C;global sum&#x201D; is to go to Coloured education? My second question is whether it is the intention of the Government, in giving effect to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s financial scheme, to create now or in the near future a &#x201C;Coloured Education Account&#x201D; on the lines of the existing &#x201C;Bantu Education Account &#x201D;? These are both simple, straightforward questions and I think they call for simple and straightforward answers from the Minister. They are questions which are very pertinent to the financial arrangements which are set out in his Bill and 1 hope therefore that in replying to this debate the Minister will give an unequivocal answer to both questions which I have raised.</p>

<p>I come then to the administrative complications involved in the transfer of the control of Coloured education from the provinces to the Department of Coloured Affairs in terms of this Bill. You see, Sir, schools are human institutions, and I am now going to concern myself with the human side of this problem. Viewed from that angle and from the administrative angle, the Bill is a very complicated measure. It is not easy to assess how some of the provisions will work out in practice, but it will, of course, affect many hundreds of persons either as teachers or as pupils or as parents, and I hope therefore that the Minister will not in his reply overlook this human aspect of the problems with which we are concerned. In that regard the Bill raises many questions of principle, but it is only possible for me to deal with a few of these matters. As I have already said, the most alarming aspect of the Bill is the vast number of executive powers it vests in a single Minister. In most cases the powers so vested in the Minister are absolute. They are absolute powers which are not subject to any form of veto or review. For all practical purposes much of the verbiage of the Bill could be replaced by four simple words, &#x201C;die Minister bly baas &#x201D;. I would refer you. Sir, to Clause 7 in particular which in simple terms <span class="col_2063-2064" refersTo="page_1046"/>could simply read this way: &#x201C;The admission and dismissal of students shall be in the hands of the Minister.&#x201D; That is the simple effect of Clause 7 of this Bill. [Interjections.] It is most inhuman, I think, and it is placing an inhuman burden on one single Minister as well.</p>

<p>I do not think the Minister is superhuman and he will be the first to admit that, because it will require someone who is superhuman to carry out these vast powers. You see, excluding the definition clause, the short title and three consequential clauses amending other legislation, there are 33 operative clauses in this Bill. Two-thirds of those operative clauses, i.e. 22 of them, place in the hands of the Minister arbitrary powers or completely discretionary powers. In several instances the clause confers not one but many such arbitrary or discretionary powers which are placed in the hands of one single person. If hon. members want to question that let them just look at Clauses 11 and 18 to see the extraordinary powers which are being placed in the hands of a single person. No wonder then that the persons most affected by this Bill find little comfort in the legislation itself, and no wonder that the representatives of the Coloured community in this House want assurances from the Minister not about the legislation as such, but about how the legislation is to be applied in practice, because that is in fact the substance of the amendment&#x2014; not the legislation but how the legislation is going to be applied in practice.</p>

<p>One of the fears that has been voiced in the Press on behalf of the teaching personnel in Coloured schools is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A most unwelcome change is that all Coloured teachers now virtually become civil servants.</block>

<p>I say that there is substance in that fear, because as I read the relevant provisions of the Bill, the teaching staff will in future come within a new category of public servant, but they will be deprived of certain of the statutory safeguards that are accorded to the main body of public servants in South Africa in terms of the Service Charter, as set out in the Public Service Act of 1937 (Act No. 54 of 1937). Sir, I am dealing with the principles involved and not the detail and I can, of course, only refer therefore to a limited number of cases to substantiate that the fears which have been expressed on behalf of the Coloured teachers are not ill-founded. It is, of course, elementary that if the State is to have a contented Public Service, then Parliament as the final arbiter in all matters of administration must make sure that certain basic principles which govern employment in the Public Service are safeguarded in the law itself. The most important principle which govern employment in the Public Service is that the law which regulates the duties and the responsibilities of the servants must itself give adequate protection to the servants against any arbitrary action by the Government or by a Minister as the employer. I have indicated the extraordinary number of cases in which this Bill confers arbitrary powers on a single Minister. The principle which I have just enunciated is a perfectly clear one which governs and should govern all cases of employment in the Public Service. The justification for that is also quite clear. Because Coloured teachers under the terms of this Bill will not become statutory servants, as distinct from contractual servants, they will lose the right which they have as contractual servants under the common law. Let me explain the difference. Because the public servant is deprived of freedom of action in so many directions, his rights must be protected by statutory safeguards. In terms of this Bill the Coloured teachers will now fall into the category of an employee who cannot bargain on his own for better terms, because he now falls within a statutory group. He cannot freely offer his services to a different employer in future because there will be no competing employer for Coloured teachers, and basically he has only the rights and the privileges which are set out in the Bill and in the regulations. He has no other rights or privileges. Our courts have made that position perfectly clear. In Evans&#x2019; case 1920 T.P.D., the court said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A public servant is bound solely by the Statute. Whatever right that Statute gives him he possesses. Any rights which are not found to exist on a proper interpretation of the Statute, the public servant does not possess.</block>

<p>That is why I am stressing the general principle which is so important if you are going to have a contented Public Service, and that is why the Coloured teachers, the public servants of the future, are entitled to have statutory safeguards such as (1) security against reduction of emoluments; (2) security of tenure of office and against arbitrary dismissal and (3) the privilege of pension benefits. Let me traverse some of the provisions of this Bill. There is no general safeguard for instance, against reduction of emoluments as is to be found in Section 22 of the Public Service Act of 1957. Let me just read the provisions of that section for record purposes. Section 22 reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An officer&#x2019;s salary or the scale of salary shall not be reduced without his consent except in accordance with the provisions of Chapter IV &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is in the case of misconduct&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; or except in pursuance of an Act of Parliament.</block>

<p>Sir, when you look at the terms of this Bill you find that the safeguard is by no means as clear and unequivocal as that contained in Section 22. It is perfectly true that in the case of a transfer, Clause 14 (2) does give a limited amount of protection in that it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2065-2066" refersTo="page_1047"/>If a transfer will involve a reduction of pensionable emoluments, the person in question &#x2026; shall not be transferred without his consent&#x2014;</block>

<p>And it adds, unless it is in consequence of an act of misconduct. But there is no such protection given to the man who may be seconded by the Minister in terms of the powers which he has.</p>

<p>The second aspect to which I want to draw attention is that whilst it is true that the fixing of salary scales and allowances is dependent on the Public Service Commission having first made recommendation&#x2014;and that is in terms of Clause 11 (1)&#x2014;but when you come to the question of the appointment, the promotion or the transfer of the individual, we find that the power vests entirely in the Minister. There he has certainly got arbitrary, complete discretionary power, to appoint or to promote or to transfer. Under the Public Service Act, however, the appointment or promotion of an individual are dependent on a prior recommendation by the Public Service Commission. That is a most valuable safeguard which any public servant is entitled to have, but it is absent from the provisions of this Bill. And that is not the worst. Where the Public Service Commission is required in terms of this Bill to make a recommendation the hon. the Minister is not bound to accept that recommendation. He can change it at will. Nowhere in this Bill is there any safeguard to ensure that the individual receives any protection in any way. Once the Public Service Commission has made its recommendation it becomes <i>functus officio</i> under this provision, therefore it ceases to operate. As far as the individual is concerned, whether he may or may not know what the effect of that recommendation is as far as he is concerned, he is completely remediless. On the contrary, Sir, in the Public Service Act there are safeguards which are of great value to the public servants. The first one is this that the Public Service Commission is obliged to report to Parliament annually. I will read one of the provisions which calls upon it to report to Parliament&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Government is unable or unwilling to adopt or rejects or varies a recommendation, the Commission shall report the matter to Parliament either by means of a special report or by means of its annual report. (Section 7 (7).)</block>

<p>Moreover, Sir, the Public Service Act safeguards the right of the individual where a recommendation favourable to him had been made. There is provision that having made this recommendation it shall be carried out by the Government, unless it alters it. If it alters it, it shall also be carried out as altered, and if in a stated period&#x2014;usually six months&#x2014; nothing is done the individual becomes entitled to the benefits which have been included in that recommendation. These matters are basic to employment in Government service. Those safeguards are singularly absent when you read the provisions of this Bill, complicated as they are, and I can assure you, Sir, that they are extremely complicated as far as the individual is concerned. Nor is there any safeguard to protect the prior rights of a Coloured teacher who, in terms of this Bill, now becomes a State servant. I will again quote from the Public Service Act to show the extent to which that Statute protects the individual. Section 31 reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No provision of this Act shall be construed as in any way abrogating, or derogating from any existing, accruing or contingent rights, liability or obligation to any person flowing from any other law.</block>

<p>The teacher who has contractual rights in a State-aided school, once that State-aided school is taken over by the Minister&#x2014;and he can take it over on consultation alone&#x2014;that individual becomes a State servant He becomes a State servant in terms of Clause 10. It is true that he is given a limited amount of protection in Clause 11 (2) which says that his conditions of service shall remain the same. And then come the significant words &#x201C;unless or until the Minister determines otherwise &#x201D;. So there again, Sir, we have the situation that only a limited amount of protection is given to him; he is really placed at the mercy of one single individual whose decision is final and not subject to any form of veto or review.</p>

<p>Viewed in the light of the absence of any adequate statutory safeguards such as those that I have mentioned&#x2014;I am obviously only able to deal with some; not with all&#x2014;all I can say at this stage is that the comment that was made in the Press on behalf of the Coloured teachers is a very modest one. I shall read it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A most unwelcome change is that all teachers now virtually become Public Servants. Up to now this has not been the case and the Coloured teachers will not like the change at all.</block>

<p>I can only repeat that it is a modest way of setting out a position which is going to affect the human side of schools very very greatly. It is a matter which I think is sufficient to deter this Government from proceeding with the Bill which is before us to-day.</p>

<speech by="#treurnicht">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TREURNICHT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down always gives me the impression of being a person who has a reasonably wide knowledge of subjects and who can participate in discussions on many matters. But he has one unmistakable characteristic and that is that he always succeeds in burying in his speech the case which he is advocating. Once he has finished speaking he really does not know what he said and what he wanted to say. I must say that in any case the hon. member once again succeeded in making all of us forget what he was talking about. I tried to follow the hon. member to the best of my ability and I think that he made more or less two points which are of interest in regard to this matter. The rest of <span class="col_2067-2068" refersTo="page_1048"/>his speech dealt more with the Public Service Commission, the Public Service and so forth. He tried to simplify the question of Coloured education and he tried to make out that the whole matter would be solved simply by way of financial adjustment. He complained further about the increasing power of the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs.</p>

<p>The history of Coloured education and the history of education in the Cape has, over the years, become a great problem to the various Provincial Councils and particularly the Cape Provincial Council. This shows that the question of financial adjustment is not such a simple matter. It is not a problem which is easily solved. Every Administrator finds himself saddled each year with this problem of doing justice to Coloured education within the limits of the funds at his disposal. This is a problem which has also retarded the whole development of Coloured education with the result that it has not made good progress. It has also impeded White education in the Cape and has frustrated development in various other directions. As has already been said, this has imposed a very heavy burden on the Cape. I do not want to try to follow the hon. member any further because much of what he said was not germane to this particular debate.</p>

<p>I want to start by referring to three historical facts which we must take into account in a discussion of this nature.</p>

<p>The first fact that I want to emphasize is that we have developed a system of separate education for the Coloureds over the years and this fact must be borne in mind in discussing the transfer of Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs. This system of separate education for the Coloureds is one which has grown from our history; it is a system which we cannot break away from. We have separate schools for the Coloured child throughout the whole of the Cape Province and in the other provinces as well.</p>

<p>There is another fact that I want to mention and that is that in the religious sphere the Coloureds have developed their own separate Church. History has taught us that this system of separate education for the Coloureds and a separate Church for the Coloureds&#x2014;the vast majority of the Coloured people belong to the D.R. Mission Church&#x2014;is the best thing for the Coloured people. Over the years it has given them the best opportunity to look after their own religious and educational matters. Although there has been further development in the religious sphere, separate education for the Coloured has only reached a certain point; in other words it has been separate education only in the sense that there have been separate classrooms and separate school buildings and Coloured teachers for the Coloured child.</p>

<p>The third historical fact that I want to mention is the establishment of the Department of Coloured Affairs. This is a comparatively recent development and yet this development has, during the few years of its existence, demonstrated that we are dealing here with a particular direction in the interests of the Coloured people. I do not think that there is one State Department which has been able to do so much in such a short time for the particular cause which it has been serving as the Department of Coloured Affairs has done. That is why in this short period the Coloureds have begun to look to the Department of Coloured Affairs more and more for guidance, not only in regard to their socio-economic development but also in regard to their spiritual and mental development. The Department of Coloured Affairs is taking the lead to-day in the development of Coloured residential townships and in the building up of local authorities for the Coloured people. The Department is taking the lead in training the Coloureds in administrative work. The Department of Coloured Affairs already controls higher education for the Coloureds. In this development of the Coloured people there is one important shortcoming, and that is that the matter which is fundamental to all Coloured progress is controlled by other bodies, bodies other than the Department of Coloured Affairs, and that matter is the education of the Coloureds which is controlled by the provinces. There is no doubt that we have to deal here with a practical shortcoming&#x2014;I might almost call it impediment&#x2014;in that the Department of Coloured Affairs, which guides the Coloured people along the road of development, which assists them socio-economically, which gives them the opportunity to enjoy higher education, which helps then enter a section of the Public Service, can have nothing to do with the education of the Coloured people. It cannot direct that education into really useful channels so that the Coloureds will be trained in the best way possible to make use of the opportunities which are open to them. I want to emphasize this point very strongly to-day that under the present regime the Department of Coloured Affairs which the Coloureds look to for assistance and guidance and which is accepted by the Coloured people as the appointed body to assist them in their progress, is not able to look after the education of the Coloureds also and to fit it into the whole pattern of Coloured development. In other words, as things stand at present, the Department of Coloured Affairs is like a cripple trying to help another cripple. We will only be able to serve the interests of the Coloured people in the best way if we also give the Department of Coloured Affairs this other leg so that it can look after the interests of the Coloureds as a strong unit. If there are shortcomings in the present system, they are inherent in this divided control of Coloured education in the various provinces. Coloured education has always been treated as an appendage of White education. Good work has been done, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;let us admit it. Good work has been done under the circumstances but we have reached the stage where we are experiencing a particularly rapid development on the part of the Coloured people. New opportunities are arising for them. They are faced with <span class="col_2069-2070" refersTo="page_1049"/>new challenges now and we have reached a stage where the Provincial Administrations are simply not able to meet the demands of the times and readily to equip the Coloured people for the task which lies ahead of them.</p>

<p>I want also to mention another shortcoming in the existing system, and that is the fact that in the past, Coloured education was an appendage of White education, because it was too loosely connected with the national character and needs of life peculiar to the Coloured people. It took too little account of the national character and the particular requirements of the Coloured people. It needs no expert to realize that in spite of their diversity, we have to deal with an individual group of the population, people with their own way of life and with their own outlook on life, and that their education cannot merely be something which is incidental to White education if it is to be really effective.</p>

<p>The figures have been mentioned here. The percentage of failures in the Senior Certificate Examination as far as the Coloureds are concerned is about 35 per cent or 40 per cent, while that for the Whites is much lower. This leads me to think that there is a lack of understanding in regard to the nature and the needs of the Coloured people. That is one of the reasons&#x2014;I do not say that it is the only one&#x2014;for this unduly high percentage of failures amongst the Senior Certificate Coloured candidates.</p>

<p>Another shortcoming in the system of Coloured education is that there is no positive aim, there is no clear goal. That is why there are so many Coloured boys and girls who leave school and do not know what they are going to do. The reason for this is that they have not been trained for a specific task because they have really not undergone the preparation needed to become fully-fledged members of society.</p>

<p>Another shortcoming in the present system is that there is so little of what is peculiar to the Coloured in Coloured education and the fact that the Coloureds can contribute so little themselves towards the system of Coloured education which is offered them. To a large extent it is White education which is given to them, as a favour. The Coloured teacher has little opportunity to make a positive contribution to the curriculum and the content of the education which the Coloured child receives. Besides this, the Coloured teacher has little control over and little share in the administration of Coloured education. In other words, Coloured teachers and education leaders have no say in regard to the essence and the scope of Coloured education and those matters which should fall in with the national characteristics of the Coloureds. This has remained a very important shortcoming of this system. There is another shortcoming and that is the lack of funds, a shortcoming which is always raised in regard to Coloured education. Hon. members opposite cannot escape the fact that Coloured education is often impeded by this stumbling-block of a lack of funds. The funds of the provinces are limited and they simply cannot make sufficient funds available to make Coloured education effective. They cannot supply the necessary facilities for suitable education.</p>

<p>I have stood up before in the Provincial Council and asked the hon. the Administrator whether we could not move in the direction of giving more technical training to the Coloureds; whether we could not move in the direction of specialized training so that a Coloured child leaving school, whether in Standard eight or Standard ten, could find a position which would enable him to become a useful person. The reply I received was: Unfortunately, the province does not make those services available and we do not have the necessary funds. What else is this but an admission by the highest authority that the province is powerless to make available really effective and positive Coloured education? That is why one of the sore points in the present set-up is that a great deal of human material is lost because of the lack of the necessary guidance and vocational training and information. I telephoned the head of the Department of Psychological Services of the Provincial Administration last week and asked him whether he had a good intelligence test for Coloureds. I asked him whether comparative tests had been made by means of which the White and Coloured child could be compared with one another to assist us in directing the Coloured child along the correct channels. The reply of the head of that particular service was: Sorry; we are engaged upon it but so far we have made no progress. In other words, Mr. Speaker, the head of the Department of Psychological Services here in Cape Town admitted that we actually do not yet know the Coloured child. We do not yet know what his potential is. We do not know what his particular aptitude is. But hon. members opposite want the matter to stay as it is. If the Central Government were merely to make more money available it would not rectify this matter. On the contrary, we have to deal here with a matter which is a challenge to us; which reassures further investigation and further study and challenges us to utilize and harness the Coloured person in education so that he can make a positive contribution towards the education of his own child. Is this not something which we owe the Coloured child and the Coloured people in general? I want to go so far as to say that we will be committing a crime if we continue offering the Coloured merely what we think is good for him. To my mind it is necessary for the Department of Coloured Affairs to take over this service and not only for the Coloured people to be consulted in connection with the question of the take-over, but that the Coloured people will be further consulted and asked: What is your opinion of and what will you contribute to the curriculum of the Coloured child, to the education of the Coloured child in order to make him a worthy citizen of South Africa? We cannot <span class="col_2071-2072" refersTo="page_1050"/>get away from the variety of national groups in our population. We cannot deny that we have to deal here with a group of the population which is fundamentally different from the Whites even though there are many points of similarity. It is this difference exactly, this difference which is a challenge to us. We must keep in mind and we must offer the Coloured people a new adjustment having regard to the demands of the time. That is why it is important to my mind that we give the Coloured people a new r&#x00E9;gime in education and not merely a little more money, as was advocated by the hon. member for Hillbrow. To his mind, in the detailed survey of the history of Coloured education which he gave us here, the whole solution to the problem is simply: The provinces must have more money. But he as an educationist knows that the matter is not so simple. Let me remind the hon. member that we have to deal here with a considerable section of our population. There are 300,000 Coloured boys and girls of schoolgoing age at school to-day. This is a large number for our country and it creates a great problem in regard to the future of our country and the development of our industries. There are probably at least 50,000 more who are not yet at school. Let us make no secret of the fact that it is our responsibility to get the Coloured people to help themselves. Let us urge them to see to it that all of those schoolgoing children attend school if possible. We do not only owe this to the Coloured people but we also owe it to South Africa. I am convinced of the fact that if there is one body which will make this possible it will be the Department of Coloured Affairs and not the Provincial Administrations because they are hampered by a lack of funds.</p>

<p>Let me say further that we need a new regime because we have to deal with a swiftly developing community in South Africa. The Coloured people are one of the most swiftly developing communities in South Africa at this time, on the one hand because there is so much opportunity for them and on the other hand because the demands of the time are so great. As is the case with any other nation in the world, they ask to be permitted to play an active part in their own development. The Department of Coloured Affairs gives them that opportunity in other spheres &#x2014;in their own local authorities and in the Public Service in the Department of Coloured Affairs. They receive that opportunity in their community associations and so forth. It is also most important that the Coloured people should play an active part in the education of their children and this can best be done by placing Coloured education under the Department of Coloured Affairs. There is moreover the challenge to the Coloured people at this stage to serve their own people in a variety of professions. There is a need for Coloured doctors; there is a need for Coloured attorneys; there is a need for people to serve the Coloureds in various spheres, for example, in the commercial sphere. There has to be a controlling body covering the whole field, a body which can give guidance and arrange matters so that those opportunities will be created for the Coloured people. Because the Coloured community is developing so swiftly at this stage and because there are so many opportunities for them it is very important that Coloured education be lifted out of its old groove; that Coloured education be used to help the Coloureds ahead so that they can make a positive contribution towards the development of the country.</p>

<p>I want to add that this Department knows the needs of the Coloureds, the nature of the Coloureds better than any of the Provincial Administrations do. And moreover, this Department will enable more Coloured teachers, people who have a knowledge and experience of the education of the Coloured child, to participate administratively in Coloured education. In other words, there are new possibilities for promotion for Coloured teachers. Let us give them what is their due. We are convinced that where they have the opportunity they will grasp it and not disappoint us.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I was disappointed last week at the speech of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) who is a responsible front-bencher on the other side. I was surprised when he stood up and reversed the policy of the National Party and said that it was a policy of discrimination. He was replying to what the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) had said. The hon. member for Malmesbury had said that he did not want to be incorrectly understood. He had said: &#x201C;I want it to be very clearly understood that I am not speaking of inferior education, but of the differentiated education of the Coloured with a view to the circumstances in which he finds himself Then the hon. member for South Coast stood up and said that the hon. member for Malmesbury had said that our policy was one of discrimination. He translated &#x201C;differentiation&#x201D; by &#x201C;discrimination &#x201D;. But surely any hon. member in this House is able to translate &#x201C;differensiasie&#x201D; by &#x201C;differentiation &#x201D;? To translate it by &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; is rather droll to my mind and I really did not expect this of the hon. member for South Coast. But that is the way hon. members opposite argue. Their arguments do not hold water. I want to repeat that our view on this side of the House is that we want to give the Coloured people in this country every opportunity to develop as a happy community and as a developed community so that they can make a worthy contribution to the welfare and progress of South Africa. I am also convinced of the fact that they will make that contribution. Our policy is not one of discrimination but a policy of the development of the variety&#x2014;differentiation&#x2014;by means of which the national characteristics of each national group are considered. In terms of this policy those groups have the opportunity of contributing to the prosperity of all according to their own national characteristics, their own talents and possibilities, and most of all, towards the prosperity of their own national group.</p>

<p><span class="col_2073-2074" refersTo="page_1051"/>And so I want to conclude with a few general remarks. We are living in particular times and the Coloured people find themselves in particular circumstances of the times. World politics are in a turmoil and I have been struck over the past years by the fact that the Coloured people have acted in a fairly mature manner. They have gradually come to realize that in order to progress they should talk less and work harder. The Coloured people are awakening to the idea of hard and faithful work, and that is the key to the future. It is a striking fact that they have learnt to withstand the political assaults which are being made to-day on the lesser developed nations of the world and to find their own way and their own direction. They are participating to-day in the swift industrial development in South Africa and they are doing so successfully. They are producing professional people who can stand on their own feet and even in the Public Service they are making use of the opportunity offered to them by means of which they will eventually hold responsible positions in the Department of Coloured Affairs. That is why we have high hopes for the Coloured people and we are convinced that it is the policy of separate development of the National Party which is giving the Coloured people their best opportunities. We are convinced that the taking-over of Coloured education by the Department of Coloured Affairs is not only necessary but that it will give the Coloured people a particular opportunity not merely of participating in their own education but also of having a share in the content of Coloured education, in order by so doing to make their contribution to the development of our country in their own particular way.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Piketberg (Mr. Treurnicht) tried to convince the House that the transfer of Coloured education is desirable for the future of the Coloured people. He studiously avoided the basic difference between his party&#x2019;s political views and the views of the Opposition. Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to be consistent in this matter from a political point of view. That is more than I can say about some of the Government members opposite. Our amendment is on record, but I would be failing in my duty as a Representative of the Coloured people if I did not point out certain aspects of this matter. Mr. Speaker, two very important features have become evident during the debate. The one is the question of finance and the other, in my opinion, is a purely political aspect. I believe, as the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) indicated, that this question which was raised by the Government side of the very heavy financial burden is merely a red-herring. There is no substance in it. But they believe that this legislation is an important piece in the crazy jigsaw puzzle of apartheid. The hon. member who has just spoken clearly indicated that that is the viewpoint of the Government party. It is part and parcel of the Government&#x2019;s policy.</p>

<p>and I might describe it in this way, that the Government has built a Berlin Wall between the Whites and the Coloureds in South Africa. They have built a wall dividing two sections of the same nation, as in Berlin the Germans of the West and the Germans of the East have been divided. Two people belonging to the same nation, divided in South Africa, not only on ideological grounds but on the basis of colour, and every step that the Government has taken in regard to legislation in respect of the Coloured people has been one brick more to build up this wall and making it higher and broader and making it completely impossible for the Coloured people eventually to come over to us again as it is their desire to do. Mr. Speaker, to show my consistency I want to quote from the debate that took place in 1959.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Sir, it deals with Coloured education. I want to say that we were watching out for this type of legislation for years, because the Coloured people were afraid and they asked us to watch developments, and in March 1959 (Hansard, Col. 2955) I said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am very concerned about the statement made by the Deputy Minister of the Interior that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to transfer the control of Coloured education from the provincial councils to the Central Government. Of course that would be a most retrogressive step, and we will have much more to say about it if it does come about.</block>

<p>And what did the then Minister of the Interior say?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the moment I cannot give him any assurance. This is as far as I have gone. I do not know what may be contemplated in the future. There are no other matters for which I think provision should be made. I have not given this question of Coloured education any consideration.

<p>Despite the fact that in 1957, when I was a member of the Provincial Council of the Cape Province, there was a resolution asking the Government to take over Coloured education, two years later, in 1959, the Minister of the Interior, in charge of that particular Department, said that he had not yet considered it.</p>

<p>Now the present Minister of Coloured Affairs then took the unprecedented step last year of forestalling&#x2014;and I give him credit for <span class="col_2075-2076" refersTo="page_1052"/>it as a clever political move&#x2014;of forestalling this issue. He made a statement in this House and said that the Government was going to take over Coloured education. There was no legislation before the House, there was no motion. What happened?

<block name="quote"><span class="col_2077-2078" refersTo="page_1053"/>U kommissie wil hier weereens beklem-toon dat die finansiele verligting vir byvoor-beeld Kaapland nie as argument mag ge-bruik word ten gunste van &#x2019;n oordrag van Kleurlingonderwys nie. Soos in Hoofstuk I, paragraaf 12, gestel, kan die kommissie hom nie vereenselwig met die oorweging dat &#x2019;n bepaalde diens van een openbare liggaam na &#x2019;n ander oorgedra moet word omdat laasgenoemde oor meer fondse beskik nie. Die nodige fondse moet beskikbaar gestel word aan die liggaam wat &#x2019;n gegewe diens of taak, alles in aanmerking geneem, die beste kan verrig.</block>

<p>This is an extract and if the hon. member wants to see it I will give it to him. I merely am trying to show that those hon. members of the House who wish to convince the public outside that this is a necessary step on account of finance, are not correct, that is merely eye-wash. I want to read to you what an Administrator said when this matter was raised in the Provincial Council. I have been told that it was the present Administrator, but it may have been a previous Administrator, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mnr. die Voorsitter, die agb. lid vir Moorreesburg (mnr. J. E. van der Merwe) het gepraat oor Kleurlingonderwys en ge-vra dat die Unie-regering dit moet oor-neem, dat die provinsie Kleurlingonderwys moet oordra aan die Unie-regering. Ek wil graag verduidelik wat die finansi&#x00EB;le uitwer-king sou wees indien die Unie-regering Kleurlingonderwys sou oorneem, want dit blyk die algemene opinie te wees dat indien Kleurlingonderwys oorgeneem word, ons &#x00A3;5,000,000 tot &#x00A3;7,000.000 ekstra sou h&#x00EA; vir dienste in Kaapland, en dit is nie die geval nie. Vir die lopende diensjaar sal Kleurlingonderwys ongeveer &#x00A3;7,000,000 kos. Agb. lede kan dit sien op Pos 2, bladsy 22 van die Begroting. Die gewone subsidie van die Tesourie is naasteby 50 per cent. Dus is die helfte van die &#x00A3;7,000,000, d.w.s. &#x00A3;3,500,000, reeds deur die Tesourie gedek. Maar ons ont-vang ook van die Tesourie &#x2019;n spesiale toelae, wat vanjaar &#x00A3;1,800,000 beloop, wat ons kan verwag sal onttrek word met die oorplasing van Kleurlingonderwys van die provinsie na die Sentrale Regering. Dus kan verwag word dat ons aan inkomste &#x00A3;3,500,000 sal ver-loor. plus &#x00A3;1,800,000. &#x2019;n totaal van &#x00A3;5,300,000, wat &#x2019;n balans van slegs &#x00A3;1,700.000 sal oorlaat. Die provinsie het tans die reg om Kleurlinge net soos Blanke te belas, maar as Kleurlingonderwys oorge-plaas word, kan ons verwag dat die Regering ook die provinsie se reg om Kleurlinge te belas moontlik sal inkort. Dit sal die provinsie op die ou end veel minder baat as wat sommige agb. lede skyn te dink. Ook moet ons onthou dat as nog &#x2019;n onderwys-department in die lewe geroep word, sal die totale administrasiekoste heelwat ho&#x00EB;r wees. Die provinsiale belastingbetalers betaal ook Unie-belasting. en die ho&#x00EB;r koste, na oorplasing, sal tog deur dieselfde belastingbetalers gedra moet word. Sal dit nie goedkoper wees vir die Regering om ruimer bystand aan die provinsie te verleen nie, en dat ons dan Kleurlingonderwys behou liewer as om dit oor te dra? Dit is die vraag wat ons onsself behoort te stel. Die Raad behoort al hierdie feite baie goed in gedag-te te hou wanneer daar gepraat word van die oordrag van Kleurlingonderwys.</block>

<p>I am quoting from &#x201C;Christian National Education&#x201D;, and the Coloured people have drawn my attention to this. The hon. the Minister is trying to anticipate what I am going to conclude my speech with. I did not interrupt him when he spoke, and I want to tell the hon. Minister now that it is no use him getting hot under the collar, because <span class="col_2079-2080" refersTo="page_1054"/>I repeat with all the emphasis at my command, that the Coloured people are not happy at this moment about the change. They may be wrong, they may find that they were wrong in opposing this step. Only the future can tell. But we are talking about this legislation at the moment. There is another extract from this &#x201C;Christian National Education&#x201D;, and it goes like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The welfare and happiness of the Coloured lies in his understanding that he belongs to a separate racial group (hence apartheid is necessary in education), and in his being proud of it &#x2026; Coloured education must not be financed at the expense of White education.</block>

<p>Those are matters which rather frighten the Coloured people, this fear of Government people to use money which they claim comes only from the White taxpayers, to be used for Coloured education. I was in the Provincial Council in 1957, when the hon. member for Malmesbury moved a motion which read&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this Council requests the Administrator to make urgent representations to the Central Government for the taking over of Coloured education.</block>

<p>I was there, and as usual he made a typical organizer&#x2019;s speech. The late Mr. Olivier, was then Administrator, but unfortunately he was ill that day and he could not be present during the debate, but he sent us a message and he informed us that he was quite happy in respect of the next three years at least, because he had received an increased subsidy from the Government which would last him for about three years, from 1957 to 1960. He was a Nationalist, who was a member of the Nationalist Party in this House, but threw off the cloak of party politics when he became Administrator, and there he sent a message to say that he was quite happy with the position at the time.</p>

<block name="quote">The Minister of Coloured Affairs informed the Administrator &#x2026; that the Cabinet had decided that all matters pertaining to Coloured education be transferred to the Central Government and that legislation to provide for it will be introduced during the next parliamentary session.</block>

Therefore the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) moved an amendment and we therefore hope that the answer to these questions will be given. We do not expect that the Coloureds will be very happy, but there will be some sort of compensation if they know that the questions we have asked of the Government will be answered in the affirmative.

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think it is necessary to take the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) very seriously. We are accustomed to his making contact with certain groups of his voters, and it is clear which groups they are&#x2014; and sets his sails according to their wind, but always towards the end of his speech he makes a wide turn so as to be able to get some of the praise if something good should emanate from the legislation.</p>

<p>I think what is basic to the discussion to the transfer of Coloured education to the Central Government is the recognition of the Coloured as a differentiated section of the population with their own needs, with an individual way of life and a particular place in our country. This debate shows the difference in the approach of the two main parties. The Government Party sees the Coloureds as a particular group, a section of the population which largely shares the White Western way of life, which talks our languages and, on the other hand, also has its own characteristic customs and a way of life peculiar to itself, and which is still poor and backward in many respects, and for that reason needs much assistance in order to develop. But at the same time this side of the House regards the Coloureds as a great potential for the development of the country, and we realize, without belittling them in any way, that they are still poor, but we believe that that must be recognized and remedied in order to give them a decent living in this country. The National Party has made it its task to assist the <span class="col_2083-2084" refersTo="page_1056"/>Coloureds, and the announced programme of socio-economic development for the Coloureds is the key to that task, and we believe that education is really the key to everything in that programme. Opportunities must thereby be created for the Coloureds to improve their position and thereby become an asset to the country. The Coloured must be assisted to help himself. This belief is also shared by responsible Coloured leaders. I should like to quote the opinion of a responsible Coloured leader and educationist in my constituency, Mr. P. M. Williams, who said the following last year at the Conference of Coloured Teachers at the University College of the Western Cape&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Department of Coloured Affairs has to provide everything, the perseverance of the teachers will be derogated from. The Department should just supply the essentials and the teachers must carry on from there. The teachers should teach the child to work. Let us win the confidence of our people through work and will-power &#x2026;</block>

<p>I say it is encouraging that the views held by this side of the House in regard to the position of the Coloureds and the task ahead of it is shared by responsible Coloured leaders.</p>

<p>But I regret that hon. members opposite have a totally different view of the matter. They do not want to regard the Coloured as an individual national group. In debates of this nature they express those views, but when they go outside they treat the Coloureds as an inferior group. This behaviour cannot but give one the impression that the Opposition&#x2019;s political philosophy as to the position of the Coloureds and its practical politics differ as day from night. In debates of this nature the Opposition acts as the spokesman for the leftist element amongst the Coloureds, and they usually allege that the Government is suppressing the Coloureds. But now I want to ask hon. members opposite what they have specifically done for the Coloured population in the many years during which they were in power? In practice the behaviour of the party opposite in regard to the Coloureds clearly amounts to &#x201C;the survival of the fittest &#x201D;. In theory they believe that they should be treated as equals, but in practice they do not care what happens to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) spoke about larger subsidies to the provinces for Coloured education. Listening to him and to other hon. members opposite, one would have said that this is very easy. The State must just pay a much larger subsidy, but not a single word was said about how that subsidy should be spent to the advantage of the Coloureds in order to improve their position by means of their education. This argument was often used when they referred to the cost of the transfer of Coloured education, but there is no deep interest in the education of the Coloureds. They are not concerned about how the money is to be used. That is the sort of attitude which will result in the Coloureds, as the weaker economic group, retrogressing further and further. We have had the same attitude from the Opposition in regard to every measure passed by the Government so far to assist the Coloureds. They adopted precisely the same attitude in regard to the establishment of the Department of Coloured Affairs, with the taking over of special education, with the legislation for the establishment of the University College of the Western Cape, with the legislation to establish the Coloured Development Corporation, and precisely the same attitude in regard to the rural Coloured areas, when we had to hear from them that this was now the beginning of the establishment of Colouredstans. And they are adopting the same attitude in regard to this Bill. We have heard the same arguments of inferior education that we heard when the University College was established. At that time they spoke about &#x201C;the college in the bush &#x201D;. In this debate the amendment of the hon. member for Peninsula says it will mean inferior education.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>It was also stated in the amendment that this Bill would make the relations between the Whites and the Coloureds more difficult. But I want to tell the hon. member that it is this attitude and these views that they disseminate amongst extremist elements, that it will be inferior education, which makes relations more difficult. I want to ask hon. members whether they can point to anything inferior in the steps hitherto taken by the Government and this Department to improve the lot of the Coloured? I do not mind criticism, because it can have a wholesome effect, but if the Opposition cannot point to anything inferior in the results achieved by this Department they should not use such arguments. Is it not true that an infinite new world has been opened to the Coloureds in South Africa since the Government announced its policy for the socio-economic development of the Coloureds? If hon. members opposite cannot get any further with this type of argument about inferior education, they go to the provinces of which there is only one where they can still frighten the people, namely Natal, and say that it means the curtailment of provincial powers knowing, as the hon. member for Hillbrow knows, that his political friends in Natal are very sensitive on this point.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>Now he tries to frighten them by saying that their powers will be taken away or curtailed. I think the people in the Free State are a little more politically mature so that they will not be frightened by such allegations.</p>

<p>I do not want to derogate from what the provinces have done in regard to education <span class="col_2085-2086" refersTo="page_1057"/>and the other functions entrusted to them, but with reference to the allegation made by the hon. member for Hillbrow this Bill will curtail provincial powers, I just want to ask this: Has the provincial system been introduced to be served, or is it there to serve the province and the country? I believe that this system was wisely created to serve the citizens of the country, but I also believe that when circumstances develop which at that time were not foreseen, and if the provincial system cannot cope with the position, supplementary functions should be taken over by the Central Government, not because the Government is so keen on doing it but simply because circumstances force it to do so.</p>

<p>The argument is also advanced that this Bill means that the status of the Provincial Education Departments will be derogated from. I cannot believe that. On the contrary, I believe that the status of the Provincial Education Departments will suffer particularly as a result of a shortage of funds and if as the result of developing circumstances they cannot cope with the requirements of Coloured education. The hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) said that the transfer of Coloured education to the Central Government would lead to further fragmentation. Sir, it is nothing new that the particular needs of a particular group lead to special permission being made for that group. I have never heard hon. members opposite complain about fragmentation because of the fact that certain people in their ranks formerly decided that there should be private schools in which certain principles to which they adhered should be applied, schools which in the words of one of their leaders should be &#x201C;unashamedly English &#x201D;. I believe that it was in order to meet the particular needs of that group of the population that they established such schools. At a later stage departmental singlemedium schools were also established. I believe that it was in order to meet the particular needs of that particular group that they took that step. But then I cannot see how the hon. member can allege that for the socio-economic development of the Coloureds the transfer of their education to the Department of Coloured Affairs which concentrates on the advancement of the Coloureds is tantamount to fragmentation.</p>

<p>I should like to pay tribute to the various Provincial Administrations for what they have done and what they are still doing in connection with education, but they are being restricted by a lack of funds as well as other means. The Administrations are not always equipped to be able to judge where people should be fitted in so as to be able to make a good economic living. Our Provincial Administrations are not equipped for it. It is precisely because of this need that the State has now taken it upon itself, in its plan to uplift the Coloured, to transfer his education to the Department of Coloured Affairs. I do not think anybody can level the reproach against this Department and its officials&#x2014;and I was glad to hear this tribute from the hon. member for Boland&#x2014;that in this great task which they have undertaken and to which the hon. the Minister has also devoted his energies, they have never neglected to do their duty. I believe that because of this divided control the place that should be occupied by the Coloured is not appreciated by the Provincial Administrations as well as it is appreciated by a department which is in touch daily with the needs and problems of the Coloureds. There is a multiplicity of systems in the provinces in respect of Coloured education. In the Cape Province we find that a large portion of education is the responsibility of the various denominations of which there is a large number. In the Transvaal we find that quite a number of Coloured children have to attend school together with the children of Asiatics and in the Free State we find that Coloured education is administered as a subdivision of Bantu education. In the provinces we find that there are various forms of instruction and divided control of Coloured education, which cannot be sound. As far as the financial aspect is concerned, I believe that it is the Coloured who suffers as far as his education is concerned, because the necessary means are not always available. It appears from the report of the Schumann Commission that in the Cape Province 90 per cent of the Provincial revenue is contributed by Whites and only 8.7 per cent by the Coloureds, but as far as expenditure is concerned, only 60.3 per cent of the expenditure is devoted to White services and 33 per cent to the Coloureds. It so happens that provincial revenue is derived mainly from direct taxes and that is why it is felt, since this position is developing, that it would be much more correct for the State, which to a large extent also gets the indirect taxation, which is also paid by the Coloureds in the form of excise duties, etc., to plough this money back for the education of Coloureds.</p>

<p>The point has also been raised that it will cost too much to transfer Coloured education to the Central Government, but I believe that it will always be worth while incurring these costs as long as we get the necessary results which the hon. member for Boland apparently believes we will get.</p>

<p>The Coloureds find themselves in a particular economic position. I do not say this reproachfully or in a derogatory way, but the fact of the matter is that there are thousands upon thousands of Coloureds in the Western Cape who are not in full-time employ simply because, as the result of defective education, the right approach towards work has not been drilled into them. In this situation we find that workers, Bantu amongst others, flock from elsewhere to this area where Coloured labour is available. When another hon. member referred to this aspect this afternoon it was stated sneeringly from the other side, &#x201C;Oh, you want the Coloured to do the work of the Bantu &#x201D;. That is an absolutely erroneous representation. Better equipped Coloured workers strengthen our manpower <span class="col_2087-2088" refersTo="page_1058"/>potential and also make the presence of Bantu here unnecessary. But I want to go further and say that we must get away from the idea that there are certain kinds of work which are only fit for the Bantu. Just as we are teaching our own White children, so we should also teach the Coloured to realize that no work is a disgrace, whether it be manual work or white-collar work. On the other hand we believe that through better training of our Coloureds greater mechanization is possible, which will make it possible to transfer many of the redundant labourers who are here at the moment and who keep Coloureds unemployed. Without reproaching the provincial authorities in any way, I want to say that the existing education does not meet the need that exists to equip the Coloureds for their task, and South Africa can no longer afford this state of affairs. The Department of Coloured Affairs which takes an intense interest in placing Coloureds in employment is in an excellent position to judge for which occupations the Coloureds should prepare themselves. I do not believe for a single moment that this department will ever plan anything of an inferior nature for the Coloureds. There was a time when our White children could not all attend the bigger schools with the finest buildings. There was a time when we had little farm schools, but was that inferior education? On the contrary, I believe that one of the tragedies of education is the disappearance of these small farm schools. Attention will also have to be given to this problem of the education of the rural Coloured. There are certain farmers who at their own expense are establishing schools for the education of the children of their Coloured labourers. I want to put forward the plea that the Department, in implementing its educational policy, should guard against the harmful consequences of over-centralization of schools. Although we Whites have developed beyond that stage, I would urge that we do not overlook the value of our rural schools and the place that they occupy in our social life. I would urge that special attention be given to the aptitude which the rural Coloured has for agriculture, and that that aptitude should not only be retained but further developed. In connection with vocational training I would also urge that the necessary attention be given time-ously to the question of keeping in the rural areas the Coloureds who show so much aptitude for agriculture. Through the planned educational policy of this Government they will also be better fitted for the commercial world which more and more Coloureds are entering to-day. In the nature of things, what is lacking in the domestic background of many of our Coloured children will also have to be supplemented by the instruction that will be given to them. On the other hand, through the taking over of Coloured education by the Department of Coloured Affairs, opportunities for promotion in the teaching profession will be created for our Coloureds. to-day teaching is practically a dead-end profession in which the highest post that they can reach is that of school principal; as against that, the possibility is now being created that they will be able to progress even as far as inspectorship. The establishment of a Coloured Educational Council, which is visualized here, opens up the possibility of using the services of some of our best Coloured teachers on this Council. All this can only redound to the benefit of the Coloureds in general because they will now be able to put into practice their own ideas and co-operate with the Department to uplift their own people.</p>

<p>To show to what extent our Coloured educational leaders agree with us as far as this matter is concerned, I need only refer to a few ideas that were expressed at the conference which was held in October last year at the Cape Western University College. Mr. Golding of Elsies River, for example, stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If everything is provided to the child, he remains a loafer. We cannot help our people by giving everything to them on a platter. I am opposed to the provision of free books.</block>

<p>He said that his school received free books every year to the value of R3,000 but at the end of the first term those books were in a terrible condition and that by the end of the year half of them had disappeared. He went on to point out that he noticed every day at the tuck-shop that large silver coins were being handed over, but that when 5 cents was charged for a book, the children were unable to pay it. He said that the children grew up with the idea that the Government has to pay for everything they need.</p>

<p>Another Coloured educationist stated that many teachers were against the Department of Coloured Affairs, but this was due to ignorance. Now they realize what opportunities are being offered to the Coloured child and to the Coloured group as a whole and that is why there is a new awakening amongst the Coloured teachers, he said.</p>

<p>Since that is so, in other words, since one already notices a sense of responsibility amongst the Coloured educationists, I think the time has come when we should carry on with this step and, through the Department of Coloured Affairs, help Coloured education find its feet. In that way I believe that we will achieve the results which were also visualized this evening by the hon. member for Boland towards the end of his speech and that we will silence the Opposition cries, because the knowledge will grow in the mind of the Coloured that this Government and the Department of Coloured Affairs are out to benefit the Coloured in his own interest and in the interests of South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as one who finds little to admire in the policies or politics of the Nationalist Party, I am nevertheless constrained to admire and to wonder at the ingenuity with which they invent the <span class="col_2089-2090" refersTo="page_1059"/>necessary jargon to go with every shift of policy&#x2014;because every time they think up something new in relation to any particular section of the population of South Africa, up comes the phrase, or combination of phrases, or the magic word or combination of words, and after that every argument is based on that particular phrase or word. Lest the hon. the Minister feels surprised about this, as surprised as he looks, let me hasten to tell him what I mean by this. He set the pattern for this debate when he talked about socio-economic, followed by this, that and the other. I can give you my word, Mr. Speaker, that every speaker on that side has had a lot to say, since, about the socio-economic motivation or about the socio-economic effects of this Bill. But it is quite easy over a period of a few years to go back from socio-economic considerations to &#x201C;Wit baasskap&#x201D; because it started with &#x201C;Wit baasskap&#x201D;, turned into apartheid, then into separate development. was then called self-development or autogenous development.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>May I with respect point out, Sir, that in order to understand the Bill properly, one is entitled to find out what the motivation behind it is, what are the reasons behind it because, after all, we on this side have not asked for the Bill, and therefore I submit we are entitled, if we cannot get the answers from the other side, to examine of our own volition the effect as well as the motivation of the Bill. If we do this, Sir, we find that there was first of all separate or self-development, autogenous development and now we come to socio-economic development. So it goes on until the point is reached where we are now being told, with the usual mass of statistics and with the usual quotations from this, that and the other authority, that this is the only solution and the only salvation for the Coloured people of South Africa.</p>

<p>Before I examine what I call the motivation of this Bill, I should like for two reasons &#x2014;one of them being that I want to be courteous&#x2014;to deal with some of the points raised by the last two speakers on the Government side. For all sorts of reasons, I believe that after I have done that, there will not be many more speakers on that side of the House! At any rate, one of these members, namely the hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit) said in effect that better education&#x2014; which, he claimed, would result from this particular Bill&#x2014;would make more Coloureds employable, and as a result would do away with the need to have Natives in the Western Province. I am prepared to stand corrected as a result of what is reported by Hansard, and I hope that the hon. member is similarly prepared to stand by what Hansard reports he has said. I heard him say it&#x2014;admittedly it was in Afrikaans that he said it &#x2026;</p>

<p>When a member on this side of the House is heard to say that this Bill is based on a political motive, there arises a cry of horror from the Government benches&#x2014;and yet at the tail-end of the debate&#x2014;I do not mean &#x201C;tail&#x201D; in the sense I have just used it, but in the sense of &#x201C;at the end&#x201D; of the debate&#x2014;we heard the hon. member for Stellenbgsch who comes from a constituency which is vitally concerned with the Coloured people and the contents of this Bill, telling us what we have been telling them for the last 12 hours of this debate, namely, that there is undoubtedly a political motive behind this Bill. Now the hon. member for Stellenbosch gives us that reason gratuitously, namely that better education would make more Coloureds employable &#x2026;</p>

<p>Wait a minute &#x2026; "and that it would do away with the need for Natives in the Western Province &#x201D;. Again, Sir, I want to say that I admire the ingenuity of the spokesmen of the Nationalist Party, but if they can alter the complexion of this statement by the hon. member and still say that this Bill has no political motive&#x2014;such as, for example, displacing the Natives in the Western Province, which has been a very strong political flash-point in this part of the country for some months now&#x2014;then I am prepared to say that I have made a mistake. However, I will not pursue this point any further.</p>

<p>The hon. member went on to say that one of the tragedies of our educational system was the disappearance of the farm school. Now, Sir, it is all very well to become sentimental about the old school and the old farm, and the little old school on the old farm! That is all very well. With due respect, however, I do not think that anybody in South Africa wants to change our educational system, which is already being changed to some extent by this Bill, to the extent where all of us will be running back to the dear little school on the dear little farm. I would have thought that he, speaking on behalf of an area which has a vital interest in this matter, would have said that we should have better and bigger schools because of the fact that we are an industrial country, that we have already left the pastoral economy behind, and that we do not want to have farm schools if we can avoid it&#x2014;but that we want well-established schools in well-established <span class="col_2091-2092" refersTo="page_1060"/>civic communities. That is what the Minister said he was going to give the Coloured people. So that when I say that all this talk about the value of the old farm schools made no real contribution to this debate, I hope the hon. member will forgive me.</p>

<p>Now, before I come to deal with my own particular approach to this Bill, I should like to deal with certain remarks made by another member on the Government side, namely the hon. member for Piketberg (Mr. Treurnicht). <b>I</b> am sorry he is not present here now, He, in effect, said that the purpose of this Bill was to make of the Coloured man a worthy citizen of South Africa, &#x201C;om &#x2019;n waardige burger van Suid-Afrika te wees &#x201D;. This is what this Bill is going to do for the Coloured, according to that hon. member. So again when one asks why this Bill has been brought before this House, one must examine that aspect of the matter. What is the meaning of this argument about the Coloured people being all of a sudden citizens worthy, or unworthy, of South Africa when one compares it with some of the other statements made by more senior spokesmen of the Nationalist Party than the hon. member for Piketberg? I have here, as an example, a statement which was made by the hon. member for Kempton Park. Unfortunately he made the statement in my constituency when he addressed the John X. Merriman Branch. The statement has a real bearing on this matter we are discussing now. Analysing the composition of the South African people he said&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, Sir. I should then like to deal with our point of view, i.e. that the Coloured people are a part of the South African nation <i>in toto.</i> We agree entirely on the need, referred to by the hon. member for Piketberg, that there is for us to make of every Coloured person a worthy citizen of South Africa. Consequently, we want to examine how far this Bill is going to contribute to that object. That, I think, is relevant to the matter under discussion, and therefore I should like to examine some of the statements made in this connection by some of the hon. members on the other side.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister was heard to say that no socio-economic plan could be carried out without the educational aspect being kept in view. He went on to say that such a proposal (the Bill) was in line with South Africa&#x2019;s traditional colour policy. But if I recall the Minister&#x2019;s statement correctly, he did not go on to say why it was in line with the traditional colour policy of South Africa. When you use the word &#x201C;tradition&#x201D; you are supposed to be referring to a pattern which has evolved out of the past into the present. And we know that, as regards the education of the Coloured people, there has, in fact, been a fairly consistent pattern for some 100 years or so. I can quote from five different books which I have here, if proof of that is necessary. There is plenty of authority for such a statement. Why then this change now, this handing over to a new Department which happens to be the Department for Coloured Affairs, under a Minister of Coloured Affairs? Why? Has that become the traditional policy of South Africa overnight? I hope the hon. <span class="col_2093-2094" refersTo="page_1061"/>the Minister will be good enough to explain, when he replies to the debate, why this is now, so suddenly, the traditional policy. Otherwise, this will only be another loose statement in support of a very poor case.</p>

<p>The Minister went on to say that education must be planned as an undivided whole for each group. This, he said, was emphasized by large employers&#x2019; organizations which urged him to accept this point of view. Now, Sir, the question immediately arises: which large organizations of employers urged this upon the Minister? He did not say that he was urged by the Federated Chamber of Industries, for instance, or by the Association of Chambers of Commerce, or by the Chamber of Mines, or by the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut or the Afrikaanse Sakekamer. He did not say whether it was any of these bodies which urged him to take Coloured education away from its traditional home! Not a word of that&#x2014;but he merely announced airily that this was urged upon him by large employers&#x2019; organizations. As this point has been made by the hon. the Minister, I wish to urge upon him to tell us which large employers&#x2019; organizations took up that attitude, because they certainly have a very direct and material interest in the education of all the people of South Africa. I should like him to tell us which large employers&#x2019; organizations came to him and urged him to take Coloured education away from, say, the Cape Provincial Department of Education. It will be very interesting to hear who they were.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Malmesbury, earlier on in the debate, asked why we were against divided control in education. Such divided control is, in fact, being introduced here because if this Bill is passed, it will mean that there will be two Departments which will be concerned with education in an area like the Western Cape, for example: one for the Whites and one for the Coloureds, leaving aside for the moment the Department of Bantu Education. He asked why we were against it, and went on to say that in the United States there was divided control of education. Of course there is&#x2014;but the first material difference is that such division in the United States is certainly not, to begin with, based on colour. As you know, Sir, there is a lot of trouble in certain of the American states because of their determination to integrate their educational systems with the constitution of the United States. It is, in consequence, a remarkable comparison to make, when he says that this divided control is also the position in the United States. Then the hon. member went on to state&#x2014;completely at variance with what we heard from the hon. member for Stellenbosch to-night&#x2014;after all, Stellenbosch and Malmesbury are not geographically far removed from one another!&#x2014;that they, i.e. the National Party, recognized the Coloureds as part of our &#x201C;volk&#x201D; but not of our &#x201C;nasie&#x201D;, Those were his very words. Again, Sir, I am constrained to ask when hon. gentlemen on the other side are going to tell us exactly where the Coloured people fit into our South African pattern; I hesitate, Sir, to use the word &#x201C;nation&#x201D; because if you contrast the statement of the hon. member for Malmesbury with that made by the hon. member for Stellenbosch, who wants to make of every Coloured man a &#x201C;waardige burger van Suid-Afrika&#x201D;, part, therefore, of the &#x201C;volk&#x201D; and nation &#x2026; [Interjections.] When one remembers, Sir, that the difference between &#x201C;volk&#x201D; and &#x201C;nasie&#x201D; as these words are being used to-day by spokesmen opposite is absolutely impossible to grasp, then one is entitled to ask what they mean by saying in Johannesburg that the Coloureds are not recognized as part of the nation, and by saying in this House just the opposite, on a Monday night&#x2014;and that in contrast to what was said on the previous Thursday night. Words have a certain meaning for the simple-minded person and this meaning they get out of the dictionary &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>In the greatly expanded and revised 4th edition of the dictionary compiled by Bosman, Van der Merwe and Hiemstra, the following definitions will be found: &#x201C;nasie&#x201D; means &#x201C;nation &#x201D;; &#x201C;volk&#x201D; means &#x201C;people, nation &#x201D;. Therefore, Sir, accordingly to an authoritative work on the subject, &#x201C;volk&#x201D; and &#x201C;nasie&#x201D; mean exactly the same thing. That, however, is not the case for the National Party. To them the meanings are completely different, although we do not understand what that difference is. They blow hot and cold about who is or is not part of the &#x201C;volk&#x201D;, and who is or is not part of the &#x201C;nasie &#x201D;. I think they owe us an explanation. According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary of 1955, the word &#x201C;nation&#x201D; means &#x201C;the whole people of a country &#x201D;. In terms of this, the Coloureds are part of the whole people of South Africa. They do not live anywhere else than in South Africa! Or hasn&#x2019;t anybody over there realized that yet? The Oxford Dictionary goes out of its way to give an example by an authority by the name of Freeman. &#x201C;In Switzerland four languages are spoken, yet the Swiss certainly constitute one nation.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Therefore, to understand this Bill, one must realize once and for all that despite the hon. gentlemen on the other side arguing about differentiating between the one group and the other group as much as they do, the Coloured people are part of the South African nation; yet the Minister has come forward with a Bill to prove the type of ideological concept of nationhood existing in the mind of the hon. member for Kempton Park and of the hon. member for Malmesbury.</p>

<p>I should now like to deal briefly with a point made by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker). This hon. member is obviously a very great admirer of the United States of America, because whatever we may have been discussing this session, he quoted examples <span class="col_2095-2096" refersTo="page_1062"/>for us from the United States. The other day, in asking what this cry of &#x201C;fragmentation&#x201D; meant which came from the hon. member for Natal (South Coast), he asked whether he was not aware that there was fragmentation in the United States? The obvious explanation is, Sir, that just as some people cannot distinguish between &#x201C;volk&#x201D; and &#x201C;nasie&#x201D;, the hon. member cannot distinguish between &#x201C;fragmentation&#x201D; and &#x201C;decentralization. Of course there is decentralization, because no department of State can be run by push-button control from some central bureau. Hence decentralization. The fragmentation to which we object is, however, a different thing, because it means that you take something which exists as an administrative whole and break it up into two or more sections. That is fragmentation, and that is what this Bill does. I think that I should for the benefit of the hon. member, again read from one of my favourite American books entitled &#x201C;Facts of American Life&#x201D; issued by the American Government. I think I should tell him what they say in this book about the general philosophy behind American education, because he seems to rely on that philosophy, without mentioning what it really is, in order to prove that this is a good Bill. On page 225 of that book the question is asked: &#x201C;What is the general philosophy behind American education?&#x201D; Then the following answer is given&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">American education is based on a general philosophy which holds that all men are created free and equal and must have an equal opportunity to develop as individuals whose capacities are adapted to useful service to their community and nation; that the strength of society depends upon intellectual enlightenment of all citizens; that worthy capacity should be developed in all men; that decentralization of the control of schools is the best guarantee of freedom; that education should be free to every child &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is the American philosophy of education. Now, Sir, one has only to examine this Bill to see how far it deviates from that philosophy of education, and to see how far the hon. member for Fort Beaufort missed the point when he said that we would only be following the American pattern when we adopted the proposals placed before us in this Bill.</p>

<p>Now I should like to come to another point. I was somewhat surprised that in the course of a speech made by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), when she mentioned the name of Dr. van der Ross, the hon. the Minister&#x2014;even before the words were out of her mouth&#x2014;interjected by saying &#x201C;The voice of van der Ross!&#x201D; Apparently he thinks very little of this van der Ross. But the fact is that Dr. van der Ross is regarded by the Coloured people as having some standing in the field of education. I may be wrong in saying that he is on friendly terms with the Minister, because I do not know what their personal relations are like, but that does not alter the fact, Sir, that Dr. van der Ross enjoys some standing, in the Coloured community and out of it&#x2014;as an educationist &#x2026;</p>

<p>All right, Sir, in the English Press. But does the hon. member hold that against him? Does the hon. member mean to say that if this gentleman had a standing in the Afrikaans Press, he would be a fine fellow? I have here a publication called &#x201C;The Coloured People of South Africa&#x201D; published, not by the English Press, but by two Departments of State in combination, i.e. the Department of Information and the Department of Coloured Affairs. I have had this publication since last year; it is, in fact, one of my treasured possessions. It is an extraordinary document telling you all about the Coloured people, &#x201C;you&#x201D; being a person living thousands of miles away in some European country. This publication puts the Coloured people in a Technicolor light; it is a highly-coloured publication, unlike the other one I have here, named &#x201C;Bantu&#x201D;, which is just in black and white! On page 47 the compiler of this Coloured publication apparently wanted to show that we in South Africa were so broadminded as to recognize the merits of certain Coloured writers, certain Coloured educationists and of certain Coloured poets; and he says that from time to time articles appear by Coloured writers, such as Dr. van der Ross &#x2026; He therefore gets his accolade from the Department of Coloured Affairs and he gets his accolade from the Department of Information. Yet the hon. member for Pretoria (District) says it is the English Press that recognizes van der Ross! It is very important to note that although this publication is circulated very widely in South Africa, it is not primarily intended for us but for the overseas reader.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>But it is not intended for us in this sense: that the emphasis on everything concerning the Coloured people is&#x2014;I will not use the word &#x201C;slanted &#x201D;&#x2014;put in such a way that it is intended for overseas consumption. I should like to give the House further examples of this. First of all, there is the future of the Coloured people which was canvassed by the Prime Minister. In this connection the overseas reader was told by the Prime Minister (via his address to the Council for Coloured Affairs in Cape Town in December 1961) that the Coloured people could have &#x201C;their own Parliament and Cabinet within ten years &#x201D;. Now, within that framework comes also the question of education. In this connection the Prime Minister&#x2019;s concept is made clear in this Bill, namely, that wherever there is to be any consultation or contact between <span class="col_2097-2098" refersTo="page_1063"/>one Department and another, it shall take place through the Minister concerned. That was made clear at that time, in 1961, because it is made clear in this document that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; methods will be devised by which this organization&#x2019;s activities, decisions and requirements can be brought to the attention of Parliament. It is also intended to hold Prime Minister&#x2019;s conferences based on the pattern of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x2019; conferences, between the Prime Minister, the Minister of Coloured Affairs and leaders of the Coloured community to discuss matters of common interest.</block>

<p>So you can see, Sir, how this educational system, now called the &#x201C;traditional system of South Africa&#x201D; is meant to be integrated politically and ideologically in this Prime Minister&#x2019;s concept as stated to the Council for Coloured Affairs in December 1961 and as reflected in the statement of the Prime Minister in this document. In other words, Sir, the whole thing from top to bottom is nothing more than a political concept. It is not an educational concept. If the hon. the Minister had come to this House and said that he and his Party had had the bright idea that politically it would be a good thing for the Coloureds to have a separate department of education under his control, I would have understood him readily, because that would have been a plain and simple statement of fact. But when he comes to this House rigged out in all the trimmings and trappings of this Bill yet making it so easy to trace it all back to a political foundation, I am amazed at the lack of perception on the part of hon. members on that side in coming to us&#x2014;gullible as we may be in appearance&#x2014;and trying to sell us this Bill of goods on the strength of it being in accordance with the traditional system of education.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am not going to deprive the House for very much longer of the privilege of hearing that hon. member. Despite the fact that I have found something hilarious in this Bill, there is a bitter irony about it all. Superficially it may be funny, but basically it is tragic. The arguments which I have advanced show up so pathetically the sham which this Bill is in reality, and what the policy of the Government really is. I am sorry it has not been said as plainly as this by a representative of the Coloured people, but if they have a group point of view, I am at a complete loss to discern it. Therefore I am obliged to say that from what I have observed, and from what the Government is now trying to do to the Coloured people, it is clear that this Bill is educational sham, which has no other motivation than a political one.</p>

<p>The question of intelligence was also brought up by the hon. member for Piketberg this evening. He said that he contacted the University of Cape Town and asked them whether they had any intelligence tests or assessments of the intelligence of the Coloured people. The reply which he got and which he gave to the House to-night was &#x201C;no, they were still working on it &#x201D;. The inference which he asked us to draw was that if this education, this so-called traditional pattern of education for the Coloureds, was in fact as inferior as we claimed it to be, then it was justified. That was the inference he asked us to draw&#x2014;that it was justified on the basis of the inferior intelligence of the Coloured people. I have various reference books here; I do not want to take up the time of the House, but I think this one is really quotable. This is a work by Professor T. B. Davie, Principal, Vice-Chancellor of the same University of Cape Town which the hon. member for Piketberg consulted about this alleged inferiority of the intelligence of the Coloured people. This is a very important book on education because it is called &#x201C;Education and Race Relations in South Africa &#x201D;. One of the points which the Minister made was that this Bill would make for better race relations. So, Sir, I think with respect that this is very relevant. Professor Davie says on page 17 of this book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Education of the Coloured in school and university: The education of the Coloured up to the present has followed the European pattern &#x2026;</block>

<p>This book was written in 1955; one should be quite accurate about this matter. It says &#x201C;up to the present&#x201D; that is up to 1955&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and while the proportion of children reaching high school and university has been much smaller than in the case of the Europeans, there has nevertheless been a considerable and increasing number who have done so. Their standard of intelligence &#x2026;</block>

<p>Where is the hon. member for Piketberg?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Their standard of intelligence and their capacity for absorbing a university education have in our experience been in every way equal to those of their European counterparts.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Equal to those of their European counterparts &#x201D;! Mr. Speaker, how can anyone have the gall to come to this House and start this old hare running again? This hare of the man&#x2019;s inferior intelligence; he is Coloured, you must give him an inferior education, because he cannot absorb or understand the superior, the White, education. Surely this has been dealt with so regularly and frequently in our own time as not to require repetition in this House. The answer is not only in this work, <span class="col_2099-2100" refersTo="page_1064"/>it is in others as well; it is in the facts of life about the Coloured people which should be known to people who represent a Coloured constituency, I have very few Coloured people in my constituency, but I have some personal knowledge of conditions in this part of the country. I have no doubt that a Coloured person, given the same educational opportunity is naturally, in terms of the experience of the people at the University of Cape Town, as intelligent as a White man. What stock does he stem from, to begin with, Sir? I want to make one quotation from Dr. van der Ross, the same Dr. van der Ross who is not appreciated by some hon. members here, but who apparently has the blessing and the approval of a publication for which I, as a taxpayer, have to contribute my share. Here they say &#x201C;Look at this Dr. van der Ross; he is one of our leading Coloured writers &#x201D;. &#x201C;He is an estimable man, in fact&#x201D;, they say to the people overseas&#x2014;but here he is anathema. Why? Maybe he is a political opponent. I do not know. But he said quite recently, under the heading &#x201C;Little Solace in Education Bill &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The much awaited Coloured Persons Education Bill has been published, and it contains little that will give solace to those concerned with education. On the contrary, it contains some provisions which will cause grave concern &#x2026;</block>

<p>So he goes on, Sir, for I would say, about a quarter of a page of this particular newspaper.</p>

Long before this Adam Small could have seen this book on education&#x2014;because he wrote this poem some time ago &#x2014;he summed the position up far better than I have been able to do in my speech up to now. [Interjections.] Yes, I concede that. It is no good saying &#x201C;hear, hear &#x201D;. In all humility I have said it. Of course, you would not understand his point as well as you would mine, because he has no right to speak in this House.

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, with your leave I should like to return to the Coloured Persons Education Bill. Before I come to it, I suppose that in terms of the unwritten rules of debate I am obliged to make a few remarks in regard to the speech of the hon. member who has just resumed his seat. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) completely misinterpreted the hon. member for Piketberg (Mr. Treurnicht) when he said that the hon. member for Piketberg had consulted the vice-chancellor of the University of Cape Town in regard to the intelligence of Coloured students. What he said in fact was that he had consulted the chief of the Psychological Services of the Cape Education Department, who certainly knows just as much or a little more about the intelligence of Coloured school children than the principal of the Cape Town University.</p>

<p>Another point made by the hon. member for Hospital was that this traditional system, as he called it, in South Africa makes no provision for the divided control over White education and Coloured education. Apart from the fact that this is not true, he seems to be quite confused in his mind in regard to this concept of divided control. I will deal with that in a moment. I just want to point out first that this proposition of his that it is not inherent in the traditional system in South Africa is quite untrue. Ever since 1893 provision has been made in the Cape School Board for separate schools for Whites and for Coloureds, and in 1911 Coloured children were prohibited by legislation from attending the schools for Whites. In the Transvaal, in the days of Milner, the same legislation was passed, and in 1907 legislation was passed in the Transvaal by one General Smuts providing for separate schools for Whites and Coloureds. But as I said, the hon. member is rather confused in his mind in regard to divided control. When we talk here about divided control, we mean the control over academic or school education on the one hand and technical training or vocational education on the other hand. That is the concept of divided control we are discussing here. In order to come to that, Mr. Speaker, I want to quote from a whole series of commissions of inquiry which investigated this aspect of education ever since 1916 when the Jagger Commission brought out its report after having investigated the matter. One commission after the other pointed out how untenable the arrangement was that the provinces <span class="col_2101-2102" refersTo="page_1065"/>were responsible for portion of the education and the Central Government for another portion, viz. vocational training and technical training. The Hofmeyr Commission of 1924 proposed a Union Education Council, but points out that the confusion and the resultant powerlessness which arose from divided control was a cause for much of the inefficacy of the education provided. I want to read what the Hofmeyr Commission said in regard to this matter. Unfortunately I have only the Nederlands copy here, because at that time Nederlands was still the official language of Parliament [translation.]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The afore going report has shown how the present multiplicity of authorities arose and has also pointed out some of the administrative difficulties and the powerlessness which inevitably resulted from this confusion. Any recommendation made by this Commission must therefore presuppose the existence and the operation of some effective means or other of regulating the existing badly regulated activities.</block>

<p>Thereafter the Van der Horst Commission in 1928 emphasized that technical education should not revert to the provinces. I want to read the English report of the De Villiers Commission, which quotes the Van der Horst Commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do not recommend the diversion of the control of these institutions, technical colleges, back to the provinces for the following reasons: (1) It appears that the provinces will not be able with their resources to cope adequately with the growing need of this type of education, and (2) Union industrial legislation, for example the Apprenticeship Act, has a direct bearing on the work and the very existence of the technical colleges and grave difficulties will be anticipated if they should be completely free from Union control.</block>

<p>Thereafter the Roos Commission found that the co-ordination between ordinary education and vocational education was so essential that if the provinces could not or would not cooperate voluntarily, Parliament should enforce it. I again read from the same report, para. 2010-</p>

<block name="quote">In making the recommendation the Commission stated that it realized that the best method of dealing with this difficult subject would be on the lines of a free and voluntary co-operation between the provinces themselves and the Union Department, but &#x201C;so important&#x201D;, it stated, &#x201C;is the co-ordination in the educational field that if it is not achieved voluntarily by the provinces, then Parliament will ultimately be compelled to enforce it&#x201D;, and again, &#x201C;If it should be found after such a Committee has functioned for a year or two that it fails in its object, then the Commission is reluctantly compelled to the conclusion that the statutory control of these matters by machinery established by Parliament is the only alternative.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, so I could continue quoting from one educational report after another to show how tragic it was for education in South Africa that for so many years we had this divided control between the provinces which were in charge of primary and secondary school education, on the one hand, and the Central Government which was in charge of vocational and technical education on the other hand. The De Villiers Commission itself in conclusion emphasizes that divided control over general education and vocational education was completely unsound. I do not want to quote it again; it appears in the same report, in para. 2115 (4). The one recommends that general education should be transferred to the Central Government, and the others just the opposite, viz. that vocational education should be handed back to the provinces, but all of them are agreed that divided control should come to an end. It is therefore clear that either the provinces must take care of all education, or else the Central Government must do so. The Cape Province, with its 85 per cent of Coloured education, cannot afford it, as various hon. members on this side have already indicated convincingly. Therefore the Central Government must take over.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) stated the proposition to-day that the Cape Province would not really benefit so much financially if the Central Government took over Coloured education, because, according to figures he quoted from a speech made by the Administrator of the Cape Province, it appeared that the Cape Province would benefit to the extent of &#x00A3;1,700,000 only if Coloured education were transferred to the Central Government. But that was five years ago, Sir. The Schumann Commission, which he also quoted, states that viewed from the financial aspect the transfer of Coloured education is not really desirable. But this same Schumann Commission points out that although five years ago there were only about 220,000 Coloured children in the Cape Province, to-day there are already more than 300,000. Therefore the picture in regard to the cost of Coloured education is completely changed. The Schumann Commission emphasizes the fact that the costs in the years to come will be particularly high. In 1961-2 the expenditure on Coloured education was R22,196,000. In the year 1970-1 it will be precisely double that amount, namely R44.144,000. That is without compulsory education. That is the position as we know it to-day. When compulsory education is in fact introduced, the costs in the year 1970-1, according to the calculations made by the Schumann Commission, will already amount to R47.922,000. Will the Cape Province be able to bear that, or even its share of this huge amount? Definitely not. The hon. member for Boland talks about concern and opposition on the part of <span class="col_2103-2104" refersTo="page_1066"/>the Coloureds against this Bill, but what about the Standing Education Committee of the Coloured Council who expressed themselves as being in favour of this transfer of Coloured education? An acquaintance of mine who is a Coloured principal expressed the following opinion: He trusts that the transfer will one day rightly be viewed as the outstanding incident in the history of the Coloured people of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The Department of Coloured Affairs already administers a whole number of vocational and other technical schools and colleges, including nine State-aided vocational schools, various extension courses, a higher technical school, the Peninsula Technical College which was recently taken over from the Cape Technical College, an agricultural training centre at Kromme River which will commence its courses in the near future, the University College of the Western Cape and an industrial school at Ottery, as well as the reformatories at Constantia and Faure. All these educational institutions are already being controlled by the Department of Coloured Affairs through its Coloured education section. In order to put an end to this divided control over ordinary education on the one hand by the province and this type of vocational and technical education on the other hand, under the Central Government through the Department of Coloured Affairs, we are therefore compelled to come along with this Bill which is now before this House, namely to transfer all education from the Provincial Administrations to the Central Government.</p>

<p>The only principle which in the final result is of any real importance is that the best interests of the child and therefore of the community should be promoted. In order to uplift the Coloureds in the most effective manner, it is essential to devote particular attention to their education and that it should be planned as a whole. I repeat, Sir, that it should be planned as a whole. I wish that we could also have in respect of White education this position we will now get in respect of White education, this position we will now get in respect of Coloured education. Only with this central planning of all education will full justice be done to our White education. Mr. Speaker, when I say that I wish that this position would also arise in respect of White education, then I do not allege that it should necessarily be transferred from the Provincial Administration to the Central Government. In regard to White education, as far as I am concerned, the opposite may also be done, namely that all White education be transferred to the provinces. I have no definite views on that, as long as we can just put an end to this, I may almost say diabolical, divided control over education.</p>

<p>In referring here to the transfer of Coloured education to the Central Government, it behoves us briefly to pay tribute to those people who for so many years had Coloured education under their control. I refer here particularly to the various mission societies in South Africa, and particularly to the N.G. Sending-kerk, which had by far the most mission schools. These people rendered a very valuable service to South Africa under very difficult circumstances and with very few facilities. It behoves us, standing as we do on the threshold of a new era, to pay tribute to those who deserve it.</p>

<p>Allow me also to pay tribute to the Secretary for Coloured Affairs and his officials and to the Director of Education in that Department. New ground is being broken here, and as is the case in any new undertaking there are, of course, and will still be, birth pains and growing pains. But we feel assured and full of confidence that with these people at the head of affairs those birth pains will soon pass. It is with full confidence that we entrust this task to them to implement it, not only in the interests of Coloured education, but in the interests of the whole of South Africa. A Coloured acquaintance of mine, who is also concerned with education, expressed this opinion to me: We Coloured teachers in South Africa have a tremendous task in educating and forming our people for the future, and what a pity it is that we have to do so against a wall of prejudice against everything which is done by this Government, or which the Government wants to do for the Coloured community. And then he continued: We who regard the matter free from politics and quite objectively cannot but state with regret that it is the United Party which to a large extent is responsible for this prejudice. That took my thoughts back to the time many years ago when I was a youth and started to take an interest in politics, and when on one occasion I noticed how one of the fathers of the present United Party, viz. the old S.A. Party, fought an election in the days when the Coloureds were still on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) who has just sat down has surprised me considerably by saying that he believes in the central planning of White education. I had thought that hon. members <span class="col_2105-2106" refersTo="page_1067"/>would believe to-day in decentralization in education. That is the accepted education policy of the world and the central planning of education does not appeal to democratically-minded countries. The hon. member for Paarl spoke further about the Milner policy and he quoted from the Hofmeyr Commission&#x2019;s report and from the de Villiers Commission&#x2019;s report. He quoted the portion from the de Villiers Commission&#x2019;s report which formed a justification for the removal of vocational and technical education in the earlier stages from the provinces to the Central Government. But I would like to remind the hon. member for Paarl that this recommendation was based on lack of finance, lack of financial support to the provinces. If sufficient financial assistance from the Central Government had been forthcoming at that time, there would have been no need for the change-over of vocational and technical education from the control of the provinces, which had managed it admirably since Union, to the Central Government.</p>

<p>I have listened to hon. members this afternoon and this evening. The hon. member for Piketberg (Mr. Treurnicht) was in favour of Coloured education and Coloured development under the direction of their people. When the hon. member for Piketberg was saying this I myself was thinking of what has happened to Bantu education since 1953-4 when there was talk at that time of the development under more direction of their own people. When I heard the hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. G. P. Kotze) say that representatives here who had the least number of Coloured people in their provinces&#x2014;he was referring no doubt to Transvalers&#x2014;had been the majority in this debate, I would like to point out to the hon. member that I am a Transvaler and I intend dealing with the very real problem of this transfer of Coloured education and its effect on the four provinces. Because the Transvaal has a smaller number of Cape Coloured pupils does not mean that they were not very directly concerned with the proposed transfer under this Bill now before the House. The hon. member for Gordonia referred to the Schumann Report and he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Die verslag wat mnr. Schumann voor die Kabinet l&#x00EA;.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Yet not one hon. member, and here I include the hon. the Minister himself, has referred to the fact that the Schumann report is an Interim report. It is not the full report; it is not the final report of this Commission at all. This Commission of Inquiry which is sitting to inquire into the financial relations between the Central Government and the provinces, stresses throughout this Interim report that we have had before us, that no final conclusions can be drawn on the financial implications of transferring Coloured education to the Government. None is possible until the overall investigation is complete. On page 3 of this report it stresses this point and it says on page 4 that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Since an Interim report is now requested on this subject the Commission assumes that the Government is seriously considering such a step and that it wishes to have the full financial implications investigated before taking a final decision.</block>

<p>The commission makes it quite clear in this report, on page 3, that the additional mandate to investigate the transfer of Coloured education, was thrust upon it suddenly. So it seems as if the Government in this respect, has acted with its customary haste in committing itself to a course of action as laid down in this Bill without knowing the full implications and without proper regard to the taxpayers&#x2019; interests as it has done so often in the past.</p>

<p>The Government&#x2019;s decision to transfer Coloured education to the Minister&#x2019;s Department was taken months before the commission&#x2019;s report was available to the public. It started in 1961 and I quote from the Minutes of the Cape Provincial Council where, in regard to the Coloured Education Special Grant, the Administrator said the following in his report in 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The special grant of R600,000 mainly in respect of Coloured education which was agreed to last year has, however, not been repeated this year.</block>

<p>Why, Mr. Speaker? Because decisions were already being taken in 1961 for the transfer of Coloured education. The hon. the Minister himself last year mentioned in this House, when his Vote was under discussion, that all Coloured education presently falling under the aegis of the provinces would be transferred gradually to the Department of Coloured Affairs.</p>

We on this side of the House in supporting the amendment put forward by the hon. member for Hillbrow feel that the best possible way of providing Coloured education in the interests of all must be found, but we do not feel that it can be found through the measure of this Bill, and between us and the other side there is no measure of agreement on the contents of this Bill whatsoever, as we feel it will be more costly for the State to run Coloured education because of a duplication of administrative services, which are at present shared by the White and the Coloured schools. We ask: Why cannot better services <span class="col_2107-2108" refersTo="page_1068"/>for the Coloured people (we are all in favour of better services for the Coloured people) be provided at less cost by merely expanding financial aid to the provinces? This has been gone into very fully in this report here, and if hon. members on the Government side of the House&#x2014;the hon. member for Malmesbury and the hon. member for Parow touched on this earlier in the debate&#x2014;think that this transfer is going to alleviate the financial burdens of the provinces, then I feel there is naught for their comfort in this interim report. I would like to quote from the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 19 October last year. This is what the <i>Cape Argus</i> said in an article about these financial arrangements&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to the report, the provinces will benefit from the compensation to be paid for school buildings and equipment and will be relieved of the cost of Coloured education, but the effect on the provincial subsidy requires complicated calculations, and it is by no means clear what the overall result will be. It is something like the man who has to work out whether moving into the supertax bracket will offset his additional earnings, for the subsidy is worked out on the province&#x2019;s budget for expenditure, and if the total budget drops, so will the subsidy. And the province would only be human if, relieved of the cost of Coloured education, it used some of the money secured for other services and did not reduce taxation.</block>

<p>That is indeed what may happen.</p>

<p>In 1957, as has already been mentioned by the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett), the Cape Provincial Council passed a resolution asking that Coloured education should be transferred to the Central Government, and 1 would like to ask the hon. Minister at this point whether the other provinces also petitioned the Central Government to take over Coloured education from 1957 onwards and whether they themselves sent petitions in to the Central Government on this point? The reaction is very interesting&#x2014;I am now referring to the resolution passed in 1957. It was moved by the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) who was then member of the Provincial Council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Council requests the Administrator to make urgent representations to the Central Government for the taking over of Coloured education.</block>

<p>An amendment was moved by United Party members of the Provincial Council, in which they said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Council is totally opposed to the transfer of Coloured education from the control of the Cape Provincial Administration to any Government Department or subsidiary Department on the grounds&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) it would not be in the interests of the Coloured people for their education to be administered and controlled by a Central Government Department;</li>

<li>(b) it would cost the South African taxpayer far more in administrative costs to make a wholesale transfer than to increase the present subsidy to the province;</li>

<li>(c) the Coloured community in the Cape contributes a considerable proportion towards our provincial taxes;</li>

<li>(d) any attempt that proposes the transfer of Coloured education to the Central Government is, in effect an expression of no-confidence in the Cape Education Department, which has always administered and controlled Coloured education in this province most competently, and, further, it would constitute a serious diminution in the powers of the Provincial Council.</li>

</ol>

<p>It is very interesting to see what the Schumann Report says about this very same motion. On page 4 it says that the Cape Provincial Council passed the said resolution, and then they react as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to information obtained by the Commission, virtually the sole grounds for this resolution (in favour of the Central Government taking over education) were fear that the financial burden would become too great for the province. The reaction to the above resolution was on the whole unfavourable in the Cape Province. The then Administration pointed out in the Provincial Council that the actual saving in the province would not be as great as expected. In a memorandum to the Executive Committee of the Provincial Council, dated 12 November 1957, the Superintendent General of Education expressed decided opposition to such a transfer. This was also the attitude of the two teachers&#x2019; unions in the Cape Province. After the Government, in 1957, granted the Cape Province an additional sum of &#x00A3;750,000 per annum, for three years, and also made certain other concessions to the province, the request was not repeated.</block>

<p>On the administrative side I would like to deal with the Cape Province. On the administrative side the Cape Province has 84 per cent of the teachers, 86 per cent of the pupils and 90 per cent of the schools. In the business world when a take-over bid for education is made on these lines, I feel that when it would be negotiated, it would be customary to assess not only the financial considerations but also the very vitally important question of whether there is the necessary administrative staff available in the hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department to run this concern. Those are the questions that would be asked in an ordinary business deal, and in this proposed take-over of Coloured education, has the hon. the Minister given the House any guarantee and assurances that the high standard of personnel now employed in <span class="col_2109-2110" refersTo="page_1069"/>the Provincial Department of the Cape Province will be maintained in his Department? Has the hon. Minister already got the necessary personnel trained and ready to move in and ready to perform the same administrative task immediately as at present carried out by the provinces? And how is the hon. Minister going to evolve the take-over? I would like to refer to the last clause in this Bill that we are now discussing, where it says &#x201C;that the provisions of the Act shall come into operation on a date fixed by proclamation in the <i>Gazette,</i> and a separate date in respect of the provisions of Sections 30 and 31, and different dates in respect of different provinces may be so fixed &#x201D;. So one may well ask how the hon. the Minister is going to introduce this programme in order to interfere as little as possible with the provincial programme. The budgets of Provincial Councils have either been passed or are in the process of being passed at this moment. Is there going to be a complete financial take-over immediately? How will this timetable be laid down? I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to answer this question and I would like to draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to the Cape School Board which has functioned admirably over these past years. It has 18 members, three of which are Coloureds. I understand that the Cape School Board submitted a memorandum to the hon. the Minister in which they strongly opposed the transfer of Coloured education to the Government, and this resolution was supported by the three Coloured representatives on the Cape School Board. The Cape School Board has jurisdiction over the largest number of schools in the Cape Province, and the experience of this board gained over the years in which it has been in existence, is very valuable. Like all other school boards, a trained inspectorate has been built up, and the Cape School Board has the whole force of the Department of Education of the Cape Province behind it, with the background and knowledge of people who have handled Coloured education over these years. Can the hon. the Minister transfer this also to his new Department? I feel the dangers inherent in transferring education out of the hands of experienced educationists such as these who occupy positions in the Provincial Administration to a Department of State are manifestly apparent when consideration is given to the deterioration in much of the educational standards of the Bantu, since the Government took over Bantu education in 1953. I know it has been touched on by hon. members already, but I would like to make this comparison: The hon. the Minister himself in October, last year, speaking in Robertson on the changes in Coloured education, said according to a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Plans to adapt the education of Coloured people to the labour market of the Western Cape were outlined here to-day by the Minister of Coloured Affairs (Mr. P. W. Botha).</block>

<block name="quote">Mr. Botha was speaking at the Annual Congress of the Breede River Development Association during a debate on the proposal that &#x201C;a sort of special service batallion&#x201D; be formed to train Coloured labour in preparation for the removal of Natives from the Western Cape.</block>

<p>Later on the hon. the Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My Department has already taken over Coloured welfare services, and intends to take over Coloured education whatever the opposition.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;There are basic faults in Coloured education,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We shall give no inferior education, but shall most certainly give Coloured people differentiated education. It would not help to give them only academic education and then throw them onto the labour market as frustrated people.</block>

<p>He continued to say that there would be greater emphasis on industrial schools. And in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 27 February they say in a leading article that it is apparent to anyone &#x2026;</p>

<p>It is apparent that Coloured education under the Central Government may well be inferior to the type of education as provided admirably by the provinces at the moment, and one would like to ask in connection with the clause in this Bill which refers to the taking over of education, what the position is going to be of private schools. We know when Bantu education was taken over by the Central Government, there was also the proposition put to mission schools to fall in with the regulations, or otherwise to function without a grant. Now I would just like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to Clause 6 of this Bill. Is there the same underlying motive in Clause 6, and what is the full meaning of paragraph (a) and (b) of this clause&#x2014; &#x201C;Unless such school is registered with the Department in the prescribed manner and complies with the prescribed requirements; and otherwise than in accordance with the prescribed conditions&#x201D;, &#x201C;no person shall manage any school for the education of Coloured persons which is not a State school or a State-aided school and at which more than 14 pupils are enrolled &#x201D;? Will the hon. the Minister enlarge on the implications of Clause 6?</p>

<p>On the administrative side of this take-over there is going to be very heavy financial expenditure necessary, and the provincial personnel in the four provinces that handle White and Coloured education, will no longer be in control of Coloured and White education. <span class="col_2111-2112" refersTo="page_1070"/>This division of control will necessitate the employment of more personnel in order to handle this separate sector of education. It is the taxpayer in South Africa living in the four provinces who will be called upon to pay for the policy of this separate development.</p>

<p>I would like to ask another question of the hon. Minister regarding the representative representing the Coloured people in the present Provincial Council. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister as to the position of representatives of the Coloured community in the Cape Provincial Council. Once Coloured education is removed from the control of the Cape Provincial Council, will the hon. Minister give the House the assurance that the Coloured representatives will remain in the Cape Provincial Council.</p>

<p>I would like to turn to the Transvaal schools, the Transvaal schools dealing with the Coloured and Asiatic communities. Figures have already been quoted from the Report of the Schumann Commission, viz. that there are 80 schools, 969 teachers and 28,400 pupils in the mixed schools, but as far as the Coloureds alone are concerned, they have 32 schools, 14,500 pupils and 492 teachers. When consulted, the Transvaal Coloured community stated that there was no discrimination against them at present, but that the lack of progress in the building of new schools and in the laying out of new playing fields, was hampering Coloured education. Most of the new schools are prefabricated, they say, and the lack of progress can be attributed solely to the effect of the Group Areas Act, because until these areas are fully defined, the Transvaal authorities are unable and unwilling to develop existing schools fully, or to establish new ones in the old areas. So Coloured schooling is suffering obliquely as a result of this lack of development because of the Group Areas Act. The Coloured teachers of the Transvaal, they state further, have always felt satisfied that their position was satisfactory, and that within the limit of National policy, as laid down by the Government, they were well-treated, and that there is no discrimination in Transvaal Estimates regarding bursaries for the Coloured pupils there. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is going to continue giving the Transvaal pupils generous bursaries and travel bursaries such as they can apply for at the moment? I would also like to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to an ordinance that was passed in the Cape Provincial Council recently which said that children accepted were accepted in schools if their parents had been checked via the population registration control and the certificates of the parents both showed them to be White. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister if the population registration control is now completed in the Transvaal and whether that provision will also be applied to Transvaal Coloured children.</p>

<p>The Coloureds in South Africa have always been accepted as a part of the Western section of the South African population. This has been stressed by hon. members on both sides of the House. The Coloureds speak our languages, they attend the same churches as we do, their living standards are based on our Western living standards and if the Government really wishes to serve the interests of the Coloured community then it should leave in control those at present charged with the administration of education and make a greater contribution by way of a subsidy to the provincial authorities. Expenditure rises very naturally with the provinces as well as with the Central Government, but with this rise in expenditure, my criticism is that it has no bearing whatsoever on the motives in introducing this Bill, because if the provinces were subsidized to a sufficient extent they could pay for Coloured education. Moreover the taxpayer pays for it anyway. If the Government takes over Coloured Education, the national taxpayer will pay for it just the same, and I feel that provincial councils are most admirably suited to our circumstances and that they are a permanent and essential feature of South Africa. They have become a tradition since they were established under the Act of Union, now incorporated in the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, and it is therefore essential to strengthen the provincial councils by retaining their existing rights, and not by pruning them. The machinery for the transfer of Coloured Education laid down in the Bill before the House leaves very much to be desired. The principle of transfer is simply objectionable, as it was in the case of Bantu education, and decentralization of control is always to be preferred, with education left in the hands of the provinces. Anything else, especially when it refers to such a humane subject as the education of children, or the nursing of the sick, when it is centralized tends towards a disregard of people as individual personalities in their own rights. I feel that this Bill is another step in driving a wedge between the Coloureds and the Europeans, that it is diminishing provincial autonomy and rights and that it will run us into unnecessary extra costs, and it could lead to the further estrangement between the two section of the population, the Whites and the non-Whites.</p>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) obviously studied this Bill in order to find points in regard to which she wants information, and I will leave it to the hon. the Minister to provide her with that information. The main theme of her objection to the Bill, if I understood her correctly, was that she objected to the additional expenditure which the taxpayers of the country would have to defray as the result of transferring Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs. My reply to her is this: If it can give the Coloured more than he has had for the past 50 years, I <span class="col_2113-2114" refersTo="page_1071"/>am sure I as well as the whole of the White community are more than prepared to make that greater contribution, because there is no doubt that however much we want to defend the system we had, the accusation can be made against the White man in South Africa to-day that the system under which we wanted to serve that community and provide education for it simply has not kept pace with the times and the demands of the times in which we live. I am one of those who have developed a conscience that we have neglected to do certain things for that community. Therefore I heartily welcome the fact that we want to make a new start in an energetic way with a new, virile and energetic department which can say: This backlog must be caught up with, this emergency in regard to the Coloured population is my task and I shall try to concern myself not only with the every-day needs of the Coloured in regard to housing and his upliftment, but also start at the very roots and that is to educate his child to become a useful citizen of our country who can occupy a worthy and respected place.</p>

<p>I rose to thank the Minister heartily for what he has already done for the Coloured community in the short time he has been responsible for this Department, and in doing so I do not want to forget the names of men like Dr. du Plessis and others, who along with him fought like a small Gideon&#x2019;s band to maintain the honour and respect of the White man in the eyes of the Coloured community in South Africa. They have rendered wonderful services. But it is no less than our duty now to make it possible for them to continue that good work full force and on a level which is not only worthy of the Department of Coloured Affairs but of the White people of our country as well. It is a great and a tremendous task.</p>

<p>It has been said that we should leave it to the Provincial Councils, I have no complaints about the work they have done, but I want to say that with all respect: If this is the position in which the Coloured community finds itself after 50 years or more of provincial control, then it does not seem to me that the question of finance is the only one I should be concerned about and that I can allow this state of affairs to remain as it is, But I will accept that this is so, and I want to say that the Cape Province, which is larger than all the other provinces together, does not have the sources of income which, e.g. the Transvaal has. But for all these years the Cape Province has had to bear this tremendous responsibility, and it is nothing short of a miracle that they succeeded in the way they did, and as the hon. member for Gordonia has said, the taxpayers of the Cape Province had to pay property tax in order to finance these services, and they have to pay more taxation than is paid in the other provinces. Therefore it is high time for us to remedy these matters. I personally do not wish to wait until the Schumann Commission has one day published a report in regard to the financial relations, and then to do something. It should be done immediately. I am prepared to say that the taxpayers of South Africa should make it their responsibility, and I know that the matter cannot be in better hands than those of the hon. the Minister and his Department. As I have already said, they have to catch up with the great backlog, and I have no doubt that where they are now going to be burdened also with the education and training of the Coloureds, they will make sure that the same mistakes will not be made in respect of the Coloureds which were made in the past in connection with White Education, but that they will help to educate the Coloureds in those things which will be of most value to them and which they will need most. By that I mean that we must ensure that their vocational and technical training will keep pace with their needs as a group so that the Coloured can be a useful citizen to society and can be of service to his own community and to the country.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if I have to tell you to-night what the position of Coloured education is in my own constituency, in a town like Mafeking, I must honestly say that I would hesitate to tell you over the floor of this House, so essential is it for steps to be taken immediately. Therefore I want to express the hope that this House will never begrudge the Minister the funds he will need to catch up with this backlog which is really the responsibility of Parliament and of the Government. I hope that he will always readily obtain the funds needed by his Department to perform the great task resting on them.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the Minister and express the hope that by means of this Bill he and his Department will be of great benefit to the Coloured community for the welfare of which they are responsible, and I want to express the hope that through education and uplift the Coloured community, with the guidance of that Department, will in the years that lie ahead be a useful and contented section of our population and will be an ally to our White civilization in South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am glad to be able to follow the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) because it is clear to me that he has given heed to the appeal made by the hon. the Minister at the outset when he asked that this debate should be carried on in a spirit of realism and objectivity, and although I do not agree with the hon. member in every respect it is clear to me that he has heeded that appeal, because I believe that tremendous harm may be done to the prestige of the White people in South Africa by discussing the Coloured problem in an unrestrained manner.</p>

<p>I do not doubt for a moment that this Bill as a whole should be viewed against the background of the policy of the Nationalist Party, the policy of separate development, the policy of autogenous development or of development of each race according to its nature, as one of the hon. members called it, and in particular I believe that the Bill should be viewed in the light of the particular policy of transfer <span class="col_2115-2116" refersTo="page_1072"/>ring Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs. I do not think any hon. member opposite will deny that. That is the policy, and the Government is simply trying to implement its policy by means of this Bill.</p>

<p>If we accept that, I feel that we should also attach a different value to the consultation which the hon. the Minister told us took place with the Coloureds. It was interesting to hear that he held 40 regional meetings at which Coloureds attended. It is certainly interesting to know that between 6,000 and 7,000 teachers were consulted in regard to the matter. I want to add that in my opinion that is laudable. But in my opinion also this has little to do with the essence of the matter, because the question that arises in my mind is this: What would the Minister have done if the Coloureds during those consultations had said: &#x201C;No, we do not want it &#x201D;? Would the Minister then have said: I am convinced that the Coloureds do not want this change? Or would he have continued with it? He would undoubtedly have continued because the policy of the Nationalist Party has not been formulated with reference to the wishes of the Coloureds; certainly that policy has not been formulated with reference to a proviso that the Coloureds should approve or disapprove of this transfer. This is the policy of the Nationalist Party and in my opinion the Coloured teacher who surely listened to this explanation with as as much interest as I did, or more, felt that he was faced with a <i>fait accompli,</i> and whether he liked it or not the hon. the Minister would simply have continued with his legislation. The conclusion to which I have come in regard to this consultation is that the Minister, for the sake of courtesy, consulted all these teachers, but in my opinion he cannot rely on this consultation to support the transfer of Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs.</p>
