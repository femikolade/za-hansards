<heading>Legislation in Regard to Crash Helmets</heading>

<question by="#mitchell" to="#minister_of_transport">

<num>*IV.</num>

<from>Mr. M. L. MITCHELL</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Transport:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his Department has made any investigations into the incidence of head injuries in accidents involving the drivers of power-driven two-wheeled vehicles: and</li>

<li>(2) whether he intends to introduce legislation to make the wearing of crash helmets by riders of such vehicles compulsory; if so, when.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_transport" to="#mitchell">

<from>The MINISTER OF TRANSPORT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No. The National Institute for Personnel Research of the C.S.I.R., however, made a study of motor cycle accidents. In its report the Institute quoted the findings of research undertaken in Great Britain to the effect that 92 per cent of the deaths in the sample of motor cycle accidents investigated were due to head injuries.</li>

<li>(2) This is a matter for Provincial legislation. For the information of the hon. member I can state that the South African Road Safety Council has considered requesting such legislation. It has been found, however, that the helmet at present available on the market is under South African conditions unsuitable from the point of view of unimpaired hearing and comfort. The South African Road Safety Council accordingly approached the National Institute for Road Research to conduct research with a view to evolving a crash helmet suitable for South African conditions. Representations for legislation on the compulsory wearing of crash helmets has been deferred until the results of the research are known. The National Institute for Road Research has meanwhile obtained specimens of helmets evolved by a manufacturer in Great Britain for tropical conditions as well as helmets experimentally produced in the Republic and these are being tested in conjunction with a number of local Traffic Departments. As soon as their reports have been received steps will be taken with a view to a satisfactory specification being laid down by the South African Bureau of Standards. As already stated the Provincial authorities will thereafter be requested to introduce legislation for the compulsory wearing of crash helmets.</li>

<num>*V.</num>

<from>Mr. M. L. MITCHELL</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether there have been any negotiations between his Department and the Durban City Council in regard to the future control of the Bantu township Kwa Mashu by the Department; if so, what was the nature of the negotiations; and, if not,</li>

<li>(2) whether any such negotiations are contemplated; if so, for what reason.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development" to="#mitchell">

<from>The MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No formal negotiations have yet been entered into between the Durban Corporation and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development in regard to the incorporation of Kwa Mashu location into the Inanda Mission Reserve. The matter has on one or two occasions been discussed between officials of my Department and the Durban Corporation but as the development of Kwa Mashu is still in progress and as the Corporation is now in the process of purchasing from Natal Estates the small area of land between Kwa Mashu and the Inanda Reserve for the purpose of extending Kwa Mashu it is considered that it would be premature to proceed further with the matter at this juncture.</li>

<li>(2) Ever since the establishment of Kwa Mashu it has been the intention that it should ultimately be incorporated as part of the Inanda Reserve so as to give effect to the policy that, wherever possible, Bantu employed in a European area should reside in a Bantu homeland and to enable the Bantu to obtain full ownership of the erven occupied by them. It is felt that this will also bring about stability of labour as well as a happy and contented Bantu community.</li>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#odell">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. However, the figures quoted in the Press reports are incorrect. According to the latest annual report of the Assize Division 320 out of 4,855 petrol pumps dispensing fuel in the Johannesburg Assize District were found defective during assize tests and were closed.</li>

<li>(2) No; nil.</li>

<li>(3) No. The testing and assizing of petrol pumps are functions of the Assize Division.</li>

<li>(4) As the assizing of petrol pumps is a continuous process and in view of the penalties prescribed in the Weights and Measures Act in connection with the reintroduction of rejected weighing and measuring instruments for use in the trade no special steps are contemplated.</li>

In Durban additional boxes are in the process of being installed and it is expected that the work will be completed by 1 April 1963.

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) I recently saw a Press report to the effect that a new agreement of association had been concluded between the member states of the European Economic Community and certain overseas countries and territories which, in terms of article 131 of the Rome Treaty of 1957 qualify for and have accepted associated membership and which have held such membership for a considerable time prior to the conclusion of the new agreement reported in the Press.</li>

<li>(2) No. In terms of article 131 of the Rome Treaty associated membership is confined to the non-European countries and territories which previously had or still have special relations with Belgium, France, Italy and the Netherlands. South Africa therefore does not qualify for such associated membership and in this respect its position is exactly the same as that of other countries, e.g. U.S.A., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, etc.</li>

One of the witnesses whose evidence had to be taken could not be traced and he was only located during May 1962, when the preparatory examination was reopened.<br/>Due to an unfortunate combination of circumstances there was a delay in forwarding the further evidence to the Attorney-General with the result that the case could not be brought before the Circuit Court which commenced its sittings at Queenstown on 27 July 1962. The accused appeared at the next Circuit Court session at Queenstown on 27 November 1962, and the fact that he had been in custody for almost a year was taken into consideration by the Court when it imposed sentence.</li>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to move the following motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its deep dissatisfaction at the obvious lack of planning and guidance in respect of the serious problems threatening the agricultural industry and requests the responsible Cabinet Minister to resign immediately.</block>

<p>Last year we also had a discussion on agriculture, a discussion which was an objective one. During that discussion the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing told us that things were going well with certain facets of agriculture and not so well with others. In other words, things were going well with certain facets and reasonably well with others. Either the hon. the Minister is not <i>au fait</i> with the position of the farmers in this country or he is not sympathetically disposed towards them. We pointed out last year that things were going badly with the farmers in many branches of agriculture. There are, of course, certain facets where things are going well with the farmers. The wool farmers, for example, are faring well but things are going badly with many other farmers. When we read the report dealing with the depopulation of the platteland and realize that 28,000 farmers have already left the platteland, we know that things could not have been going too well with them otherwise they would never have left the platteland. They left the platteland because things were going badly with them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>We are not discussing the difficulties of other countries now; we are discussing our country&#x2019;s difficulties. When we see that arrear interest and capital instalments owing to the Land Bank amounted to R4.6 million in December 1961, it is clear to us that things are not going well with those farmers either because the man who cannot meet his interest and capital instalments is not a flourishing farmer. When we see that in 1957-8. according to the income-tax assessments, 17 per cent of the farmers were farming at a loss and that in 1961-2,23 per cent farmed at a loss, it is clear to us that things were not going well with them and I believe that the percentage to-day is even much higher. The production costs of maize rose between 1948 and 1962 by 102 per cent while the maize price rose by only 33 per cent. Last year production costs rose even higher and the price dropped considerably. How on earth can things be going well with those people? The cost of farming requisites rose by 1.5 per cent in 1961 and by 2.9 per cent in 1962&#x2014;twice as much. Things are therefore not going at all well with the farmers. But it is not only we on this side of the House who know that things are going badly with the farmers. There are members on <span class="col_989-990" refersTo="page_0509"/>the other side who also know that a large number of farmers in this country are struggling.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that. The position of the farmer has not improved over the past year. The Government and the Ministers did nothing about it. They cannot handle the present surpluses. Milk prices were lowered and the result was that many farmers produced less milk. They gave less concentrates to their cows because it did not pay them to do so. It is quite true that droughts also played their part but one of the reasons was that prices were too low; it was not a paying proposition to produce milk; the milk farmers produced less and the result was that we found ourselves with a shortage of butter and cheese and we had to import it. There is no proper planning on the part of the Government in connection with agriculture. As far as meat is concerned we recently had a surplus and now we have a shortage. Fortunately, the drought saved the Minister from a surplus this year. As far as maize is concerned the price will probably drop lower if we have a larger crop. As a result of the larger crop it is possible that some farmers will produce more per morgen and that they will be able to make a small profit. On the other hand their production costs will also be much higher</p>

<p>They will need more bags; their threshing expenses will be higher but the exports will be far greater because the new crop will quite possibly amount to 75,000,000 or 80,000,000 bags and the price will probably be fixed accordingly.</p>

<p>It is an estimate. One of the members of the Maize Board told me that it may easily be 80,000,000 bags. The Minister&#x2019;s solution to the whole problem is that the farmer has to adapt himself. He told us last year that the farmer paid what he liked for his land; he farmed there with whatever he liked and he used his labour as he liked and he went on to say this (Col. 1262)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I say therefore that if the producers retain that basic freedom, they will have to be prepared to a large extent to sell the article that they produce at the price that they can get for it.</block>

<p>&#x201C;Take the price that they can get.&#x201D; That is the sympathy which the farmers get from this Government! The small-scale farmers are frankly told that they will have to clear out, that they will have to be sacrificed under the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>I want to say something about meat and the handling of meat. In 1948 when this Government came into power there was a fixed price for meat. The farmer knew precisely what he was going to get; the trade had a fixed price and the producer had a fixed price. Hon. members on the other side condemned that scheme roundly, but strangely enough they continued that scheme for two and a half years after having condemned it as a bad scheme in 1946,1947 and the early part of 1948. In November 1950 they came forward with the policy of auctions on the hook for sheep together with a floor price. Six years later they introduced the system of auctions on the hook for oxen. In 1961 they abolished the whole of the permit system. We still remember the glut of sheep on the market&#x2014;16,000 here in Cape Town and 30,000 in Newtown. We experienced the worst cruelty to animals that we have probably ever experienced, so much so that because of the public outcry the Government was compelled to effect a change and shortly afterwards they introduced the quota system in terms of which they placed the responsibility on the market agents and said to them: &#x201C;That is your baby; you must handle the matter.&#x201D; We have had this groping about in connection with the marketing of meat over the past 14 years. The Government has no plan; they meddle here and they meddle there in an effort to bring about a small improvement.</p>

<p>What is the position of the lucerne farmer? Two years ago there was a shortage of lucerne. The farmer received a maximum price of 88 cents per 100 lbs. Last year there was so much lucerne that the farmers along the Orange River could not sell their lucerne. <span class="col_991-992" refersTo="page_0510"/>They had stacks of lucerne along the Orange River resembling small mountains. Many farmers received 40 cents which their co-operative societies had to pay them. The valuation was applied very strictly and because their lucerne was not classed as first grade lucerne, the farmers were urged to plough it under. Most of the farmers did so because the production of lucerne was not paying them. Over the past six months we have had a tremendous shortage of lucerne. That is the position of the poor lucerne farmer in this country. He has no certainty and he is subject to a maximum price for his lucerne. In times of scarcity he is pegged down and in times of plenty he faces bankruptcy. There is hardly any farmer in this country who is worse off than the lucerne farmer. What was the reaction of the Minister? His reaction, particularly in connection with the maize problem, was to hold meetings in the Free State&#x2014;he and his colleague. At Frankfort in August the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing said [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A downward adjustment and sacrifices are needed. Many people are going to be hurt before the problem is solved.</block>

<p>The Minister of Agricultural Technical Services said [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is this sickly tendency on the part of some farmers and even farmers&#x2019; assistance committee members to think that they need not fulfil their obligations to the State.</block>

<p>I think that if there is one section of our community which has fulfilled its obligations to the State up to the present, it is the farming section. There may be a few exceptions. There may be some irresponsible farmers who say that they cannot fulfil their obligations to the State but that is no justification for the Minister to cast this slur on the farmers and to say that they do not want to fulfil their obligations to the State. On the other hand what is the reaction of the farmers towards the Ministers? Let me quote what happened at the meeting which they held&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dissatisfaction amongst north-eastern and eastern Free State farmers over the Government&#x2019;s mealie muddle is mounting and in some places open hostility is being shown to the two Ministers of Agriculture now appearing on the same platforms in the mealie areas. The Ministers are Mr. P. K. le Roux, Agricultural Technical Services and Mr. Uys, Agricultural Economics and Marketing. At some meetings Nationalists have booed the Ministers. At others rows have broken out between fellow-Nationalists. At one a leading Nationalist shouted: &#x201C;I would never vote for you even if a communist is put up against you&#x2026;.&#x201D; But Mr. le Roux is avoiding issues, adopting diversionary tactics and switching to personal attacks. Many of the meetings have continued till past midnight. The feeling is that the joint Ministerial tour has done nothing to give farmers any future hope but has aggravated the position for the Government.</block>

<p>Here is another report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government was taken to task by delegates to the Transvaal Nationalist Party Congress at the session in Pretoria yesterday on questions of surpluses, prices of agricultural products, uneconomic units, rising production costs and the effects of these on the farmer. These are the comments of several delegates: &#x201C;The price of mealies is based on some imaginary concept and is then reduced to ensure that there is no possibility of a profit.&#x201D;</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;I never thought it would be necessary for me to speak to my Government in this fashion, but the fact is that the smaller farmer is going to the wall because of lack of sympathy from the Government. We sent a letter to the Minister from Morgenzon about our problems but he chose to ignore it.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The small farmer is being driven into a corner. People who could make a living from the land in my area a year ago, now cannot do so. If it is necessary for the farmer to state his case in the way in which it has proved necessary this afternoon then we must accept the fact that the case is already half lost.&#x201D;</block>

<p>That is the reaction of the farmers towards the Government. No wonder that one hears from numbers of places that the farmers are insisting that the two Ministers should resign. I was told by a Nationalist the other day: &#x201C;I am a hardened Nationalist &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>I shall prove it to my good friend, the hon. member for Cradock, who is a strong supporter of the Marketing Act. He always tells us that he was one of those who assisted in framing the Marketing Act. In the January 1962 issue of <i>Agricon</i> we read the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In some cases where the producer receives a fixed price, costs of production are in fact taken into account when that price is determined, but this is only one of the factors &#x2026;</block>

<p>You are guessing.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is a good guess. Mr. Speaker, it is price manipulation to get away from the principle of the Marketing Act, the principle of production costs plus a living wage for the producer. I want to quote the following from <i>Organized Agriculture</i> (Translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Agricultural economic long-term planning, the co-ordination of present short-and longterm planning and their positive implementation as swiftly as possible have become an urgent requirement to help solve the economic problems with which the South African farmer is struggling. The General Council of the S.A.A.U. came to this conclusion after the economic position of the farmer had been closely scrutinized at the Council&#x2019;s meeting in Pretoria in March in terms of congress resolutions. Farmers throughout the whole country expressed serious concern at the present tendency of solving surplus problems by price manipulation and thereby ruining and eliminating hundreds of small-scale farmers and making large-scale farmers topple.</block>

<p>Price manipulation is, of course, a serious departure from the principles of the Marketing Act and of stable marketing. A certain measure of adjustment is, of course, unavoidable, but it must be done in such a way that farmers do not suffer. The adjustment should take place over a number of years. A short-term, as well as a long-term, policy should be applied, short-term to absorb surpluses immediately and long-term to expand the local market and to find suitable foreign markets. We will have to give financial assistance, advice and guidance. As <i>Agricon</i> recently put it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those with capital resources, the requisite knowledge and executive ability, will be able to achieve this unaided, but many of those without financial reserves will have to be assisted. In addition to credit facilities, many need, as badly, advice and guidance on exactly how to make the necessary changes and how to utilize the funds made available to them.</block>

<p>We fully agree with that. We think that it is absolutely necessary to do so. We must assist the farmers during this period of adjustment. We will have to develop domestic markets; the less-privileged classes must be assisted by means of subsidies. The foundation of longterm agriculture and farm planning is research, veterinary services, extension officers and agriculture faculties at universities and agricultural colleges. It is in this connection that the Ministers of Agriculture are found wanting in respect of many services. Year after year we talk about the shortage of the necessary staff. Those whom we have are doing outstanding work for us, but there are far too few of them to be able to do the work properly. At the present rate it will probably take 50 years before we are able to demarcate this country properly. Recently we only had 120 extension officers for 105,000 farmers, while Rhodesia had 170 for 4,000 farmers. There is also a tremendous shortage of technical staff. The position remains unchanged from year to year. Each year the matter is raised here, but our requests are not acceded to. It is not only we on this side who feel so strongly about this position, but hon. members on the other side as well. The hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) made a very good speech in this connection last year, and I would like to quote part of that speech (col. 5577)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to throw light on a matter which I think has aroused the interest of everybody, both in farming and Public Service circles, and it concerns the dilemma in which the Department finds itself at the moment, and has been in recent years, in connection with its research personnel. I do not think we can afford to allow a Department in South Africa to lose its staff at the rate at which the Department of Agricultural Technical Services has been losing its research staff in recent years. There is a lack of research workers in South Africa in general, but particularly in this Department, because the Department has lost its staff to commerce and industry, as well as to large agricultural institutions.</block>

<p>Here I want to add &#x201C;and to other countries &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the first place, I think the Department lost its research workers and scientists because it was not prepared to place a premium on scientific services, and these days the position is that a premium is being placed on scientific knowledge in practically every country in the world. Now the fact is that in recent years we have lost some of our best men at a rate at which we should never <span class="col_995-996" refersTo="page_0512"/>have lost them, and which our country cannot afford. An investigation was made under the leadership of Professor Rautenbach, and therefore I hope that the Minister will, at this stage, be able to say something in this regard which will indicate to us what the attitude of the Department is going to be with an eye to the future.</block>

<p>And so he goes on.</p>

<p>What was the Minister&#x2019;s reply?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister&#x2019;s reply was that during the war years there were no facilities&#x2014;Grootfontein was closed. But the hon. the Minister forgets that the war ended 20 years ago. In any case, that is the position as it actually is. There is a shortage of these people. We cannot plan ahead and we are retrogressing. We will never overcome our problems if we do not take positive steps to remedy the position. What is the position in connection with soil conservation? The Soil Conservation Act has been on the Statute Book for 25 years. We thought that by this time we would at least have reached the stage where our soil would no longer be deteriorating and where we would have succeeded in reclaiming all our land. Instead of that we still have a marked deterioration. It will be a long time before we overcome this position. We do not have the necessary extension officers; there is no farm planning, nor are there people to ensure that the planning that we do is properly carried out. The sooner this Minister resigns the better it will be for this country.</p>

<p>Our policy is to stimulate industry generally by regaining the confidence of the investor both at home and abroad so that the demand for primary and related agricultural products can be increased. The lack of demand is one of the most important reasons why we are saddled with surpluses. If we had not had a change of government, if the industrial development which would have taken place under the United Party had taken place, the purchasing power of the public would have been so great that we would not have had any surpluses. If this Government had not smothered the immigration policy of the United Party, we would quite possibly have had an additional 750,000 White people in this country to-day, people who would have been consumers. They would have used our surpluses and we would have experienced far fewer difficulties than we are experiencing to-day. This problem which is facing the farmers to-day is due directly to the Nationalist Party Government. What we need in the first place therefore is a United Party Government; secondly, the maintenance of the principles of the Marketing Act system, that is to say, price stabilization and price determination on the basis of production costs plus a reasonable profit; thirdly, a thorough inquiry into the factors influencing steadily increasing production costs, particularly the prices of agricultural requisites; fourthly, positive action to combat the problem of surpluses, amongst other things, the taking of effective steps to find new markets overseas and in Africa; an increased consumption of grain as animal food; alternative uses for surpluses; the use of surpluses for emergencies and for the less privileged classes; increased purchasing power for the lower income groups; the improvement of research, information and veterinary services; improved agricultural training and education for our labour forces as well. Mr. Speaker, the time has come for our labour to receive training as well. We invest hundreds of millions of pounds of capital in machinery which is controlled by non-White labour, unskilled non-White labour. They handle that machinery in such a way that it lasts a very short time. That labour must be trained and facilities must be created to train such labour and to make it efficient. Further, farmers must be given assistance to adjust their farming operations to changing circumstances; and lastly, income-tax must be levied on an average income over a period of at least three years, Because a farmer&#x2019;s income fluctuates to such an extent it is necessary that he be assessed on his average income. I move.</p>

<p>I have pleasure in seconding the motion that this House expresses its dissatisfaction with the agricultural policy of the Government. It is with particular pleasure that I second the motion that the two hon. Ministers of Agriculture, who are unfit to handle their portfolios, should resign. We will prove how unfit they are. It is, however, not with the same pleasure that I say that the time has come for this House to scrutinize the position of agriculture. We so often say that agriculture is the backbone of the country. In other countries in the Southern Hemisphere we say that agriculture is still the backbone of those countries but here that backbone has become so paralysed that it has become merely an appendage to the economy of the country.</p>

<p>This side of the House is in complete agreement with the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs that the economy of this country is inherently so fundamentally sound that even the Government cannot break it. This country has everything, Sir. It has minerals, it has metals, it has precious and semi-precious stones; it has unlimited resources of coal, it has a tremendous source of labour which not even this Government and the methods which it has used, has alienated to such an extent that agriculture no longer has labour. This country has sunshine; it is the country in which we live. It is the country that we love. It is the country which we, like hon. members on the other side, will defend to the last, so that the White man can be assured of his place here.</p>

<p>Let us look at the position of agriculture over the last few years to try to discover what ails it. It does not help to argue about it but the fact remains that a large percentage of the farmers&#x2014;I do not even want to hazard a guess <span class="col_997-998" refersTo="page_0513"/>at the percentage&#x2014;are inherently no longer solvent; those farmers are already insolvent. What then is wrong with the country? Are prices too low? Are production costs too high? Do we not have the markets? What has gone wrong with agriculture in South Africa? Does agriculture in South Africa experience more difficulties than agriculture in Australia or New Zealand? Does our agriculture here struggle more than agriculture in the Latin-American countries where they have a form of government different to that which we have here? They have dictatorial Governments there which do not allow a country to develop in a democratic way. Even there things are going better with agriculture than here. The Nationalist Party recently published a pamphlet to indicate the phenomenal increase in our agricultural production over the last ten years and the phenomenal increase in the income of agriculture&#x2014;note this well&#x2014;over the past five years. They did not have the courage to take it over a ten-year period! The ten-year period which was taken was the period from 1952 to 1962. The pamphlet states that the increase in the index figure was 45 units. If one analyses the ten-year period from 1943 to 1954 one finds that this figure also rose by 45 units. It is a normal thing for the index figure for agriculture to rise if one has virile people, people with a pioneering spirit and people who will continue producing in the most scientific manner. It is the strangest thing in the world to my mind that any Government can say that because the index figure for agriculture has increased by 45 units over the past ten years, this is proof of the fact that the country has a good Government. The South African farmers are just the same as farmers in any other part of the world, and better. Notwithstanding the droughts with which they have to contend&#x2014;other countries have to deal with the same problem&#x2014;the farmers in South Africa are some of the best in the world, as those of us who had the privilege of doing some travelling can testify. It is the most normal thing that with their scientific methods, with everything that science can give them by way of fertilizers and mechanization and so forth they should produce more year after year. Mr. Speaker, our production has lagged behind. All the other countries in the Southern Hemisphere have been exporting countries for some time &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<p>I think our problem is surplus production.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That is what the Government says. All the countries in the Southern. Hemisphere have been large exporting countries for some time. We have been progressing at a snail&#x2019;s pace and it was only a year or two ago that we reached the stage where surpluses and export products began to create a problem. They state further in this publication that the income from agriculture has risen over the past five years by R120,000,000. They are silent about the previous five years when it dropped.</p>

<p>Let us look at the previous ten years. During this period production also rose by 45 units. Over that period the gross income from agriculture rose by no less than R402,000,000 as against R120,000,000 for the years 1952-62. There is something wrong in the country somewhere.</p>

<p>Let us ask ourselves what this Government has done to encourage and stimulate production. Has it done anything by way of a price incentive or not? For a number of years it accepted the recommendations of the marketing boards as long as the product could be consumed locally and as long as price determinations were not disturbed because of the export quota. But the moment surpluses arose they resorted to the old story of supply and demand. They cut the prices of some of those products, something which I can never agree was justified. Last year the United Party told the Minister that 10c per bag of maize would be sufficient. There is the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and if he wants to be honest he will also agree that 10c would have been adequate, but now it is 25c and 27&#x00BD;c. That is the decrease. That is the Government&#x2019;s method of dealing with the surplus. There are many members on the other side serving on marketing boards; some of them have even been the chairmen of those boards. They know as well as we do that when a marketing board makes a recommendation in connection with the price structure, the representative of the National Marketing Council argues about it for two days or more. Boards have already adjourned and met again at a later stage because they could not get past the representative of the National Marketing Council in connection with a price recommendation. Eventually, because they can do nothing else, they accept the price which the representative of the National Marketing Council is prepared to recommend to the Minister.</p>

<p>When this party comes into power&#x2014;I do not say &#x201C;if&#x201D; it comes into power; I say &#x201C;when&#x201D; it does&#x2014;it will ensure that that National Marketing Council is reconstituted. It will not consist as it does now of six or seven members, two of whom are public servants, and others who do not speak for agriculture even though they are farmers because they have not been placed there on behalf of an agricultural organization or nominated by an agricultural organization. We will ensure that the National Marketing Council is constituted on a basis which will ensure that representatives of agriculture have seats on the Council, so that when price determinations are made there will be a correlation between the price structure and the price of the various agricultural products which we do not have to-day.</p>

<p>Oh, no; I do not say that it has done nothing. Concessions have been <span class="col_999-1000" refersTo="page_0514"/>made by the Railways in respect of stock which has to be transported; there have been railway concessions on fodder, That is the assistance which this Government has given. We are still waiting for the day when this Government states that it will establish a fodder bank for droughts by way of financial support or otherwise which will prevent our losing 1,000,000 or more sheep during one drought. [Interjections.] We have just experienced a severe drought but recently we have had good rains. Most parts of the country have had good rains and we are grateful for this fact but we know what this recent drought has done to our stock, what it cost the Eastern and Western Transvaal, the whole of the Free State, the Little and the Great Karoo and the Eastern Cape. We know how many head of stock died, something which could have been prevented by making available surplus stocks of grain at the export price, or even at a lower price, if necessary, to be processed into and made available as animal feed. Have we ever investigated the results of such a policy? If we can use our surplus production at a low price or at a subsidized price to be processed into animal feed and in this way feed our stock during times of drought, what will the position be then? What is the country coming to if the number of stock in this country to-day is the same as it was in 1932? How can a country feed its people if the quality of the meat falls because of drought, and if when an ox arrives at the market it weighs an average of 380 lbs. instead of 520 lbs.? If we can stimulate and strengthen our herds by way of a feeding scheme which will ensure that the animal reaches the market weighing more, we will be progressing and we will have meat for export. I challenge any hon. member opposite to tell me that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the former Department of Agriculture, before it was divided into two&#x2014;ever told the farmers: We advise you to make use of the following three or four cross-breeds of oxen according to climatic conditions and locality.</p>

<p>Eventually we had surplus production, notwithstanding the lack of action on the part Of the Government to stimulate agriculture. What was the reply then? There was a cut in prices, and the small-scale farmer was told that the uneconomic units were responsible for the fact that the farmers were struggling. I ask hon. members opposite? When is a unit uneconomic? It is uneconomic when production costs and the price of the land, in the first instance, are too high, and when the price of the product is too low. The size of a unit makes no difference but under those circumstances it will be uneconomic. What does an expert say? He writes as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Land prices, production costs and the maintenance of his position are important factors deeply affecting the small-scale farmer particularly. In Europe land price are pegged according to a fixed estimated value in order to lend solidarity to agriculture and to prevent speculation and price manipulation.</block>

<block name="quote">No financial assistance can save a producer on an uneconomic unit.</block>

<p>My friend, it was the hon. member for Vredefort who wrote this, not I. I told you what the Government&#x2019;s answer was to the question of surpluses. Did the Government take any steps to ensure that we had markets for any agricultural surpluses which we produced in the past and which we produced this year? If this good season continues we will probably again reap 60,000,000 or 70,000,000 bags of maize. What is the answer of the Government and of these two Ministers in connection with markets? One has to have a market to sell one&#x2019;s products. It is pathetic to look at these two persons, Mr. Speaker; it is pathetic to see what they do when one talks about international markets and the international marketing system. It is a pity that they did not have the opportunity of coming into contact more with these people as the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs came into contact with them during his last three visits overseas. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs warned us yesterday. I cannot agree with him more. He did not put both alternatives; he put only one alternative to the Euromart. He said that heavy tariffs would be imposed upon agricultural products exported there. He did not say that one of the clauses of the Euromart agreement provides that where they produce an adequate quantity of a certain commodity themselves they will not permit that commodity to be imported. Who will tell me that Europe does not produce sufficient perishable products, wine, and so forth?</p>

<p>If we look at our trade statistics we see that of our total exports of R852,000,000 in 1961 we exported goods to the value of R380,000,000 to the United Kingdom and Rhodesia which is a good 40 per cent of our total exports, and we only exported goods to the value of R200,000,000 to the whole of <span class="col_1001-1002" refersTo="page_0515"/>Europe. Of our total exports amounting to R852,000,000, R580,000,000 went to England, Rhodesia and Europe. [Interjections.] The hon. member there is apparently not pleased that we had those markets and that we are now losing them.</p>

<p>We must lose them, Mr. Speaker, partly because if England joins Euromart she will be subject to all the qualifications of that body. We will then be faced with the problem of exporting those products to England whereas to-day we are freely exporting them to England. Our problem will be firstly, a tariff wall against us and secondly, we will then come into competition with the whole world because then we will have to produce at a competitive price. It has to be the same selling price as that in the rest of the world. As I have already indicated, of all the southern hemisphere countries we are most dependent upon Euromart. What are we going to do in that connection?</p>

<p>I will not allow myself to be told that the hon. the Prime Minister was not able to find two Ministers of Agriculture amongst the more intelligent farmers on that side who could have gone overseas at the right time and who could have appointed their trade attach&#x00E9;s timeously or who would have encouraged the Department of Foreign Affairs to appoint them. I can count the agricultural attach&#x00E9;s of this country on four fingers. We are dealing with an ideological policy here while the other countries in the southern hemisphere are appointing agricultural attach&#x00E9;s not only in all the northern hemisphere countries but also in our own part of the world, to the north of us. They are sending trade missions overseas and they have been doing so for years. They have concluded trade contracts for their dairy products and their meat. I wonder whether hon. members on the other side know that for more than a year Australia has been selling her old cows and bulls to America under contract at fantastic prices? When we talk about trade agreements, it is pathetic to think that we have representatives in this House who travelled overseas for years and returned with recommendations to the Ministers concerned that not only should agricultural attach&#x00E9;s be appointed in many countries but that trade agreements should also be entered into to protect agriculture in our country in regard to the sale of our agricultural products. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to tell us how many trade agreements our country has concluded to sell our agricultural produce under contract abroad. I want to issue a challenge to the hon. the Minister even as far as Japan is concerned. I have indicated how difficult it may be to market our products in Europe and this also holds good for England and the Continent. If England does not join the Common Market, she will give preference to Commonwealth countries. That is obvious. If England joins the Market, we will find ourselves in trouble. We look towards the East in search for markets. What do we see? We see that in Tanganyika at Moshi a conference is being held at the moment. The following report appeared in this connection&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">African National Congress leaders from South Africa asked Japanese attending the Afro-Asian Conference here to agitate in Japan for trade boycott of South Africa.</block>

<p>They say further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The sources said the Japanese delegates hoped that pressure could be brought against their Government to renounce contracts agreed to last year for imports of pig-iron from South Africa. The two delegations were expected to continue their talks during the conference and the leader of the Japanese delegation at the meeting said his delegation was in favour of the end of colonialism in Africa.</block>

<p>I sincerely hope that the Japanese will not pay attention to the request to impose boycotts against South Africa because that would be silly. I hope that it will be possible for us to expand our trade with Japan because we will have to expand our trade. We must find a market abroad for our surplus agricultural production if a market cannot be found here, and where will we find markets if we can sell less and less in Europe? There are other southern hemisphere countries which may perhaps buy some of our agricultural produce. The South Americas do not have a large grape production and we may find a market there. I do not know how much propaganda we make in respect of our wine products in the South American countries, There are places there to which we could send these products but then we must do our level best to find more markets. Otherwise we will not find them. The hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said last evening that we must make a place for ourselves in the Euromart. I would like the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs or the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing to explain how our price structure can find a market in Europe in competition with all the other southern hemisphere and northern hemisphere countries, Canada and all the others included? How can we find a market in Europe? No one would welcome it more than members on this side of the House because the whole economic structure of the country will collapse if we cannot find markets overseas to a larger extent than is the case to-day. What is the Government&#x2019;s answer? Has the Government lifted a finger to reduce production costs since prices fell and production costs rose? I am still waiting for them to reply in this connection. They say that farmers must reduce their production costs. We have done our best but if the prices of tractors and spares and artificial fertilizers rise, the farmer can do little to bring down his production costs. We <span class="col_1003-1004" refersTo="page_0516"/>also have the fact that many farmers purchased their land during a boom period, when land prices were high, and they are saddled with that burden to-day. They have to pay high rates of interest. It is fortunate that interest rates are falling because this will assist the farmer somewhat but there are so many factors which increase production costs. I am still waiting for the Minister to tell us that he will insist that the Government reduces customs tariffs on tractors and spares and artificial fertilizers and bags and similar articles used by the farmer so that production costs can be lowered. That is a cardinal point. If a man has to make a living and he has an economic unit, irrespective of the size of the unit, the production costs must be lowered and that man&#x2019;s prices must be stabilized. Otherwise he cannot exist. If you force him to accept the world price without a subsidy, it is quite obvious that you will have to lower production costs until that man can accept the world price otherwise he will go bankrupt.</p>

<p>The mover of the motion raised certain points of policy of this party in connection with agriculture. I want to add that a Government or a party which is not prepared to extend its agricultural representation throughout the world and to seek markets for its country, not merely by way of an occasional mission now and again in connection with the marketing of maize and the marketing of dairy products or the marketing of citrus products and so forth, is not worth its salt, and that a Government which does not want to ensure that more trade agreements are entered into to dispose of its surplus agricultural production, is not worth its salt either. It is one of the definite aims of our party to bring this about. I say that a Government which is not prepared to ensure that the National Marketing Council is converted so as to be representative on a sound basis of agriculture and agricultural organizations, that a Government which does not want to ensure that the South African Agricultural Union is strengthened, financially and otherwise, so that it can make a positive contribution towards the solution of the problem and not merely hold conferences with foreigners, is not worth its salt. And&#x2014;this serves as a reply to the question of the hon. the Minister&#x2014;a Government which is not prepared to consider the adjustment of prices of agricultural products to world prices and to assist the farmers during the transition period, is not worth its salt. A Government which is not prepared to do everything in its power to reduce the production costs of the farmer, is not worth its salt. Most agricultural products can no longer be produced profitably. A Government which is not prepared to establish a drought fodder bank to ensure the survival of our stock in time of drought, is not worth its salt. I do not maintain that the Government should provide all the money in this connection. The farmers must help. The present Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Marketing worked on a scheme for a cooperative, which sprang from the farmers, and he was the head of that organization and I was a member. The Government had to assist us financially, but the amount required to bring the co-operative into being was not even &#x00A3;5,000,000. A Government which is not prepared to do these things is not worthy to remain in office and a Minister who is not prepared to recommend them to his Cabinet, is not worthy of the name of Minister. I am sure that the party on the other side has men in its ranks who can take more positive action to assist agriculture than the present Minister of Agriculture has done. That is why I have pleasure in seconding this motion.</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>A man was walking down the street and he came upon a married couple who were quarrelling and hitting each other. When the man went to the assistance of the woman she immediately turned upon the man who was trying to help her, struck him and said, &#x201C;Why are you interfering in our quarrel?&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, the farming population of the Republic has rejected the United Party because of the mess which it made of agriculture and it will certainly take time and proof before the farmer of South Africa once again has confidence in the United Party. It is for that reason that a man from the north-west or from Middelburg now has to call out like a naughty boy from behind granny&#x2019;s tombstone in order to make himself heard on agricultural matters. Consider for a moment the fact that the hon. member who was the mover of this motion has to speak from Cape Town (Gardens) and that his seconder, a man from Middelburg, has to speak from East London. Just think of that for a moment! Can you imagine the hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F.H. Bekker) having to find an urban constituency in order to make his voice heard about agricultural matters! I cannot think of one Minister of the National Party who has ever lost his seat in an election, but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself, who still represents agriculture, had to accept an urban constituency a short while ago. I wonder how Gardens will take what the hon. member said in connection with the maize problem, for <span class="col_1005-1006" refersTo="page_0517"/>example. It would be necessary to subsidize the surpluses which we have to-day to the extent of 30 cents per bag in order to raise the price to the farmer by 10 cents. The hon. member for Gardens may think perhaps that the people of the Gardens constituency know nothing about maize but he must remember that this subsidy can be made available in three ways, One can subsidize or one can increase the consumer price and if one increases the consumer price, the prices of all the poultry products and the prices of many other products sold in Cape Town will have to be increased immediately. Can one allow the price to rise further? It is interesting to note that the hon. member has moved three motions in this Parliament over the past years and I want to say with due deference to the United Party that the type of policy which they advocate is &#x201C;stimulation of industry&#x201D; to start with. Our people know what encouragement the United Party gave South African industries in the past. In other words, that point will not be popular. One can take their arguments point by point. Mr. Speaker, to restore the confidence of the farmers in the United Party will take far more than advocating this type of speculative policy. The people will have to have confidence that this policy can bring about a change in the position of the farmers. Far more is required to restore the confidence of the people in the United Party than a few meetings or a political auction such as they held during the past session in the north-eastern Free State. I want for a moment to discuss the three motions which the hon. member for Gardens moved, one in 1961, one in 1962 and this one to-day which is the third. If we take those motions, particularly the one which the hon. member moved in 1961, and we read the motion of last year and the motion which is now before the House, I am convinced that when I move my amendment on behalf of this side of the House, the hon. member will support it. Let me take the first motion moved in 1961&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House expresses its disappointment over the lack of proper economic planning on the part of the Government in the interests of South African agriculture.</block>

<p>In discussing the motion the hon. member quoted Dr. Ross, the former Director of Soil Conservation, who said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is clear that unless there is a large-scale improvement in planning practice. South Africa will not be able to provide the food needed at the end of the century.</block>

<p>And then followed the comments of the hon. member for Gardens&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is where the crux of the matter lies. If we are to continue as we are continuing here, we will not be able to produce the necessary food for our people within the foreseeable future.</block>

<p>The hon. member was worried that we would not be in a position to produce sufficient food after a while. What confidence in the farming population and in the soil of South Africa!</p>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>Very well, let us include the Government as well, but the hon. member clearly expressed his displeasure at the farming population&#x2014;a lack of confidence. But what are the facts? That on that same land, on that same soil, with that same farming population and with the same Government the country is producing so much to-day that the hon. member is worried that we shall be unable to find a market for that production. He is worried. That was his motion last year and that is his motion this year. He says that we must find markets in order to dispose of those surpluses. I say again in this connection that I am convinced that the hon. member is correct &#x2014;that with its policy the Government has succeeded under the circumstances in avoiding that danger which the hon. member considered to be a very great danger. We have avoided it. Let hon. members deny that. The facts speak for themselves. I want to move the following amendment now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, in the first place, expresses its thanks and appreciation to the Government for the steps taken&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to promote agricultural production and to make it more efficient and more stable;</li>

<li>(b) to maintain an orderly and stable marketing system;</li>

<li>(c) to render assistance to farmers in distress; and</li>

<li>(d) to protect the independence and freedom of farmers;</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">and, in the second place, affirms its full confidence in the two Ministers of Agriculture in view of the competent manner in which, through efficient planning, they have guided the agricultural industry through its difficult years of adjustment, thus enabling it to contribute its share to the prosperity and progress of the Republic of South Africa.&#x201D;.</block>

<p>When we come back to the motion that the hon. member moved last year we find that the hon. the Minister stated that if it were not for certain words, he would have nothing against the motion because it was a motion dealing with a downward trend in production prices and an upward tendency in production costs and the accumulation of surpluses which had to be combated. But what is the position this year and what has been achieved?</p>

<p>If the hon. member had moved this motion last year, he might have had some sort of case. Let me read out another quotation to <span class="col_1007-1008" refersTo="page_0518"/>him in pursuance of his speech to-day, namely, in connection with the maize problem. After the hon. member had elaborated on the maize problem, he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But fortunately the maize industry is under proper control.</block>

<p>I want to say that we do not know what the surplus is going to be this year. There has not yet been an official estimate. The first estimate will be made at the end of January, the planting estimate, but the first true estimate comes at the end of February and the information is then sifted. At the moment the crop is very promising but no one can make an estimate at this stage. It can be very misleading. But we do accept the fact that there will be a large crop. Let me say, however, that the Maize Board, with the support of the Government and the policy of the Government, has been successful and that by the time the new crop is harvested towards the end of June, South Africa will have disposed of virtually the entire quantity of 62,000,000 bags from last year and the carry over from the previous year. About 5,000,000 bags will remain unsold. In other words, the market has been obtained. There are problems, not only marketing problems, but markets have been obtained. The hon. member made particular mention of dairy products. There was a surplus last year but the hon. member ought to know that the position has greatly improved. Markets have been obtained. This no longer creates a major problem. Last year in his announcement the hon. the Minister stated that certain products created problems, but under present-day circumstances the hon. member must admit that for this period the Government has succeeded in disposing of that production. The hon. member spoke about a violation of the Marketing Act. In the first place I want to ask the hon. member where it is provided in the Marketing Act that the price shall be a &#x201C;cost-plus&#x201D; price. I will be grateful if the hon. member will tell me. But the hon. member also made certain references to what constituted a stable or fixed price in 1948 when the National Party came into power. I do not want to remind you why the United Party was rejected at the time, but the hon. member referred to the meat position and I want to ask whether that system which was in force at the time was not the system of the United Party which the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) called a &#x201C;mess&#x201D;? The hon. member described that old system as a mess.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member complains that we wasted time but the hon. member&#x2019;s seconder himself said that it was a mess. But apart from the meat scheme of the United Party which was a mess, I want to ask the hon. member what the basis was of the prices of all the other products, amongst others maize, and which prices were determined during the period of office of the United Party. The Marketing Act must give stability, and that has been maintained. Let the hon. member read his past speeches. The hon. member complained that the State had not yet taken steps to obtain more officials to control the whole project. Because the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mr. S. M. van Niekerk) was away for so long, I want to refer to the figures. The hon. member for Gardens referred repeatedly to planning and complained about the shortage of officials, but they are doing their best. He referred to the number of officials in Technical Services who numbered 2.308 in 1947. to-day they number 4,473. Let us mention the various sections. In 1947 under the United Party Government &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>That was just after the war.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wentzel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WENTZEL</person>:</from>

<p>It was two years after the war. [Interjection.] There were 93 extension officers then and in 1962 there were 234; there were 718 research workers and now there are 1,324; there were 638 in technical services and now there are 1,077; there were 294 in the general section and now there are 1,322. But we must remember that one of the experts said the other day that a country required at least 500,000 to 600,000 people in managerial positions during its developmental stage, the stage in which we are at present, whereas we only have 10,000 or 12,000. In other words, we have a population of 3,000,000 White people and 12,000,000 Bantu and we must realize that unless we appoint every White man in South Africa as an official there will always not be enough to meet the needs of the country. There is no question about that.</p>

<p>But let us look at something else to which the hon. member also referred last year and in connection with which he again quoted figures this year to show that the total income of agriculture had fallen. I do not want to accuse the hon. member of having given us the wrong figures but he used certain figures for his purposes merely to support his argument. Up to 1956-7 there was a rise in the total agricultural production and then we had a gradual decline over two years, and these were the figures which the hon. member used to prove his point in his previous speech. Why did the hon. member not use the further figures in 1961 as well because they prove just the opposite&#x2014;that there has been a gradual rise? If one takes the 1954-5 figure at 100, it is to-day 115; in other words, we are still experiencing this gradual rise in our total income. But he takes figures to compare with the total income of the country and to show that the <span class="col_1009-1010" refersTo="page_0519"/>position of agriculture has been maintained. There was a very small decrease, less than 3 per cent. There was an increase in the total income but the seconder of the motion said that there was a decrease in the income of the farmer. Was the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) wrong when he spoke about a decrease and when he said that so many farmers had given up farming? I would like an answer from the hon. member. Let me give the hon. member another figure. I stated at the outset that the position had been maintained and that a greater production had been forthcoming from the same land. The hon. member for East London (City) referred to a decrease in our animal population, but is that correct? Far more sheep and cattle have been slaughtered and yet we have been able to maintain their numbers. I want to know how else that can be done other than by proper planning and guidance to the farmers, and the farmers accept it and admit it. We have perhaps discussed farm planning more than farming planning at this stage because there are three aspects of this matter. There is the production aspect, the financial aspect and the marketing aspect. The hon. member must accept the fact that the production aspect has to a large extent been solved by the guidance given to the farmers by the Government. I do not know what is actually meant in the motion by &#x201C;planning&#x201D;, because that planning has resulted in our having a surplus production. Marketing was satisfactory. I do not want to say any more about the number of stock slaughtered, but their numbers were maintained notwithstanding the great increase in the number slaughtered. [Interjection.] The hon. member has been completely at sea. He has blown hot and cold.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize one point in the amendment although my seconder will elaborate further on it. Before I do so I want to refer once again to this motion of the hon. member. He gave two reasons why the Ministers should resign. He spoke about the obvious lack of planning. That is what his motion deals with although he Spoke about everything else but that. I think that I have succeeded in proving that as far as the production potential is concerned, the Government has succeeded in its efforts. This is due not only to the policy of the Ministers of Agriculture; they are merely implementing the policy of the Government. If hon. members have no confidence in it, they should move that the Government should resign. With a few officials at their disposal, these Ministers have succeeded beyond expectation in solving the production difficulties and assisting the farmers. That is why we should like to know why these Ministers should resign. The United Party will have to do more than make election speeches before the farmers believe them. I want to refer to one point, the necessity for protecting the independence and freedom of the farmer. The hon. member for East London (City) referred to this. I accept the fact that he agrees and that that is why he has read those quotations. If land prices rise, production costs increase. Does the hon. member suggest that the State should take steps to control land prices?</p>

<p>Wait a moment. The hon. member must not be so hasty. Was it not the United Party who started with control when a settler received land from the State? [Interjection.] No, it has nothing to do with the Marketing Act. It was the Land Settlement Act which provided that a person who received land from the State could not sell it; it remained State property, and it was the National Party Government which changed it again. I think the hon. member for Gardens agrees with me that we have reached a new era, that a third era has developed in farming. The first era was merely one of self-support and the second era was to supply the local market. The farmers have developed tremendously, beyond all expectation, and no matter what our problems are to-day, it is with a feeling of gratitude and pride that we see how South Africa&#x2019;s farmers have developed; how that development has outstripped our industrial development. In other words, the farmers have outstripped the general level of development and we must be careful during this new phase lest we make a mistake, and I accept the fact that the Government is obliged to give a great deal of support during the transition period. The hon. member had a great deal to say about maize consumption. Does he know that the State subsidize the maize consumption for stock feeding purposes by more than 50 cents per bag? Nevertheless, not much use has been made of this scheme and the hon. member must tell me how much higher the subsidy must be before it will be used. One cannot subsidize an export market because the moment that one does so. one comes into conflict with the World Food Organization and one comes up against tariff walls. I would like to have exchanged a few words with the hon. member about the Euromart but the hon. member did not prove that he understood the implications of it all.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I am grateful for the task which the farmers have performed in South Africa and that I have confidence and faith in the soil of South Africa. The farmer has proved that with the support of the State he will be able to carry and feed a much bigger population. I also have full confidence in the measures which have been taken by the Government and I expect great development in South Africa.</p>

<p>I second the amendment. There is probably no easier task than to come to this House with a few generalities, as the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) has done for the past three years and to say that <span class="col_1011-1012" refersTo="page_0520"/>the farmers are struggling. It is also easy to add that the farmers are in trouble because of a lack of planning. The motion of the hon. member for Gardens this morning is very similar to his motion of 1961, as the mover of this amendment has already said, except that the hon. member went further this morning. He has been more daring to-day. He has moved that the two Ministers responsible for agricultural matters be asked by this House to resign. If these two Ministers were to be so silly, or if this House, by some misfortune or other, were to adopt this resolution, I wonder how far it would satisfy the hon. member for Gardens? Of course, nobody gives it a thought, but I want to put this to the hon. member: Let us imagine that the two Ministers of Agriculture handed in their resignations to the hon. the Prime Minister and that the hon. the Prime Minister appointed two other capable men on this side of the House as Ministers of Agriculture; would that hon. member not move a motion next year in the same terms as the motions which he has moved for the past three years, and would he not use the same arguments? No, the hon. member for Gardens has nothing against these two hon. Ministers. He could just as well have moved that this House requests the Minister of Economic Affairs or the Minister of Bantu Administration or the Minister of Information to resign.</p>

<p>They want to see a change of government and of policy. The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), who seconded this motion, offered a solution to certain agricultural problems at a time when he was still closely concerned with agriculture. He alleged at the time&#x2014;I refer to his much-resented Queenstown speech two years ago when he stated that he feared that he would no longer be able to sell South Africa&#x2019;s wool because he was afraid that his honour as a person would be attacked if he had to take the Chair at the meetings of the International Wool Secretariat. Then he spoke about marketing problems which had apparently placed South Africa in such a position that she could no longer do any business and his solution was that &#x201C;the Government must change its policy&#x201D;.</p>

If it is not our policy that has to be changed, I challenge any hon. member on the other side to say what they want. No, things are going well with agriculture in this country and in fact the hon. member for Gardens said so. He said that things were going well in certain sections and not so well in others.</p>

<p>It appears to me that the hon. member for Gardens is no longer so sure that things are not going well with the farmers, because he now wants us to assume the responsibility for that allegation. I say that it is not only their allegation that things are not going well with the farmers which causes them to move this motion. They are in favour of a change of policy in South Africa and this motion is merely a cog in the machinery which they want to set in motion.</p>

<p>I want to come immediately to the amendment that we have moved. We say that this House expresses its gratitude and appreciation to the Government for the steps which have been taken in the first place to promote agricultural production and to make it more efficient and more stable. We have had two divergent allegations here this morning, which to my mind were very peculiar, in connection with our production. The hon. member for East London (City) seconded the motion of the hon. member for Gardens and wanted to know what was wrong in South Africa; what had happened here to make our production lag behind so much. Listening to the hon. member for East London (City), one would imagine that one was again living in the years 1944-5 when we had food rationing. One would imagine that there was a great shortage of food in the country because according to him our production has not increased at all. But the hon. member for Gardens was concerned about the large surpluses and he even went so far as to say that the farmers&#x2019; costs were rising very steeply because they had to buy so many bags to take the large crop of maize and they had to pay large sums for threshing that large crop of maize. I did not expect that from the hon. member for Gardens, but if that should be so, then it is no wonder that he can no longer plead the cause of the farmers from Prieska but has to do so from Gardens.</p>

<p>What is the position with regard to our production? We say that we have made production more efficient and more stable. In this connection I want to say something about research in agriculture which has resulted in our production being so stable. I listened attentively to the hon. member for Gardens who objected to the fact that there were insufficient extension officers and that not enough research was being done. I think it is necessary to dwell on this point for some time. The figures which the hon. member for Christiana gave him in this connection were quite adequate but I want <span class="col_1013-1014" refersTo="page_0521"/>to put this to the hon. member: If we look at our research stations, at our agricultural colleges, at our institutes, even technological institutes, and if we look at our veterinary laboratory, we cannot help feeling proud of the fact that we have built up a research service in South Africa equal to the best in the world.</p>

<p>Is that the work of this Government?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#vosloo">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>Much of it is the work of this Government. The hon. member must not provoke me. He makes me think of Uilspie&#x00EB;l who saw people sleeping on feather beds so he also got hold of a feather and slept on it and the next day he said that he wondered how people could endure sleeping on so many feathers because he had slept on only one and his body was very sore. When the hon. member for Christiana spoke just now about the achievements of this Government, that hon. member said: &#x201C;But we did pass the Marketing Act&#x201D;; he does have one feather on which to sleep! Mr. Speaker, our research service to my mind is one of our finest achievements in South Africa. I wonder whether the difficulty of the hon. member for Gardens is not that to which his good friend&#x2014;I take it that Mr. Jannie van Wyk is a good friend of his&#x2014;referred yesterday afternoon when he opened the Robertson Show and said [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every farmer in the Winter Rainfall Area must ask himself whether he has made full use of the information which he receives from the excellent research institutions in his immediate vicinity, Mr. J. F. van Wyk said here yesterday. Mr. van Wyk, Vice-Chairman of the South African Agricultural Union and Chairman of the Cape Agricultural Union, officially opened the Robertson, Montagu and Bonnievale Show. &#x201C;Farmers must not make the mistake of concentrating solely on internal marketing possibilities but they must also find foreign markets as is already the case in regard to certain of our other products.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The point that I want to make is this: If hon. members complain that we are not receiving the necessary information, that we do not have the necessary research and training, they are doing an injustice to these organizations throughout South Africa. I think these organizations constitute one of South Africa&#x2019;s greatest achievements; they are organizations from which other countries with older civilizations and with far larger populations than South Africa draw their knowledge and in connection with which they speak in laudatory terms of the achievements of South Africa. But I want to refer to something else in regard to which the hon. member for Gardens did not do the right thing. Mr. Speaker, I am not dealing so harshly with the hon. member for Gardens that he has to get protection from the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk). The hon. member for Gardens tried to prove that this side of the House was also objecting to the fact that we do not have the necessary technicians in the Department of Agriculture, and he also tried to suggest that the hon. member for Soutpansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha) had made certain accusations against the Minister. We asked him what the Minister&#x2019;s reply was and he said that the Minister merely replied that it was the fault of the United Party Government because they had closed the agricultural colleges during the war years. For his information I now want to quote the actual reply of the hon. the Minister to the hon. member for Soutpansberg (Hansard, Vol. 4, col. 5596)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The first speaker on this side of the House, the hon. member for Soutspansberg (Mr. S. P. Botha), immediately began by putting his finger on the most essential matter, namely, the staff position, and many other hon. members also did so. They pointed to what were perhaps weaknesses which exist or existed and which have to be remedied. Now I think I must just tell the hon. member what has been done and how much progress we have made, before replying to the other minor matters.</block>

<block name="quote">I want to begin by saying that in 1960 I appointed a committee, under the chairmanship of Professor Rautenbach of the Pretoria University, to investigate all matters affecting the organization and functioning of the technical services of my Department and to make recommendations in regard to increasing the efficiency of those services. This committee reported to me at the end of last year, and certain steps have already been taken to implement their most important recommendations&#x2026;.</block>

<block name="quote">One of their recommendations was the strengthening of the overall technical control and reorganization of the national services&#x2026; As the result of the committee&#x2019;s recommendations the overall control of the technical services, which was exercised by a Director and two Assistant Directors, and the co-ordination of Research Services and Field Services which in the technical sphere was effected by the heads of national divisions, have been reviewed and a division has now been made in the Head Office of the Department.</block>

<p>He went on to explain (col. 5598)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principle of higher remuneration for scientists and technologists in control posts has also been accepted by the Government for the Public Service and State-supported bodies.</block>

<p>But hon. members are trying to create the impression now that these were the only increases in the salaries of technicians during the period of office of the National Party Government. This is the increase which the hon. the Minister announced last year but I want my hon. friends to investigate how many increases there <span class="col_1015-1016" refersTo="page_0522"/>have been since 1948 which have attracted large numbers of technicians to agricultural research, as the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) has already shown. No, they will no longer impress the farmers of South Africa with this type of sophistry, if I may call it that&#x2014;to suggest here that nothing has been done and that the only reply which they have been given has been to put the blame for this lack of technicians onto the United Party Government. The United Party makes me think of a game which I believe the hon. member for Vredefort also played in his childhood days, when we sang this little song</p>

<block name="quote">Al jare en jare in die bos,</block>

<block name="quote">My ouma kook lekker kos,</block>

<block name="quote">Wat wil jy h&#x00EA;&#x2014;perske-konfyt of tamatlekonfyt?</block>

<p>And if you said &#x201C;perske-konfyt&#x201D; you had to stand behind Jan and if you said &#x201C;tamatlekonfyt&#x201D; you had to stand behind Piet. The United Party is trying that sort of game in vain with the farmer of South Africa. They ate trying in vain to make a political football of him. The farmer of South Africa will not allow himself to be impressed by these allegations.</p>

<p>I want to discuss soil conservation and research and this brings me in the first place to the question of soil conservation which the hon. member did not mention this morning as he usually does. He has already said that one can drive through this country for miles without seeing a single contour bank, and he wanted to know what the Government was doing in connection with soil conservation. I do not want to give figures to the Opposition to show what the Government has already done to stabilize our production. I just want to mention facts to them, facts which we all know. When we talk about water conservation and the lack of water in our irrigation dams, these hon. members join us in saying that as a result of soil conservation we no longer have a flow in our river beds and that our dams remain empty. This is said each year by the hon. member for Albany (Mr. Bowker) who is not present here this morning. They are correct there. I have previously quoted here what was said three or four years ago by Mr. Langenecker when he said that as the result of soil conservation, in 10 years&#x2019; time, we would find that in most of our river beds there would no longer be a flow which we would be able to use for irrigation purposes. Mr. Speaker, in the Eastern Cape we have had a record rainfall over the past month, a rainfall such as we had not had since the 19th century. The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), who lives in the catchment area of the Fish River Dams, will also be able to tell you how strong the flow in that river bed was, so much so that the dams in the Fish River valley were 15 per cent full the day before yesterday. We need no longer test the effectiveness of soil conservation by the number of contour banks which the hon. member for Gardens sees in travelling through the country; we can see what the effect of it is by looking at the amount of valuable water which still flows down our river beds and the amount of water we are retaining on our soil.</p>

<p>Then hon. members of the Opposition say that there is a lack of planning; they say that there are insufficient technical officers, but I want to ask every member who has any knowledge of agriculture just to look at what is taking place in his own area. I believe that the experience of every member over there will be what mine has been, and that is this: One notices that a certain farmer has his farm planned; he carries out that planning and he draws his maximum soil conservation subsidy; he erects the maximum number of camp fences as far as his planning permits. As soon as he begins to see the advantages of that planning there is no end to his own planning; he himself then builds additional dams; he erects his own inside camps; a camp which was first planned as one camp is again divided into two or three camps and where provision was first made for only one drinking place in that camp, he now has two or three or four drinking places. Has that not also been the experience of those hon. members who now come and tell us that there is a lack of planning? Have they not also noticed these things in their own areas? I want to ask the hon. member for East London (City) how much water has flowed down the Brak River in recent times? Their own experiences and their own observations refute every argument advanced by them in connection with the lack of planning&#x2014;arguments which they advance here in order to make some political capital.</p>

<p>I want to say something else about production. The hon. member for Gardens who is so sorry this morning because the maize producers have to buy so many bags and have to pay so much in threshing charges, was afraid in 1961, when he quoted Dr. Ross here, that towards the end of this century we would no longer be able to feed the people of South Africa. I want to put this to him and to the hon. member for East London (City)&#x2014;both of them know how many irrigation dams have been built during the period of office of the National Party Government&#x2014;and now the hon, member for East London (City) must not go and sit on his one and only feather and tell me what they did in connection with the building of dams. I give them credit for every dam that they built but how many dams have been built by the National Party Government? He need only go to his own constituency and look at the Beervlei Dam which has been completed, at the Mentz Lake wall which has been raised and at the Commando Drift Dam which has been completed. I want to ask hon. members whether they were joking when they said last year that there would be surplus production when all the various schemes came into operation. I refer them to the Pongola Scheme and to the Kougat Scheme in my constituency; I refer them to the Orange River project which will benefit the largest part of South Africa. Does this reveal planning or <span class="col_1017-1018" refersTo="page_0523"/>does it reveal a lack of planning? Will our production be stimulated by it and will our production be stabilized by it, or are we just wasting our time on trivialities, such as the cost of bags for a large harvest? No, as far as this Government is concerned and as far as these two Ministers are concerned, to my mind they have a fine record as far as planning, research, information services and training are concerned. The fact that the farmer of South Africa is anxious to make use of these things is proved by the fact that our agricultural colleges are full and that our agricultural schools are being used to the full extent. These achievements of the National Party Government are achievements which they can never reason away, no matter how much they try, and they will not win a single vote by doing so, no matter how much they harp on the subject.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the second part of our amendment, namely, to maintain an orderly and stable marketing system.</p>

<p>When business was suspended before lunch, I had already shown why the House ought to express its appreciation to the Government for the steps which have been taken to promote agricultural production and to make it more efficient and more stable, and I was starting to show how this Government was maintaining and had maintained an orderly and stable marketing system. The two products which the hon. member for Gardens brought to the attention of the House this morning were the two products of which we have a surplus at the moment, the marketing of which is giving us some trouble, namely maize and dairy products. I want frankly to admit here that I know very little about the cultivation of maize, as little as the hon. member for Gardens and as little as the hon. member for East London (City), but as the House has already listened this morning to two members who know nothing about the cultivation of maize, I think that it would be very unfair for a third member also to discuss a product about which he knows little, although I do want to say a few things in this connection. Hon. members gave the impression that the Government could solve the problem of the maize farmer in the first instance by only considering production costs and by adding a reasonable entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage and a profit margin, and making that the price. If this was done, the whole problem would be solved. The two hon. members who have spoken thus far have not yet told us what they will do with a maize surplus, with the exception of the hon. member for East London (City) who explained that he would conclude new trade agreements with other countries. Hon. members are aware of the fact that the export market is also a limited market but where you have to deal with an export market, even though it may absorb everything which we produce in excess of our local consumption, one still has to contend with a world market price, and one cannot sell one&#x2019;s products at a price in excess of that world market price. The policy of this Government was and is to comply with the primary requirement of the Marketing Act, namely, orderly marketing; in the first instance to comply with domestic requirements at a reasonable price, a price at which the consumer can buy, and to export the surplus at the best price obtainable and in this way to give the producer such a price that he will be able to continue to produce in the future.</p>

<p>I just want to say in connection with the production of dairy products, particularly butter which has also been referred to, that hon. members opposite are very anxious to have an increased local consumption, but if we follow the reasoning of both hon. members who spoke this morning and if prices have to be determined only on the basis of production costs plus a reasonable entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage and, in their view, there is to be no reduction in price, this must necessarily bring about an increase in the local market price. Hon. members cannot get away from that; it is inexorable economic law. I want to ask them how the local consumption of maize would be stimulated if the price to the local consumer was increased? We have the case of butter. Last year and this year too hon. members complained when the price of butter was reduced last year. They hold the view that local consumption must be stimulated. Last year the price of butter was reduced by 5 cents per lb. of which the producer contributed 2&#x00BD; cents per lb. and the Government 2&#x00BD; cents per lb. by way of subsidy. They complained vociferously about this. In their view it was simply no longer profitable to produce butter; according to them the dairy farmers were bankrupt. But what was the result of the price reduction? It resulted in the fact that during the first year after the price reduction, butter was brought within the reach of the less privileged section of the people and its consumption increased by 6,000,000 lbs. If one wishes to increase the local consumption of maize which is about 30,000,000 bags per year, as the hon. member for Gardens knows, or ought to know, the worst way of going about it is to increase the local price. [Interjections.] No. Now hon. members say that that is what they said, but if they had said so, on what do they base their reasoning that a price determination should only be made on the basis of production costs plus an entrepreneur&#x2019;s wage? One cannot do that then when one has to deal with a world market which has to absorb nearly half of one&#x2019;s production. The hon. member shakes his head but that is something that he must consider. It is an economic law and he cannot get past it. The same thing holds good for butter and other dairy products. One cannot get away from the fact that in South Africa, where we have products which we cannot consume locally and have therefore to export large quantities of <span class="col_1019-1020" refersTo="page_0524"/>those products, we have always to bear the world market and the foreign market in mind. It is very easy for the hon. member for East London (City) to tell us that we should appoint trade attach&#x00E9;s and that we should listen to people who have been overseas. If the hon. member for East London (City) could have left a dustline on the sea during the period that he was chairman of the Wool Board, that dustline would still have been there as a result of all his journeys overseas to market wool. What else did the hon. member achieve but to tell us that he did not see his way clear to finding better markets unless we changed our policy? That was all that the hon. member Would report in that connection. No, when it is necessary to make price adjustments so that it is still profitable for the producer to produce but his product must be brought within the reach of the local consumer, this Government has always had the courage in most cases to lower prices, a reduction in price which the producer has always been able to stand.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Drakensberg will probably give us more information this afternoon. Perhaps she will give us more information which will help us to solve this problem of surplus production. There are three categories into which we can divide our products. The one category deals with products which are produced Tor the export market only. It does not seem as though hon. members opposite have any objection to foreign prices, prices which are completely beyond our control. Those products are produced specifically for export. I have in mind such products as wool, mohair and also a large portion of our citrus production. There are products which are produced for both the local and foreign markets, for example, deciduous fruits and citrus fruits which can also be placed in this category. Their objection does not appear to lie there either. Their great difficulty&#x2014;and it was in this connection that hon. members tried to make out a case this morning&#x2014;involves these products which are produced specifically for local consumption, and when our domestic requirements have been met, the surplus has to be disposed of in some way or other in order to maintain a stable price locally for the farmer. It is particularly for those products that the Marketing Act makes provision; it is those products for which a local market must in the first instance be obtained, The price of that product must be adjusted so that it is within reach of the local consumer because if this is not done, one will merely succeed in cutting down the consumption of these products. This Government has ensured that where there is a surplus and it must be exported, it is exported at the best possible world price, even though it means that in a case like that of butter, to which I referred just now, in one year we lost R3,000,000 on the butter which we exported because we were saddled with an increased production and with a surplus of 19,000,000 lbs. of butter. Then hon. members complain when in such cases the producer is asked to take 2&#x00BD; cents per lb. less.</p>

<p>In connection with wool I was surprised that hon. members did not blame the Government for the drop of 10,000,000 lbs. in our wool production during the first six months of the past wool season. Because of the drought&#x2014;I want to quote from the monthly report of the South African Wool Commission&#x2014;for the first six months, namely from 1 July to 31 December, we produced 10,000,000 lbs. less wool, namely 155,000,000 lbs. as against 165,000,000 lbs. in the previous year, so much so that three auctions had to be cancelled in those six months because less wool was available. We were, however, in this fortunate position that we experienced a price increase during that period of 6.9 per cent or 2.19c per lb. as against the corresponding six months of the previous year. This resulted in the fact that the value of the wool for those six months amounted to R20,370 more than the amount for the previous year. They do not appear to have any objection to that nor do they want to ask the Ministers to resign because of it.</p>

<p>Take the case of mohair. This Government has since placed mohair on a stable basis; it has established a Mohair Advisory Board which also makes its contribution and is also active in seeking a stable market abroad to assist the mohair producer to obtain a more stable price for his product. Mr. Speaker, orderly marketing is the aim of this Government, orderly marketing under conditions with which the United Party never had to contend during its period of office because it was saddled with shortages. It was the task of this Government to make use of the Marketing Act to market the surpluses. I think that the Government is worthy of all praise&#x2014;and the farmers admit it&#x2014;for the way in which it has treated the farmers in time of surpluses.</p>

<p>I come now to the third reason why we on this side of the House want to express our appreciation to the Government and that is because it has given assistance to farmers in distress. If one listens to hon. members opposite, one is brought to believe&#x2014;and that is also the impression that they try to create&#x2014; that this Government has not the slightest sympathy with the farmers. [Interjections.] Yes, the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) even went so far as to say that this Government would like to see the farmers bankrupt. I do not know for what reason. I wonder whether in her case the wish is not father to the thought? They would like to see bankruptcy. They would like to see the farmers in trouble because that fact may perhaps give them some party political advantage, political advantage to a party which has been rejected by the farmers in the past and will be rejected by them in the future. I do not think that I can give a better resum&#x00E9; of the assistance given to farmers than that given by <span class="col_1021-1022" refersTo="page_0525"/>Volkskas in one of its recent bulletins. These are all official figures. It will take me longer to mention them myself than to quote them as they appear in this bulletin. They say. [Translation.]</p>

<block name="quote">During the past 12 years nearly 80,000 loans have been granted to farmers directly by the State for the purpose of assisting them to overcome their financial difficulties. All these loans together amount to R38,861,000. This does not include loans made by the Land Bank or under the Land Settlement Act. The assistance schemes which are administered by the State Advances Recoveries Office include loans for crop cultivation, assistance in regard to stock in droughtstricken areas, direct financial assistance where the farmer has lost his income because of circumstances beyond his control and loans for the repair of damage caused by natural hazards such as floods. In the past four years an amount of nearly R11,000,000 has been loaned to farmers in respect of these four groups. Under certain circumstances loans are also granted by the State. In the past three years for example under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act, an amount of R19,000,000 has been advanced to farmers to relieve them of pressing debts and to strengthen farming operations. The effect of this is that debts have been consolidated and have been made payable over a long period. Since 1961 loans to an amount of R2,600,000 have also been transfered to State Advances under the Soil Conservation Act in respect of money advanced to farmers for conservation works which have already been started and a further R170,000 for drilling and irrigation loans. Such loans are made available by the departments concerned and thereafter administered by State Advances.</block>

<p>If we analyse all these figures in connection with loans to farmers who have not had the necessary capital themselves or who have experienced a lack of credit facilities during the past 14 years of National Government, it is an achievement which is head and shoulders above that of any other Government in South Africa. It is a record which the National Party is not ashamed of; it is a record of which its Ministers responsible for Agriculture and Finance can be proud. It is also for that reason that this House expressed its appreciation to the Government.</p>

<p>In the last point of our amendment we express appreciation for the independence and the freedom of the farmer which is being protected by this Government. We listened to interesting speeches this morning from the other side. The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) quoted from a speech&#x2014; I do not know from whose speech&#x2014;to the effect that in other countries they ensure that production costs do not rise too high and that land prices are controlled. I do not think that that is the policy of his Party but I just want to say, Mr. Speaker, that there is no other factor which has a greater effect upon one&#x2019;s production costs than the amount of capital which one has invested. To a certain extent one has control over one&#x2019;s other production costs. One can perhaps make better use of one&#x2019;s labour; one can perhaps produce with less labour. One can perhaps use less machinery but there is one thing over which one has no control after one has invested one&#x2019;s capital, and that is the interest on that capital. If I understand those hon. members correctly and if their attitude is the correct one&#x2014;they are always harping on the question of production costs and saying that it is the task of this Government to control production costs&#x2014; then this Government should have a say over land prices. I want to ask that hon. member whether he is prepared to come to Somerset-East and tell the Swaershoek farmers&#x2014;he knows them all very well; he sold his land there and sought pastures new&#x2014;that they may not pay more than a certain amount for their land. I wonder what will happen if he tells Mr. T. J. Jordaan, the holder of the Holden trophy as the farmer in that part of the world who has done most for agriculture in South Africa: &#x201C;Look here, you have enough land and you may not pay more than a certain amount for land&#x201D;, when those farmers recently still paid up to R104 per morgen for grazing land? I wonder what will happen if they tell the farmers what to produce, if they tell the farmers: &#x201C;You cannot plant more maize than you planted before because there is a surplus, or &#x201C;You cannot produce more dairy products&#x201D;? No. Mr. Speaker, this Government gives the farmers freedom to produce what they consider will enable them to meet their obligations.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to conclude. Our amendment states that we affirm our full confidence in our two Ministers of Agriculture in view of the competent manner in which, through efficient planning, they have guided the agricultural industry through its difficult years of adjustment. I want to affirm that not only in this House but in the country as well the farmers have confidence in the National Government and in the Ministers under whose guidance and under whose care agriculture has been placed.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I wonder why the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) seconds this amendment. Is the reason perhaps that he is afraid that one of the Ministers will resign and that he wants to improve his chances to fill that post if one of them resigns? If it should happen that the hon. member for Somerset East takes one of their places, I will be even more sorry than I am to-day for the farmers and their interests. What has the hon. member for Somerset East told us? He has told us that the National Party has a proud record; look at our agricultural schools and colleges and you will find that they are filled to capacity! Full use is being made of them! But here I have before me a speech by Dr. Henning, the Director of Technical Services of the Department of Agricultural Technical <span class="col_1023-1024" refersTo="page_0526"/>Services. When it comes to agricultural training, the hon. member for Somerset East must forgive me if I take the word of Dr. Henning rather than his. What does he say? He spoke during a diploma ceremony at the Potchefstroom Agricultural College on 27 October 1961 and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">According to this calculation, approximately 600 young farmers who have received agricultural education in one or other of the aforementioned subjects enter the farming industry every year. Only 600 out of the 3,000 who enter the agricultural industry every year have enjoyed formal agricultural education at a college or at an agricultural high school.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_technical_services">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL SERVICES</person>:</from>

<p>Does all that point to a lack of training facilities?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>I also want to tell the hon. the Minister that when it comes to this matter I prefer to accept the word of Dr. Henning. According to Dr. Henning, this is definitely to-day one of the greatest weaknesses in our agricultural structure. He also says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is also a pity that the existing facilities, which are all but sufficient for the training of our future farmers, are not fully utilized.</block>

<p>But then the hon. member for Somerset East says that they are filled to capacity. Then he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would appear that the terribly unfavourable climatic conditions prevailing during the past few years have resulted in fewer enrolments in our colleges, so that the available space at all the agricultural colleges could not be fully utilized.</block>

<p>That is what Dr. Henning says. But it is not only the climatic conditions; it is the agricultural policy of this Government which makes it impossible for the prospective farmer to enter the industry. Even though a farmer has sons whom he would like to have agricultural training, he does not have the courage to send those sons to the colleges, because what will their future be when they leave those colleges and enter the agricultural industry? The hon. member for Somerset East says we must see how many dams the farmers have already built and how much soil conservation they have applied. The hon. member is very satisfied with what has already been done, but let us listen to a member of the Soil Conservation Board&#x2014;and not to the hon. member for Somerset East. Mr. de Villiers Loubser addressed a soil conservation conference in the South-Western Districts, and according to the <i>Burger</i> of 29 October 1962 he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Rhodesia there are only 80 farmers to every extension officer. The 25,000 farmers in the South-Western Districts have only 89 soil conservation committees. In the past 15 years only 28 per cent of the farms has been planned. At this tempo it will take another 50 years before the 18,000 farmers have plans.</block>

<p>Then the hon. member for Somerset East says we must go and see what has been done in the Karoo and we will find that a tremendous amount of work has been done. Of course much work has been done, Sir. Our argument is not that nothing was done in the past, but that this Government is not prepared to face the facts of the matter in the way this member of the Soil Conservation Board was prepared to face them, namely that unless we have more extension officers we will not be in a position properly to implement our soil conservation plans in South Africa.</p>

<p>Apart from the splendid record to which he referred, the hon. member for Somerset East said in conclusion that he was surprised that we had said nothing about wool and mohair. But surely he knows, and the Minister also knows, that we have no say over the prices obtained for these products. He knows that they are sold in the open market. The fact that the farmer now receives good prices for his wool and mohair, says the hon. member for Somerset East, is due to the Government! He pretends that this Government is responsible for it. But then the hon. member must also shoulder the responsibility for the fall in the price a few years ago. But that he does not do.</p>

<p>What is still more serious is the attack made by the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) on the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) and the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman). He says it shows how little confidence the farmers have in the United Party that those two hon. members for Gardens and East London (City) should have to plead their case here. [Interjections.] Yes, he can include me also. But, Sir, it is not that side of the House which should be ashamed. They are the people who represent the rural constituencies in this House, and what do they do here? They are just here to praise the hon. the Ministers for what they are doing whilst they know that the farmers outside are bitterly dissatisfied. If there is a party which should be ashamed of itself it is the party opposite. They should be ashamed because they were not prepared to make constructive suggestions as to how these two Ministers could remedy the position. The hon. member for Christiana says the farmers will never have confidence in the United Party, and then he says again that it will take a long time for them to have confidence. I admit that it usually takes a long time for a man to have confidence in somebody else. But I do know that it takes a very short time to lose confidence, and that is what is taking place with this Government. The farmers of South Africa will increasingly have to look even to the urban representatives on this side of the House to protect their interests. Let me assure <span class="col_1025-1026" refersTo="page_0527"/>hon. members that we will not hesitate to do so, because we do not see South Africa in various facets, but as a whole. If a certain sector of our economy find things difficult it is the bounden duty of the Opposition to state the case of those people. The farmers of South Africa have their committees and their congresses; they get together and discuss various matters. And if the Government is not prepared to give attention to it, do they want us to sit here quietly and say that the farmers of the country are satisfied? Is that what they expect of us? Do they expect us as an Opposition to do nothing when we see that they are harming the agriculture of South Africa?</p>

<p>What do we find to-day? We find that even the <i>Landbou-weekblad</i> and certain other bodies interested in agriculture have to bring certain matters to the notice of the Government. Here I have an extract from the <i>Landbou-weekblad</i> published a year or so ago. This is an article by &#x201C;Manie&#x201D;&#x2014;he is almost like &#x201C;Dawie&#x201D; in the <i>Burger.</i> It is so nice to write under a pseudonym so that one can get in a dig here and there. &#x201C;Manie&#x201D; says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If one wants to make a donkey run it is not much use putting a hot potato under its tail if the potato immediately drops out again. He soon forgets about it and will not run far. One must ensure that the potato stays there so that he will continue to suffer pain.</block>

<p>He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If we have well-founded grievances and complaints we must not cease bringing them to the notice of the authorities. We must keep the potato there and, if possible, see that it is a little hotter every time.</block>

<p>That is the advice we get. That is the advice the farmer of South Africa gets, to keep that hot potato there. Do hon. members opposite want to tell us that we should not do our duty in bringing to the notice of the Government the grievances of the people outside? No, I repeat that the Opposition would have failed in its duty if it had not brought the grievances of the farmers to the notice of the Government.</p>

<p>Now what are the grievances of the farmers? What are the difficulties with which they are faced? I want to say at once that although there are various types of farmers&#x2014;grain farmers, maize farmers, potato farmers, dairy farmers, etc.&#x2014;I think that there is some resemblance between all of them. We are all using labour to keep the various branches of the industry going. We are all mechanizing; we are all trying to farm more efficiently; we are all faced with the problem of rising costs of production and falling prices. When we take part in this debate to-day we do not talk on behalf of any specific farmer. If one particularly refers to one class of farmer, that is only to illustrate one&#x2019;s case. We know that a matter which affects every farmer is the problem of the rising costs of production and the falling produce prices. What I find interesting, Sir, is that none of the hon. members opposite even referred in their speeches to the rising costs of production, nor in their amendment. How can the Government stabilize the agricultural industry unless it devotes attention to the rising costs of production? I admit that production costs may vary from farm to farm and from area to area, but there are some items in the cost of production over which this Government in fact has control and to which they ought to devote attention.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel), who is not here now, is a prominent farmer in the Free State, and what did he say about the position of the farmers in the Free State? According to the <i>Oosterlig</i> of 30 August 1962, he addressed the Free State Agricultural Union and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. G. J. Knobel, M.P. for Bethlehem, said that he thought that the picture which would be revealed would be found to be shocking. The State could not expect the farmers to be supermen. According to the investigation made by the speaker, it was found that of a co-operative with 1,800 members, 75 per cent produced less than 500 bags of maize and 87 per cent less than 500 bags of wheat. Of the 3,000 members of another co-operative 65 per cent produced less than 500 bags of maize and 81 per cent less than 500 bags of wheat. A survey made over the whole country will show that 67 per cent of the farmers produced less than 500 bags of maize.</block>

<p>Terribly small farmers! And unless steps are taken to assist these people to reduce their production costs I cannot see how there can be any future for them. And the hon. the Minister and hon. members opposite should not tell us now that they are not responsible if these people produce, as the Minister did last year in the Free State when he said: If our farmers are under the impression that they can just continue producing more of a product than can be consumed internally whilst maintaining the price in the country, they are making a mistake.</p>

<block name="quote">The maize industry in South Africa: Danger signals for the future.</block>

<p>That is the position in which these people find themselves to-day. They were encouraged to produce and they did so, but to-day when they have these tremendous surpluses the Government has no policy at all. We are gratified to learn from the hon. member for Christiana that the Mealie Board had succeeded in having only 5,000,000 bags over to be carried over to the next season. But what about the next season? The hon. member expects the maize crop not to remain at 60,000,000 bags, but says that there is a strong possibility that it may be 70,000,000 bags or more. What then? Must we then follow the policy suggested by the hon. member for Ladybrand, the chairman of the Mealie Board, in a letter in reply to the S.A. Agricultural Union in connection with the policy of the Mealie Board&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The decrease in the basic producers&#x2019; price must be a clear indication to producers that the price structure of the past cannot be maintained if production increases as fast as it did recently.</block>

<p>In other words, the maize farmers can expect in the following season that if there is a crop of 70,000,000 bags there will be a strong possibility that their prices will be still further decreased. The hon. member for Ladybrand says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the export surplus increases further and/or the export prices fall, further adaptations in this regard will have to be considered by the board.</block>

<p>In other words, the future of the maize farmer in South Africa, with his tremendous efficiency and his tremendous production potential does not become clearer but increasingly darker under this Government. If that is the position. Sir, I am not surprised that the Prime Minister had to intervene in the agricultural debate at the National Party Congress last year in Bloemfontein. Because there one of the Nationalists himself, Mr. Jurg Human, of Warden said, according to the <i>Burger</i> 13 September last year, that at Warden they had fought the Ministers of Agriculture with bare fists.</p>

<p>I am sure the farmers did not win. But hon. members opposite know what the position is. They allege that they are protecting the independence of the farmers in South Africa and therefore they want to express confidence in these two Ministers. But by what yardstick does one measure the independence of the farmers? Does one measure it perhaps by what they owe to the Land Bank, to the numbers of mortgages held there? Whilst we know that the number of farmers in South Africa is becoming increasingly smaller, the mortgages are increasing. If there is a party which has enslaved the farmer of South</p>

<p>Africa to the Land Bank and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board, it is this Government as the result of the agricultural policy they followed. If the farmers of South Africa had been given the chance to make a decent living and if they could have obtained a decent price for their products, and if they had been assisted to reduce their costs of production, we would not have had this enormous amount of debt with the Land Bank and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board to-day.

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd stated that it was difficult, but that the Government would have to take more serious steps to prevent the uneconomic sub-division of land.

<p>Is it the Opposition which says that? It is the Minister of Agricultural Economics and the Prime Minister who made this new statement of policy. The Minister of Agricultural Economics repeatedly says that there should be a new approach in respect of the agricultural industry and that steps must be taken to ensure that the farmers will no longer be able to do what they want, and then hon. members opposite still have the temerity to suggest that we should have confidence in this Government because they want to protect the independence of the farmers of South Africa!

I say that to the hon. member for Mossel Bay (Dr. van Nierop) who is now glaring at me.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>Is it not the duty of the Ministers of Agriculture to satisfy the majority of farmers in South Africa? My greatest criticism of the Minister is that he always tries to run away from the matter, that he always tries <span class="col_1031-1032" refersTo="page_0530"/>to find an excuse, as for example when he says that farmers should now farm more efficiently. What is the use of telling people that? Which farmer in South Africa does not try to farm as efficiently as possible? Would we have had this phenomenal expansion in production of agricultural products if our farmers were not efficient? Would we have had this tremendous increase in the sales of farm machinery if our farmers were not efficient? But now he pretends that he is telling the farmers a very wise thing when he says that they must be more efficient, something every farmer knows already. Sir, let me now quote what Mr. Andr&#x00E9; du Toit said, because that is the worst of all. Mr. du Toit opened the congress of the winter rainfall area at Stellenbosch last year. He is the chairman of the K.W.V. and this is what he said under the headline &#x201C;The Future of the Farmer is Not Rosy&#x201D;, He was not referring to the present only, but to the future and he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although South Africa is now experiencing financial prosperity, the farmer has entered a period of surpluses. In the agricultural sphere matters are not so rosy.</block>

<p>I hope that will satisfy hon. members now. They ask what we want to achieve now. There is at least one thing we are trying to achieve, and that is to bring hon. members opposite under the impression that things are not going well with the farmers of South Africa. And as long as they think that things are going well with the farmers, I say that they are committing a great wrong against the farmers.

And as long as we do not have the fundamental approach of realizing that things are not going well, we will not get down to plans to put agriculture in South Africa on a sound basis.</p>

<p>I have here <i>Organised Agriculture</i> of April 1962, in which Mr. Andr&#x00E9; du Toit, chairman of the K.W.V., also said that it was unfortunate that the economic aspect of agriculture did not receive the same attention that the technical aspects received in recent years. He says further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Agricultural leaders right throughout the country have expressed serious concern in regard to the present tendency to solve the problem of surpluses by price manipulation, thereby bring to a fall and eliminating hundreds of the smaller farmers and causing financial instability to the big farmers.</block>

<p>This report is quite correct because it is not only the small farmer who is in trouble. Even the so-called independent farmer comes up every day against the wall of rising production costs and falling prices.</p>

<p>The hon. member for De Aar-Colesberg may boast of his area, just as I may boast of the area where I live. But the hon. member can go around in his area, and what will he find? That 15. 20 or 30 years ago people could make a living on 2.000 and 3,000 and 4.000 morgen, but to-day we find that that land is all owned by one man. In other words he needed a larger unit. Why? Because in the first place the small farmer had to get rid of his land because he could not make a living, and the man who could in any way afford it had to purchase it and add it to his land in order to be able to make a living.</p>

I can mention numerous cases where one man is farming on a farm on which three or four independent farmers made a living 20 or 25 years ago, and the independent farmers who to-day farm on that increased acreage are also in difficulties.

<p>I listened this afternoon to speeches from the Opposition on a motion which they introduced. Their motion does not deal with the difficulties and problems of the farmers but the motion deals with lack of planning on the part of the Ministers of Agriculture. Nobody in this House and nobody outside this House will deny that we are to-day faced with certain problems in the agricultural sphere. It was totally unnecessary for the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) to have made the plea which he did make because we are all aware of it that certain parts of the country are experiencing great economic and other difficulties. I do not think, however, that the object of this debate is to discuss the difficulties of the farmers.</p>

<p>In view of the steps the Government has taken to assist it has indeed admitted that there were difficulties. It is ridiculous to say that we do not admit it. But on an occasion such as this when a special motion has been moved by the Opposition&#x2014;this is not a Budget debate or a debate to discuss the Vote of a Minister &#x2014;you at least expect them when they introduce a motion in which they ask the two Ministers concerned to resign, to say that they regard themselves as the people who ought to take the place of those two Ministers. I am referring to the main speakers on the other side. You would have expected them to tell us what their plans were. But in order to introduce planning you must in the first place have a policy because you do not plan without a policy. Planning is only the carrying out of a policy.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I would have expected hon. member to say: Look, as far as the question of policy is concerned we differ from the Government and that is why the Government&#x2019;s planning is not right. But what did we get? We had a number of loose statements by the hon. member for East London (City). He alleges that the position of the farmers in Australia and New Zealand is much better than that of our farmers, that it is much better in America, that it is much better in Canada, and that it is much better in South America. It is easy to make such statements but let me tell him that every one of those countries is planning to keep fewer farmers on the land, is planning specifically to get rid of the people. If, therefore, they are so prosperous why do they want to get rid of people who are so prosperous? The hon. member must not talk such nonsense. He made other wild statements, for example, that the Government has done nothing to find markets overseas. The hon. member for East London (City) himself was at one time chairman of the Wool Board and at times he went overseas two or three times a year to look for markets and to promote markets. What did he do there? to-day he says that there has been no planning to find markets. What solution did the hon. member have in mind when he went overseas to find better markets for our wool? His solution was that the South African Government should change its policy to conform with the wishes of the Black countries and the Asiatic countries of the world, the Government should change its policy to conform with their wishes in order to get markets. The hon. member&#x2019;s fellow farmers were not even prepared to join him in making that sacrifice and they kicked him out of the Wool Board. That is the kind of planning which the hon. member for East London (City) suggests. Then he talks about other people who lack planning and that is why you must take it that the United Party are the people who will produce better planning for the farmers. If that wish of his were to come true, if his plan to get better markets overseas were to come to fruition, does he think that he will still be able to sell his wool in South Africa? Their policy is that the Bantu should have representation in this Parliament, isn't it? Does he still think that it will be possible for Jan Moolman to sell his wool here? No, our farmers do not want that sort of planning and that was why they got rid of him.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my time is limited but I want to confine myself more specifically to the motion of the hon. member and I say this that agricultural planning can only take place on an accepted agricultural policy and if they do not agree with the agricultural policy of this Government hon. members can say that they disagree with the policy. But I want to state the five basic principles of policy on which agriculture rests, basic principles which we accept.</p>

<p>In the first place our agricultural policy is founded on this that the best use should be made of our natural resources, including manpower, and that agriculture is part of the whole unit; you must always bear the balanced economic development of the country in mind when you apply your agricultural policy. Do hon. members agree with that? The second principle is that of private initiative, that as far as agriculture is concerned private initiative should be left to the farmer himself. Hon. members now talk about planning and they suggest certain things in respect of which there should be planning but which is in direct conflict with the private initiative of the farmer <span class="col_1035-1036" refersTo="page_0532"/>as such. That is why I maintain that where there is planning and where that is one of your basic approaches, your planning must always take into account that it should be possible for the farmer to carry on and to farm as a free individual and if the Government then has to do certain things it follows of necessity that the basic rights of the farmer will be curtailed. Then you must curtail his right to determine what he should pay for land, how he should farm and with what. If you analyse it, Sir, we have had strange criticism here and it is this that the Government should undertake to pay a fixed price to certain groups of farmers in all circumstances. I maintain that no Government can undertake to pay a fixed price to a group of farmers without depriving them of this basic freedom. I want to ask hon. members this: Are they agreeable that we select certain branches of agriculture? We can take the maize industry or the wheat industry or the dairy industry, those industries which were criticized to-day. Are they prepared to say that in all circumstances they will pay a fixed price to those three groups of farmers? Will the hon. member for Gardens say that? He might just as well say it because his party will not come into power in any case. That is what they are pleading for, but they do not reply now. The attack which we have had&#x2014;and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) referred to it&#x2014;consisted entirely of this that I as Minister had said that if more of a product was produced than could be consumed locally that product should be sold at the price which could be obtained on the overseas market. But the hon. member says that is wrong; it is ridiculous. [Interjections.] I told the farmers this at their congress and I repeat it here. Surely it is the duty of the Minister to tell the farmers that if they overproduce, if they produce far in excess of the local demand, they must accept the price which offers on the export market overseas. Will the hon. member give the undertaking that if they come into power they will always pay a fixed price to those three groups of farmers.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_agricultural_economics_and_marketing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member now advances another argument and he says that it is their policy that the adaptation should be gradual. But that was exactly what this Government did. I want to know from the hon. member whether it is not better to effect the adaptation in a year when crops are good than in a year when crops are poor? Strangely enough, Sir, the Opposition does not plead for a fixed price to all the farmers. They are not pleading for that in the case of the fruit farmers or the citrus farmers or the meat farmers or the wool farmers. They only advocate that in the case of maize and dairy products, why? Not because they are so sorry for the maize farmers. Not one of them is sorry for the maize farmer. But they only advocate it in the case of those two products because they know those are the two products in respect of which there is a surplus to-day and in respect of which the overseas price is lower to-day than the price on the local market and because they think they can derive a little political advantage from it. That is the only reason.</p>

<p>There is a third basic principle in an agricultural policy and that is that the greatest efficiency should be maintained. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) said that I had said on one occasion that the farmers should employ more efficient farming methods. I did say that at a congress. Does he want them to farm less efficiently? The hon. member for Gardens also said that the Minister had said that the farmers should live within their means. Does he wish to encourage them to live beyond their means? He went further and said that the Minister had also told them that they should adapt themselves to circumstances and to declining prices. Should the Minister not have said that? Does the hon. member mean to tell me that his approach is that the farmers should live beyond their income, that they need not employ efficient farming methods and that they need not adapt themselves to circumstances? Is that the approach of the United Party? I merely mention these few things to show how ridiculous the points are on which the United Party are basing their attack, and then they say the two Ministers should resign. They do not say the Ministers must resign because they have better people on that side. I take it that there is such a great deal of talent in the National Party that many of our members will be able to do the work, but they lack the courage to say: Give us a chance to Show what we can do. They know that that sort of argument will not get them anywhere. I wanted to say more but time unfortunately does not permit me to do so.</p>

<p>A fourth important principle is that our farmers should adapt themselves to changed circumstances. Does any hon. member opposite say that it is not necessary for the farmers to adapt themselves to circumstances? He must just close his eyes and ignore the question of supply and demand and prices. All he has to do is to produce and if he produces too much it is unfortunate. Is that what they want? No, we must adapt ourselves to new circumstances, and circumstances have changed tremendously in South Africa over the past year as far as the farmer is concerned. The hon. member quoted Mr. Andr&#x00E9; du Toit where he said that economic planning had fallen behind technical planning. That is true, but that has not only happened <span class="col_1037-1038" refersTo="page_0533"/>in South Africa that has happened all over the world, for the simple reason that there has been a shortage of food and it has been necessary to produce more food and the pressure of economic circumstances and surpluses has had the effect that more time had to be devoted to economic planning and the Government is doing that. The very reason why the Prime Minister split the Department of Agriculture was that more attention could be paid to giving guidance to our farmers in the economic field because circumstances are different to-day. That is the fourth basic principle and I ask hon. members whether they agree with it? No, there is dead silence.</p>

<p>The fourth basic principle of our policy is that the Government and the Minister of Agriculture and this party would like to see the agricultural farmer in South Africa make a living which is worthy of a human being and in order to do so he must of necessity farm on an economic unit. He should derive sufficient income from his land to live a decent life. That is a principle which we have often stated. Naturally the United Party is continually distorting it. They say we said the small farmer must leave the platteland. We never said that. What we did say was that where the State had to finance people to establish them on the land it would have to do so on the basis of an economic unit so that those people would be able to make a living worthy of a human being. Do hon. members opposite agree with that or do they differ from that? But they say the two Ministers do not do any planning; they had said the small farmer must go. I have now mentioned the five basic principles on which agriculture is founded. In this regard you can resort to various ways and means in that planning so as to carry out your policy in the direction indicated by it, and when circumstances arise such as we have to-day where agriculture has to adapt itself to new circumstances, the Government must step in, as it has already stepped in, to give assistance to the farmers in all spheres. On various occasions, with a view to the increased production which has taken place in the case of various products, surpluses which had to be exported, control boards and the Government have sent people overseas to find new markets, and with success. Attempts have been made to extend our local market and to increase consumption, also with success. All these things are done to assist in carrying out our policy. One hon. member said that the Government was doing absolutely nothing to reduce the production costs of the farmers. I just want to mention what the Government is doing in an attempt to reduce the farmers&#x2019; production costs. Fertilizer is subsidized and in 1962 that subsidy amounted to R2,690,000. Railway rebates were subsidized by the Government to the tune of R3,600,000. During the drought the cost of transporting stock amounted to R170,000 and the transport costs of stock feed R62,000. The Railways gave a subsidy of R682,000 and R105,000 in the case of the transportation of stock feed. An amount of R1,290,000 was spent by the Department of Agricultural Technical Services on soil conservation works, R29,000 on the combating of pests and plagues&#x2014;a total of R8,660,000 only in respect of these services, apart from the other services which the Department of Agricultural Technical Services also rendered, such as the eradication of noxious weeds R205,000, irrigation works R111,000, the subsidy on boreholes R1,100,000. Then hon. members say the Government is not doing anything to reduce the farmers&#x2019; costs.</p>

<p>But apart from the reduction of costs to the farmer, the Government also provides the producer with a bigger market for his product by way of subsidies. Last year butter was subsidized to the tune of R4,500,000; wheat was subsidized to the tune of R12,900,000; maize to the tune of R9,000,000; and railway rebates amounted to R2,900,000. A total, therefore in respect of these few items only of R26,000,000 in one year only. This, together with the other amounts I have mentioned, comes to over R34,000,000, money spent directly on production and also on markets, and in one year only. But then the hon. member says the Government is doing absolutely nothing to reduce production costs or to get rid of surpluses. I ask hon. members to be a little more responsible.</p>

<p>Another argument of theirs is that we must adapt ourselves to changed circumstances and find new markets. The hon. member for East London (City) stated that we were doing absolutely nothing to find new markets overseas. He said the Department had only two agricultural attach&#x00E9;s, one in London and one in America and he asked what was being done in the case of the Common Market. The Government has appointed a special representative to study the position in regard to the Common Market and to keep us <i>au fait.</i> The various control boards send people overseas annually and some of them do so twice a year to sell their products. Time does not permit me to give figures to illustrate the success they have achieved. I want to ask hon. members opposite whether it is really their intention to serve agriculture with this motion which they have introduced? Do they wish to assist in solving the problem with which agriculture is faced? We have many problems. Recently many parts of the country experienced the worst drought since 1933. In respect of many products there have been surpluses for which new markets had to be found. Is it the intention of hon. members opposite to assist with better planning for the future as far as the farmers are concerned? Are they sincere when they lay these charges without proving them, these charges that nothing is being done, or are they simply trying to make political capital out of this situation and thus derive a little benefit at the polling booth? I maintain that if you analyse their attack the United Party have only selected those products in respect of which there is dissatisfaction amongst the farmers because there are surpluses and the overseas prices are low. They are trying to <span class="col_1039-1040" refersTo="page_0534"/>get the sympathy of those few farmers, but I can assure them that some of those farmers have come to me, that they have put their problems to me and asked for certain things and I told them that we could not do this or that for various reasons and I told them that if they were so dissatisfied they should simply vote for the United Party if they thought the United Party could do better and they replied: No, Mr. the Minister, surely you cannot throw us to the wolves like that. I do not believe, therefore, that the hon. members will derive any political advantage from it. We are endeavouring to ascertain by way of research what the problems are in all spheres, the economic sphere. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) said that the farmers were farming as efficiently as they could. But we have come across farmers who have cooperated with the Department and who thought that they were very efficient but after their position had been analysed they themselves said that they realized how much more efficient they could be. But these things take time and the farmers require to be educated as well. Everyone did not have the opportunity of receiving proper training. This sort of propaganda does nevertheless make an impression on certain people and the kind of articles which sometimes appear in the agricultural journals, articles which are written with the greatest measure of irresponsibility also make an impression at times. That is why it is our task to educate the farmers, together with planning on the part of the Department, but then hon. members must not say that the Minister should not warn the farmers to be more efficient and to live within their income. In spite of their problems and the arguments advanced by the hon. member, the farmers of South Africa are not yet prepared to accept the United Party in the place of the National Party Government.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>When the House adjourned on Friday I was saying that I could not agree with the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson), nor entirely with the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). I fully realize that there are certain evils in the system of separation from bed and board but I am not in favour of its abolition. The hon. member for Pinelands pretends that there are no evils in this system. The system of separation from bed and board was always intended just as a temporary way out of the difficulty in the hope that the parties would become reconciled again. In fact that was the whole idea of the institution of the system of separation from bed and board, to see whether the marriage cannot be saved by a reconciliation. It was a sound basis and I think we all want that. That is why I cannot agree with the hon. member for Heilbron because if we abolish separation from bed and board it means that we shall also be abolishing that principle of reconciliation, and in my opinion we cannot allow that. It is true as the hon. member for Heilbron has said that the number of cases where people become reconciled again is minimal, but even if it is only one case out of 100 it still means that one marriage can be saved.</p>

<p>But there is another reason too why I should not like to meddle with this legal remedy which is already deeply rooted in our legal system. One does not like to interfere with such an old system unless one is able to put something new and better in its place. The old Roman-Dutch Law laid particular emphasis on the question of reconciliation. Let me mention a case in support of my argument. In one of his publications Van Bynkershoek mentions a case where the Hoge Raad in Holland refused to grant a separation from bed and board in spite of the fact that the parties were willing to be divorced and in spite of the fact that there were legal grounds for it, because the Court stated that the conditions that were stipulated made it unlikely or ruled out the possibility that the two parties would become reconciled. It is interesting to see what the conditions were that were stipulated. The wife was prepared to pay maintenance to the husband provided he always lived abroad and did not return to Holland. The Hoge Raad in Holland held that this could not be agreed to because it would rule out or render unlikely the possibility of reconciliation. The idea of the reconciliation period was to save the marriage and that is still the position to-day under our law. Here I could quote the judgment of Mr. Justice Hoexter in the case of Belfort v, Belfort in 1961 in the Appellate Division&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The second consideration is that the granting of a divorce is a matter of public policy and that the policy of the Courts is to uphold the sanctity of the marriage and not lightly to put an end to what is the very foundation of the most important unit of our social life, the family.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this legal remedy of separation from bed and board laid the emphasis on reconciliation <span class="col_1041-1042" refersTo="page_0535"/>and you may ask me where the mistake crept in because with the passing of the years something did go wrong. The trouble is that the parties began to regard separation from bed and board as a means of punishment, they started to use it as a means of punishment. The husband would say to the wife, &#x201C;I shall see to it that you do not remarry for the rest of your life,&#x201D; or the wife would say to the husband, &#x201C;I shall see to it that you do not re-marry.&#x201D; It started to become a means of punishment and that is where the argument advanced by the hon. member for Heilbron is correct. When this legal remedy became a means of punishment it introduced all these evils to which he referred in his introductory speech. The reason was that in the past, particularly under Roman Dutch Law, it was difficult to obtain a divorce while it was fairly easy to obtain a separation from bed and board, particularly where the two parties agreed to separate. It was more difficult than it is to-day to obtain a divorce. In support of this idea that it became a means of punishment and that the courts expressed themselves against it, I just want to refer to the case of <i>Wentzel</i> v. <i>Wentzel,</i> 1915 A.D., in which Mr. Justice Solomon used these words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The important point in my opinion to bear in mind is that a decree of judicial separation should be granted not only by way of punishment exacted by the innocent spouse against the guilty one but rather as a means of relief and escape from the state of things which has become unbearable.</block>

<p>As far back as 1915 Mr. Justice Solomon said that this legal remedy of separation from bed and board could serve as a means of punishment, and that is why he expressed himself most strongly against it in the Appellate Division. But there is another point too and that is this: Why should the one party who is possibly just one degree more guilty than the other party be punished? If the one party is 60 per cent guilty and the other party is 40 per cent guilty, then the one who is 40 per cent guilty can get a separation from bed and board and prevent the other party from ever re-marrying because according to our law it is not necessary for a person to go to court and prove that he is entirely innocent and that the other party is entirely to blame. That is not the case here; here it is simply a question of a difference in the degree of guilt. I also agree with Professor Hahlo where he says this in his book&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A decree of separation will not be granted if both parties are equally to blame: the defendant&#x2019;s conduct must have been the sole or main cause of the state of danger or intolerability.</block>

<p>But in a judgment in 1948 in the Free State Court, Mr. Justice Toon van den Heever went even further. I do not think that this is accepted as one of our legal principles, but he went so far in 1948 in the case of <i>Van Broemhsen</i> v. <i>Van Broemhsen</i> as to say that where the two parties are equally guilty, separation from bed and board should also be granted. Here we have the situation where one party is perhaps just slightly more guilty than the other party and the later can then refuse to give him or her a divorce. The question arises how we can rectify our law so that this legal remedy can once again become what it ought to be, namely a means of reconciliation; What we can do to improve it so that it once again becomes a means of reconciliation instead of a means of punishment because the idea of punishment is not in consonance with our practice, nor is it in consonance with Roman Dutch Law? The idea of allowing a period of reconciliation is something which exists not only in our legal system; we also find it in the English legal system under which a few years have to elapse before an action for divorce can be instituted. In Natal a period of 18 months has to elapse before an action for divorce can be instituted and in Southern Rhodesia the parties cannot divorce until three years have elapsed from the date of their marriage. Mr. Speaker, here I want to submit the following idea for the consideration of the House; this idea does not emanate from me; it is an idea which other people have already put forward in the past. A few years ago in different circles the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) expressed the same idea that I want to submit to the House in all modesty. I have also discussed it with certain colleagues at the Cape Bar&#x2014;I could mention their names&#x2014;and they feel strongly that this may be the solution to a very difficult problem. The idea to which I refer is that we should retain the grounds for separation from bed and board; that we should also retain the legal remedy of separation from bed and board, but after a certain period, which I do not want to discuss now&#x2014;let us fix it arbitrarily at a period of three years&#x2014; anyone of the parties should be able to go to court and say to the court that there is no possibility of their becoming reconciled. The court would then listen to the evidence; the other party may come along and say that there is a possibility of reconciliation; the court would then weigh up the evidence of the two parties and if it finds that there is no possibilities of reconciliation, it would then grant a divorce.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, even the guilty person. It is for that very reason that I referred a moment ago to the degree of guilt. One spouse, as I have already indicated, may be 60 per cent guilty and the other 40 per cent guilty but because the one spouse is only 20 per cent more guilty, he or she is punished. Either of the two parties could then go to court and say that there is no possibility of <span class="col_1043-1044" refersTo="page_0536"/>a reconciliation. In those circumstances we would re-introduce the possibility of a reconciliation which is necessary to keep the marriage intact and the legal remedy of separation from bed and board would again come into its own. I mention this just for the consideration of hon. members but I propose to move that this matter be referred to a Select Committee so that it can be thoroughly investigated. I hope that in these circumstances the United Party will support me. I recall that ten years ago when I made my maiden speech in this House I dealt with marital affairs, and when we came back from the Select Committee I was one of the three persons who voted on the side of the United Party for certain clauses. to-day, ten years later, the United Party can return the compliment and give me their support. I may say that in that debate in 1953 I was followed by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman); she was also making her maiden speech and she said that I had made a particularly fine speech. With that I fully agree. The hon. member for Houghton has also indicated that she will support me as far as the appointment of a Select Committee is concerned. I am only afraid, however, that the United Party will refuse to support me in view of the fact that the hon. member for Houghton supports me. I move&#x2014;</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to deal at the outset with the amendment that has just been moved and seconded. I appreciate the sentiments of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) in expressing what he considers to be a duty on the part of this side of the House to reciprocate and to support his motion in the light of his previous support of a motion moved by this side of the House, but I regret that duty will have to be fulfilled on some other occasion. We on this side of the House are against the Bill before the House. We are against it because we consider that legislation of this kind which proposes to introduce far-reaching changes in our marriage laws, should not be put through the House in the way in which it is sought to put through this Bill. If far-reaching changes are to be made to our marriage laws we consider that the Government should take the full responsibility for it and if it is proposed to introduce a Bill, not do so until the whole matter has been thoroughly and properly investigated. We consider that a Select Committee is not the proper body to carry out such investigation. If any body is to be appointed it should be a properly constituted commission.</p>

<p>I do not wish to go into this subject at length; I merely wish to state the views of this side of the House on the amendment which has been moved but quite in passing may I say that my personal views on the proposition of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North), namely that the laws should be changed so as to make it possible to obtain a divorce after a separation of a certain length of time, my personal views are that I oppose that strongly. In passing I would like to mention to the House that in the February edition of the <i>S.A. Law Journal</i> there will appear an article by Professor Hahlo, to whom reference has already been made on two or three occasions, particularly by the hon. member for Heilbron. In this article he examines various suggestions that have been made with a view to reforming the marriage laws. In particular he examines at some length this particular suggestion that a divorce should be obtainable after a separation of a certain period of time, and he comes to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By making separation for a fixed number of years, whether under a decree or deed or <i>de facto</i> only a ground of divorce &#x2026;</block>

<p>and then he goes on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">the basic objection to this proposal, which applies equally to the more limited provisions of the Bill (i.e. the Bill which is now before the House) is that it makes in effect a marriage terminable at will, enabling either spouse to obtain a divorce after the prescribed interval of separation has lapsed, for no better reason than that he no longer wishes to be bound by the marriage.</block>

<p>I wish to deal with the merits of this Bill, and I will point out that the Bill proposes to do two things; it proposes firstly to abolish judicial separation and secondly to make any existing judicial order or notarial deed of separation and any future notarial deed of separation, virtually convertible into a divorce. Judicial separation has been part of our law for hundreds of years. As has been pointed out by the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson), it formed part of the canon law and of the laws of the countries from which we derived our legal system, for nearly</p>

<p>1. 000 years. Furthermore, judicial separation is still part of the law of England; it is still part of the law of Holland and it is still part of the law of most Continental countries. I suggest that under those circumstances this House should be extremely cautious before deciding to abolish judicial separation and more so since in England, after careful and thorough investigation by the Morton Commission, an investigation which I believe lasted for a period of four years, it has been decided to retain this institution. The hon. member for Heilbron seeks to persuade this House that judicial separation ought to be abolished. I would have expected, and I think this House was entitled to expect, that the hon. member would not have introduced the Bill unless he <span class="col_1045-1046" refersTo="page_0537"/>was able to show a substantial demand to abolish judicial separation from law societies, marriage guidance councils, churches, women&#x2019;s organizations and other bodies which have to do with matrimonial problems. Not only has he shown no demand whatever from such organizations but, what is more, he said during the course of his introductory speech that he had not heard from these organizations. In fact he introduces this Bill despite the fact that he has not troubled to ascertain the views of bodies which are far better able to speak authoritatively on this subject than is the hon. member&#x2014;and I say this with respect to him&#x2014; despite his 25 years&#x2019; experience as an attorney. The fact that there has been no demand to abolish judicial separation from bodies which are intimately concerned with the effect of this institution, should, quite apart from any other considerations, I suggest, cause this House to reject this Bill. But in fact I believe that there is one body whose members have a lot to do with matrimonial problems which has, I believe. unanimously expressed its opposition to this Bill, and that is the Association of Law Societies &#x2026;</p>

<p>Where do you get that from?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>With respect, Sir, it is irrelevant where I get this from. What is relevant is whether or not the Association of Law Societies opposes or supports this Bill, and I say that I believe that the Association opposes this Bill. The Association of Law Societies is made up of the Law Societies of all the provinces of the Republic. Quite apart from the absence of a demand for the abolition of judicial separation from bodies intimately concerned with marital problems, I believe there are other reasons for rejecting this Bill and maintaining judicial separation as part of our law. I believe these fall into three categories&#x2014;religious, social and what I might call practical reasons&#x2014;and I propose to deal briefly with each of these, first of all the religious reasons. There are obviously many people in South Africa who are against divorce on religious grounds. For such people the only relief from a dangerous or intolerable matrimonial situation is judicial separation. One such group of people is the Roman Catholic group, but I want to stress that the Roman Catholics are by no means the only people in South Africa who are against divorce on religious grounds; there are many others, so for that reason, because the statement which I propose to read will apply to others as well as Roman Catholics, I propose to read to this House the views of the Roman Catholic Church on this Bill as expressed by the Catholic Archbishop of Cape Town, Archbishop Owen McCann in a statement published in last week&#x2019;s issue of the Catholic weekly newspaper <i>The Southern Cross.</i> But before I do so I would like to say that I intend to deal later with what the hon. member for Heilbron described as his threefold answer to people such as Roman Catholics, and I shall show that the so-called answer is in fact no answer at all. This is what the Archbishop says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bill is a Private Bill, but we must protest against it as an intrusion on the rights of conscience and as a furtherance of easy divorce.</block>

<block name="quote">The Catholic Church does not recognize civil divorce as allowed by law, as breaking the marital bond, holding that marriage is a permanent union, which cannot be dissolved at the mere instance of either of the parties. The Church, however, does recognize that a separation <i>a mensa et thoro</i> may be made. Catholics are bound in conscience by this teaching and the law of the land should respect their conscience. Where justification for separation exists, the law should be so framed as to sanction this without impressing a burden on the conscience of those unhappily enmeshed in matrimonial difficulties. The Bill, too, could open the way to an automatic divorce, after one year of separation. The Church always looks upon separation as a temporary position hoping that reconciliation may be eventually effected between the spouses. This Bill is, therefore, tantamount to forcing divorce on one who though justified in being separated, may for reasons of conscience be against divorcing. The Bill also is wrong from a social point of view as it will weaken still further marriage as an institution in which only permanency of union safeguards the security of the spouses and the proper education of the off-spring.</block>

<p>I say again that there are many people in South Africa whose consciences do not permit them to divorce, and for them the only relief from an intolerable matrimonial position is judicial separation. It may be convenient at this stage to deal with the three answers given by the hon. member for Heilbron to such persons. He said first of all&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If their belief and religious convictions are so strong then these people ought to have the courage of their religious convictions and preserve their marriage and not seek legal means, whereby they retain the empty shell of the marriage and violate the whole essence and nature of the marriage.</block>

<p>Sir, the first thing I have to say about this is that judicial separation has been recognized as part of the law of many countries which are termed Western civilization, and it has become part of the law as a result of Christian influences and I am not aware that it has previously been suggested that to recognize this institution shows in any way a lack of conviction on the part of those who have conscientious objections to divorce. However, there is another answer to this so-called first answer and that is, I think, that marriage is an institution which affects two people and if one party makes life intolerable for the other, it <span class="col_1047-1048" refersTo="page_0538"/>is unjust towards the innocent spouse to force that spouse to continue living together with the guilty spouse and not to give the innocent spouse the opportunity to live, apart whilst at the same time recognizing that a divorce must be obtained.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This is a queer argument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron regards this as a queer argument. Perhaps I can return the compliment and say that I regard his answers as being very queer answers to the persons who share the views that I hold. The second of the hon. member&#x2019;s so-called reasons is this. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Such believers under this Bill will still be able to conclude a private agreement of separation and even conclude a notarial agreement of separation because it is not abolished under the Bill.</block>

<p>Sir, that is so provided the guilty party is prepared to enter into an agreement. If he is not, then of course that cannot be done. In any event it is of little help because after a period of a year the guilty party will be able under the Bill to petition the Court to set aside any such agreement. The third reason is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If such an agreement of separation cannot be reached and the other party makes living together dangerous or intolerable then the other party can leave. She need not live together with him. She still has all the protection that she desires under the law; she can get all the maintenance that she wants. It is not necessary for them to get an Order of Court in order to live apart.</block>

<p>That argument, to my way of thinking, goes against the hon. member for Heilbron because if in fact the abuses and the difficulty which he seeks to overcome by doing away with judicial separation can nevertheless be obtained by merely living apart, then he does not solve any problems at all by abolishing this institution. In any event, I suggest that persons should be given the protection of the law if they find themselves in an intolerable matrimonial situation. It is not sufficient simply to say to them: You can live apart. There should be some protection at law whereby they can get a judicial separation order which will give legal recognition to their living apart. I consider that it would be morally wrong for this House to abolish judicial separation and so bring about a situation whereby the only relief from an impossible or tragic matrimonial situation would be a course which is contrary to the conscience of the person concerned. This, I think, applies even more so if in fact the number of judicial separations is comparatively small in comparison with divorces. We do not know what the figures are; no statistics have been placed before this House.</p>

<p>I pass on to the second ground, the social reasons. The argument advanced to this House by the hon. member for Heilbron was largely based on the assumption that plaintiffs who obtain judicial separation could have obtained divorce orders equally well but refrained from doing so in order to keep their husbands tied to them for other motives. Firstly, that is quite wrong because there are many instances where the plaintiff has no grounds at all for a divorce but does have grounds for a judicial separation. Secondly, the hon. member for Heilbron looked at the matter purely from the point of view of the aggrieved husband. But there is, of course, the wife&#x2019;s side of the matter and I belive it is this: Although the member for Heilbron was quite right in saying, as he did, that a wife is able to get maintenance under our laws even though she obtained a decree of divorce&#x2014;that does not need a judicial separation order. So from that point of view she is not prejudiced by taking an order of divorce instead of a judicial separation order. But in practice she could well be prejudiced and in fact she is very frequently prejudiced because a husband who re-marries as a result of having been divorced, creates other financial obligations and in doing so he lessens his ability to maintain his previous wife; he is either no longer able to maintain her at all or is not able to maintain her to the extent which she requires. The same applies to the children. They also are very often prejudiced by a second marriage and the creation of these further financial obligations. So, although in theory &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<p>They must be supported in any case.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>But surely the hon. member must appreciate that in deciding how much a husband should be ordered to pay, the Court will and must take into account the financial obligations which the husband has towards his second wife and towards his second family.</p>

<p>The other social reason, I believe, is that by passing this Bill we will in effect be making divorce easier. I will explain why I say that in a moment. Before I do so I would like to make a few observations which are probably not necessary and that is that all right-thinking people in South Africa are in agreement as to the importance of the family unit to the nation and the need to do everything possible to safeguard the stability and security of marriage. Any step, therefore, which makes it easier to get divorced should not be taken. In fact, Sir, there are many people who think that under our law it is already too easy to get divorced. The Bill before the House, I suggest, will undoubtedly make divorce easier; firstly, because it makes an existing judicial order or a notarial deed of separation and any future notarial deed of separation convertible into a divorce.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Not necessarily.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with that but it does make it convertible into a divorce. But the matter goes further than that. Divorce under our law is granted on two main grounds, <span class="col_1049-1050" refersTo="page_0539"/>malicious desertion and adultery. There are two others but those are not relevant to this discussion. Judicial separation, on the other hand, is granted on the two grounds of divorce but also on a further ground which, for the purposes of this discussion, I think we can call cruelty although, strictly speaking, that is not an entirely correct term. If judicial separation is abolished no relief for a wife whose husband has not deserted her nor committed adultry but by conduct of one sort or another has made life intolerable, will be obtainable. The inevitable result will be that very soon cruelty will be made a ground of divorce. I suggest that that is inevitable. In this regard I should like to quote again from this article by Professor Hahlo. I do so mainly, Mr. Speaker, because the hon. member for Heilbron in introducing this Bill relied on certain passages from a text book by Hahlo which, <i>prima facie</i> appear to justify the Bill. I quote firstly from page 43 of this article. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Judicial separation is at present the only legal remedy for a husband or wife whose spouse makes life together miserable for the plaintiff, without acting with the intention to put an end to the marriage. If we were to abolish judicial separation, we should have to make cruelty a ground of divorce.</block>

<p>Then again at page 38 he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In England the Morton Commission recommended that the remedy of judicial separation, though little used, should be retained for the benefit of those who have conscientious objections to divorce or maintain hopes of eventual reconciliation. In our law there is an additional reason for its retention. However dangerous or intolerable a husband may make cohabitation for his wife (or a wife for her husband), unless he acts with the intention of putting an end to the marriage, judicial separation is at present her only remedy. If we were to abolish judicial separation, cruelty would have to be introduced as a new ground for divorce.</block>

<p>In passing I would point out that by the amendment which has been moved to-day a new ground of divorce is in fact proposed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>I am, yes. I am opposed to it amongst other reasons because of the difficulty of drawing the line. I suggest that the experience in America, where mental and physical cruelty are grounds of divorce, shows how it can be abused, firstly; and secondly how difficult it is to draw the line between acts which justify a divorce and acts which really do not.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_lands">

<p>Is malicious desertion not also abused?</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The fact that the marriage laws may be abused&#x2014;and they are&#x2014; certainly does not justify doing away with the institution of judicial separation nor does it justify introducing the new ground for divorce which is proposed or introducing cruelty as a ground of divorce. These interjections by the hon. the Minister of Lands emphasize the folly of trying to deal with the marriage laws piecemeal in the way this Bill proposes to do. If there are to be changes in our marriage laws it is essential, I suggest, that the whole matter should be properly and carer fully investigated by a properly constituted committee. I have already expressed myself against a Select Committee. In my view a Select Committee is not a proper body to carry out such an investigation.</p>

<p>I might add one point only in support of that argument. The English commission which investigated this whole question took four years for its investigation. Undoubtedly it is a matter which is going to require the hearing of a great deal of evidence from various bodies who have to do with matrimonial problems and from various persons. It is bound to take a long time if the body concerned does its job properly. For that reason alone I suggest that a Select Committee will be an entirely unsuitable body to carry out the investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I now come to the third category and that is what I term practical reasons. One of the main arguments advanced by the hon. member for Heilbron for the abolition of judicial separation is that, in his view, it is abused by spiteful and vindictive wives or by wives who use judicial separation to extort more maintenance than they are entitled to. Let me make it quite clear, Sir, that I appreciate that judicial separation is in some cases abused in this way. I do not deny it. But I repeat that there are many laws which are subject to abuse and if all laws which are so subject have to be abolished, we would arrive at an extraordinary situation. I suggest that if the law is in fact subject to abuse, it ought to be possible to so amend it as to obviate, at any rate the bulk of the abuses. You will never be able to obviate all the abuses. But I suggest that it ought to be possible to obviate a large number of the abuses by amendment without doing away with the institution altogether In any event, Sir, without proper statistics it is impossible to see the problem of abuse in its proper perspective and no statistics have been put before this House.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I explained why I could not give statistics.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty and the reason why he was not able to put statistics before the House. But that is a further reason why if the matter is to be amended by legislation at all, it should be properly investigated by a properly constituted commission. One <span class="col_1051-1052" refersTo="page_0540"/>needs to know in this regard, one needs to have the answer in this regard to the question of how many judicial separation orders there have been granted by our courts each year; how many divorces there are so as to make a comparison and arrive at a percentage, and in how many cases of judicial separation there is abuse. Clearly, Sir, there must be many cases of judicial separation in which no abuse at all exists; many wives who act perfectly properly, and do not extort more maintenance from their husbands than they are entitled to and so on. One needs to know the extent of these abuses so as to see the matter in its proper perspective. I am inclined to think, Mr. Speaker, although I may be quite wrong, that statistics would show two things. They would show firstly that the number of judicial separations granted is extremely small in comparison with the number of divorces and secondly that it is only in a small percentage of cases of judicial separation that the situation is abused. However, Sir, I consider that the strongest argument against the proposition that judicial separation ought to be abolished, because it is being abused, is that, even if judicial separation is abolished, it will still be possible for unscrupulous wives to hold their husbands to ransom in the same way that they do under the judicial separation procedure. Here again, Sir, I shall quote from the article by Professor Hahlo to which I previously referred. At page 37 the professor says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Occasionally&#x2014;not very often&#x2014;a wife whose husband has committed adultery or deserted her, instead of suing him for a divorce, brings an action for judicial separation, thus putting an end to cohabitation and yet keeping him tied to her. And there are, no doubt, cases where wives use the threat of judicial separation to hold their freedom-thirsting husbands to ransom. It is this kind of situation that the aforestated proposals are intended to meet.</block>

<p>That is the proposal under this Bill. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not easy to see how the abolition of judicial separation would help. There is no rule in our law forcing a wife to live with her guilty husband unless and until she obtains a decree of judicial separation. Nor is there a rule by which she could be forced to sue him for divorce. In the absence of judicial separation, she could still live apart from him, setting up his adultery or desertion as a defence if he were to sue her for restitution of conjugal rights. And, of course, as the wronged party she would still be entitled to claim maintenance from him.</block>

<block name="quote">A decree of separation is, in the first instance, a judicial recognition of the fact that by making life together dangerous or intolerable to her, the husband has given his wife good reason to live apart; in the second instance, it gives the court an opportunity of making a wholesale regulation of their affairs <i>pendente se paratione</i>&#x2014;property rights, maintenance, custody of minor children. If judicial separation were abolished, there would still be a need to regulate these matters, only it would be done piecemeal and the orders would bear different names.</block>

<p>I would draw attention to what follows, Mr. Speaker, because I believe the professor is quite right&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By its abolition we should lose its benefits without achieving the object at which the reformers aim.</block>

<p>He deals with this again at page 44 where he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The framers of the Bill seem to think that, once judicial separation is abolished, a woman will be compelled to live with her husband or sue for a divorce. But why should she? If her husband deserts her or commits adultery or treats her with cruelty, she will still be able to live apart, to claim maintenance as a deserted wife, and to apply for the custody of the children of the marriage. Provided she herself does not commit adultery, and is not fool enough to enter into a notarial deed of separation, she is safe from divorce, nor can her guilty husband compel her to restore conjugal rights. The only difference will be that instead of the neat and comprehensive regulation presently made under the judicial separation, there will be a multitude of applications and orders.</block>

<block name="quote">With Mr. Froneman, M.P., one feels sorry for the man (or woman) who discovers that he has made a mistake in his marriage, but whose wife (husband) refuses to give him a divorce, with the result that he finds himself condemned to a life-time of celibacy or sin. But this is not due to judicial separation, which is unjustly &#x2026;</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think hon. members on the other side of the House have taken the discussions on this Bill rather lightly, including, if I may say so, the hon. the Minister of Finance. The discussions have not been insignificant, but I think they have been significant both for what the Minister and his colleagues did not say as well as for what the hon. the Minister himself did say. Talking of colleagues, Mr. Speaker, we had another instance during the week-end of how extremely difficult it is for the public or the Press to understand just exactly what Government policy is. I refer to a Press conference which was given by the hon. the Minister of Information, I understand, on Friday morning. At that Press conference he gave out a statement. He ingenuously said that he had not read the Bill himself but he understood that the statement was a fair description of what it contained and that it was designed to improve race relations. I do not know whether the Minister thought it was wiser to break the news in easy stages to the country of what the Bill really contained or whether he had been badly briefed or whether he had not done his homework. The fact remains that he created a completely wrong impression in the minds of the Press as to the main features of this Bill, as a result of which the afternoon Press&#x2014;the Bill had of course not been published yet; the Press had not seen it&#x2014; came out with headlines. The <i>Cape Argus</i> said: &#x201C;State Plans to ease Race Friction; Bill to amend Laws for the Urban Bantu&#x201D;; the <i>Burger</i> said: &#x201C;Die Wetsontwerp sal skaafplekke tussen wit en Bantoe verwyder.&#x201D; The <i>Star</i> said: &#x201C;New Deal for Africans and to get rid of Friction&#x201D;; the <i>Vaderland</i> said&#x2014;&#x201C;Nuwe Rassebedeling&#x201D;. But, Mr. Speaker, the main purpose of the Bill is not to remove friction; it is simply to place the urban Bantu still further at the mercy of the Administration. I can only say, Sir, that as far as that Press conference was concerned&#x2014;after all I suppose the hon. the Minister is the public relations officer of this Government&#x2014;it was a complete fiasco. I can tell him this that it is going to take a very long time both at home and abroad before any statement that he issues will be accepted except with extreme reservation and with a certain degree of scepticism. If that makes for a successful public relations officer, then I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the first significant thing about the debate on this measure was, I think, that a number of questions were asked by this side of the House, pertinent questions affecting the policy of the Government, questions which this House is perfectly entitled to ask and upon which we quite reasonably might expect answers. The significant thing is that not one of those questions was answered. It took three Ministers and a Deputy Minister, as well as various humbler members on the Government benches, several hours to give no answers at all to any of these questions. We asked, Sir, what was to be the future of the Witwatersrand, having regard to the fact that it was faced with the closing down of some 27 or even 35 mines in the next few years. Sir, we did not even get an admission from anyone on that side of the House, not even from the Minister of Mines himself, that there was a problem posed by this prospective closing down of mines. We were told by an hon. member sitting on the back-benches that there was a private inquiry&#x2014;he did not know that it was a private inquiry; he was told that later&#x2014; to which the Government is making a small contribution, and we were told that mines have closed down before, and that Johannesburg still stands; we were told that the population is still increasing on the Witwatersrand&#x2014;I do not know what that has got to do with it, because the miners are still employed there and after all miners do not spend their whole life underground. In other words, we were given clearly to understand that as far as this Government is concerned there is nothing to be concerned about. I want to ask the hon. Minister, on behalf of his Government, this afternoon, a perfectly straightforward and <span class="col_1055-1056" refersTo="page_0542"/>simple question: Does the Government realize and agree that the potential closing down in the next few years of 27 mines on the Rand and the East Rand poses a problem; if so, how does the Government view that problem and how does it propose to face up to it and to tackle it? That is a fair question.</p>

<p>We also asked, Sir, for a clarification of the policy of the development of border industries. We would like to know in the first place what is a &#x201C;border area&#x201D;? Nobody knows. We know that some R45,000,000 of the taxpayer&#x2019;s money is to be spent on industries, in the so-called border areas, but nobody knows which those border areas are. Is Durban a border area? Durban has large Native reserves actually on its borders, touching its borders, but Durban is not classified as a border area. Pretoria has one Black spot about 15 miles north, which in terms of the policy enunciated by the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development should be due for removal altogether to the Bantustans, but Pretoria has been declared a border area, and industries being started there are receiving all the assistance border factories are entitled to. Is Pinetown a border area? Pinetown is adjacent to Native reserves, but there is no suggestion of border industries being established there. Moreover, when it comes to border areas, what about all these towns on the Reef? They have a very large permanent Native population. It is all very well for the hon. the Minister of Bantu Development to say that they are only migrant Natives and that they are only there temporarily. But when you give a man a thirty-year lease of a property it is very difficult to consider him as a temporary resident. And I would say that when it comes to the establishment of industries to find employment, some of these border towns, like Roodepoort for instance, have a very strong claim for assistance in that direction, because if large numbers of these Bantu people are forced by starvation or by decree from the Department under this new proposed Bill to return to the reserves, there will be no work for them. We have to accept the fact that they are there on the Rand and provision should be made for them and to keep the whole economy of the Witwatersrand going. Now what industries are visualized under this border development? We know that this R45,000,000 has been earmarked for spending on the textile industry, and that is presumably so because the textile industry employs a very large proportion of unskilled or semi-skilled Native labour, and this R45,000,000 is to be spent clearly in subsidizing employment for the Natives in the reserves, Natives who in the course of time under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy will be &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; Natives. I ask myself why if you are going to subsidize on that scale to find employment for the Bantu people, why not subsidize White industries as well, selected industries. You see we have no list, no schedule of what the Government might consider to be White industry, that is to say White industries employing an overwhelming proportion of White labour, and it seems to me only logical that if you are going to subsidize the Black man to give him a living (which we do not object to), it is quite logical to say that you also have to subsidize the White man in order to enable him to compete with the Black man you are subsidizing already. And it may well be that when the Government finally wakes up to the problems which exist on the Witwatersrand and which will develop in the coming years, they will have to provide similar inducements to people to start industries on the Witwatersrand to keep the Witwatersrand going.</p>

<p>Or is it&#x2014;perhaps the Minister could tell us&#x2014;that there are no such White industries and that there is no possibility of establishing any industry almost entirely manned by White people? Because if that is the case, I ask what is the future then for White South Africa under the Government&#x2019;s policy? What alternative has the Government for economic integration? We know the Government does not approve of economic integration. So it seems that as a result of our endeavours to find information, we and the country are no wiser than we were when we started asking questions, except that judging from this debate it seems clear that the Government has no answers to any of these pregnant questions we put to them.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance particularly criticized the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje). He said that the hon. member for Jeppes apparently&#x2014;he did not quote him exactly&#x2014;believed in the materialistic doctrine &#x201C;that nothing is politically good that is not economically sound&#x201D;, and he went on to say that the hon. member for Jeppes apparently believes that &#x201C;economic considerations alone should dictate Government policy&#x201D;, and the hon. the Minister said &#x201C;We reject that <i>in toto</i>&#x201D;. Well, of course, Sir, the hon. member for Jeppes did not say that and so what the hon. the Minister of Finance rejected <i>in toto</i> was a figment of his own imagination. The hon. member for Jeppes did argue that economic policies should be economically sound. I would have thought that that is axiomatic, and I would have thought that any reasonable person would have taken that for granted. I do not know whether the hon. Minister rejects that or not, and whether that is included in his <i>in toto.</i> In my opinion it is a fair axiom to say that economic schemes should be economically sound. But the main argument of the hon. member for Jeppes was that in addition to being economically unsound, referring to the Government&#x2019;s ideas, they were politically quite incapable of achievement and he gave figures and arguments in support of that contention. He took as his basis that economic integration is a fact, whether it is in the towns or on the borders of the reserves&#x2014;when you shift the integration from the urban areas to the borders of the reserves, it does not alter the fact of integration. That again seems to me a sound argument and an unanswerable argument. The hon. Minister did have an answer, and a very remarkable and significant answer it was. He said that he believes that <span class="col_1057-1058" refersTo="page_0543"/>the time might come&#x2014;and presumably he meant now, otherwise there was little sense in his argument&#x2014;in the life of a country when it had to place imponderable things above every consideration in order to preserve the soul of the country. If that is so, if the hon. the Minister in enunciating that theory is correct, one may well ask that if the country&#x2019;s financial and economic policies are to be shaped by the &#x201C;imponderables&#x201D;, why do we appoint expert commissions on economic matters to advise the Government? Why did we appoint the Tomlinson Commission? We know that its recommendations have largely been rejected out of hand. Why did the Government appoint the Viljoen Commission, a commission which incidentally recommended that the Government&#x2019;s policy should always be directed with an eye to its effect on the country&#x2019;s economy. That is being completely ignored. Why have we got a formidable Economic Advisory Council? We do not know what advice it gives to the hon. the Prime Minister of course; we only know of excerpts which are published in the Press, and which are presumably the bits of advice which the hon. the Prime Minister is prepared to accept. But it would appear that when these commissions which are appointed, consisting of the best brains in that particular line, report, the Government is ready to disregard the whole lot in pursuit of its political ideologies. It reminds one of the old story of the rather heated football game where the ball was kicked out of the ground, and while the players were waiting for the ball to be returned one of the large forwards in the game said &#x201C;Never mind the ruddy ball, let us get on with the game&#x201D;. It looks to me as if in their pursuit of these ideologies, the Government is not going to be bothered with economic expert advice, wherever it comes from. I am quite sure, however, that the Treasury does not draft its proposals on the basis of imponderable things. What is this &#x201C;imponderable&#x201D;, this mysterious X, that haunts the hon. the Minister of Finance in guiding the financial destinies of the country? Mr. Speaker, is it by any chance a guarded reference to the hon. the Prime Minister, do you think? I can just see the hon. Minister telling his financial advisers; Look, Gentlemen, your advice is economically sound, but the &#x201C;Great Imponderable&#x201D; does not accept it, and that is all there is to it. I wonder, in saying that, whether we are not really coming to the root of the matter, and whether we cannot really phrase our country&#x2019;s difficulties in one short sentence by simply saying that the whole country&#x2019;s economic future is being jeopardized by and subjected to the ideological pipe-dreams of the hon. the Prime Minister. That being so, one can only feel sorry for his colleagues, who otherwise in many respects are rational people, having to get up in this House and to try and justify things which they know are irrational, impossible and hold serious dangers for the country. Mr. Speaker, this talk of &#x201C;imponderables&#x201D; and &#x201C;saving die country&#x2019;s soul&#x201D; is to my mind quite arrant nonsense in the context in which the hon. the Minister used these words. It seems to me like vamping on the piano when you cannot read the music and hoping that the audience will not notice it. But let me tell the hon. the Minister that the public is beginning to notice it, and when they become fully aware&#x2014;the audience is not only this House, but also the country&#x2014;of the five-finger exercise they have been listening to instead of the concerto which they expected, it will be no excuse for the Minister to say that he is just doing his best.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister talked about these discussions here in the House being interred in the annals of Parliament. He meant &#x201C;Hansard&#x201D;, I expect. Well, Sir, I can. only say that in time to come I think the hon. the Minister would like to see them not interred but expunged altogether from the annals of this House, because they expose the Government&#x2019;s weaknesses so very clearly. Sir, the annals of the last 15 years are full of instances of &#x201C;what the Opposition says to-day the Government is compelled sooner or later to accept as its policy&#x201D;. And I have no doubt that this debate which has taken place is another example, and that before very long the Government will be compelled to admit that in raising these matters as we have done during the last few days, we were perfectly right. I think we have particularly established two things: First of all, that the problems of the Rand&#x2019;s future, according to the Government, are not considered sufficiently important to merit the serious consideration either of this House or of the Government, and that in any case the Government has no plans for dealing with those problems; secondly we have established, I think, that these grandiose plans of border industrial development and the gradual shifting of the labour force of the country from the urban areas and from the Western Province generally, that is to say, disintegrating the present economy, are based not on sound economic lines, but on a theory, a wild theory, to my mind an untenable theory, that by so doing you save the soul of the nation! Well, Mr. Speaker, when an hon. Minister of Finance can put up that reason in justification of a policy and give no other justification, one can only hold up one&#x2019;s hands and say &#x201C;Heaven help South Africa!&#x201D;</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down began by talking about a Bill which as far as I know has not even been before the Cabinet yet, according to newspaper reports, a Bill which was published purely for information and on which public comment was invited. Does the hon. member not think that he should submit these comments to the Department instead of raising the matter here? Something might then be done perhaps along the lines that he has in mind, but surely it is far-reaching to come and criticize the Government in this House in connection with a Bill which the Government itself has not yet considered!</p>

<p>The hon. member says that quite a number of questions which the Opposition raised during the second-reading debate remained unanswered. <span class="col_1059-1060" refersTo="page_0544"/>Let me just take the few that he mentioned. He referred to the future of the Witwatersrand. The United Party is supposed to be so perturbed about the Witwatersrand which allegedly faces ruin because gold mines are going to close down on a large scale. I do not know whether hon. members of the United Party realize this or whether they do not realize it, but the problem of the Vereeniging-Witwatersrand-Pretoria complex is not one of too few economic activities but of too many activities, the problem being that there are no water supplies in that area to continue to make provision for the expansion which is taking place, and it is for that reason that we must have a policy of decentralization. The development which is taking place there in the industrial sphere much more than compensates for the possible decline in gold-mining activities. It is a systematic development. Hon. members opposite must not try to suggest here that it is the Government&#x2019;s policy to kill all industrial development in that complex, because that is not the truth. The Government&#x2019;s policy is to shift those industries which need large numbers of unskilled workers to areas which are more suitable for them, so as to make provision on the Rand and in areas which are not border areas for industries which make more extensive use of capital and of mechanization. We cannot go and establish more industries in that part of the world than it would be reasonably safe to do bearing in mind the amount of water that is available in this area.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member wants to know what border industries are. Mr. Speaker, that has been explained here so often that I do not know whether he is serious in putting this question. The hon. member asks whether Durban is a border area for industrial development. Of course Durban is a border area, and the hon. member ought to know that. It was said in this House last year and also prior to that, but it was also said that certain concessions would be granted to border industries which are established away from the present industrial areas so as to compensate them for possible disadvantages which do not exist in respect of border places such as Durban and Pretoria. The hon. member&#x2019;s whole quarrel therefore is that he wants concessions for Durban which are not justified because Durban is already an industrial area, Durban has a growth potential of its own and it is not necessary as far as Durban is concerned to give it an injection of vitality. The same applies to Pinetown and other areas in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member talked about our Ideology and said that the hon. the Minister of Finance had stated that we were not going to sacrifice our ideological policy for the sake of temporary economic gain. Surely that is something which is said year after year in this House and year after year the same hon. member for Constantia comes along with a motion&#x2014;usually in connection with the main Budget&#x2014;in which he moves that all the words after &#x201C;that&#x201D; be deleted and that a whole lot of other words be substituted &#x201C;because the Government&#x2019;s racial policy is ruining the country economically&#x201D;. That is the amendment which he moves here every year and adequate replies have been given to it repeatedly. It is pointed out every year that with our racial policy we want to safeguard the future of South Africa and that the necessary adjustments have to be made as far as these other things are concerned. Now the hon. member wants to know why, if that is the position, the Government appoints experts, economists and commissions to advise it in connection with economic matters if the racial issue is such a dominant one. I have already said on a few previous occasions in this House, and it has been said by some of our Ministers, that these people have go give us the best advice as to how to build up this country economically, but just as in the case of mathematics there are certain fundamental axioms on which they have to work and one of the fundamental axioms is that apartheid must continue to exist in South Africa, that White civilization must rule in the White areas of South Africa. Once that is accepted as the fundamental axiom, then from that point onwards you can work out what your policy should be and what the best course is economically that will fit in with that axiom. The best economic policy for South Africa must be worked out within the framework of our broad ideological policy, not outside that framework. On that point the National Party stands very firmly.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is a third-reading debate, and in a debate such as this one should view matters more objectively really. Here I want to touch upon a matter which I raised last year during the Budget debate. You will recall that last year I raised the question here of the rates of interest of the Reserve Bank, the commercial banks, the building societies and other deposit-receiving institutions, and I pointed out that the commercial banks were under the control of the Reserve Bank; the commercial banks follow the lead given by the Reserve Bank, but the other institutions do not do so with the result that these other institutions are paying higher rates of interest on deposits from the public and that they are growing out of all proportion to what their growth should be; and in the second place I want to point out that it puts a spoke in the wheel of State policy if the Reserve Bank gives a lead and only a percentage of the deposit-receiving institutions follow that lead while the rest do not do so. The figure that I mentioned last year was that at 30 June 1961 deposit-receiving institutions and building societies already had R344,000,000 more in deposits than all the commercial banks together. I said that this was an unsound position. Since that time the position has developed further, and in my opinion the figure to-day is no longer R344,000,000 but probably much more than R500,000,000, that is to say, the difference between deposits with those institutions and deposits with the banks. I want to add that if the deposit-receiving institutions and building societies had also reduced <span class="col_1061-1062" refersTo="page_0545"/>their rates of interest systematically, as the commercial banks have done, we would have been in a stronger position economically than we are to-day. There would have been more rapid development in the past six or nine months because there would have been more liquidity in the money market. What do we find? I have here the latest edition of the Reserve Bank&#x2019;s quarterly journal, the December edition, and there we find that the rate of interest charged by the commercial banks on overdrafts was 7 per cent on 15 May 1961 and it remained unchanged until 1 January 1962 when it was reduced to 6&#x00BD; per cent; on 1 July 1962 it was reduced to 6 per cent, and on 1 December last to 5&#x00BD; per cent. Over a period of 11 months therefore there was a reduction of 1&#x00BD; per cent. The rate was reduced on three occasions by a total of H per cent. In other words, the current rate of interest on bank overdrafts is 5&#x00BD; per cent. Take the building societies. As from 1 July 1961 their rate of interest was 7 per cent and per cent on loans other than housing loans. It was only on 1 October, ten months after the commercial banks had reduced their rates of interest the first time, that the building societies reduced theirs by only a half per cent to 6&#x00BD; per cent. What is the position to-day? One can get an ordinary bank overdraft at a full 1 per cent lower rate of interest than one can get a building society loan on a property. That is an unheard-of position. The sound position is that the rate of interest on a mortgage bond should always be lower than the rate of interest charged on a bank overdraft. But what do we find further? Building societies started to hold meetings and decided that they would like to accede to the request that they should also reduce their rates of interest, but they were afraid that the public would withdraw the money invested with them. Well, I do not blame them for being afraid of that because the other deposit-receiving institutions attract investments away from them by paying an even higher rate of interest. But to show the seriousness of this problem the building societies then decided to offer the public &#x00BD; per cent less on deposits. One building society&#x2014;I think the biggest in the country&#x2014;circulated their depositors and said that they proposed to offer a half per cent lower rate of interest but in terms of their articles of association they have to give notice of that fact. A large number of depositors then said that they refused to allow it, otherwise they would withdraw their deposits. The building societies got the fright of their lives and decided to rescind the decision which they had taken to reduce the rate of interest by a half per cent, and decided that every building society could do what it pleased. The result is that the rates of interest are not going to drop.</p>

<p>That brings me to the matter which I raised here last year. I asked the Minister whether something could not be done about this matter and whether we should not amend the Banking Act in such a way that deposit-receiving institutions, including building societies, will all fall under the Banking Act in this sense that they have to follow the lead given by the Reserve Bank with regard to rates of interest. The Minister said that this matter had been investigated by a technical committee. I understand that that committee drew up a draft Bill and circulated it to various parties and that there is a great deal of opposition. There are many people in this country who know the contents of that Bill, but we do not and we should like to know. In the first place, therefore, I would like to ask whether he will not allow us to peruse the Bill, and secondly I want to ask whether it is likely that we shall be able to put through that legislation this year, because I feel that here we are dealing with a matter where we have two trends in our economy. One is the lead that is given by the Treasury and the Reserve Bank and that is followed by the commercial banks, and the other is just a sort of contrarious policy that is followed by the financial institutions, and we should bring about the necessary co-ordination between these bodies. That is of the utmost importance, and I make an appeal to the Minister please to expedite this matter so that it can be disposed of this year still.</p>

<p>Then there is another matter that I want to raise. The other day, in his reply to the second-reading debate the Minister pointed out that the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) had read a newspaper report entirely incorrectly. Well, the hon. member did read it incorrectly, of course&#x2014;and I think he will admit that&#x2014;when he said that we were going to have a surplus of R45,000,000 this year. I just want to give him the correct position according to the latest figures that have been published. It appears from the <i>Government Gazette</i> of 11 January that the total State expenditure amounted to R594,000,000, in comparison with R523,000,000 the previous year for the nine months in question, and that the estimated total expenditure for the year is R799,550,000 In other words, more than R200,000,000 still has to be spent to make up the total amount that we voted. That is the expenditure. But over the same nine months revenue increased by only R40,000,000, from R479,000,000 to R519,000,000. The expenditure increased by R71,000.000. These are the figures that were available, and with these figures available the reporter of the local afternoon newspaper goes along and places a report which is entirely misleading, and that, of course, is the report which the hon. member for Green Point used. The reporter placed this report under a three-column headline, &#x201C;Hope of tax cuts; State has collected R45,000,000 more than it expected&#x201D;, and then the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The State has collected R45,000,000 more than it expected in the past financial year. The public paid R22,000,000 of this extra amount in direct taxation.</block>

<p>What does the writer of this article mean by &#x201C;the past financial year&#x201D;? To you, Mr. Speaker, and to me, it is clear, but it-was not clear to the hon. member for Green Point <span class="col_1063-1064" refersTo="page_0546"/>because he said it was this year. Then the report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the latest windfall &#x2026;</block>

<p>He is now talking about this R45,000,000&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; together with Dr. D&#x00F6;nges&#x2019; urgent appeal to spend more money indicates strongly that taxes will be reduced this year.</block>

<p>Then he refers to the so-called underestimates in the past, and only at the end of the report he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Auditor-General&#x2019;s Report for 1961-2 shows that merely by making an accurate estimate of revenue the Minister of Finance could let people off not only R22,000,000, but another R10,000,000 &#x2026;</block>

<p>I must refer to this report, because I wondered who was going to be the first person to put his foot into it and to misinterpret this report, and then it turned out to be the hon. member for Green Point who in 1948 was seriously Being considered for appointment as Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>But that is not all. This newspaper&#x2019;s chief sub-editor, who writes the headlines for their reports, published a few letters with reference to the same report, all of them indicating that these people believed that this year there was going to be a surplus of R45,000,000 and that there would be a reduction of taxation. One of the headlines read: &#x201C;Heads Should Roll for this R45,000,000 Blunder.&#x201D; The Minister pointed out the other day that if he had to budget for R45,000,000 less, he would have had a deficit of R28,000,000. That is the one report to which I want to refer to show that newspapers ought to be more careful when they write on financial matters and that they should try at least to understand what they are writing about. This misleading report aroused expectations in the minds of numerous voters. I have pointed out now that up to the end of December the expenditure already exceeded the expenditure in the previous year by about R71,000,000 while revenue was up by only about R40,000,000, so on the basis of the figures that were actually available there was no reason to expect such a thing.</p>

<p>But it is not only this one newspaper; here I have the Transvaal Afrikaans afternoon newspaper, in which there appears a report dated 18 January by their correspondent in the House of Assembly. Let me say at once that I have no fault to find with the report itself. Amongst other things he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The level of the Republic&#x2019;s finances and economy gives an encouraging picture of sustained progress in general, and sound prospects for the future, the State President stated in Cape Town to-day when he gave a general review in his Opening Speech of the country&#x2019;s development over the past year. The country&#x2019;s economic balance sheet with the outside world showed a very favourable trend during 1962, and the year could be concluded with foreign exchange reserves at a higher level than at any time during the preceding fifteen years&#x2026;. Resulting from, <i>inter alia,</i> a decrease of the Republic&#x2019;s foreign capital liability, the invisible items on current account will, it is expected, require considerably less foreign exchange during 1962 than the previous year, and the year&#x2019;s credit balance on current account will possibly be as much as R80,000,000 more than in the previous year.</block>

<p>All this is correct; it is precisely what the State President said, but now the report reaches Johannesburg and this newspaper&#x2019;s sub-editor, who is supposed to be a man with some knowledge of matters of this kind, prints it under a six-column headline which reads: &#x201C;R80,000,000 more predicted for Treasury.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, surely the Treasury has nothing to do with this matter. Here we have an additional R80,000,000 of currency available for foreign trade, but that has nothing to do with the Treasury. This person goes even further and this is what he writes in his summary&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A rosy future awaits the Republic of South Africa in the forthcoming year. Amongst other things, an increase of something like R80,000,000 is expected on current account, in comparison with last year&#x2019;s credit balance.</block>

<p>If words have any meaning, this means that there is going to be a surplus of R80,000,000 at the end of March on the Government&#x2019;s current expenditure account. In view of the fact that members of the public are very prone to pin their hopes and their expectations on this type of report&#x2014;and I speak from experience; I have already received a stack of letters in connection with this matter, in pursuance of the report that taxation is going to be reduced because of the fact that surplus is anticipated&#x2014;let us make an appeal in all friendliness to all our newspapermen to be careful as to what they write about the country&#x2019;s finances. This is a delicate matter which is easily influenced by pessimism or optimism. Let them please get persons to write the headlines who know something about the subject and who do not simply think up something and then publish all sorts of nonsense.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before coming to the subject I really want to discuss, I would like to suggest to the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) who has just sat down that the very eloquent warning he has just given the Press of the country with regard to their statements appertaining to the probable surplus might with much better force have been turned to the hon. the Minister of Information, because if ever a Minister requires a warning from his own side surely what happened over the week-end calls for such a warning, and one could well apply the strictures of the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) to this incident. We have become accustomed <span class="col_1065-1066" refersTo="page_0547"/>to realizing that the Minister of Information does not really appreciate the responsibilities of his Department in regard to the public statements he has to make on behalf of South Africa, but we understand that he is incapable of this fact. This week-end&#x2019;s fiasco, however, which affects not only our own Press but the world Press, I think, fully warrants his attention being directed to this particular warning.</p>

<p>Other than that, the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) went to considerable trouble with his apologetic explanations of the delays and uncertainties about which this side of the House has criticized the Government, particularly in regard to its border industry scheme. All he has done is to succeed in emphasizing the correctness of our main charge, the complete lack of forward planning on the part of the Government, their lack of appreciation of the responsibilities and the difficulties they will experience in moving forward in this new direction of remaking the face of and the economic life of South Africa on an ideological basis. We claim that the trouble has largely been the complete absence of planning and I think the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) with his excuses has merely emphasized these points. I think the Government&#x2019;s position with regard to that and the excuses made by the Minister of Finance in his reply to the second-reading debate have been so thoroughly debunked by speakers on this side that there is no need for me at this stage to carry that matter any further.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one or two matters arising out of the defence expenditure, but before touching on defence as such, I want to ask the Minister of Finance to give consideration to one point amongst the many others he has been asked to deal with. The Minister in his reply to the second reading showed that he was not unsympathetic towards the pensioners and he gave us an outline of the sympathetic treatment they have received over the past seven or eight years from this Government. There is no thought in my mind to belittle what has been done for the pensioners. Far be it from that. Also, there is no thought of minimizing the difficulties the Minister and the Government have to face in regard to this problem. But our argument is that what has been done is not enough and we claim that now is a suitable time to increase the tempo of that relief and to move forward with a far more comprehensive scheme for old age and similar social pensions which have lagged so far behind present-day living costs and money values that they are completely out of touch with reality. That was the gravamen of the criticism of this side of the House. I want to quote just one example to illustrate it.</p>

<p>Here in the Peninsula wage determinations brought about under the Government&#x2019;s wage legislation have laid down that the maximum old-age pension which can be received by a White man and his wife who are both qualified to draw a pension is about R24 a month. That is the maximum; the majority do not receive the maximum, and for the Africans and Coloureds it is much lower. I am sorry, I said wage determinations, but I meant the pension laws not wage determinations. Under the Government's labour legislation the wage determinations lay down that a minimum wage for an African unskilled worker is approximately R40 a month, just about breadline level and practically double the old-age pension for a White man and his wife. This example shows that the level of pensions has fallen right out of touch with reality. The wage determination is an attempt to keep wages in touch with reality and we have to try to bring our pensions somewhere within approachable distance of that. Whilst the Minister is in such a sympathetic mood, I want to plead the case of a very special group of people. They are relatively small in numbers, owing to age, but they are a group of people who well deserve the best we can give them. I refer to the men and women who draw the old-age pension as war veterans&#x2019; pensions for service to South Africa in the First World War. When the Government and Parliament approved of the special concessions which we gave to the survivors of the Anglo-Boer War on both sides, whereby the means test would not be applicable in their case, they established both a principle and a precedent which won the instant approval of the whole of South Africa. It is the principle that any man who fights for his country merits special treatment from his country in the closing years of his life. Not only men but women also. This is one of the things on which I can claim that everyone unites in supporting, irrespective of politics. I believe it is time for that principle and precedent to take the next logical step forward and be extended to First World War veterans. I believe that consideration should now be given to at least the older group of the war veterans from the First World War, many of whom in their advancing age are now suffering from the hardships and privations they experienced when they fought under appalling conditions in the 191418 war. Many of them are drawing pensions, but they are handicapped by the means test. I believe it is time that at least those of a particular age level, say 65 or some other age which the Minister feels justified, should be granted a similar exemption from the means test as we applied to their comrades from the Anglo-Boer War. There cannot be a great number of them left and unhappily, due to the ravages of age, the number of pensioners from the Anglo-Boer War to whom it applies is steadily declining. I believe the Minister would find widespread support if he made such a concession in his new budget. Last March, at the request of the Minister of Defence, Parliament approved of additional defence expenditure of just over R48,000,000, a 68 per cent increase on the Defence Vote. The Minister told us in the Appropriation Bill debate that share dealings under the arbitrage scheme had resulted in a further R1, 600,000 for the Defence Fund, making it approximately <span class="col_1067-1068" refersTo="page_0548"/>R50,000,000 altogether. Surely if to-day we can find those amounts to guarantee the security of the Republic against aggression, we can also afford to find the relatively insignificant amount required to honour our obligations to those men and women who fought for South Africa in the First World War and to guarantee their security in their old age. I would like to commend that to the Minister when he considers his budget and to ask him to add not only sympathy but boldness to his vision when he deals with the matter.</p>

<p>I now want to pass over to the question of defence itself. When the Minister of Finance presented his Budget last March he described it as essentially a defence budget. When he introduced it on 22 March last he concluded his speech by saying: &#x201C;This is a budget of national security. Defence is at once its dominant theme and its ultimate justification.&#x201D; Later he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I do not say that our national security is actively threatened now, but I say that it will very soon be unless we are strong enough to deter a potential aggressor.</block>

<p>When he presented that Budget the Minister provided for R120,000,000 for defence, 67 per cent higher than in the previous Budget. Actually it was the highest defence budget in the history of the country, not even excluding the war years. I think it is as well briefly to remind the country of the responsibilities which that budget imposed on the public. The abolition of the 10 per cent discount on the normal tax increased the normal income-tax of the average family man by 10 per cent and took roughly R10,000,000 away from the people. It also abolished the benefit of certain concessions in the Companies&#x2019; Tax which took another R4,000,000. It helped to push up the cost of living by imposing extra duties on petrol and oil, which in turn meant a general increase in the cost of living. To meet defence requirements, the Minister took R14,300,000 by way of increased duties on liquor, including an increase in the price of beer. Increased taxation on records amounted to R100,000 and it increased the cost of reading and books. In the family home the budget pushed up the cost of prams. It meant dearer candles for the poor. All these may seem small items, but they are relatively important to the families concerned. Overall the taxpayer had to provide R40,000,000 extra, including the underestimated R5,000,000 to which the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) referred. Defence expenditure also has an impact on this Part Appropriation of R241,000,000. What we want to ask both the hon. Ministers of Defence and Finance is: What are we getting and what have we got for last year&#x2019;s defence budget of R120,000,000? I do not intend asking a lot of detailed questions, but I believe it is a matter which calls for a statement by the Minister of Defence, to tell the taxpaper what progress has been made towards substantiating the claim of the Minister of Finance that defence was at once the dominant theme and the ultimate justification of the Budget. Perhaps the Minister will give us some information to support that claim of justification. Particularly, what is our position to-day with regard to meeting the external aggression referred to by the hon. the Minister of Finance? Since that budget was passed there have been tremendous changes in the world, changes which involve South Africa from every aspect. We want to know what we have got and what we are getting for last year&#x2019;s Budget. Tell the taxpayers what progress has been made towards substantiating the claim that we are going to provide security for the future of the country, and particularly what steps have been taken, if any, with regard to forming any external alliances so as to get a combined defence organization which must increase our security. Since those statements were made by the Minister of Finance there has been a judgment given by the World Court stating that court is competent to deal with the South West Africa question. There have been events to the north of us, in the Congo, in Katanga and in Rhodesia. There has been a growing demand in UN for action against us. There has been the recent important statement by the Secretary-General of UNO regarding the decision to boycott us. There are events and pressures in Angola and Portuguese East Africa, all a sure indication that the pincers are slowly but inexorably closing on South Africa. We should know more about these things because they affect our security. It is more than ever necessary for the Government to keep the country informed and reassured regarding the progress and the sufficiency of what is being done to guarantee the security of South Africa, particularly in regard to the potential aggressors mentioned by the Minister of Finance. You see, apart from its repeated appeal that we must stand together to meet the dangers threatening South Africa, the Government has done little to acquaint the people of the Republic regarding the nature or the extent of the steps actually being taken or as to what positive steps they are actually taking to avert these dangers without the necessity of fighting against them. It is true that the Prime Minister has given the people of South West Africa an assurance that the Republic will support South West Africa under certain eventualities. We would like to know from the South African side what he has committed us to, and I have not the slightest doubt that the people of South West Africa would like to know what the value of that assurance really is to them and what lies behind the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement. He has committed the country, not the Government but the South African Republic, and I think the South African Republic has the right to know from the Prime Minister what he has committed us to. Sir, I have said that the demands of national security impose a considerable restraint on the hon. the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Defence as to what they can actually say; they are not free agents to say just what they like, and one accepts that. But even with that necessary <span class="col_1069-1070" refersTo="page_0549"/>limitation there is still a very wide scope regarding the information which the hon. the Minister can give to satisfy the fully justifiable request of the South African public to be told what value they are getting for the money that is being spent on defence. You see, Sir, the public have a very personal interest in this matter. Their own security and that of their family rests upon adequate defences. Under our system of a conscripted Defence Force limited to White South Africans, it is the White taxpayers&#x2019; sons and daughters who have to man the fighting lines, in the air, on the sea and on the land in case of trouble. It is the taxpayer in any case who has to pay the hard cash that is needed for an adequate Defence Force and it is the taxpayer also who will have to bear the costs of any failure in that respect, both in cash and in life. During the past year the public have been bewildered by the multiplicity of public statements&#x2014; statements made on the South African defence supplies of equipment, particularly in regard to the air arm of our defences. The majority of these reports undoubtedly were unofficial; some were obviously inspired; others emanated from sections and officials in the Government not associated with the defence organization. Some were later contradicted and some were just allowed to go into orbit without comment at all, all of them further bewildering South Africa as to just what is happening with regard to defence. The public have the right to know whether they are getting an adequate defence. The hon. the Minister also has a paramount responsibility. As Minister of Defence it is his duty to keep the nation satisfied with regard not only to the sufficiency but the efficiency of our defence organization and our ability to maintain those defences both in time of peace and in time of war&#x2014;not only maintain them as regards the weapons we have received but in many cases where the equipment and machines that we are receiving require the nuclear type of munitions he must satisfy the country that he will be able to get those supplies in time of hostilities, that we will not have a Defence Force with its teeth drawn. The Minister should make a statement as to what it has been possible to do with regard to our Air Force as far as aircraft and equipment are concerned, both for defence, and if necessary, for attack against an aggressor. The country would like to have it cleared up once and for all whether or not we are getting the French Mirage jets. I know that the Minister made a statement of sorts in that regard in the Other Place; but we have had half a dozen differing statements in the Press, and we would like to have something definite. There has been so much mystery about this matter that I doubt whether except for one or two right at the top anybody really knows just what is happening to-day. Sir, can we be assured that adequate supplies of spares and replacements and, even more important, adequate reserves of munitions for these particular aircraft and other weapons are being supplied to us? Those of us who have been fortunate enough to see them have been impressed by the increased mobility given to our defences by the new transport planes that we are receiving, but it is quite obvious that those planes will require an air-cover defence if they are ever to be used under hostility conditions. Can we be satisfied that that requirement has been foreseen and dealt with?</p>

<p>There is the question of the ballot and the call-up, a question which has affected practically 90 per cent of our homes in South Africa. I think after a year&#x2019;s experience of that system, the hon. the Minister owes some sort of explanation to the country as to whether the Government is satisfied or not with this system. Is this scheme working correctly and satisfactorily? How many ballotees, how many conscripts, have we been able to call up? What is the Government&#x2019;s policy with regard to numbers? Sir, you will remember that when the scheme was first discussed the call-up was going to be on a sliding scale, the numbers gradually increasing as the facilities and as the instructors became available. I understand that the first call-up was in the region of 10,000. Undoubtedly there must be teething trouble in a scheme of this sort. Nobody expects perfection from the start. Undoubtedly also the scheme has worked reasonably well under the circumstances, but the fathers and mothers of those boys and of the boys still to be called up would like a statement from the hon. Minister on the lesson of the year&#x2019;s experience and what is proposed to be done to improve matters or to rectify any deficiencies which may have become apparent.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the gymnasiums which justifiably have a magnificent record. There has been some criticism of the method of selecting entrants to the gymnasiums. There is a very heavy demand for admission to the gymnasiums, far in excess of their capacity. I suppose that some criticism by those rejected is inevitable, but there again I think the Minister owes a duty to the country to acquaint it with what has happened and what steps are being taken in order to overcome these difficulties. Let me quote just one instance. How is it possible for a trainee who has applied for admission to the gymnasium, a trainee who has a magnificent record of cadet service in his school, who has moved up into the officers&#x2019; group, who is physically fit in every respect, who has the highest testimonials of military service as a cadet, and who has expressed the desire to carry on into the Permanent Force of the Republic as a profession&#x2014;how is it possible for such a lad to be refused entry to the gymnasium and for a friend of his, who does not desire to go into the Permanent Force, who has never taken the slightest interest in the cadet movement, who has shown no military aptitude of any sort, who is in the same group and in the same area, to be selected and entered in a gymnasium? These are things which are rankling in the public mind, and I believe that the Minister will be doing a service to the gymnasiums and to defence by clarifying the <span class="col_1071-1072" refersTo="page_0550"/>position and satisfying the country that there will not be a recurrence of these things. Maybe you cannot prevent it when it happens the first time, but if it happens a second time then it is time to know something about it.</p>

<p>Then there is the tremendous double procedure and time-delay in applying for exemption and deciding upon applications for exemption. Here again I believe that the hon. the Minister would satisfy the country and improve matters if he included in a general statement some information in that regard and told us whether it is not possible to simplify the procedure. I wonder whether the Minister could tell us whether he has received representations re these delays from certain educational authorities, who put up what appeared to be a pretty sound scheme, which would probably halve the time taken to deal with these exemptions. At the present time a lad is kept in uncertainty for about five or six months when the situation could be cleared up within a month or two. The procedure should be revised and the general overall delay should be reduced. There are other points, I believe, which can be dealt with with regard to the Navy and to the Defence Force as a whole&#x2014; the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. Are steps being taken to meet what must be an inevitable demand which provides the hard core for the training of our thousands of trainees as well as manning the new equipment and machines we are obtaining to increase the size of the Permanent Force. With the increased size of the Republic&#x2019;s Defence Force with the number of trainees we are dealing with, with the new weapons that are coming forward, with the year-by-year call-up of trainees it is imperative that the hard core of the Permanent Force should be increased. At the present moment a large number of the naval personnel are overseas to fetch the three new ships. They are rightly taking advantage of their stay in England to go through certain courses, which will be of benefit to this country. As the result of this a much larger number of trainees have to be used to keep the ships remaining in the South African waters in operation at the moment. Well and good; nobody objects to that, it is only natural, but that state cannot continue as the new ships take up their positions on the station and we have to man them. These ships are solid masses of scientific instruments; they have electronic equipment from bow to stern; they require highly specialized knowledge and experience. You cannot put in trainees for nine months and then expect them to adequately handle that sort of equipment. These ships will have to be manned by permanent people. Are we taking adequate steps in time to increase the permanent complement of the Navy? The same thing applies to the air arm and to the land forces. You cannot make a cake without breaking eggs, and we cannot build up our defences unless you are prepared to foot the bill for it. If footing the bill also means a substantial increase in the cost of our permanent defence, then the country must be prepared to pay that bill or to accept that a large proportion of the money we are spending on the trainee scheme and our new equipment is so much money wasted. You bring a chap up to a certain stage of perfection: then he completes his training period and goes off. In the next two years he has two periods of training of ten days or a fortnight each. Sir, in 12 months the whole technique of warfare changes, as the hon. the Minister knows. Even whilst a piece of equipment is in the process of being built, while a ship is being built, the cost may be increased by 50 per cent because of advances made by science in that period. The same thing applies in the training of officers and men. In order to keep them trained we must have the necessary resources in equipment and experienced instructors. In order to do that, you must have a sufficiently large permanent force, experienced and trained in the things that count.</p>

<p>I think the time at my disposal is almost exhausted so I am not going to deal with other matters but I would urge the hon. the Minister to make a general statement on these points. I am not asking for State secrets to be disclosed. Nobody wants to jeopardize the defences of our country but there is a reasonable limit to which the Minister can and should go to satisfy the country.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) complained at the beginning of his speech that we had allegedly not replied to him in this debate on the question as to what the Government proposes to do for the Witwatersrand. I do not propose to deal with that portion of his speech at length, but I just want to say that I cannot understand how anyone can believe that the Government is neglecting that area when it was announced only last year that in the next few years Iscor alone is going to spend no less than R560,000,000 on its own expansion and development. The vast bulk of that money is going to be spent in that area. Have hon. members forgotten that an announcement was made here last year in connection with the tremendous expansion of the chemical industry in that area? Are hon. members of the Opposition not aware of all the millions that the Department of Defence is spending at this moment to give an enormous fillip to the manufacturing industry in that area by manufacturing as much as possible of our own arms and ammunition here? These are all things which are being done to build up that area. I cannot understand how anybody can say that no attention is being given to that area. A very great deal of attention is being given to it. The question is, having regard to what that area can carry in the future, whether too much attention is not being given to it; whether we shall ever be able to carry that expansion later on.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say anything else in that connection. The hon. member elaborated first of all on the size of the defence budget and he then asked this question: <span class="col_1073-1074" refersTo="page_0551"/>&#x201C;But what are we getting for that expenditure?&#x201D; The hon. member said that it was my duty to tell the public what we were in fact getting for that expenditure and he then asked whether we were getting certain types of aircraft. I want to ask the hon. member whether he did not read the news item in the Press only this morning that pressure is being brought to bear on Great Britain and France at a certain conference in Africa not to provide South Africa with arms? Does the hon. member want me to embarrass countries which sell weapons to us, even before those weapons are delivered? What could we achieve by doing so? I am prepared to take into my confidence a few members on the other side nominated by the Leader of the Opposition and a few members whom we will nominate on our side and to show them what we are purchasing and how much we are purchasing, but at this stage when all these threats are being made against countries which provide us with weapons, I cannot play into the hands of the countries which have uttered these threats. The Opposition has been trying since last year to get me to tell them which countries are supplying us with arms. I cannot imagine for a moment what the Opposition wants to do with that information. What is the object of it? Do they want to make the position as difficult as possible for the countries which sell arms to us? I cannot imagine that the hon. member for Simonstown would be so irresponsible as to expect us to make the position more and more difficult for those countries which provide us with arms. The hon. member for Simonstown was my guest the other day and there he saw some of the equipment that we purchased for the millions that we spent last year, and I do not think that what we showed him was a poor example of what we have purchased. As a military man he ought to know what the things that he saw there will mean to us. These things will be disclosed step by step once the contracts have been carried out, but even after the contracts have been carried out it would be in very bad taste on my part, if we receive weapons of a certain kind from a particular country, to announce to the world, even after the contract has been carried out, &#x201C;Look what country A sold to us; look what country B sold to us&#x201D;. At this moment I have in South Africa a weapon of particularly great value that was sold to us by a certain country, a country which had stated that it would never sell a single weapon to us. Not only did that country sell that weapon to us but it forced us to take 25 per cent more than we had asked for, otherwise we could not get a licence to manufacture it here. What would I gain by revealing the name of that country? Why should I make the position of that country more difficult? It has its own problems. Why should I aggravate its problems by revealing this type of thing? I informed this House last year that there was nothing whatsoever in the sphere of defence that we wished to buy and that we could afford that we could not obtain, and I want to emphasize that again to-day. There is nothing at all that we want to buy and that we can afford that we cannot buy in the sphere of defence. I say again that I am not prepared to disclose the names of these countries which are selling these things to me, and even if the Opposition develops a feeling of mistrust because of this, then I cannot help it. I do not propose to disclose the names of those countries, firstly because it would be unfair to them and secondly because it would be unfair to South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member wanted to know how we were progressing with this nine-month scheme. Let me say to the hon. member and to the House that if all my efforts in connection with defence were as successful as the nine-month ballotee scheme, then I can give the assurance that within a short space of time South Africa&#x2019;s defences will be in a very excellent condition. Nothing could be more successful. I have my problems, of course. This scheme was introduced for the first time last year. I too am very concerned over these problems and we are trying to devise plans to expedite the notices or the postings so that ballotees will be able to know earlier, if possible, whether they are going to be posted or not. But I want to give hon. members the assurance that there are many problems connected with it.</p>

<p>The other question is whether we should not increase the strength of our Permanent Force and reduce the strength of our Citizen Force. I want to tell the hon. member that South Africa has never yet been able to afford to build up a Permanent Force which is so strong that the entire defence of South Africa can be entrusted to it.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>The point I made was that with the expansion that we are getting on the trainee side, plus the new weapons and the new ships and aircraft that we are going to get, it will also be essential to expand the hard core of the Permanent Force in order to be able to take full advantage of the new equipment, new ships, etc., that we are getting. We cannot expect to get along with trainees only.</p>

<p>*The MINISTER OF DEFENCE; That is so self-evident that I did not think that that was what the hon. member meant, because the hon. member asked whether the money that we were spending on ballotees was being wasted. But I accept the hon. member&#x2019;s explanation. However, I just want to say that as far as our Permanent Force is concerned the number of approved posts has been increased <span class="col_1075-1076" refersTo="page_0552"/>by approximately 50 per cent. Naturally we cannot build up the Citizen Force and naturally we cannot train so many more ballotees without also increasing the strength of the Permanent Force and, moreover, since we are now expanding our Air Force so tremendously, it goes without saying that the Permanent Force section of the Air Force must also be expanded rapidly, and that is being done. In general I just want to say that since last year we have had additional posts approved to expand our Permanent Force by approximately 50 per cent. I hope the hon. member is not going to ask me how much 50 per cent is.</p>

<p>I think I have now replied more or less to all the points raised by the hon. member, but I just want to say that at this stage I cannot tell the public what we have purchased, but I am prepared to disclose that information to a few members on that side nominated by the Leader of the Opposition and also to a few members on this side. I issue that standing invitation this afternoon.</p>

<p>There being a time limit to this debate the hon. the Minister will understand if I do not respond to his address this afternoon. I want to come back to matters economic. I would like to deal with some of the remarks of the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever); I am sorry to see that he is not here. I do not intend dealing with that part of his speech which contained the &#x201C;warning Waring theme&#x201D; about inaccurate announcements to the Press, but I do want to come back to the remarks he made about an inquiry which has been carried out by a committee appointed by the hon. the Minister. I would like to support his representations and his plea that the report of that committee should be printed and made available to members of this House. I myself think that he would have been wise to have stopped there. He then went on to propound certain views which he held in regard to how the question of deposits between various financial institutions should be regulated. My own feeling about the matter, of course, is that the money market is well left to be regulated by the laws of economics rather than by the laws of Parliament, and I would not like to see further regimentation in regard to currency matters. What is, of course, very essential is that there should be security in different types of financial institutions and that there should be an equitable arrangement by which the investing public have adequate security in all types of financial institutions. I would, however, not like to take the matter as far as the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) did, except to support his plea that a report of the committe of inquiry should be printed and made available to members of this House.</p>

<p>Sir, anyone listening to hon. members opposite during the second-reading debate on this Part Appropriation Bill might conclude that the country&#x2019;s economy is stronger now than it has ever been before. Another word of caution would therefore not be out of place at this stage of the discussion. Admittedly&#x2014;and let me add mercifully&#x2014;the wheels of industry are turning faster now than they did in lune 1962 when the last parliamentary session ended. Reference has already been made to that and we have indicated that it is admittedly an advantage. There has also been an impressive building up of funds in the hands of banks and other financial institutions. But I think it would be wise before coming to any such conclusion about the matter to remember that the improvement in trade is essentially a recovery, and again I say a merciful recovery. From an alarming slowing down of trade during the first half of 1962. I naturally welcome the recovery, but I would welcome it very much more if there was any indication on the part of the Government that it itself had trust in that recovery. The hon. the Minister was concerned about imponderables, but I would mention to him two matters which do not fall within the category of the imponderables which are apparently a bogyman to the hon. Minister. I say that if the Government really believes that there has been a return of investor confidence and itself has trust that the rate of recovery which we have been witnessing would continue, then of course the duty of the Government and the hon. the Minister is to remove completely or by progressive steps the arbitrary import and exchange control which are still in operation. Those are the tests of the Government&#x2019;s own faith and trust in the economic recovery and in what the hon. the Minister speaks of as a return of investor confidence. You see, Sir, so long as those controls remain in operation, they give a wholly artificial slant to the state of our economy, and that is the state of affairs which is not healthy or satisfactory from the investor&#x2019;s point of view. I have said before in this House and others have said too that those arbitrary control measures are largely self-defeating and must in the long run prove to be more harmful than helpful to the economy and to industrial growth. That is my word of caution to those hon. members opposite who go on trying to imply that the country&#x2019;s economic health has never been better than it is now and who still delude themselves that boom days are here again. In support of my statement that control measures are more harmful than helpful to the economy, I in turn choose to quote what was said in this House not from these benches but by the Minister&#x2019;s predecessor in office who said this in July 1958 when introducing the 1958-9 Budget: He was justifying the imposition of certain monetary reforms and then he went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I feel it my duty to point out that while import control may well at times and under exceptional circumstances be necessary to bridge the gap until the more fundamental measures can have the desired effect, it cannot permanently solve our problems, but can only suppress them at the risk of rising prices and costs.</block>

<block name="quote">Apart from these considerations, we cannot afford to ignore the changed international <span class="col_1077-1078" refersTo="page_0553"/>attitude in regard to import control. A few years ago import control was still fashionable, but to-day it is widely regarded as a stop-gap to which resort is taken by Governments who are either unable to appreciate the long-term harmful effects of quantitative restrictions on imports, or who lack the courage to introduce more fundamental measures which are designed to remove the real causes of the disequilibrium in the balance of payments. In these circumstances exclusive reliance on import control casts a reflection on a country&#x2019;s credit standing and under present conditions both the International Bank and the International Monetary Fund look with disfavour on the intensification of import control for the solution of balance of payments problems.</block>

<p>That, Sir, was four years ago, and meanwhile artificial distortion has been made the greater by reason of the fact that exchange control has been intensified. Currency control which operates under this Minister&#x2019;s Department is being applied more rigidly, more restrictively, at present than it was in July 1958. The slamming of the door in June 1961 against the transfer of capital funds of the external investor remains a drastic step, notwithstanding the slight modifications which have been made and in which the Minister found some comfort when he spoke. The remarks to which I have referred are very much the same as those of the hon. member for Constantia during the second reading. There was a statement of emergency which obviously called for emergency measures. But if the situation is as described by the hon. the Minister the time has come to remove these arbitrary restrictions and to allow the economic scene to take its true perspective and to be seen in its true light. Until the hon. the Minister realizes that neither import control nor exchange control is a substitute to investor confidence, the true state of our economy will remain artificially obscure. That is why I feel as I do, namely that there should be a revision of this aspect of the matter. So long as these controls remain, the corner around which boom days are waiting will remain what it is&#x2014;a make-believe corner.</p>

<p>There is, however, another circumstance which is disturbing to the current economic scene. It is a form of disruption which can only get worse, not better, under this Government&#x2019;s policies. You see, Sir, upsets in the labour field are not entirely new or of recent origin but they have certainly been getting steadily worse. The position is rapidly developing in which a labour crisis will have to be faced. When the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) spoke during the no-confidence debate at the beginning of this Session he said that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council had warned him that a serious bottleneck to the &#x201C;round-the-corner-boom&#x201D; would be the shortage of skilled labour. I understood the hon. the Prime Minister by way of interjection to say in effect that there was a similar shortage of skilled labour in the United Kingdom. Sir, the dilemma which is facing this country cannot be overcome by a remark of that kind. It is no solution to our problem to gloat over another country having the same sort of problem, even if that problem were similar to ours. I myself, however, do not believe that the two problems are in fact similar. According to a United Kingdom Government White Paper issued during December 1962, the difficulty which is being encountered there is largely a technological problem. It is in fact the problem of keeping up with modern technical and technological progress in industry. In the United Kingdom the authorities are faced with a long-term problem: the difficulty of keeping pace in so highly a developed economy with an adequate supply of trained personnel who are skilled in modern technological changes. The shortage there, Sir, is a shortage of quality and not of quantity, and there, of course, the plan of action is to improve and speed up training in technological skills. With us, Sir, the problem is a shortage of quantity as well as of quality, hence the warnings which the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Economic Advisory Council issued. They issued the first warning in October 1962 when they expressed this view&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the rate of development reaches a high level again, as we all desire, a shortage of capital may develop again, but the consensus is that a shortage of managerial talent, skilled labour, scientists and technical knowhow in general will seriously hamper economic development before this stage is reached. It is therefore desirable that both the Government and private enterprise should constantly endeavour to solve these vital problems.</block>

<p>In December 1962 the Economic Advisory Council took a more general stand and said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although it is thus not expected that the balance of payments will constitute a limiting factor in regard to development during 1963, it is the unanimous view of the Council that once the cumulative effect of the announced capital schemes in the private and public sectors is felt to an increasing extent, a scarcity of workers in the various occupations will tend to retard development.</block>

<p>Sir, we had even more recent evidence of that. Only last week Mr. J. S. Marais, the managing director of Trust Bank, gave a similar warning. He also pointed out that there was this serious bottle-neck and a serious shortage of labour which would greatly retard development in the country.</p>

<p>The question is, Sir, how did we land in, this parlous position under this regime? Time will not permit me to go into all the various facets as to why we are in this parlous position, but it is mainly due to this Government&#x2019;s bad handling of the immigration position. <span class="col_1079-1080" refersTo="page_0554"/>Until quite recently the Government turned its back on the immigrants. It is true, belatedly, it has now changed its attitude and it tries to smile at them. But much more than that is needed if we are to succeed in attracting skilled manpower to South Africa. The Minister of Immigration&#x2014;and I regret he is not here&#x2014;admittedly went abroad towards the end of last year to make some investigations about the matter. I have no doubt that he must have met some of the same surprises which I did. At The Hague in Holland I was surprised to find that the Australian Government occupied a very large building entirely for that section of its embassy which was concerned with immigration. Inquiries revealed that they employed up to 200 people on their immigration section alone. Admittedly there has been a slowing down during 1962 and there has been a reduction, but the reduction still left a staff complement of well over 100 in the immigration section alone. I believe I am correct in saying&#x2014;and had the Minister been here he could have corrected me if I were wrong&#x2014;that our staff at The Hague consist of three persons. I make this remark not to belittle the work of those three persons. I have not the slightest doubt that they are doing an admirable job and that they are doing all and whatever they can. But I do mention it to show what is involved in carrying out in earnest an effective and successful immigration drive on the Continent. I will find it very difficult to try to get a balance between something over 100 people for Australia and only three for South Africa, if we really are earnest in our endeavours to attract immigrants.</p>

<p>As I have indicated before, Sir, most of the problems which are related to this labour crisis which is rapidly developing are associated with the restrictive legislation and controlling legislation on our Statute Book. This is not the time or the place to try to deal with those many arbitrary devices which are enforced by this Government to keep unskilled labour on the run, because that is the effect of much of that legislation. And it is that which is creating these bottle-necks of quantity in the free development of private enterprise. I said last year, and I repeat, that our economy has become entangled in a network of arbitrary control. It is entangled in controls which affect finance, commerce, land and labour. They are all designed, for political purposes. The Minister himself admitted as much in his reply to the second-reading debate. Sir, authoritarian rule and free enterprise have no affinity. Like oil and water they do not and will not mix.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_information">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF INFORMATION</person>:</from>

<p>Surely hon. members opposite must be getting tired of listening to these prophets of doom.</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. member who has just sat down and I thought to myself that if there were any American investor in the galleries of this House listening to him talk about the economic position of South Africa, or our future, or our prospects, he would not invest a penny In this country. But fortunately, Mr. Speaker, the people who control investment in South Africa are not hon. members on that side of the House. A statement was made a short while ago by a Mr. Randall, a man who is critical of South Africa. He had some very nasty things to say but this was what he had to say about the economic future of South Africa. I quote from the <i>Argus</i> of 8 February. The heading is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">United States Economic Export: Bright Future for South Africa. Mr. Randall, former chairman of Inland Steel of America and a former economic adviser to presidents Truman and Eisenhower who visited South Africa recently as a guest of the South African Foundation said in a recent issue of <i>Dunn's Review</i>: &#x201C;I recommend South Africa to the consideration of the American investor &#x201D;.</block>

<p>Will the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) ever attract a penny to South Africa with his kind of remarks? Listen to this. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Republic has 50 per cent of all the vehicles and telephones on the Continent generates two-thirds of the electric energy and operates more than 50 per cent of all the road transport. Its people have 30 per cent of the total income. In <i>per capita</i> terms, this is three times that of Ghana and five times that of Nigeria.</block>

<p>He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;However, the idea that an American business man in the Republic must be prepared to live in a constant state of tension&#x201D; Mr. Randall said &#x201C;was a great distortion of the truth&#x201D;&#x2026; Many a Native, happy in his job, will tell you that the White man, as he knows him. is at least honest, unlike the position in other parts of Africa the non-White knows where he stands and his standard of living is the highest on the Continent. Mr. Randall wrote that he did not believe that a period of armed revolution, so often talked about in American newspapers, was at hand for the Republic.</block>

<p>All I want to point out to the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) is that this Mr. Randall is a critic of South Africa but this is what he had to say that as far as the economic field is concerned. That comes from an American, but do you think we can get anything like that from a member of the Opposition in South Africa? All we have are prophets of doom and Jeremiahs. We are tired of those prophet of doom stories, but what amazes me is that the Opposition members are not sick of it. When I watched the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) just now I thought to myself: &#x201C;You must also really be getting tired of this</p>

<p>I now want to come to the charges laid by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). I do not want to misquote what he said <span class="col_1081-1082" refersTo="page_0555"/>but I gather that he considers that the Press conference was a fiasco. He used the word &#x201C;fiasco&#x201D; and he used it in that sense. He said it would take a long time before the English Press would again believe me. He said I was a complete failure as a Minister. The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) said I needed a warning from my own side. I was just waiting for him to advise the hon. the Prime Minister to sack me from the Cabinet. Do you know why, Sir? Because it is always the Opposition who want to pick the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to govern this country. They want to nominate the Cabinet every time; only the Cabinet which they pick will be good enough. I also ask myself this question what is eating up the hon. member for Constantia. What is eating up the hon. member for Simonstown. I will answer that question. Whenever the hon. the Minister of Labour is attacked or myself as Minister of Information, I know what is behind it. They are the only people who can ever talk for the English-speaking people of South Africa! Only they can voice any opinion which can be classified as being the opinion of the English-speaking section in this country. [Interjections.] You know, Sir, it amazes me that those people can never take anything. It was the hon. member of Constantia, when he referred to the hon. the Minister of Labour and myself, referred to us as &#x201C;two minor politicians&#x201D;. He only is the sort of person that should be speaking for the English-speaking people and who should be in the Cabinet. I feel sorry for him and I feel sorry for the hon. member for Simonstown. I feel sorry for the hon. member for Constantia because, after all, he has reached high places in the Government of this country. He was Minister of Finance; he was Minister of Transport. He is a very disappointed man to-day. The hon. member of Simonstown is the shadow Minister of Defence. He is also a disappointed man because he will always remain a shadow. What it amounts to is this. Sir. When hon. members refer to this particular Bill which has been Gazetted, their attitude is that nothing good must be said about South Africa.</p>

<p>I will. They do not even mind if it is untrue or if it is a lie but they will still defend it. I want to give you an example, Sir. The hon. the Minister of Justice referred to certain correspondence he had had with Mrs. Bertha Solomon dealing with articles she had written overseas as a columnist in English newspapers in Canada to discredit the South African Government. She had written articles which were palpably untrue. She had written that the death penalty under the Sabotage Act shall be inflicted. She also said that the onus had been shifted from the Crown to the accused; that there had been a complete change of the rule of law in South Africa. Both statements were completely untrue but what happened? When Minister Vorster raised the matter she said she had been misled. She was misled by hon. members on that side of the House. What did they do? Immediately it became a question of defending South Africa they were more anxious to come to her defence. [Interjections.] You heard the hon. member for Constantia who talks behind his hand all the time. You heard what he said. He had read the <i>Argus</i> and he resented it that the <i>Argus</i> should ever say anything positive about legislation or proposed legislation&#x2014;not even legislation. Instead of what the <i>Argus</i> had written he would like to see this sort of thing. This comes from Durban: &#x201C;Bantu Bill reminiscent of</p>

<p>Slavery&#x201D;. I think this comes from Mr. Leo Boyd who is the leader of the Progressive Party in Natal. Mr. Boyd said it was the &#x201C;most inhuman piece of legislation made for the people of South Africa&#x201D;. This was the criticism of the Progressive Party leader Mr. Boyd. He said &#x201C;It is an utter disregard of the human rights of millions of people&#x201D;, Dr. Bernard Friedman, another great political friend of the hon. member for Constantia said &#x201C;The Government&#x2019;s new measure would lead the country still further on the road to disaster&#x201D;. That is the type of comment they like to see in the English Press. The hon. member for Constantia wants to divide the English-speaking people and the Afrikaans-speaking people because that is the only way he can politically exist. He goes further. He is determined that the English Press in South Africa should only play a role which is critical of and negative to the Government of the country. And if a newspaper does not take the line which he wants it to take, then, of course, it is something very bad and I as Minister am responsible for it. The hon. member for Constantia gave me credit of saying that I had not read the Bill and I admitted that to the Press conference. I want to ask the hon. member for Constantia and the hon. member for Simonstown whether they have read the Bill? I was at least honest to admit it to the Press conference but those hon. members are not honest with themselves. They will not even now admit across the floor of this House that they have not read the Bill. Where do those hon. members get this information from?</p>

I now want to give to the House the true position.</p>

<p>The Bill was not introduced into this House on Thursday or Friday and we are not to-day having the second reading of the Bill.

<block name="quote">The Department of Bantu Administration and Development to-day in the <i>Government Gazette</i> published the Bantu Legislation Amendment Bill which in many respects has been prompted by the same spirit which gave rise to &#x201C;White&#x201D; liquor being made freely available to Bantu, and to the abrogating of various restrictions concerning the brewing of Bantu beer.</block>

<p>It goes on to say that this voluminous piece of legislation affects nine Acts and envisages the following&#x2014;and then it gives the aims of the Bill. It talks about the revision of legislation, the elimination of obsolete and overlapping provisions, it mentions relief for the <i>bona fide</i> Bantu worker, and refers to the revision and simplification of administration, and then it says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Deficiencies which have so far existed in the efficient control of Bantu outside the Bantu homelands, both in urban and rural areas, are being supplemented by this legislation to ensure that Bantu will pass through the approved avenues to the White areas there to sell their labour.</block>

<p>Hon. members may not agree that that is right, they may have other ideas&#x2014;the Progressive Party regards this as leading to slavery, but there it is &#x201C;to sell their labour&#x201D;. It goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In addition the Bill envisages stricter action in proper cases against employers who do not observe control measures.</block>

<p><span class="col_1085-1086" refersTo="page_0557"/>&#x201C;Stricter action&#x201D;, Then it says&#x2014;</p>

I never described the clauses of the Bill and made no other comment. That is why I say: I am not concerned with the opinion of the hon. member for Constantia. I am not interested in his opinion, just as I am not interested in the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) in this House. The point is that especially these two English-speaking members on the other side of the House go out of their way to try and break any good feelings that exist between English-speaking and Afrikaans-speaking people in this House, and they are the ones who are a discredit to this House. I go further and say that in this way they try and direct the newspapers in South Africa, the English-speaking newspapers to follow a particular line, that is a discredit to South Africa. I remember the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) saying in a speech at Pietermaritzburg &#x201C;If it was not for the United Party there would not be a free Press in South Africa That is the atmosphere they want to create.

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that the groans you have just heard from that side of the House will prove to be well justified when hon. members have heard what I have to say on the subject of the remarks just made by the hon. Minister of Information. It reminds me of the story of a very famous commedian by the name of Vic Oliver, who used to start his act by coming out on the stage, and after playing two or three bars on his violin in an excruciatingly bad way, put the violin down, saying &#x201C;I think I will take my applause now!&#x201D; We have heard the groaning on that side of the House in advance of what I am going to say in reply to the Minister, and I think that I am in the position of that commedian Vic Oliver, and that the groaning is very well-merited.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister has, I think, sat down with some relief after the speech which he has felt obliged to make as a result of certain strictures laid upon him by the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson). He felt obliged to do so. I do not think he would have welcomed the opportunity, of his own volition, to raise the matter which was raised here by the hon. member for Constantia in regard to the statement which he made to the Press a few days ago. He went out of his way, for example, to say that only when there was a news report in the English language Press, or headlines, or posters, or bill boards, which were critical of South Africa, only then was this Opposition happy. [Hear, hear!] He said that only then were we happy, but whenever an English language newspaper came out with a banner headline or a bill-board which put South Africa or the Government in a good light, then, of course, we were not at all happy. Of course, the Minister felt that then that paper was doing its duty. He said that in referring to the <i>Cape Argus</i> of Friday which, as cited by the hon. member for Constantia, reported on the Press Conference held that afternoon and came out with this headline, according to the Minister: &#x201C;State plans to ease race friction. Bill to amend laws for Bantu That was the headline. The hon. the Minister was very happy with that, Sir, but is it not an extraordinary thing that in the very first issue of the same newspaper, which satisfies the hon. Minister and all the members opposite, as being a right-minded English-language newspaper, in the very first issue after they had time to look at the situation and to realize what happened at that Press conference, this is what they said&#x2014;and I hope all the members opposite will in this case also approve of the <i>Cape Argus</i>.&#x2014;In the leader column under the heading of &#x201C;Less Friction Indeed!&#x201D; this afternoon, the <i>Argus</i> said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1087-1088" refersTo="page_0558"/>It does not help much for Government spokesmen to say that the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill has not yet been accepted by the Cabinet, and therefore is not a full reflection of Government policy.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in this editorial, after the <i>Cape Argus</i> had thought about the matter, it goes on to say&#x2014;-</p>

<block name="quote">Nor does it reflect to the credit of Mr. F. W. Waring, Minister of Information, that he sponsored the ballyhoo with which the Bill was published without even having read it.</block>

<p>Where are the &#x201C;hear, hears&#x201D; from that side of the House now? Then towards the end of this editorial, the <i>Cape Argus</i> says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The one thing this elaborate Bill does not take into consideration is that this is legislation about living people. If the Bill becomes law these people will cease to have roots in the soil and rights, but tend to be a floating mass of labouring material that is only potentially divisible into individual human beings.</block>

<p>Where is the applause for the <i>Cape Argus,</i> that right-thinking English language newspaper applauded by the Minister of Information 20 minutes ago? Do hon. members not want to say &#x201C;Hoor, hoor!&#x201D; for the <i>Cape Argus</i> all over again? But this is only one aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>If I had never attended a Press conference&#x2014; and I have indeed attended, and even helped them&#x2014;and if I can imagine with any accuracy what happened when this conference took place, the Minister&#x2014;and this is borne out by at least one Press report&#x2014;was his most disarming self. He was not so this afternoon. But he said to these gentlemen of the Press:</p>

<p>&#x201C;You cannot expect me&#x201D; to discuss with you in detail a Bill which first of all I have not seen; moreover, the time is limited, since there is an *embargo for release&#x2019; of this statement at 2 p.m. to-day. Obviously the matter is designed to be featured in the Press this day.&#x201D;</p>

<p>&#x201C;You cannot expect me.&#x201D; says the hon. Minister, &#x201C;to deal with a Bill * which is more than two inches thick&#x2019; &#x201D;. He said so at the conference, he said so in the House this afternoon when he was quizzed by the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) as to whether he had made any supplementary statement at the Press Conference. He said &#x201C;Yes, I told them that the Bill was more than two inches thick&#x201D;, I say with all deference to the Minister: If he can take a slide rule, or the ruler I have in my hand, and make this more than three-twentieths of an inch in thickness, then, Sir, I take back a lot of the things I intend to say before I sit down. Here is a document, and he says it is more than two inches thick; he says, in effect, that it is 35 times the thickness it actually is. How can we be expected to discuss things rationally with the hon. the Minister? If the hon. the Minister is prepared to multiply by 35 in order to establish the thickness of this published Bill, is he also prepared to divide by 35 when it comes to telling the truth about this matter? I am sorry to say that the hon. the Minister, if I am critical of him, has brought this on his own head, because instead of standing up here in the House and saying, in effect &#x201C;Perhaps I was wrong in what I said to the Press conference, perhaps they were misled into believing that what I have said about the contents of this draft Bill in fact related to its text, perhaps I went beyond my duty as an honourable Minister of Information and acted as if I were a propagandist for a commercial company&#x201D;&#x2014;if he had said that, I doubt if any attack would have come from this side of the House. But when the hon. member for Constantia raises this matter in all seriousness, in order to point out to the House what actually must have transpired at the Press conference, the hon. the Minister of Information sails into him with everything that he has got, all guns blazing, and into the Opposition, of course, at the same time, because it presents a bigger target! We, Sir, whenever we say anything critical of a Minister, and particularly of the newly-born hon. Minister of Information, we are guilty of an act of high treason. That is his attitude.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into detail as to what the <i>Cape Times</i> said about the Bill on Saturday, because at that stage they were quoting what the Minister had told them, including his statement that in its published form the Bill would be about two inches thick. Nor do I want to deal in any detail with what the <i>Sunday Times</i> said yesterday. I do not hold a brief for the one or the other newspaper, but what is the use of the hon. Minister saying &#x201C;Do you know who wrote this article for the <i>Sunday Times</i>? Nobody else but Stanley Uys&#x201D; as if he were saying &#x201C;Do you know who blew up the House of Parliament? Nobody else but Guy Fawkes!&#x201D; You know&#x2014;<i>ipso facto.</i> It is what the lawyers call a <i>non sequitur.</i> The fact that Stanley Uys writes something does not necessarily make it inaccurate, any more than the fact that the hon. the Minister of Information says something to Stanley Uys. necessarily makes it accurate. Here is what the <i>Sunday Times</i> stated, quite categorically&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Accepting Mr. Waring&#x2019;s statement at its face value, those South African afternoon papers published it, in good faith under prominent headlines announcing, as one newspaper did, &#x201C;State Plans to Ease Race Friction&#x201D;.</block>

<p><span class="col_1089-1090" refersTo="page_0559"/>Nothing wrong with that statement. They then go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Waring explained at the conference that he had not seen the Bill.</block>

<p>Nothing wrong with that. In fact the hon. Minister said that he had not seen the Bill. He repeated that this afternoon&#x2014;that he had received it from the other department. Then he said, according to the <i>Sunday Times:</i> &#x201C;Mr. Waring praised the new Bill&#x201D;. Nothing wrong with that. He praised the Bill this afternoon, and what is more, on Friday night I was absolutely dumfounded when I turned on the news. I can do that on a Friday night since the House is not in Session then. I turned it on for the news at nine o&#x2019;clock, the English news transmission, and there was the news in a new guise, &#x201C;News at Nine&#x201D;, Now I want to be more careful than the hon. Minister. &#x201C;News at Nine&#x201D;, a very novel title for a news service; I have never heard it before; but it was the regular Radio South Africa news service in English, and all of a sudden, in referring to this very Press conference, this very draft legislation, what do you think (The Minister keeps on saying &#x201C;Who do you think wrote this?&#x201D; I say &#x201C;What do you think I heard?&#x201D;) The voice of the Minister of Information! Now this is a very peculiar situation, because as far as I can remember&#x2014;and I would like the hon. Minister to correct me, and I would be very happy to be put back on what the hon. Minister of Transport calls &#x201C;the right track&#x201D; it has never happened before in the history of the S.A.B.C. that in the course of a regular news transmission, the &#x201C;live&#x201D; voice of a Cabinet Minister has cut in.</p>

<p>I will tell you what is wrong with it.

Because the hon. Minister went beyond the comment that he made, according to the Press reports of both language-group newspapers at the Press conference, and he referred to this legislation as bringing about what he was pleased to call the &#x201C;liberalization&#x201D; of the legislation referring to the Bantu. Now the hon. member for Vereeniging seems suddenly to have become tongue-tied.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member must surely remember the number of times in this Session alone, let alone the past session and the one before, when the word &#x201C;liberal&#x201D; as used by hon. members opposite took on the very worst meaning in the world: &#x201C;Communistic, communist.&#x201D; Now, all of a sudden, when a statement is made about this draft Bill, then according to the hon. Minister of Information it is designed to bring about the &#x201C;liberalization&#x201D; of the legislation which governs the Natives of this country. We know that anybody who is interested in the &#x201C;liberalization&#x201D; of anything is what the hon. members on that side of the House call a &#x201C;liberalis&#x201D;, a very bad word from the point of view of any ordinary understanding of grammar or language, but they say &#x201C;Jy is &#x2019;n liberalis&#x201D;&#x2014;and then you are supposed to drop dead after that! Now we have the hon. Minister of Information suddenly as a &#x201C;liberalis&#x201D;, on the radio, in a news broadcast, telling the public of South Africa about the way he and his colleagues in the Government are setting out to become the great &#x201C;liberalists&#x201D; by the &#x201C;liberalization&#x201D; of the legislation that governs three-quarters of the people of South Africa, the Bantu. This is an extraordinary thing which calls, in due course, for some comment from the hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in the first place, and I hope also for an explanation from the hon. Minister of Information himself; because one of the things we have heard from the hon. Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, when we have queried certain things that have been heard over the S.A.B.C., in regard to certain matters of policy of the Board of Governors, was that its news services are designed to be completely factual, accurate and objective. How then does one man&#x2019;s opinion about the &#x201C;liberalization&#x201D; process of certain legislation come into a news transmission which is designed to be factual, accurate and objective? His opinion as Minister, or mine&#x2014;I have no more right to go on to the radio in a news transmission and say that this legislation &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I was about to say that the hon. Minister of Information, or any Minister for that, has no more right to intrude or to obtrude himself in a radio news service, an objective, factual news transmission, and to give his opinion about legislation, than I would have to obtrude myself in that same objective news service, with my opinion about legislation or proposed legislation.</p>

<p>But furthermore, if we are examining the motivation, as the Americans call it, of the hon. Minister of Information, then let us see what he says in his Press statement &#x201C;to be released at 2 p.m.&#x201D; that he gave to the Press, and which resulted in the discussion this afternoon. He has quoted it himself&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the Bill has in many respects been prompted by the same spirit as that which gave rise to &#x201C;White&#x201D; liquor being made available to the Bantu and to the abrogating of various restrictions concerning the brewing of Bantu beer.</block>

<p>Is not this an extraordinary portrayal of legislation which is undertaken, in all seriousness, to ease the lot of three-quarters of the population <span class="col_1091-1092" refersTo="page_0560"/>of South Africa, and apparently to amend difficult legislation? Is it not an extraordinary portrayal to say &#x201C;the same spirit motivates this legislation as the liberalization of the supply of White liquor and beer&#x201D;? Mr. Speaker, whether one is a teetotaller or not (I am not prepared to ask you the question), I think it makes an extremely bad impression in South Africa and out of it, to tell the world that when we are going to the trouble that the Minister says we have gone to, and when officials of the Bantu Administration Department have been working on this Bill, three-fifths of an inch thick&#x2014;not two inches&#x2014;to tell South Africa and the world that it arose in the same spirit (the word, of course, is used in another context here) as that which motivated us, the governing race and the Government of South Africa, to liberalize (I use the word this time) the supply of White liquor and Bantu beer&#x2026; In other words, Mr. Speaker, we think no more of this, and all the amendments in this enormous document, as an ethical concept, than we did of our legislation to make whisky available to the Bantu and to make Bantu beer available to the Whites, because that is what it means. (And this cross-over between the races is designed, of course, to show how broadminded we are!) I sincerely hope, however, that as far as the majority of the people of South Africa are concerned, they will realize that if we in this House ever discuss amending legislation of this sort, at least those on this side of the House&#x2014;and I hope members on the other side of the House, and even members on the cross-benches&#x2014;will discuss this legislation in a so-called &#x201C;spirit&#x201D; other than the one that motivated the Government in making whisky available to the Bantu. I sincerely hope so, Sir, because if we do that, then we undo some of the damage which I believe, in all sincerity, has already been done to the good name of the White community in this country. I sincerely hope that the hon. Minister, instead of resenting what I have said&#x2014;and I have only said what I said because of the fact that he deliberately attacked someone who tried to bring to his notice a rather serious matter which emanated from his Department&#x2014;that instead of resenting me and what I have said, will have the grace to regard me as someone who has spoken up, perhaps not in the personal interest of the Minister of Information, but in the interest of South Africa and in the good name of this House of Assembly. I hope he will say so. I hear the hon. member for Cradock groaning again. I wish I had a collection of Press cuttings to equal that of the Minister of Information or of the Minister of External Affairs, but I do have one which he seems to have forgotten. He quoted this afternoon from Mr. Clarence B. Randall&#x2019;s report on South Africa. Well, we have heard Mr. Randall on the subject before and some of us have even met him, and I am not here to criticize him. But there was a gentleman who came out here and the hon. the Minister will remember him. He represented the Nieman Foundation of Harvard University. Remember him?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Do not put words into my mouth. What I am trying to say to the Minister is that this attitude which is reflected in the way this Press conference was called last week, where the Minister, to put it mildly, springs on a collection of representatives of newspapers a Bill which he says is more than two inches thick and says: &#x201C;Boys, this is what it is going to do; it will *liberalize&#x2019; the laws and do wonders for our race relations,&#x201D; and these fellows grab their notes and rush off&#x2014;that is what is meant by &#x201C;glib&#x201D;&#x2014;because he should have told them that there are certain things in this Bill upon which a very different construction could have been placed; at least, there was room for another opinion. Secondly, in regard to the Minister himself, I am sorry to say that the way he has sailed into the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson), and the way no doubt he or someone on that side, will sail into me, as if what I have said is a personal matter, will only serve once again to show that there is some truth in the statement about the &#x201C;aggressive&#x201D; attitude of the officials of the Department of Information. Because if this is the attitude of the Minister himself, one should not be surprised if in some cases it is said that the officials of the Department are &#x201C;aggressive&#x201D;; that whenever there is a comment on the radio or in the Press which is not obviously to the advantage of South Africa, instead of dealing with the matter courteously and objectively, the Minister resorts to this aggressive bull-at-the-gate method, as when he is hammering the Opposition into the ground as traitors to the cause of South Africa. I think that if we are going to have a Department of Information, let it at least be one which will, firstly, confer some benefit on the country by being as useful as possible, and secondly, let it confer some dignity on the Government of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The great pity of all this, from my personal point of view, is that I set out to use my time to discuss the questions of social welfare and pensions and the dying mines of the Rand. But unfortunately this is typical of what happens. A diversion is created by a member of the Cabinet, and instead of discussing what is germane to the motion and relevant to the business of the House, and what is important to the country, we are side-tracked into answering things of the sort we heard this afternoon.</p>

<speech by="#martins">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>It is a long time since I have listened to such a frustrated and jealous speaker as the hon. member who has just sat down. I want to give you one example, Sir. The hon. member cannot refer to one occasion where he had quoted anything good in this House which somebody had said about South Africa, but when he has an opportunity of using anything which besmirches South Africa or which besmirches a Department he grasps at it and delights in repeating it here, as for example, when he said that this professor had said that the Department of Information was aggressive and elusive. He grasps at that but when anybody says anything good about South Africa he remains silent. I want to give another example. The hon. member makes a jack-in-the-box speech and brings a ruler to measure a printed <i>Government Gazette.</i> He ought to know that when the Minister held this Press conference he only had the renewed copy of the Bill in his hands. As an advocate he knows that when the Minister tells a Press conference that he has not as yet read the Bill he says that because he cannot read that Bill by itself; he has to read it in conjunction with all the other laws which have a bearing on it in order to get a proper insight into the position, and then it is not two inches thick but four inches. Thus, by making a wrong statement and by using a ruler he tries to make a speech for one reason only and that is because he is jealous of the fact that he is not so important that his voice is also heard over the radio. That is the only reason.</p>

<p>Time unfortunately does not permit me to talk about Stanley Uys and what he said namely that if they criticize the Minister it is regarded as high treason. That has never been the position but when they besmirch South Africa and give the wrong information to Mrs. Bertha Solomon so that she can publish the wrong information overseas we regard that as high treason.</p>

<p>But I want to talk about something else. The South African Agricultural Union has repeatedly asked for the creation of a new Department, a Department of Agricultural Financing to do certain work. As a result of those representations by the Agricultural Union and other bodies there have been some confusion and speculation and guessing which do not see our Departments, the way they are linked together and the services they render, in their true perspective. I believe that it is urgently necessary that this Department of Agricultural Financing for which the Agricultural Union has asked be created because the idea of the Agricultural Union is that the present State Advances Recoveries Office, which performs such a gigantic task, should become a continuous Department to render all that assistance. But when you talk about that Department, Sir, I want to state very clearly that because people do not see the composition of the various Departments in its true perspective, I do not believe that the Agricultural Union or this House or anybody who sees the true facts in the right light will ever for one moment expect this Department of Agricultural Financing which they desire, to take over the Department of Lands or the Land Bank because each one performs a separate task. I believe it will create coordinated agricultural financing, something which is so essential. Time does not permit me to talk about the Land Bank or about the State Advances Recoveries Office and to point out the services which they have rendered but because you read about it in the newspapers and because you hear that representations have been made that the Department of Lands is an heirloom which has served its purpose, it is essential that we place on record what this Department has already done and to what extent it has assisted our White population who have craved for land and who have wished to become independent farmers over the past years. I do not think anyone will contradict me when I say that the Whites of South Africa, this Parliament and all right-thinking people will agree with me that when I have given this data it will be realized that the Department of Lands is one of the Departments which has done most to serve agriculture in South Africa and which has given the farmer an opportunity of living as an independent person, so much so that our previous Prime Minister, when he was still leader in the Transvaal and when he entered the Cabinet, actually asked whether he could not be in charge of this Department because, he said, &#x201C;This is a Department which will enable me to look after my sons and daughters and my people in the future&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Let us go into the history of this Department. It was created on 31 May 1910 and its functions were to have been the following: the administration of all matters affecting State land, irrigation, land settlement and surveys. But when the Land Settlement Act came into operation on 16 October 1912 the main object of this Department was to place suitable people on State land so that they would become independent citizens. When we think what happened from 1912 to 31 March 1960 we find that this Department had assisted farmers under various sections and that during this period it had placed 21,105 persons on land as farmers under Section 20 and Section 23 alone&#x2014;Section 20 is the section under which the farmer has to pay one-tenth of the purchase price and the State lends him the remaining nine-tenths to be repaid over a long period and Section 23 is the section under which the Department gives land to probationer tenant farmers with the option ultimately of purchasing it from the Department. They allotted 17,047,000 morgen of land to farmers in South Africa&#x2014;and I pointed out some time ago in this House how little agricultural land we really had&#x2014;on which they <span class="col_1095-1096" refersTo="page_0562"/>could farm productively and become independent. During that period it had made R68,254,000 available to farmers to enable them to acquire land in that way. It was under these two sections of the Department alone that that was done. When we look at the other section, the closer settlement section, we find&#x2014;and I am only dealing with the period from 1948-61&#x2014;that an amount of R6,216,000 was spent by this Department to place farmers on land as probationer tenant farmers.</p>

<p>The norm which you must apply to ascertain whether this Department has succeeded in doing its work is the average income of the farmers in South Africa. On investigation I found that the average income of those people who were assisted like that by the Department to become independent farmers, was R3,600 per annum and those were only test checks. I think it will be higher if you take all the closer settlements under irrigation into account but that is not all which this Department is doing. I want to refer to a few schemes which have been undertaken as developmental works. Take the Orange River Land Settlement scheme which was started in 1925 and where 23,000 morgen of land have been placed under irrigation and on which 1,675 families are living. When we look at the products we find that they provide us with lucerne, cotton, peas, sultanas and fruit, particularly dried peaches and that one settlement has an average income of R3,438 per annum and the average income per person is R1,939 per annum. When we look at the Hartebeespoort Dam scheme which was also started in 1925, we find that 14,817 morgen of land divided into 663 plots were placed under irrigation. Thanks to the action of the Department the income per lessee is R4,628 per annum. My time has nearly expired, Sir, so I cannot tell you everything that has been done at Loskop, Vaalharts, Pongola, Riet River and Levubu and then you still have Sterk River and Olifants River. I just want to say that 134,155 morgen of land has already been prepared for irrigation under this one section of this Department alone. Three thousand seven hundred and ninety tenant farmers have been placed and their globular income from irrigation just on this one closer settlement amounts to R18,900,000 per annum. How can any agricultural union say that this Department has served its purpose and that it must be abolished? No, it has an important task to fulfil. The average income of our farmers throughout South Africa is between R4,200 and R4,500 per annum and the average income of all the settlers together is R4,600 per annum. In other words, 20 per cent of the total number of farmers are on these settlements and they were placed there by this Department which has done excellent work and which has seen to it that they become independent farmers. I do not want to deal with all the schemes which have been announced and which are being developed. We know there is a whole series of them. I merely want to analyse the figures briefly and place them on record. When you take the period 1912-29 you find that there were 3,076 under Section 20 and 5,258 under Section 23, a total of 8,334 and 20.4 per cent were cancelled. For the following period, 1929-39 a total of 3,973 were allocated under Section 20 and Section 23. That was during the depression and 33.4 per cent were cancelled. During the period 1939-48 3,441 were allocated and 12.3 per cent were cancelled. Over the last period, 1948-60 a total number of 5,357 agreements of leases were concluded under the two sections and only 4.1 per cent were cancelled. In other words, the position under this Department is steadily improving; it is looking well after our farmers. When I summarize the position for the period 1912 to 1960 I find that 21,105 farmers were placed on land in terms of Sections 20 and 23 where they farmed as independent farmers and I have already said that they constitute over 20 per cent of our total number of farmers. Time does not permit me to point out the other assistance which has been given under Section 42 for example, in terms of which farmers were assisted to effect permanent improvements, or to Section 53 under which farmers were assisted with stock, seed, fertilizer and implements. But during the past five years R424,000 and R1,056,000 were granted under these two sections to assist those farmers. Now I believe, as I said at the beginning, that such a continuous department to assist Category No. 3 farmers is indispensable and that it will probably be able to take over a great amount of work from lands, for example, the work done under the last two sections which I have mentioned, particularly Section 53 under which assistance can be given in respect of stock, seed and implements. But whereas the State is the mortgagee of that settler until he has paid for his land and whereas the State has done the preliminary work in connection with those closer settlements, the same department which is the mortgagee will probably continue to administer the funds for permanent improvements such as buildings, and fencing, and I believe it will have to remain under that Department because that Department fulfils a very useful function. I believe we should have such a new department but that it should not encroach on the terrain of the existing Department of Lands or on the terrain of the Land Bank, except for this that it may possibly take over the hypothecation loans of the Land Bank because they also constitute casual assistance. But I do believe that this Department will coordinate the subsidies in the various directions so that it will not be necessary for the farmer to run to the Railways or to other bodies for a fertilizer subsidy or for the transportation of his stock in drought stricken areas or for the transportation of stock feed or that it will not be necessary for him to approach the Department of Water Affairs for assistance in connection with a borehole or to Agricultural Technical Services to subsidize soil erosion works, but that it will all come under the same umbrella of this Department, but that the other two big departments, one of which is the Land Bank will continue to give financial <span class="col_1097-1098" refersTo="page_0563"/>assistance to Category No. 2 farmers and the other, the Department of Lands which has done so much good work in the past will also remain in existence. I think we can have nothing but gratitude for Lands for what it has done to the farmers.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr.</p>

<p>Speaker, the last two speeches to which we listened formed an interesting contrast. The last speaker obviously had something to say and he stated his case positively and his speech was really a contribution to this debate. But the speaker who preceded him obviously had nothing to say, and he spoke with a great and sometimes funny verbosity. The hon. member evidently eagerly grasped at the occasion to embarrass the Minister of Information, and he devoted 25 minutes to that. As a contribution to this debate, it was, in the picturesque language of the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek) an absolute failure. The hon. member sowed macaroni but all that came up were the holes. [Laughter.]</p>

<p>I owe the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) an explanation. He is evidently under a misapprehension. Because the words which brought him under a misapprehension were in English, I shall repeat them in Afrikaans in the hope that he will be able to understand them better. I made an attack on the political philosophy of the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) and said that I did not agree with that materialistic philosophy and that we on this side totally rejected it. I summarized that political philosophy in the sense that nothing is politically correct which is not economically sound. I say that is the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Jeppes and his friends. I said that on the other hand we on this side realize that there are things which cannot be weighed or measured, but which are sometimes more important than pure economic factors. I called that the &#x201C;imponderabilia&#x201D;. I want to tell the hon. member that economics is not one of the &#x201C;imponderabilia&#x201D;&#x2014;or perhaps it is in his case, but this is not what I had in mind. But I say that there are &#x201C;imponderabilia&#x201D; in the face of which economics must step down. I said that there were times in the history of a country or a people when these &#x201C;imponderabilia&#x201D; are more weighty and serious and then economics, or what is sound economically, must give way to what under those circumstances is politically correct. I want to mention the obvious example that when a country finds that the integrity of its borders is being threatened, or when its independence is in danger, that is one of those things which cannot be weighed or measured, and economic factors must be subservient to such considerations. But there are also other circumstances which I can imagine in which the welfare of the State as a whole weighs more heavily than the immediate economic advantages. I am thinking, for example, of the time when there was a suggestion that Chinese labourers should be imported to work in our gold mines. Probably a very strong economic case could have been made out for that, but the economic factors&#x2014;and South Africa can thank God for that&#x2014;became subservient to what I call considerations of statesmanship affecting the country as a whole. It is not that what is politically correct is never economically sound, but it is only that circumstances may arise in a country when it has to consider those things which are correct irrespective of whether they are perhaps not economically sound. That is what I said and I do not know what his difficulty is in that regard. I think I owe it to him to explain it to him in Afrikaans, seeing that he did not understand it very clearly in English.</p>

<p>The hon. member said that we had not replied to the two main matters he mentioned. The first is the question of the marginal mines on the Witwatersrand. I was under the impression that the hon. the Minister of Mines had given a very detailed reply on that matter. I do know that he issued a warning, and rightly so, against the psychological effect of talking about dying mines. I also know that he said that we should not exaggerate the problem, but it is quite clear from what he said in his previous statements&#x2014;and I can almost say it is obvious&#x2014;that the Government is continually devoting attention to the problem of the marginal mines. The hon. the Minister, and I think also other Ministers, have already shown on many occasions that this is really a matter which enjoys their attention.</p>

<p>In regard to the other matter, the question of border industries, the hon. the Minister also explained the position as clearly as possible, and it is a matter which has already been discussed so often that I did not think it possible for the hon. member for Constantia still to be dissatisfied with the &#x201C;insufficiency&#x201D; of the reply he received. Personally I thought that the reply was too detailed unless one was prepared to under-estimate the intelligence of the Opposition. My personal feeling was that to any person who was <i>au fait</i> with what had been said by members of the Government on this subject, the reply of the Minister was rather too detailed than otherwise.</p>

<p>Then I just want to refer to the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever), who referred here to the problem of the banks and the building societies. He said <i>inter alia</i> that the Bill and the report should be made available to members of Parliament. I want to tell him immediately that as yet there is no report. The Technical Committee has drafted a preliminary report which has been referred to the parties concerned for their comment, and as soon as their comment has been received they will frame a final report which will be submitted to me. It will be a departmental report, and it is not customary for departmental reports to be made available. But I will then judge whether it is of <span class="col_1099-1100" refersTo="page_0564"/>sufficient general interest to make it available either generally or to those persons who are interested in this problem, but what has been drafted so far is simply a working copy, a basis on which they want to invite comment in order then to be able to express their final opinion.</p>

<p>They said there was a draft Bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>They drafted the Bill to give effect to what they felt, but it is purely a draft. I can tell the hon. member that I have not even considered it yet. It is not a final document and it has been distributed for comment only. Therefore it is a little difficult to say at this stage whether any legislation we may draft will be ready for introduction before the end of this Session. We are now awaiting the next step and I think it is very essential for us to devote as much time as possible to such an important matter as this, which has to determine the relations <i>inter se</i> between the Financial institutions, so that we can arrive at a firm basis on which these relations should rest in future. These relations should be as sound as possible.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) also raised the matter of pensions. I may say that he adopted a much more reasonable attitude than the Opposition speakers who spoke on this subject during the second reading debate. He, for example, admitted that much has been done for all groups of pensioners in recent years, but he says that not enough has been done and that much more should be done. Well, a Minister of Finance continually receives the request from various sources that still more should be done in regard to expenditure and tax concessions. Requests are continually received for more money to be devoted to welfare services, but as soon as the Minister talks about an increase in taxation to cover the additional expenditure the same persons who pleaded so much for increased expenditure are the first to say that taxes should not be increased.</p>

<p>I just want to remind the hon. member of a few things. We should remember that South Africa is not a welfare state and I hope it will never become one. There is an adage to the effect that a state which begins as a welfare state ends up having no welfare at all. We are not a welfare state and I hope we never become one. I hope that our policy in regard to welfare work will always be never to do away completely with family responsibility and the responsibility of society.</p>

<p>In the second place, we should also remember that this is not a country where there is a compulsory contributory scheme to which the person who will eventually receive the benefits makes half the contributions during the time he works, whilst the State contributes the other half. Under those circumstances, the person receiving the benefit has to a large extent contributed himself towards the benefits paid out to him on his retirement. Thirdly I want to say that if I look at the figures submitted to me it is quite clear that the increased pensions granted to pensioners from time to time have more than kept pace with the increase in the cost of living. I just want to mention a few figures to prove that. The maximum pension, including the bonus, was R120 per annum in 1947. Last year it was R294, an increase therefore of 145 per cent. In the corresponding period the cost of living increased by only 65 per cent. The same applies to the veterans. There the increase is even greater. In 1947 the veteran&#x2019;s pension was also R120 per annum; it is now R390, an increase of 225 per cent, whilst in the corresponding period the increase in the cost of living was only 65 per cent. The increase in pensions and bonuses has therefore more than kept pace with the increase in the cost of living. But I want to tell the hon. member that the suggestion he made, which has not been made before and has not received our attention yet, will be taken into consideration when we deal with the matter again. The position has always been that the pensioner has had a very sympathetic friend in the Government, and when the general position of the country allows of it we will readily devote attention to what additional benefits we can grant the pensioner, proper consideration being given to the other priorities.</p>

<p>Is the hon. the Minister prepared to consider the question of an increase in the basic pension?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I am not prepared to reply to that now. The hon. member knows that in any case that is a very unreasonable question, but it is one of the matters which will be considered in general. Any suggestion of this nature continually enjoys the attention of the Department of Pensions which discusses these matters and co-operates with the Treasury. If the hon. member&#x2019;s question is whether I am prepared to consider the question of an increase with a view to the Budget, my reply is that it is always being considered, and if the hon. member thought that in this way he could perhaps discover something then he has been wasting his time. It is not a fair question. But these matters continually enjoy the attention of the Department concerned and of the Treasury.</p>

<p>There is just one other point which was raised by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (Central). He asked whether the time had not arrived for us to abolish all control measures like currency control. He says that we say that the position is so sound to-day, and he almost pretended that the test of confidence was to abolish all control. I want to point out to the hon. member that in Britain there is still control of currency leaving the country. That control has been applied for years; it has almost become the usual thing. My information is that last year there was still control in Holland in the same form that we have it here. If a Briton, for example, sells Philips&#x2019; shares in Holland he cannot freely transfer the proceeds to Britain; he must first receive permission. We should therefore not <span class="col_1101-1102" refersTo="page_0565"/>think that the measure of control applied is the only yardstick of confidence in a country. We should remember that South Africa is in a very peculiar position. Our balance of payments is relatively more vulnerable than that of other countries because we have such a large portfolio investment abroad. It has in the past happened that large sums of money have been invested here in shares, particularly gold mining shares, and it is those portfolio investments which can so easily be withdrawn and which can so easily tempt our citizens to buy shares at bargain prices overseas and to bring them here. In spite of the fact that shares to the value of almost R120,000,000 were repatriated in 1961-2, it is estimated that there are perhaps still investments of that nature in South Africa amounting to anything from R600,000,000 to R900,000,000 and hon. members will understand that if our total reserves amount to only R440,000,000 what an effect that can have if the foreign holders of our shares are prepared to sell them to our people at bargain prices, and how money will flow out of this country with the result that our reserves will fall. The position at the moment is that there is no non-resident who is not allowed to take his money out of the country if he can make out a reasonable case for it. If he has shares here he can sell them on the London Stock Exchange; he is quite free to do so. He can sell them here if he wants to and get an extra 10 per cent discount, but then he cannot get the money immediately; he can then, if he wants to, invest in other shares here or he can invest in the blocked rand loan, and over a period of five years he can take out one-fight of the amount every year. We try as far as possible to discourage possible speculation, and that is why I have said on occasion that it is much sounder to have our reserves on a higher level than in the past, because we discovered during the balance of payments crisis in 1961 that these portfolio investments are our Achilles&#x2019; heel, and because that makes us so vulnerable we are not able to abandon all controls now. We shall probably have to carry on in this way for a long while to come, but it is not our policy to have control permanently, As long as our position is as I have stated, these controls will have to remain. If our reserves rise very much and if the portfolio investments perhaps decrease, it is perhaps something which one can reconsider seriously. At the moment we try to grant concessions wherever necessary. There is not any absolute prohibition placed on any foreign investor selling shares here from taking the proceeds of the shares out of the country. He can do so.</p>

<p>What I have said here was perhaps somewhat superfluous, but I at least had to say something in reply to what has been said here. I just want to conclude by saying that the reserve team which batted to-day almost did better than the second team which batted in the second reading debate.</p>

<heading>PUBLICATIONS AND ENTERTAINMENTS BILL</heading>

<p>Second Order read: House to go into Committee on Publications and Entertainments</p>

<p>Bill.</p>

<p>House in Committee:</p>

<p>On Clause 1, Mr. PLEWMAN; I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 5, to omit &#x201C;Publications Control Board&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;Board of Censors&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The purpose of my amendment is to make it quite clear that a board which is set up under this legislation would be a board of censors instead of a board of control. In the second-reading debate much emphasis was placed, and rightly placed, on those provisions of the Bill which are directed at restraining and penalizing those who offend against public morals. I think there was a tacit admission that instruction, both secular and religious instruction, by itself was unfortunately not enough to curb adequately the dissemination of what might be indecent, obscene or harmful to public morals. Therefore there has to be legislation to deal with that aspect of the matter. That is common cause. Now, under Roman Law that is precisely what an official who had the name &#x201C;censor&#x201D; did. He was a magistrate who was charged with the supervision of public morals and he had powers to curb and prevent the dissemination of anything which would offend against public morals. That is the derivation of our word &#x201C;censor&#x201D; and that by itself is more than an adequate reason for adopting the term &#x201C;board of censors&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;board of control&#x201D;, The term &#x201C;control board&#x201D; in South Africa has by legislative usage acquired a significance of its own. We have lots of legislation dealing with boards of control. Usually they have something to do with tobacco or mealies or potatoes or bananas&#x2014;something to do with the pricing and marketing of agricultural produce and the conduct of business of that kind. I think this is a case where we do not want to have any confusion because the term &#x201C;board of control&#x201D; by legislative usage, has come to be associated with a board that has to do with the supervision of some form of business; it has nothing to do with public morals. Do not let us confuse the control of business morality with the suppression of public immorality. That is a danger I think we must face and avoid. But there is also another reason why my amendment should be accepted and that is because the board which is now being established is a board with powers wider than the powers of the existing Board of Censors set up under the old Entertainment and Censorship Acts of 1931 to 1953. That series of Acts of Parliament set up a Board of Censors with regard to the film industry. This board will be doing much the <span class="col_1103-1104" refersTo="page_0566"/>same work, perhaps in a wider scope, as the old board did, and for that reason too I think it would be inappropriate to describe this board as a board of control. I believe I have made a case and I hope that the hon. the Minister will see fit to accept my amendments for the reasons I have given.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I rise to support the amendment moved by the hon. member and I do hope the hon. Minister will be prepared to accept it. I think there is no term which is more likely to do harm to South Africa in the outside world than the term Publications Control Board. I believe that the term suggested by the hon. member, namely &#x201C;Board of Censors&#x201D; will much more accurately describe the functions of the board, and certainly it is not open to the obvious criticism which can be levelled at a term such as &#x201C;Publications Control Board&#x201D;. I sincerely hope that the Minister will accept the hon. member&#x2019;s amendment; it will in no way weaken the legislation, but certainly the term &#x201C;Board of Control&#x201D; is a most unfortunate term to use in any legislation. It is a term which I hope we will not see on the Statute Book of this country.</p>

<p>Sir, I would like at the same time to move in an amended form the amendment standing in my name on page 104&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 52, after &#x201C;or&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;morally&#x201D;.</block>

<p>My reason for moving this is that the word &#x201C;objectionable&#x201D; is a tremendously wide term. I believe that it goes far beyond what the Minister intends to convey by this clause. Sir, many things are objectionable, although they cannot by any means be regarded as something which should be the subject of censorship. For example some hon. members on the other side find United Party policy objectionable in certain respects. The term &#x201C;objectionable&#x201D; is far too wide and it should definitely be limited, and the best way I have found of limiting it is to insert the word &#x201C;morally&#x201D; before &#x201C;objectionable&#x201D;. This is not a new point; I also raised it in the Select Committee. I believe that if the Minister agreed to this it would eliminate the possibility of a wide misconception as to what is meant. I believe that the courts would have the greatest difficulty in interpreting the term &#x201C;objectionable&#x201D; standing alone. I believe it would be far better if it is qualified by the word &#x201C;morally&#x201D;. I would not object to some other way of limiting the meaning of the term to what it is supposed to mean, and if the hon. Minister can produce some other amendment I would be very happy to support him. But in the absence of some better suggestion I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will limit the meaning of the word &#x201C;objectionable&#x201D; by agreeing to insert &#x201C;morally&#x201D; before it. Then at least the courts would not have very great difficulty in determining what Parliament meant.</p>

<p>The objection may be something which has absolutely nothing to do with morals. There may be all sorts of expressions which are objectionable on various grounds but nevertheless they need not necessarily be terms which ought to be the subject of censorship in any form, but if you say that they must be objectionable on moral grounds, then you limit it to what I believe the hon. the Minister intends to cover in this clause. In its present form that term has far too wide a meaning. I should like to see it defined even more accurately; I have not been able to think of something more accurate than the insertion of the word &#x201C;morally&#x201D;, but standing alone the word &#x201C;objectionable&#x201D; is tremendously wide and could cover a great deal of what cannot possibly be intended by the hon. the Minister to be regarded as expressions in printed matter which would be actionable under the provision of this Bill.</p>

<p>I would like to support the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) and say a word about what can be objectionable and not morally objectionable. When one imports cheap literature&#x2014;and there is much in this Bill about cheap literature&#x2014;many people find objectionable the excessive use of slang. They say that, especially in the use of the English language, it is necessary to preserve a certain purity of language, and many people say that the excessive use of slang in English must be regarded as objectionable while it may not be morally objectionable. It may not have any moral bearing whatsoever but in the use of the language it can be objectionable. I can understand that people sitting on this board may say, &#x201C;this type of book is objectionable; we do not like the kind of language used in it; the author uses the language of the lowest class cinema, of the East end of New York or the slums of London and we think that is objectionable; it is not suitable for our young people&#x201D;. But that is not a moral objection, nothing that will affect their morals; it is simply the use of the language. And I think for that reason we shall have to accept the amendment of the hon. member.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I want to talk about the amendment moved by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) which is to the effect that it should be a Board of Censors instead of a Board of Control. As I understand the contents of this Bill the idea is that our activities are now really being converted into control measures because in numerous places in the Bill it is implied that an opinion will be given, that advice will be given, so much so that it <span class="col_1105-1106" refersTo="page_0567"/>will not be necessary for many publishers to ask for advice. It is left to their own discretion. But I have always understood &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; to be something absolute. When anything is censored it is absolute and that was why no provision was made in the Entertainment (Censorship) Act of 1931 for an appeal to the courts. But control is being exercised here and when a person is not satisfied with that control he has the right to appeal to the highest court in the land to fight for his rights there. He can say: &#x201C;The control which you have exercised over me here is unreasonable; it is not correct.&#x201D; I do not know why the hon. member insists upon giving it this name. He must admit that where the Minister had absolute control in the past, where he was the last person to whom could be appealed, you could have talked about censorship; there something was censored; there was disapproval. Censorship implies all that. That is why, Mr. Chairman, it is absolutely impossible for me, according to the whole spirit of the Bill, to give the publisher or whoever it may be, the opportunity of appealing to the highest court.</p>

<p>In terms of the second amendment the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) wishes to add the word &#x201C;morally&#x201D;&#x2014;that which is &#x201C;morally&#x201D; offensive. The hon. member has made an honest attempt to narrow the wide concept of &#x201C;indecent, obscene or objectionable&#x201D;. These words were from the Customs Act of 1950. The concept is broad, I admit that. But the hon. member must not forget that if we add this word we shall be saddled with another difficulty. Most of the imported material which falls under that category is not really offensive to the morals. It can bring a totally foreign culture to our country; it may introduce completely foreign concepts. Not only can it do harm morally but it may contain such foreign offensive concepts, it may introduce a culture which differs so much from our concepts that it cannot be assimilated. How are you going to eliminate that if you limit it to that extent? Hon. members know that under this legislation the control over imported publications is very much more strict than the control over our local publications. That is essential. I do not want to venture on the field of giving examples but we are all aware of it that it is not only the moral side of life which can be shocked; that is a section. The idea which the hon. member has that it is shocking to the morals is incorporated in the idea of &#x201C;indecent, obscene and objectionable&#x201D;. We maintain that by formulating it as widely as this it will only require a few court judgments to give direction in South Africa. Only a few court judgments and everyone will know exactly where he stands in South Africa. We need not worry about the board. The final say does not lie with the board. That is why I say I am sorry but I think that by limiting that which is indecent, obscene and objectionable by applying it to morals only, we will be creating a regrettable defect in the Bill. The hon. member asked me whether I could think of another word. I am afraid I do not have another word. I am afraid that if we were to try to limit the meaning of these words we shall fail dismally and that we shall be making a farce of the whole idea of control. There have been many complaints but they were at least not so serious that we in the Republic have suffered in consequence to such an extent as far as our cultural wealth is concerned, that we have to be sorry about it to-day. With the passage of time these words will assume their true meaning because we must always bear in mind that the actual judge of these concepts will be the reading, the seeing and the listening public. The public will determine. Our way of life is different from that in other countries. What is good for A may not be good for B. The public itself will give direction. I really want to plead for it that we should not make this legislation narrow. For these reasons I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I cannot support the Minister&#x2019;s objection to the amendment. If the Minister looks at Clause 5 (2) (a), he will see that there, and also further on in the Bill, the word &#x201C;obnoxious&#x201D; is qualified and preceded by the words &#x201C;to the public morals&#x201D;. In Clause 6 we have the same thing. I think it is essential to have uniformity of definition. The Minister is full of fears about &#x201C;foreign culture and foreign conceptions&#x201D; which may enter the country. That is a very dangerous attitude for the country to adopt. Surely we should become acquainted with other cultures.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is not as the Minister put it. But what is culturally obnoxious obviously falls within the concept of &#x201C;obnoxious to the public morals&#x201D;. I cannot imagine anything which is culturally obnoxious which is not obnoxious to the public morals. The Minister has definitely not succeeded in raising any convincing objection to this amendment.</p>

<p>In regard to the name of the proposed Board, I think it is very unfortunate that he chose the words &#x201C;Board of Control over Publications&#x201D;. The question of an appeal to the court is no longer relevant. With a &#x201C;Board of Censors&#x201D; there can also be an appeal to the court. We have become accustomed to boards of control over things like potatoes and maize, but here we are dealing with something more fundamental. We are dealing here with the circulation of ideas, a fundamental freedom. The English equivalent is &#x201C;control&#x201D;, which according to English dictionaries has the meaning &#x201C;to dominate; to regulate One does not get the same feeling from the name of &#x201C;Board of Censors&#x201D;. The feeling one gets when one talks about a Board of Control is that of control in advance, but the name &#x201C;Censor Board&#x201D; presupposes in the mind of the ordinary man the elimination of that which is morally obnoxious and indecent. We are already faced with the position in our <span class="col_1107-1108" refersTo="page_0568"/>country of far-reaching control over the everyday matters in the life of every citizen, more so than in any other country in the world. That already creates a very bad impression of South Africa in the outside world. Now we are getting a further board of control, over the circulation of ideas! Most comparable countries have a form of censorship against indecency, and nobody objects to the existence of the Board of Censors as we have it. (The objections which exist are to the way in which it carries out its duties.) But to come along now with a new and more comprehensive Board of Control over the circulation of ideas is just adding fuel to the fire of the criticism we experience abroad!</p>

<p>Let me come to the assistance of the hon. member. Clauses 5 and 6 refer to the control of domestic publications. There is reference to domestic publications and then it is qualified. The control of foreign publications is provided for in Clause 20 and there is no reference to morals; there is no qualification that it is simply morally obnoxious. There is therefore nothing wrong with the Bill. Its logic is 100 per cent correct. The definition is quite in order. The hon. member paints a picture as if it is logically wrong. In Clauses 5 and 6 provision is made for what is morally obnoxious, but that is in regard to foreign publications; the domestic publications are covered by Clause 20. That is the difference.</p>

<p>I do hope the Minister will reconsider his statement just now on the amendment of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). Throughout the world the word &#x201C;control&#x201D; in the English language has, since the dictatorships, acquired a bad odour. It has got into disrepute. It means that the Government will take charge. The people outside will say that the Government is going to take charge of all publications; the publishers will be told exactly what they will be allowed to publish. Whereas the word &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; in my opinion suggests that the Government will not dictate to people; it will merely say &#x201C;You shall not publish certain things which are offensive, obscene or immoral&#x201D;. In other words: You can publish what you like provided you do not break the law laid down in this Bill. We are not going to tell you what you must do, but we will see to it that you do not publish anything offensive or harmful to public morals. The word &#x201C;control&#x201D;, as I have said, got into bad odour particularly during the dictatorships in Germany where they tried to control the lives of everybody. Art which was in no way offensive was not allowed because it was modern art, surrealist art and nobody was allowed to paint like that. Jazz music, you may not like it, but the fact is that there is nothing immoral about it, was not allowed. Because it was not traditional music nobody was allowed to compose that type of music and nobody was allowed to play it. They said to the women: Your place is in the kitchen; your place is to look after the family; you must not go into public life. You shall not wear lipstick. In other words, controlling the person&#x2019;s life from birth to death. Whereas what we are trying to do here is to prevent the public being able to get immoral books and literature, things which are likely to break down the family life. It is merely to censor what is made public and not to dictate to the individual what he shall do. He is free to do what he likes except that he must not break the law. I do hope, therefore, that the Minister will reconsider the matter. All I am thinking about is that this will create a bad impression of South Africa.</p>

<p>The amendment of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) really surprises one. He alleges that it will sound better and will be more acceptable to foreign countries if we use the word &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; instead of the word &#x201C;control&#x201D;. The newspapers which support the United Party and which have attacked this Bill have made a point of one thing and that is to give the Bill the worst possible name because they want to tell the outside world that it is a censorship Bill; that periodicals are now going to be censored in South Africa! To argue that the word &#x201C;control&#x201D; has a stronger or less acceptable connotation than the word &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; is something that I cannot understand. I would almost go as far as to say that no matter how good the intentions of some of them are, the newspapers are behind this movement which hon. members have set in motion, a movement which was started by hon. members in the Select Committee. Behind it all there is the idea of a campaign against South Africa abroad because they want to give the Bill the worst possible name.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) said that we must go back to the derivation of the word. But before I do so I would like to indicate to him in which other countries legislation exists to exercise control and even censorship, but where the bodies exercising such powers are not called censorship boards. In the State of Georgia the body which exercises control and even censorship over publications is not called a censorship board. It is called &#x201C;The State Literature Commission&#x201D;. In Queensland this legislation is called &#x201C;objectionable Literature Act&#x201D;. They also use the wide term &#x201C;Objectionable&#x201D;. They do not have a board of censors but they have &#x201C;A Literature Board of Review &#x201D;.</p>

<p>Nor of &#x201C;censorship!&#x201D; I contend that the word &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; is much stronger and will do far more harm abroad, because this not a board of censorship. We emphasized that fact during the second reading debate. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) said that we must consider the derivation of the word; we must look at the Latin word; the person who had to watch over the morals of the people was called a censor. Mr. Chairman, if in all cases, we have to go back to the derivation of a word, then no White Englishman ought to have the name &#x201C;Black&#x201D; and no White Afrikaner ought to have the name &#x201C;Malan&#x201D; because &#x201C;Malan&#x201D; also means black, nor should he have the name &#x201C;Brown&#x201D;. It is stupid to say that because a censor existed in Roman Law this control board must also be called a censorship board. That is absolute nonsense.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say a few words to the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson). He referred to Clauses 5 and 6. In pursuance of what the hon. the Minister said I want to add that the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) should read Clauses 5 and 6 where in certain paragraphs he will find the expression &#x201C;offensive to public morals&#x201D;. In those two clauses he will find a long list of things which can be regarded as being indecent and amongst them there is one provision which reads &#x201C;if it offends public morals&#x201D;. There is a long list but there the relevant provision reads &#x201C;offensive to public morals&#x201D;. That covers the whole series enumerated in Clauses 5 and 6, and it also covers imported matter; there one cannot insert this restriction. Because what does it really mean? What do the terms &#x201C;morally offensive&#x201D; which the hon. member proposed on the Select Committee&#x2014;and &#x201C;offensive to public morals&#x201D; actually mean? If it means anything it does not restrict the meaning. If it restricts the meaning then it does not cover the field that has to be covered, the field which we want to cover in this Bill.</p>

<p>Before I deal with the remarks made by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) I would just in passing like to say to the hon. member for Middellan de (Mr. van der Merwe) that the difference between objectionable and morally objectionable can be put in the following few words: His views on Graaff&#x2019;s Pool are objectionable&#x2014; but they are not necessarily morally objectionable.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Fort Beaufort says that the word &#x201C;censor&#x201D; is stricter than &#x201C;control&#x201D; or &#x201C;control board&#x201D;. He seems to find the word &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; objectionable. I wonder whether the hon. member for Fort Beaufort has forgotten that he was at one time a member of the Censor Board?

<p>We had another Bill before this House; as a matter of fact we have had four different Bills dealing with this subject before this House. The one which was introduced in 1961 specifically provided for a Censor Board. That Bill was introduced by the Minister himself, and he made no objection then to the words &#x201C;Censor Board&#x201D;. It maintained the existing Censor Board under the 1931 Act. The hon. member for Fort Beaufort was chairman of the Select Committee on that Bill yet he made no objection to that particular part of the Bill which accepted the old Censor Board. It is another board of control that this Bill is now creating, and I do say that the words &#x201C;control board&#x201D; have a bad connotation, a bad odour amongst the people of South Africa. As a matter of fact. Sir. the hon. the Minister in coming with the words &#x201C;control board&#x201D;, is going back in this particular Bill to that very obnoxious first Bill which he presented to the House. That particular one had a board of control in it and he knows the furore there was in the country amongst all sections of the population about that board. Now the Minister tells us that a board of control is much milder than a censor board, because under this particular board of control there is an appeal to the courts, whereas under a censorship board there would not be such an appeal. Mr. Chairman, under that Bill of 1960 which he presented to this House there was no appeal to the courts either and that, too, was a Bill which aimed at instituting a board of control. As a matter of fact, in this particular Bill which we have before us there is still no appeal to the courts from decision of the control board when it comes to film censorship.</p>

There are weekly papers, trade journals, religious weeklies and religious monthlies who are not members of the NPU.</p>

<p>I think the debate which has been held here this afternoon on the question of whether this board should be called a board of censorship or a board of control has really been a very small storm in a very small teacup and I want to come back now to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) and tell him how completely wrong he is in regard to this matter. He wants to call it a board of censorship and he quoted to us from a dictionary what the definition of &#x201C;censor&#x201D; actually is. I looked it up in Chamber&#x2019;s Twentieth Century Dictionary and, just as he said, I found this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A &#x201C;censor&#x201D; is an officer who kept account of the property of Roman citizens, imposed taxes and watched over their morals.</block>

<p>That is quite true, but there is another definition of &#x201C;censors&#x201D; which provides fundamental proof why one cannot call this Bill a Censorship Bill and why one cannot call this board a censorship board, and that is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A &#x201C;censor&#x201D; is an officer who examines books, papers, telegrams, plays, letters, etc., before they are published, acted or delivered.</block>

<p>The only section of the work of this board which can possibly fall under the definition of &#x201C;censorship board&#x201D; is the section which deals with films. The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) asked the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) why he did not object to the term &#x201C;censorship board&#x201D; when he was serving on the Censorship Board. The reason is very simple. He did not object to it because it was a censorship board. A censorship board is a board which has to censor anything, whether it be a film &#x2026;</p>

<p>This incident helps me a great deal. If we had a board to prevent the hon. member for Swellendam in advance from walking across in front of me. it would be a censorship board, but once he has walked across in front of me you, Mr. Chairman, instruct him to go back and in this way you, Mr. Chairman, are not a censor but a controller, a chairman. Nothing can better illustrate what I now want to say. The reason why the Film Censorship Board was called a censorship board was because before a film was shown to the public, the Board viewed the film and could cut out what it wanted to and laid down certain rules; or it could say that the film should not be shown at all. Therefore in this respect I agree with the hon. member for Porth Elizabeth (South) in so far as this board has to deal with films. It is a censorship board in a restrictive sense of the word. But when it comes to publications, this board cannot take a publication and cut certain things out of it. That it cannot do. The law makes no provision for it and so it is not a censorship board.</p>

<p>Yes, it was not we who asked for it but it was the unanimous request of the film industry that the position should remain as it is at the moment and they said that they were all completely satisfied with it. Now the hon. member wants us to call it a censorship board because it will have a nicer sound in the ears of the world. But how does the word &#x201C;censor&#x201D; sound in the ears of the outside world? Censorship means only one thing and that is what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) apparently cannot understand, namely, that before something is published, before something is distributed, before anything is delivered, it goes to a person, to a censor, and he decides whether that thing can be published or whether it can be delivered. The only portion of the Bill where this applies is in connection with films, and the film industry asked for it themselves. But there is not one single item in a publication in regard to which the censorship board can decide in advance: &#x201C;Very well; we will cut this out or that out or allow this or that&#x201D;, because this board does not have the power. That is why one cannot call this a censorship board and may not call it that in all fairness because a censorship board is an &#x201C;officer who examines books, papers, telegrams, plays, etc., before they are published, acted and delivered &#x201D;. <span class="col_1113-1114" refersTo="page_0571"/>Therefore, I do think that the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) must leave this matter be. But I am a terribly suspicious person and the hon. member of all people must forgive me for being so suspicious. I am afraid that if the hon. the Minister dares to accept this amendment to have this body called a board of censors, and a report appears to-morrow in the newspapers of the world that this Government has appointed a board of censors, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) will then incite the whole world by saying: &#x201C;Do you see; that is just what we warned against; this Government is introducing political censorship in South Africa; they are not going to allow any newspaper, any periodical, any written document to be released to the world and they are going to allow no criticism of the Government until it has first of all been approved by the censorship board&#x201D;, The hon. member must not blame me if I have that suspicion because he is the man who said that the main purpose of this Bill was political censorship, is that not true? Why does he want it to be called a censorship board? He knows that ordinary publications cannot be censored by this board.</p>

This board simply cannot do that. It is not a censorship board which has any authority over publications and can say: &#x201C;You may not publish this until we have approved of it&#x201D;. All that this board can say is that a film may not be shown if the board has not approved of it or expunged what it has wanted to expunge. That is the position.

<block name="quote">In line 25, after &#x201C;newspaper&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;magazine or periodical&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The definition in sub-section (8) gives exemption to any newspaper from the provisions of this proposed measure. In his second reading speech, the hon. the Minister was at pains to explain why he was granting this exemption to newspapers. He stated that the Newspaper Press Union had for itself accepted a code of conduct in the publication of newspapers, which, the hon. the Minister attempted to indicate, was similar to the definition of what may constitute &#x201C;undesirability&#x201D; in publications in the Bill before us. I want to submit to the hon. the Minister that if he accepts the code as laid down by the Newspaper Press Union, then the Minister can accept this amendment. I have before me the constitution of the Board of Reference which was approved by the Newspaper Press Union. The Minister has a fair knowledge of the code that was accepted because he approved of it himself. I am going to read to the House the first-stated object of this Board of Reference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To assist in maintaining the character of the South African daily, weekly and periodical Press in accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards by obtaining the voluntary adherence by proprietors and editors and their staffs and all other journalists working in the Republic to the code of conduct as set out in Annexure A.</block>

<p>But, Sir, it would seem ridiculous that we should be prepared to grant an exemption to the newspapers only when the majority of the magazine and periodical Press of our country is published by members of the Newspaper Press Union. It would seem on the face of it ridiculous to think that a newspaper proprietor would be prepared to maintain in the publication of his newspaper this code to which he has voluntarily subscribed, but in respect of his magazine or a periodical published by him, he would not apply the same code. I would ask the hon. Minister therefore to consider acceptance of this amendment on the basis that it will free from any form of control by the Publications Board the magazine and periodical Press of our country.</p>

<p>Now I know that the hon. the Minister will reply that there are certain exemptions, that there are magazines and periodicals published in our country whose proprietors are not members of the Newspaper Press Union. That is correct. He may also say that there are periodicals and magazines published of an undesirable nature in our country. I have a specimen here, a publication which I do not think is entirely desirable, and which, as far as I am aware is not a member of the Newspaper Press Union, a publication called &#x201C;Fyn Goud&#x201D;, a well-known publication. I went to the trouble to examine one particular issue of this publication. I cannot say in this House that the contents make an entirely desirable form of publication, where for example you have provocative pictures in the nude of no less than seven in one issue, of the female form in a very provocative form of no less than 12, and five short stories with descriptions of lovemaking which one can hardly describe as desirable. No respectable member of the Newspaper Press Union will maintain or subscribe to a publication of this nature. I should like to put this very pertinent point to the hon. the Minister: <span class="col_1115-1116" refersTo="page_0572"/>Would the Minister say that a publication such as for example &#x201C;Rooi Rose&#x201D; or &#x201C;Die Huisgenoot&#x201D; (which is owned by the Nasionale Pers), or for instance &#x201C;Personality&#x201D; must first, before they see the light of day, receive the stamp of approval of a control board before any readers or the public of South Africa enjoy the contents? Is there any single example that the Minister can produce before the House to-night to indicate that any issue of these well-known national publications have at any time published material and contents equivalent to what for instance is published in this issue of &#x201C;Fyn Goud&#x201D; that I have here? Because if the Minister can show that, then I would say that his rejection of the amendment that we have moved is justified. But I do not think that the Minister or any member on the Government side can produce any example of any one of the reputable national weeklies or periodicals of our country that has at any time over-stepped the mark and published matter of an undesirable and pornographic nature. We have the evidence of the Cronje Commission that in certain fields of Afrikaans publishing there were certain degrees of undesirability. In all the concerns that publish Afrikaans literature of a periodical and magazine nature only two examples were found which published matter of an undesirable nature. Perhaps the hon. member for Vereeniging can give us more information in that regard and of those particular firms. Maybe he has got more information on the subject. But the Minister says that he is prepared to exempt any newspaper from the provisions of this Bill. But then the Minister must also accept the amendment I move here, to exempt the magazine and periodical Press, because if the Government and the Minister are prepared to trust newspaper proprietors and editors in respect of one medium that they publish, then why not in respect of the other media that they publish? Mr. Chairman the position can arise where a newspaper editor can publish matter, pornographic, in an advertisement form, or of film stars which to any member of the Board, or any three members of the Board that the Minister is appointing, may appear if published in a magazine or periodical form as being objectionable or offensive to public morals in our country. You would then have the obviously ridiculous position that a newspaper can with impunity publish matter of this kind, but the magazine owned by the same proprietor, the same company, cannot do so for fear of the censure of a board of control. If the hon. Minister does not wish to make this legislation absolutely ridiculous, and if he wants to give it at least an appearance of sincerity, in an attempt to combat the publication of pornographic matter, then he should accept the amendment that I have moved.</p>

And moreover, they thought so much of me then that the first time that I walked into the Transvaal Provincial Council, they put me on the Executive Committee of that Provincial Council!

<p>I want to ask him whether he knows of the negotiations between the National Press Union and the Select Committee and the Government? Does he know that they asked to be excluded in order to eliminate any suggestion of that nature? The Government did not ask for it but the chairman of the National Press Union asked for it in order to eliminate any suggestion that this Bill had the slightest political motive. They said that to avoid that suspicion, all the newspapers belonging to the National Press Union should be excluded because they print 99 per cent of all the criticism of the Government. Does he know that? I want to ask him now as a sensible person, or rather as a person who considers himself to be sensible, to answer me honestly. Of course, if he goes on as he is going on now, he will be the only man who considers himself to be a sensible person. I want to ask him: If this Government is willing to exclude 99.9 per cent of <span class="col_1117-1118" refersTo="page_0573"/>the criticism passed on it, what possible right does the hon. member have to say that this Bill makes for political censorship? I say that it is political dishonesty of the worst nature to insinuate something of that kind. But I do not want to take so much notice of him. He has been boring me now for some time. I want to return to a matter which has also been boring me for some time and I want to put this question to the hon. member for Turffontein: Who asked him to move here that periodicals should be excluded? Did the National Press Union direct that request to him? They asked that the newspapers should be excluded but they never asked that their periodicals should be excluded. Who came to see the hon. member to ask that periodicals should be excluded? Nobody did, but he is so brash, so big for his boots and he makes such a fuss that one would swear that he was an important man and one would think that he represented the National Press Union himself.</p>

<p>Is it being personal, Mr. Chairman, if I say that he thinks that he is an important man? He is the only man who thinks so but nevertheless he does think so. Mr. Chairman, this is a serious matter and I do not want to be personal but nobody asked him to raise this matter here. The National Press Union was very clear in its request, which was that the newspapers should be excluded. It should therefore be obvious that this Bill is not intended to impose any political censorship or Press censorship at all. And so they were all excluded and nobody asked that periodicals should also be excluded. Why should the periodicals not be subject to the norms of decency laid down in this Bill? Sir, an effort is being made here by the Opposition, led by an hon. member for whom I have great respect but from whom I did not expect this, the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman), to try to tell the world&#x2014;this forms part of his amendment&#x2014;that this Bill seeks to impose political censorship, as the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said. One simply cannot read that into this Bill and the National Press Union did not read it into this Bill either. They said that the only possibility of its being read into the Bill was when their newspapers which were responsible for 99 per cent of the criticism of the Government were included. That was when they saw the danger. Then the Government said: We will exclude all newspapers from the provisions of this Bill, and yet the hon. member for Bezuidenhout still comes along and says that political censorship is being imposed in this way.</p>

<p>This is one of the happy occasions when I do not need a seconder and it does not matter one iota to me whether anybody supports me or not. I am going to put my own point of view. As far as the other two amendments to this clause are concerned, I am going to support the amendment proposed by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), mainly because of the explanation given by the hon. the Minister which I think was so absurd. He said that the word &#x201C;moral&#x201D; should be left out because he is against any sort of literature coming into the country which might have &#x201C;a foreign attitude&#x201D;. As far as I am concerned cultures have developed by the interchange of ideas, from one country to the other, from one race to the other, from one nation to the other, and to me there is nothing that could depict better the closed mind of this Government than to feel that anything which has &#x201C;a foreign attitude&#x201D; and which comes to this country should be harmful to this country. If our values are intrinsically good, if our attitudes are intrinsically good, then they can withstand surely the onslaught of so-called &#x201C;foreign attitudes&#x201D;, and I believe in the exchange and interchange of ideas between the different peoples of this world. Therefore I shall certainly support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Germiston (District).</p>

<p>There is another amendment moved by the hon. member for Turffontein and I intend to support that as well. I believe that as much as can possibly be exempted from the purview of this Bill should be exempted. I do not take the same attitude as the hon. member for Vereeniging about the National Press Union, as he knows&#x2014;he heard me during the second-reading debate, when I expressed my views about the exclusion of the newspapers belonging to the National Press Union. Here, Sir. the magazines and other publications belonging to the National Press Union are included within the purview of this Bill. Now it may very well be true that 90 per cent or 99 per cent of the criticism against this Government appear in newspapers belonging to the National Press Union, but that is by no means as far as I am concerned, the reason why other newspapers should be included in this Bill, and why magazines should be included and why any publication for that matter which can be critical of this Government should be included. In other words, as long as the definition clause of what is undesirable remains what it is, I shall vote for anything which excludes or exempts magazines, newspapers, objects or anything else that you wish to describe as falling with the terms of this Bill, from the purview of the Bill.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come back to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s reply on my amendment as regards the title to be given to this board. The hon. the Minister completely overlooked the argument that was made that the legislative usage in this country has given a specific significance to the words &#x201C;control board&#x201D;. That it has a significance, as other hon. members on this side have indicated is certainly true so far as the external situation is concerned, but also internally. Because there was a time when the words &#x201C;control board&#x201D; had such bad odour in South Africa that an effort was made to change them to &#x201C;regulatory boards&#x201D;. There was an effort to change from &#x201C;beheerraad&#x201D; to &#x201C;regulatory board&#x201D;, to get away from this sort of stigma of &#x201C;control&#x201D; which was implied in the name itself. Also the hon. Minister overlooks entirely that existing legislation uses the words &#x201C;board of censorship&#x201D;. So there is no reason for departure from it because what this Board is going to do is merely an enlargement, an extension of what the existing board does. So much for that aspect of the matter. I come then to the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). As has already been pointed out. Clauses 5 and 6 include a provision which makes it quite clear that what is aimed at is what is indecent, obscene or morally objectionable. The Minister&#x2019;s retort to that is that we are here dealing with what comes in from outside. But surely the purpose of the legislation when we started, at any rate, was to <span class="col_1121-1122" refersTo="page_0575"/>bring about a parallel situation, that whatever supervision was exercised over the external material should also be exercised over the internal material. So the argument that the hon. the Minister has used is completely invalid, in my opinion. It is perfectly true that the appeal to the court is a desirable feature of this Bill, but we must not make too much of it, as the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) are making. A right of appeal is being regarded by the Minister and by that hon. member as a concession granted by Parliament. Surely a right of appeal to a court is a right which Parliament should recognize at all times.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>But it has not been a concession for 30 years.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The right should be recognized and Parliament is the place where the right should be recognized. The point why it is necessary to insert the word &#x201C;moral&#x201D; is that Parliament&#x2019;s legislation should be so clear and specific as to reduce the need to go to appeal. This question of appeal is being used here as if it were some god sent sort of remedy which can be used with great ease. Anyone who knows the situation knows that it is difficult and costly to appeal, and I say it is the duty of Parliament not to add to the need for appeal to a court but to reduce it. That is why you want to be specific in your legislation and that is why it is necessary to insert the words suggested by the hon. member for Germiston (District). Now I have no doubt myself that when the courts come to interpret the matter they will use the <i>ejusdem generis</i> rule of interpretation and will apply the general word in the context of the specific words, but I do not think we should allow that situation to develop. I think it is the duty of this House to make its legislation clear and specific.</p>

<p>That brings me to the hon. member for Vereeniging. Instead of ranting as he did, now and during the second-reading debate here is a matter where he can establish his sincerity in saying that political censorship is to have no part in this Bill by supporting the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District). He will then demonstrate his sincerity and I challenge and invite him therefore to do so.</p>

<p>I want to deal first of all with the last argument of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman). To invite the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) to support this amendment and to think that in that way he was going to prove that we were honest when we said that there was no political censorship embodied in this Bill, was just so much bluff. Hon. members on that side are anxious to be able to say that there will be political censorship in South Africa once this Bill has been passed. This hon. member proved repeatedly that they would like to find something to be able to make propaganda which will be detrimental to South Africa and the thing that they want to use is censorship, political censorship.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging was invited to support this argument and so to prove that there was no political censorship, that there will be no Press censorship, and because he is not a political hitch-hiker, like the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson), the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) ought to know better than the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, of whom we take no notice. He ought to know better and realize that this Bill has no intention of improving Press censorship. Nowhere is censorship intended against the Press if it publishes political reports. But hon. members have moved this amendment to call this body a censorship board for that one reason only. Now the hon. member says that the expression &#x201C;control board&#x201D; has already left a bad taste in South Africa. When we read our statutes, we see that we have numbers of control boards, not only the Egg Control Board and the Maize Control Board and the Meat Control Board, and there is no question of the expression &#x201C;control board&#x201D; having left a bad taste. This is not a censorship board; it is exclusively a control board because a censorship board can expunge sections as it does in regard to films. In that respect it does act as a censorship board and it does so at the specific request of the film industry, but not as far as entertainments or publications are concerned. In this respect it acts exclusively as a control board. Now the hon. member wants us to insert the word &#x201C;morally&#x201D; in line 52. The Minister has already pointed out that we have made provision for this in Clauses 5 and 6. But I want to point out that one does not only have undesirable publications in connection with morals; one has them in connection with religion and national relationships and that is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister not to accept that amendment.</p>

<p>I wish I could get it into the mind of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) that we have no intention of substituting the words &#x201C;censor board&#x201D; for &#x201C;control board&#x201D;, because we in any way wish to harm South Africa overseas. Can he not realize that the name &#x201C;censor board&#x201D; is the existing name to-day and has been the name since 1931, and that there was nothing wrong with that name in the past? Can he not realize that his own Government came with a Bill in the beginning of last year <span class="col_1123-1124" refersTo="page_0576"/>in which they wanted a censor board? Can he not realize that the great objection to the name &#x201C;control board&#x201D; arose from that first obnoxious Bill which was introduced originally?</p>

<p>I wish to support the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) in inserting the words &#x201C;magazine or periodical&#x201D; in this particular sub-section. This is the only clause under which it can be done and therefore I should like to say something on behalf of all those newspapers and periodicals which do not fall under the Newspaper Press Union. I believe that this clause does not go far enough. It excludes newspapers which are members of the Press Union, but it does not offer any hope or consolation to the vast number of small weekly papers or monthly publications which are not members of the Press Union. There are papers of a political nature. I am associated with one. There are also papers of a political nature published by the Government. These papers are not being excluded from the provisions of this Bill. You can imagine the difficulty in which a trade journal or a small religious journal would be through not being excluded from the provisions of the Bill. Imagine the difficulties they would have if they had to decide, e.g., whether a certain article was bringing any section of the inhabitants into contempt or was harming the relations between different sections of the inhabitants, or was prejudicial to the safety or the welfare of the State. What about a cartoon in a weekly which to-day can be regarded as bringing a section of the population into contempt? What about an article on the lack of preparedness in the Defence Force which could be interpreted as being harmful to the State or the general welfare, although there was no such real intention?</p>

<p>We must realize that the small weeklies and the trade publications are already subject to a vast number of laws and regulations and that if they were to be excluded from the provisions of this Bill, as I plead, the Minister could find some other measure to apply to them, and word this clause differently. Even if they are excluded, such weeklies and newspapers would still under existing laws be subject to the following: They still could not offend against the security of the State, public confidence in the institutions of the State, the dignity of the State, the reputation and good name of citizens, the public peace, the security of personal property, the dignity of the courts and of Parliament, public and private morals, the safe custody of State secrets, harmonious relations between the White and non-White races. All these are in the existing laws. In other words, these weeklies will not be given free rein to do as they wish. I therefore plead with the Minister that something should be done about those other publications. This Bill will make the life of people who write in such papers extremely difficult, and I am one of them. The idea behind excluding newspapers published by members of the Press Union is of course that there is a Press Board with a code of conduct for members of the Newspaper Press Union. The hon. member for Vereeniging seemed to be quite satisfied with the idea of this Press Board and its code of conduct, although I remember hearing him say during the second reading &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Oh! I was under the impression that the hon. member was not at all satisfied with this Press Board. But why then does he come here and try to defend the proposal that newspapers of the Press Union should be excluded from these provisions? After all, this was put in at the request of the newspapers and because the Select Committee was satisfied that newspapers would be subject to their own code of conduct. But now the hon. member says the whole thing is a stupid idea. I think we need an explanation from the hon. member.</p>

<p>I wish to raise another matter. I want to refer to Clause 1 (1) (viii) (g), which says that a publication or object includes &#x201C;any record or other contrivance or device in or on which sound has been recorded for reproduction&#x201D;. I should like to know from the Minister to what extent broadcasts fall under the provisions of this Bill. As the Minister knows, 95 per cent of what we hear over the radio to-day are transcriptions on tape recordings or records. Will those recordings also fall under this provision? We were told on the Select Committee that there would be great problems in regard to broadcasting should they be included under this Bill. No less a person that the Director-General of the S.A.B.C. informed the Select Committee that if television were to be introduced in South Africa the S.A.B.C. would have to ask to be excluded from the provisions of this Bill. What is the Minister&#x2019;s attitude to that?</p>

<p>There is another point I should like to make. I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister what was said by the S.A. Association of Arts, the S.A. Kunsvereniging, in connection with sub-sections (d), (e) and (f). They are of opinion that the plastic arts should be excluded, in other words, that these particular sub-sections should be excluded from the provisions of this Bill. Now when one finds a prominent man such as Mr. Justice Marais and men like Senator D. H. van Zijl and Professor A. L. Meiring asking for the exclusion of these particular plastic arts, it is indeed a matter to which the Minister should give his attention. In its memorandum the Association of Arts said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We do find it a pity that, presumably for the purposes of an all-embracing measure, the plastic arts with which we are particularly concerned are being mentioned specifically and in detail in the Bill. It might give the impression that plastic artists in this country have in the past indulged in practices necessitating a measure of this kind. Such an impression would be wholly unfounded.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E.</p>

<p>G. Malan) is now dealing with definitions and really he wants provision to be made in the Bill for the sort of decisions this Board will have to take in regard to different types of works of art. Can I not make the hon. member understand that Clause 1 (viii) from (a) to (g) gives a summary of any type of publication or subject which may exist, but that it does not give a definition of when it is indecent or obnoxious? That is what the hon. member should realize. If the Bill does not include every possible gramophone record or any sort of picture which can be produced in the various types of art, whether it be a woodcut, or whether it be plastic art, it cannot be adjudged whether those things are indecent or obnoxious, and if they are not, why is the hon. member afraid of it? Are these now arguments to use in regard to definitions?</p>

<p>I now come to the amendment of the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant), which the hon. member also supports. If we exclude the newspapers belonging to the Press Union on account of the code they have drawn up themselves, why not also exclude periodicals and books? Why cannot everything be excluded? But the hon. member who is or was a newspaper reporter himself surely knows that a newspaper serves a totally different purpose from a periodical. A newspaper has the right to criticize and to publish news. It renders a service to the public, and because the newspapers themselves felt that their own house was not in order they drew up a code and decided amongst themselves, without any pressure from the side of the Government, that they would apply this code of behaviour to themselves. But periodicals serve a totally different purpose, just like stories and books and poems and other works of art. They are quite different from newspapers. But it is not we who say so. What did the Cronje Commission say, which is accepted by the hon. member for Turffontein as being a very thorough investigation? In regard to monthly periodicals they say in paragraph 3172 that first of all attention must be drawn to the fact that an extraordinary number of undesirable illustrations was found in articles, and then they continued to say that this should be regarded as a matter for concern. I do not want to waste the time of the Committee but I want to refer further to paragraphs 3172,3173, 3174 and 3186. which say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the weekly and monthly periodicals are compared in respect of all undesirable illustrations then the occurrence per 100 issues is respectively 63.3 and 329.3. Therefore in the monthly publications there are five times as many undesirable illustrations as in the weekly publications.</block>

<p>We are dealing here with a report and this Bill is based on the Cronje Report&#x2014;not on the legislation it proposed, but on this thorough investigation which was made, and if it were not for the fact that the Press Union framed a voluntary code and offered to discipline themselves, the newspapers would not have been excluded. But what the Government was prepared to do when this legislation was submitted, and before the Select Committee had yet completed its work, was to say: We will give you a chance.</p>

<p>I say the Government&#x2019;s standpoint was to give the Press Union an opportunity to show that they themselves could apply this discipline, and they are busy doing it. There have been test cases. I cannot say what the result will be. I wish them all success. But the hon. member for Orange Grove should remember that all the other little publications he mentioned here which will fall under the control of this Board need have no fears if they do not commit the sins laid down in the Bill; and if they commit those sins in the opinion of the Board they can still go to court to prove that it is not so. They have nothing to fear. Many of these small news sheets and periodicals are very decent and they can continue as before. There is no witch-hunt in progress and there is no threat to the continued existence of these publications. The hon. member became hot under the collar when he should not even have felt a cool breeze.</p>

<p>I cannot add anything to what was said by the other hon. members. I regret that I cannot under any circumstances accept these two amendments to the first clause, because by doing so I would be stigmatizing myself and my party as being inconsistent, in the first place in regard to the name. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) also made a second attempt, but I think he was then even more at sea than he was the first time. The hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) fortunately spoke only once and I have an idea that he is convinced now as the result of the fact that in Clauses 5 and 6 there is reference to morals and that in so far as domestic control is concerned it is a totally different story from what is contained in Clause 20 which deals with the control of foreign matter. I think the hon. member is convinced that he should not continue with it further.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) of <span class="col_1127-1128" refersTo="page_0578"/>course misunderstood me completely when I spoke about cultures. There is much to be learnt from other cultures and we are still learning from them every day. I think we in this country are more keen to learn than anybody else in the world in so far as this is concerned. We are not as stupid as the hon. member wishes to pretend we are. But we get foreign things, unusual relations, e.g. the relation between White and non-White, which are not obnoxious in a country with a predominating number of Whites and only a small handful of non-Whites but which in this country are detrimental to peace and good order, and one will have to measure with two yardsticks. We would never dream of producing something like that in our own country. But when we come to foreign literature and objects we very definitely have our own mode of life here, and when we come into conflict with one another, and there is a conservative as well as a more liberal point of view in regard to the same matter, the court is there to lay down the yardstick, and whoever is in the minority will gradually have to adapt themselves so that we can build up the necessary criteria. Of course that will always vary; it will never remain static. As times change, so people change. But we must take care not to land in the position where we also will have to cry out &#x201C;<i>O tempora</i>! <i>O mores</i>!&#x201D; Because we are now trying to expedite what should really be left to evolution, and we want to create a revolution here because we think that these matters will be judged too conservatively. We want to set up beacons here and be revolutionary, whereas we could leave the matter safely to evolution in the course of time. Those standards will be built up. We have ensured that these will not be political people, although the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that it was a political board appointed by a political Minister. But we can elevate ourselves beyond that, to a greater extent than we could under the Censorship Act of 1931, and we can obtain court decisions which will build up those standards for us.</p>

<p>I am very happy to hear those groans. I want to ask the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) something. A little earlier on you, Sir, called him to order, whereupon he said that he was not trying to be personal. He is exactly like the central character in a play which has recently been very successful in America, called &#x201C;How to Succeed in Business without Trying&#x201D;. He was not trying to be personal, but instead of devoting his time to clarifying the clauses which this side of the House seeks to amend, he made a personal attack on two hon. members.</p>

<p>The name of this Board, which according to the Minister should rightly be called a Publications Control Board, has been said by the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) to be something which is in the interest of South Africa because he sought to prove &#x2026;</p>

<p>That argument has been used before.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am merely drawing attention to an argument in order to refute it, and therefore I must first state it. If the point at issue is whether we should find a title for this Board under any name merely to make it look better to the outside world, then I do not believe the Minister himself would suggest that that is what he tries to do. He has said in effect that this is not a board which will censor, and therefore it should not be called a Censor Board, but a Board of Control. But in the first place the word &#x201C;publication&#x201D; surely cannot be held in the mind of the Minister to infer films, because you never publish a film; you produce it and distribute it, and exhibit it, but you do not &#x201C;publish&#x201D; it. Therefore, particularly because this Board is to take the place of the original Board of Censors which dealt with films, I think it is right to argue that this is the correct name for the Board. The Minister likes to use the word &#x201C;control&#x201D; in terms of what he said in the second reading. I must remind the Minister that he said that the controlled man is a free man, whilst the uncontrolled man is a barbarian. He has therefore now ushered in a new era for South Africa, not the era of the Comman Man but of the Controlled Man.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The fact is that essentially the object of the Bill is to control the people and their thinking, and every form of creative work in this country. However, I will not press that point any further.</p>

<p>As regards sub-sec. (2) (b), where the hon. member for Germiston (District) moved that the word &#x201C;morally&#x201D; be inserted before the word &#x201C;objectionable&#x201D;, I would like to examine the Minister&#x2019;s suggestion that the inclusion of the word &#x201C;morally&#x201D;, when, therefore, &#x201C;morally objectionable&#x201D; would be the criterion, would not make it possible to exclude from South Africa what he called a foreign culture or an alien culture. I think he should have amplified that, because to say that merely because a culture is not indigenous to this country it is therefore an alien culture, and then to come to the next conclusion, which is that you must have some sort of legislation in this clause to exclude it, is surely not the Minister&#x2019;s intention! I want to point out to him that in his other role of Minister of Education, Arts and Science, he is doing a great deal to establish in South Africa what is essentially a foreign or alien culture, and that is, the culture of the Italians in regard to grand opera. So how can anybody say that we must have the <span class="col_1129-1130" refersTo="page_0579"/>right type of legislation to keep out any foreign culture? [Interjections.] Nobody said so, but the Minister in advancing his argument in defence of this clause said it was designed to exclude a foreign culture. I must rest on this submission, that when Van Riebeeck came to the Cape 300 years ago, he did not bring &#x201C;Madame Butterfly&#x201D; with him, (or, if he did so, he kept it very quiet); the point being that what we know in this country about grand opera is in fact due to a foreign culture. I must say, with great respect to the Minister, that to rely on that argument in order to object to the amendment of the hon. member for Germiston (District), lays him wide open to the accusation that this clause is intended to be used in another way, and beyond the scope of the underlying intent of the legislation, which is: to exclude what is morally objectionable, and not to give him the power to exclude anything that is &#x201C;foreign&#x201D; merely because it says here that if it is objectionable for whatsoever reason the Board may exclude it. The Minister said in his second-reading speech that we should come forward with amendments in order to improve the Bill&#x2014;if that is the true position, then I think the Minister must, to some extent, make some concession in regard to this entire Clause 1. and at least agree to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Germiston (District).</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#coertze">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">COERTZE</person>:</from>

<p>I assure you that I will confine myself strictly to the clause. The hon. member for Germiston (District) has got lost amongst the negatives. If one looks at his amendment and at the clause as amended, one finds that in this clause the importer is put on the same footing as a printer or publisher. But now the clause continues to say that in regard to certain objects, certain publications, the importer is not considered to be the printer. In those cases the publisher will be the person who published those books overseas. These publications are those books imported under permit issued in terms of sub-sec. (a), as well as those objects imported under a certificate issued by the Board. Now the hon. member wants to add to that the words, &#x201C;which are not morally obnoxious&#x201D;&#x2014;in other words, those which are obnoxious on other grounds, and in respect of those the importer will still be considered to be the publisher. What he therefore wants to attain by means of his amendment is that those persons who have a testimonial from the Board to the effect that their publications are not morally obnoxious will be exempted, but not the others. But that is precisely what stands here. I therefore think that if we accept his amendment we will probably be even stricter than he would like us to be.</p>

<p>I should now like to come back to the amendment of the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). He says that there is a difference in the emotional content of the words &#x201C;censor&#x201D; and &#x201C;control&#x201D;. According to him, the word &#x201C;censor&#x201D; is less deplorable than the word &#x201C;control&#x201D;. Well, I do not pretend to be an expert in English, but I am able to consult the various dictionaries and encyclopaedia. I did so particularly in the light of the allegations of the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, that man of great principle! He said that we should use the word &#x201C;censor&#x201D; rather than the word &#x201C;control&#x201D;, because otherwise we would create the impression that we want to apply political control or censorship, and we should not create that impression.</p>

<p>According to the dictionaries I consulted, it appears, however, that it is when one uses the words &#x201C;censor&#x201D; or &#x201C;censorship&#x201D; that one gets the opprobrium for which he blames us. In other words he knows that his allegation is wrong, but because he knows that the world will know he is wrong he wants us to use the word which will lend truth to his allegations. I want to prove this to the hon. member.</p>

<p>Well, if I am ridiculous I am in good company. I am in the company of the people who drafted the Oxford Dictionary. If the hon. member thinks he knows more English than they do, he should compile that dictionary. Here are the meanings&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Censor: One who exercises official or officious supervision over morals and conduct.</block>

<p>The word &#x201C;officious&#x201D; means &#x201C;bemoeisiek&#x201D;, or something to that effect. In any case it is a word expressing disapproval. The second meaning of &#x201C;censor&#x201D; is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An official in some countries &#x2026;</block>

<p>Of course the hon. member now wants it here also&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; whose duty it is to inspect all books, journals, dramatic pieces, etc. before publication; to secure that they shall contain nothing immoral, heretical, or offensive to the Government.</block>

<p>I am sorry, but my time is limited. Let me point out further that the third meaning of the word &#x201C;censor&#x201D; in the Oxford Dictionary is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One who judges, or criticizes; one who censures, or blames, or an adverse critic.</block>

<p>That is the meaning, and therefore it is the meaning of the words he wants us to use. The same applies to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South). Contrast that with the word &#x201C;control&#x201D;. It is a much more neutral word. It is used in that way in our own country. We have a board of control over the mealie industry, a board of control over the wheat industry, etc. All these are boards of &#x201C;control Now what is the meaning of the word control &#x201D;?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To check, to verify, and hence to regulate payments, receipts or accounts generally.</block>

<p>It is therefore a neutral word, a word without any unfavourable connotation. A second meaning is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To check by comparison and test the accuracy of statements, stories and their authors.</block>

<p>A third meaning, the derivative meaning and the one we are making use of, is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Hence to take to task, to call to account, to rebuke, to approve.</block>

<p>But that does not mean to say that the connotation is that one blames those people, or rebukes or calls to account those who do not agree with the Government or with whom the Government does not agree. That is inherent in the concept &#x201C;censorship&#x201D;, but not in the word &#x201C;control &#x201D;. Another meaning is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To challenge, to find fault with, to censure, to reprehend, to object to a thing.</block>

<p>That is the wider meaning of the word &#x201C;control&#x201D;, but that is a word which hon. members do not like. What they want is that we should use a word which will give the allegations they make against the Government a semblance of truth.</p>

<p>I am not one who ascribes ulterior motives to my opponents, but I cannot get away from the idea that the Opposition want the Government to use words so that their scandalmongering and vilification of the Government can have a greater semblance of truth than is the case at the moment. We will not allow ourselves to be assisted from the frying pan into the fire.</p>

<p>Objection is taken to the word &#x201C;censor&#x201D;. The Government feels that censorship is much stronger than control. I disagree.

<p>The hon. the Minister gave two reasons, I think, for rejecting my amendment. The first one was the moral code, or the code of reference, which was established by the N.P.U. The major reason he gave for the rejection of my amendment was, however, that exemption from the provisions of this Bill should not be given to magazines and periodicals. He said that in the light of the evidence of undesirability which we have before us in the Cronje Commission&#x2019;s Report would be sufficient justification for including all magazines and periodicals published under the aegis of this board of control. To that end the Minister quoted some extracts from the Report of the Cronje Commission, but I should like to submit that the Minister did not in this respect give the House a true picture. I am sorry to say that. I for my part should like to indicate to the House that the Cronje Commission had a great deal to say about this question of undesirability in magazines and periodicals published within the Union. In fact, if hon. members look at the Report of that Commission, they will find that it deals over several pages with different aspects of undesirability of magazines. The Commission, in fact, carried out a very extensive investigation over a period of some 20 years.</p>

<p>Not satisfied with the general findings, however, the Commission thought it advisable to publish an appendix to its Report indicating how it arrived at their conclusions. I should like, therefore, to ask the Minister why he did not quote some other passages from the findings of this Commission? You see, Sir, the point is a pertinent one that the findings of the Commission in relation to certain magazines&#x2014;weekly magazines and periodicals&#x2014;are precisely the same as its findings in relation to newspapers. Let me quote the relevant paragraphs to the House, Sir, and not the paragraphs which the hon. the Minister quoted but those paragraphs dealing with the question of the undesirability of magazines and periodicals! Let me add this at this point, namely that the Commission on this point did not stop at the bounds of its terms of reference, but went further in that it did not only consider undesirability as such in the fact that material might be pornographic or immoral, but it also considered the question of inferiority of the type of magazine published. Let me now quote to the House what the Commission had to say about weekly magazines, namely paragraph 3,121, p. 44&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the 506 issues of the weekly publications studied &#x2026; only six undesirable articles occurred (1.2 per 100 issues). This must be regarded as a trifling figure. These undesirable articles were all encountered in the post war period.</block>

<block name="quote">3,122 A comparison of the seven weekly magazines &#x2026; reveals that the six undesirable articles occurred in two of them, while the remaining five contained no undesirable articles at all.</block>

<p>In paragraph 3,127 the Commission reported&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the weekly magazines&#x2026; 11 undesirable stories and articles occurred&#x2014;all in the postwar period&#x2014;the incidence being 2.2 per 100 issues, which must be regarded as insignificant.</block>

<p>That is in regard to stories and articles published in so-called weekly magazines. Now, the Minister says that an exemption can be granted to newspapers although not to magazines and periodicals, because of the fact that newspapers have no undesirability at all.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>That was not the only reason I gave.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the other reason. At present I am trying to dispose of the first and major reason the Minister gave for rejecting my amendment, and I am asking why the Minister did not quote these facts to the House. Why did he only quote certain facts from the Commission&#x2019;s Report in respect of monthly magazines which is entirely different and has nothing to do with this amendment. The Minister quoted only one aspect whereas the Report deals with various aspects of undesirability. The paragraphs I have quoted represent the total findings of the Commission in respect of all aspects of undesirability in magazines&#x2014;whether of the written word, illustrated, or with advertisements. Why did the Minister not quote these facts to the House? Why pick out only a portion of the Report, thereby creating an erroneous impression. What I have quoted are the facts. The Minister, on the other hand, picks out one portion of the Report and therewith he tried to bolster up his argument for not accepting this amendment. For that there is very little justification.</p>

<p>The other reason the Minister advanced was that the code of conduct adopted by the N.P.U., was adopted by that body because the newspapers belonging to it realized that their house was not in order. Now, I should like to ask the Minister where any representative of the Press of South Africa made an admission of the fact that they were establishing such a board of reference because they recognized that their house was not in order. The Commission&#x2019;s evidence is very clear in this regard. In this connection I like to quote paragraph 3,223&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nature of the undesirability in newspaper reports. The Commission deems it necessary <span class="col_1135-1136" refersTo="page_0582"/>to record at the very outset that not much that is undesirable occurs in the reporting of newspapers in the Union. In fact, the occurrence of undesirability in this connection must be regarded as trifling.</block>

<p>The Minister stated that the newspapers recognized that their house was not in order. I challenge the Minister on that issue. Some of the prominent newspapers take quite another approach. I believe that the newspapers resorted to this measure in order to protect themselves against any possible action by the Government under legislation of this nature. What they did was an attempt to forestall the Government if it wanted to apply the provisions of the Bill of 1960 to the newspapers of this country, and this was, in fact, the intention. Newspapers were not exempted from the provisions of that Bill and the Minister knows that. The steps taken by the newspapers&#x2014;and not the English language newspapers, but also the Afrikaans language newspapers associated in the same organization&#x2014;were resorted to with the object of protecting themselves. That is very clear from the constitution of this board of reference of which I have here a copy. One of the objects of this board of reference was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To publish periodical reports regarding the work of the board of reference and on any developments which the board regards as inimical to the continuance of a free Press in the Republic.</block>

<p>The preamble contains three &#x201C;whereas&#x201D; paragraphs. The first one states the belief in a free and unfettered Press in this way&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whereas the N.P.U. believes that a free Press which has as its primary function to inform the public accurately&#x2026; on matters of public interest is fundamental to the existence of any democratic State.</block>

<p>With this all of us concur.</p>

<block name="quote">And whereas the newspapers believe that the continuance of a free Press can best be assured by the acceptance by the newspaper proprietors, editors, and journalists of the highest standards of conduct: And whereas it is considered desirable to adopt a voluntary code of conduct and to set up machinery to ensure that that code is respected, this annual congress of the N.P.U. adopts the code of conduct given in Annexure A and creates a board of reference which shall operate according to the rules and with the objects set out below.</block>

<p>Of course, it was done voluntarily but it did so in order to forestall the Government including the definition of a newspaper in this Bill thereby making them subject to the provisions of the Bill. That is why. Why then does the hon. the Minister refuse to accept my amendment when the same proprietors whom he is prepared to trust with a code of reference, cannot be trusted in regard to magazines which they themselves own? Why? Where is the logic of the actions of the Minister? Based on the evidence before us, it is clear that there is no undesirability in this class of literature. Of course, the reason is obvious. Quite contrary to the views of the hon. the Minister, a large number of periodicals and magazines to-day offer comment on national affairs, comment on the social sphere and on religious matters as well as on political matters. It is also clear that the Minister seeks with this board which he seeks to appoint in terms of this clause, a measure of political control, of political intimidation against this particular section of the Press which has a far-reaching and widespread influence amongst the public of South Africa. How, by any measure of logic, can the Minister stand up in this House and say &#x201C;I will trust the newspaper proprietor with this code of conduct in regard to a daily paper, but I will not trust him in regard to magazines which he owns and publishes &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Turffontein has made himself guilty of the very thing he accused me of, namely that he read only paragraphs 3,122 and 3,121 of the Cronje Report which give a picture of only a few of the undesirable things. But he does not read paragraph 3,123. which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Undesirable articles were encountered on a considerable scale in the monthly magazine.</block>

<speech by="#durrant">

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>No, Sir. the hon. member did not say so. He only quoted from paragraphs 3,121 and 3.122, but omitted to read 3,123&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; In the 181 issues examined no fewer than 46 such articles were found (25.4 per 100 issues). During the last two periods (with 34.7 and 36.7 respectively) undesirable articles occurred to a greater extent than in the previous period. If the period as a whole (1944-1955) is reviewed, it may be stated that an upward trend is revealed in the last four years (1952-1955).</block>

<p><span class="col_1137-1138" refersTo="page_0583"/>There is something else the hon. member did not read either. When he read from the code of behaviour he referred to only 1 (c) of the objects, but not to 1 (a) and 1 (b). Now (a) and (b) read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To assist in maintaining the character of the South African daily, weekly and periodical Press, in accordance with the highest professional and commercial standards by obtaining the voluntary adherence by proprietors and editors and their staff and all other journalists working in the Republic, to the code of conduct set out in Annexure &#x201C;A&#x201D;;</block>

<block name="quote">To consider infringements or alleged infringements of the code in respect of matter appearing in publications in South Africa, or matter originating in South Africa appearing in overseas publications, and to take or recommend action in accordance with these rules as a result of such considerations.</block>

<p>These are the two most important objectives and an important admission by the Press Union, and the reason why the Government exempted it from the provisions of this Bill is because they voluntarily admitted that all these things which they mentioned did not redound to the credit of the Press in South Africa. That is what I said, and I repeat that they themselves saw that the Press was going downhill and that what was happening in the Press certainly did not redound to the credit of that Press itself. That is why they came along with this voluntary code.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to hurl reproaches in every possible way. He wants to cast doubt and he makes use of arguments which sound hollow and which are not able to prove anything. The hon. member should get out of the habit of quoting only those things which suit his arguments.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister is losing sight of the most important point. The amendment under discussion asks for exemption only for periodicals issued by publishers who are members of the Press Union. Now the position is that the Cronje Commission was of opinion that the articles contain more undesirable material than newspapers. But the Cronje Commission in this respect did not mean the type of periodicals published by publishers who are members of the Press Union. And it is only for such periodicals that the amendment seeks exemption. The periodicals referred to by the Cronje Report are the type of periodical which the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) published. The Cronje Commission would not have made the same comment about the type of periodicals published by established publishers who are members of the Press Union.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Then why not exempt them also? I cannot agree with the hon. the Minister that there is such a sharp difference between periodicals&#x2014;I am not referring to yellow literature now&#x2014;of the type published by members of the Press Union and the newspapers published by the same publishers. Let us again take the <i>Huisgenoot</i> as an example. This periodical deals with contemporary news just as much as the newspapers do. As against that, newspapers have the tendency increasingly to become periodicals&#x2014;just look at the weekend newspapers with their magazines and supplements. The periodical and the newspaper cover the same field.</p>

<p>Nor do I feel satisfied with the explanation given by the Minister as to why there evidently has to be a distinction between imported material and locally-produced material, but I think I understand the position. As the Bill reads, the right of political censorship is contained in the clause which deals with control over local printed matter, and in no fewer than three subsections. We will still get to that; we cannot discuss it now. But in respect of the clause referring to the Customs Act, the Minister does not want to accept this amendment because the definition in that clause is not as detailed as the one dealing with domestic printed matter where there is in fact recognizable provision for political censorship.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The word &#x201C;obnoxious&#x201D; is qualified in the case of local material, because there are other sub-sections which cover political censorship. But here it is not included and the Minister wants to leave the whole definition wide. My conclusion therefore is that the Minister refuses to accept the amendment because he wants to keep the word &#x201C;obnoxious&#x201D; in respect of imported material wide enough to cover political matters and therefore does not want to limit it to what is &#x201C;morally obnoxious We will still get to Clauses 5,6 and 20 and discuss the matter further then. At this stage I just want to say that I can see no other reason than the one I mentioned why the Minister does not want to accept this amendment, namely that he does not want to limit the definition of &#x201C;obnoxious&#x201D; in Clause 1 so that it will exclude political censorship. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I do not like making personal attacks on hon. members and I do not do so in debates. It is, however, time that the hon. member for Vereeniging should be warned.

How can they use the argument that we now want to accuse the Government of wanting a Censor Board? It is already there. We are satisfied with the censorship of undesirable material. The world is satisfied with it and most countries have it, but we believe that the new thing being created here now, viz. a more comprehensive Board of Control over spiritual matters and the circulation of ideas, will do South Africa infinite harm because it institutes control over the traditional freedoms of the citizen.</p>
