<p>(for Capt. Henwood) asked the Minister of Health:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to Press reports that trained nurses have been penalized for failure to pay their annual registration fee to the South African Nursing Council;</li>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#eaton">

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No, but the report to which the hon. member is referring probably relates to nurses whose names have been removed from the registers of the Nursing Council.</li>

<li>(2) (a) (b) Many nurses cease nursing after marriage or for other personal reasons, whilst some fail to renew their registration through negligence.<br/>For the efficient functioning of the Nursing Council its registers must be kept up to date and it is essential that the names of those persons who do not apply for renewal should be removed.<br/>During the past year altogether 1,348 nurses failed to renew their registration.</li>

<li>(3) The Nursing Council has already given careful consideration to the possibility of life membership, but unfortunately found it impracticable.<br/>Notices are sent to all registered nurses each year to remind them of the registration requirements.</li>

<question by="#suzman" to="#minister_of_the_interior">

<num>*IV.</num>

<from>Mrs. SUZMAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of the Interior:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether, as reported in the Press, a clerk in the Vryburg Deeds Office was dismissed or advised to resign by the Public Service Commission in June 1962; if so, for what reason;</li>

<li>(2) (a) when was he appointed to this post and (b) what were his qualifications;</li>

<li>(3) whether his work brought him into contact with the public;</li>

<li>(4) whether the Commission received any complaint about him or the performance of his duties; and</li>

<li>(5) whether he was offered any alternative employment of a similar grade and salary; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_the_interior" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No, he resigned voluntarily.</li>

<li>(2)

<ol>

<li>(a) 16 February 1960.</li>

<li>(b) National Junior Certificate.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(3) Yes, occasionally.</li>

<li>(4) No.</li>

<li>(5) No, because he resigned and was not dismissed as reported in the Press.</li>

</ol>

<p>The hon. member is presumably refering to a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 4 March 1963, regarding the alleged dismissal by the Public Service Commission of Mr. Ernst Kleinschmidt who was formerly employed as a temporary clerk in the Deeds Office, Vryburg. As would appear from the following the allegations are unfounded.</p>

<p>Mr. Kleinschmidt was appointed as a temporary clerk on 16 February 1960. As he possessed only a National Junior Certificate at that time he was not, in terms of the Public Service Act, 1957, educationally qualified for permanent appointment in the clerical division. After he obtained the National Senior Certificate in 1962 the Public Service Commission was approached during April 1962 for his permanent appointment.</p>

<p>The report on his medical examination disclosed certain physical defects and as is customary in such cases he was requested to submit a report from an ear, nose and throat specialist regarding his deafness and a report from the physician who treated him for the after-effects of meningitis. Mr. Kleinschmidt advised his Department of 15 June 1962 that the reports were being called for and would be submitted when received. However, on</p>

<p>19 June 1962 he voluntarily tendered his resignation with close of duty on 30 June 1962.</p>

<p>In view of the satisfactory services rendered by Mr. Kleinschmidt, the Public Service Commission would have been prepared to consider his permanent appointment had the medical reports been submitted and accepted.</p>

<heading>Transvaal Indians and Group Areas</heading>

<question by="#gorshel" to="#minister_of_community_development">

<num>*VIII.</num>

<from>Mr. GORSHEL</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Community Development:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 10 March 1963 in regard to the number of Indians in the Transvaal who are liable to eviction in terms of Group Areas proclamations; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_community_development" to="#gorshell">

<from>The MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) The hon. member raised practically the same matter during 1962. I then fully stated the policy of the Government in connection with the whole issue and repeated assurances that alternative accommodation for persons who cannot fend for themselves is a prerequisite to their removal. I extensively dealt with the position of members of the Indian group and more particularly with Indian traders in my speech which is recorded in columns 7956 to 7958 of Hansard of 14 June 1962.<br/>As far as residential accommodation is concerned, I wish to refer to a leading article which appeared in the <i>Leader</i> of 7 September 1962 as to why the Indians clamour for housing schemes. The paper stated:

<p><span class="col_2805-2806" refersTo="page_1417"/>But the most vicious evil that is forcing Indians to accept the housing schemes is their exploitation by Indian landlords. The Indian worker is being mercilessly fleeced by the more avaricious owners.</p>

<p>The hon. member might consider it advisable to give his attention to this matter.</p>

<p>He has, moreover, already been informed that areas in Johannesburg such as, <i>inter alia,</i> Fordsburg and Burghersdorp in which large numbers of Indians are carrying on business have not been proclaimed group areas but left controlled. These traders can therefore continue their businesses in such areas. This one example sufficiently proves that the report referred to by the hon. member creates a totally incorrect impression.</p>

<p>I must, however, add that some members of the Indian group of wilfully defy the law and refuse to co-operate notwithstanding the fact that suitable alternative housing and/or business facilities have been offered to them. The necessary steps will be taken in such cases.</p></li>

<heading>Orange River Scheme: No Consulting Engineers Appointed</heading>

<question by="#weiss" to="#minister_of_water_affairs">

<num>*XII.</num>

<from>Mrs. WEISS</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Water Affairs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 10 March 1963 that certain consulting engineers have been chosen to launch the Orange River Development Scheme; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

<p>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE (for the Minister of Water Affairs):</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes; and</li>

<li>(2) as a result thereof I have already issued the following Press statement on 11 March 1963:</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">In the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 10 March 1963 the following article by Mr. Carel Birkby, chief reporter of that newspaper, appeared under the caption:</block>

<block name="quote">Firms picked to launch giant project. Orange River Scheme likely to cost far more than R450,000,000. Seven South African groups will advise on spending.</block>

<p>and in this connection I wish to state that the article in question did not originate from either myself, my Department, or from any of the consulting firms with whom the Department are presently conducting negotiations.</p>

<p>I wish, once again, to reiterate my reply to a question in the House of Assembly on 26 February 1963 that no firm or firms have as yet been nominated or appointed as may be erroneously deduced from the report in the <i>Sunday Times</i>.</p>

<p>In my reply in the House of Assembly, I stated clearly that no South African consulting engineers or consulting engineers from abroad had as yet been appointed for the Orange River Project and that negotiations regarding the nomination of such consultants were still being conducted.</p>

<p>As soon as a final decision in this connection has been taken I will announce it in the Press.</p>

<p>Speculation or newspaper reports may at this stage just complicate matters to the detriment of the public interest.</p>

<question by="#gorshel" to="#prime_minister">

<num>*XIV.</num>

<from>Mr. GORSHEL</from>

<p>asked the Prime Minister:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 11 <span class="col_2807-2808" refersTo="page_1418"/>March 1963, of a statement by a Bantu Chief in regard to the land between the Fish River and Zululand; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_lands" to="#gorshel">

<p>The MINISTER OF LANDS (for the Prime Minister):</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) There can be no question whatsoever of the whole territory between the Fish River and Zululand becoming a Bantu Homeland. The existing division in White and Black areas will be maintained. It is well known that whereas it is the policy of all Opposition parties that the White people must share the whole of the Republic with the Bantu and other non-Whites as one nation in one state with the result that not only the territory between the Fish River and Zululand would ultimately become Black-ruled but in fact the whole Republic, the Government is prepared to set aside for Bantu self-government those areas which are and have always been Bantu areas, and are defined as such, and to keep the remainder of the country for White rule.<br/>Preserving this existing historic division will therefore be the greatest guarantee to the Whites of retaining control over their area, not only between the Fish River and Zululand but in the whole Republic, and similarly to the Bantu with regard to theirs. Any addition to the latter would have to be in terms of the commitments in the 1936 legislation, and any exchange in the interest of consolidation would need mutual agreement and therefore be of benefit to both.<br/>There is reason to believe that the Chief concerned was misquoted. However that may be, it must be regretted that any statement was made and also that provocation was given by accusations to the effect that the chiefs are open to bribery and corruption, which led to this counter-attack. It is in the interest of all that provocative statements be avoided from whatever side. It must also be strongly condemned if such statements are eagerly exploited for party political purposes and with no consideration for the damage done to the promotion of good racial relations.</li>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to an advertisement inserted by his Department in <i>Punch</i> of 20 February 1963, claiming that there were new model towns for the Bantu in the Republic with about 1,000,000 Bantu citizens, and limitless opportunity for development and leadership;</li>

<li>(2) (a) where are these towns situated and (b) what are their names; and</li>

<li>(3) whether he will make a statement indicating the nature of the opportunities referred to in the advertisement.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_information" to="#malan">

<from><span class="col_2809-2810" refersTo="page_1419"/>The MINISTER OF INFORMATION:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes, but the question is out of context.<br/>To put the matter in perspective, I might mention that the advertisement is in the form of a casual conversation between two men intending to emphasize that the Bantu in South Africa are granted opportunities for self-development. The hypothetical question is then put:<br/> &#x201C;But is this sufficient opportunity?&#x201D; to which the following answer is given:<br/> &#x201C;Well, it&#x2019;s hardly limited. After all, the Bantu are getting <i>a</i> vote, and, furthermore, they are getting Home Rule. Besides, there are all these new model towns with about 1,000,000 Bantu citizens and limitless opportunity for development and leadership.&#x201D;</li>

<li>(2) (a) and (b) The hon. member&#x2019;s attention is directed to the existence of the following Bantu towns and townships&#x2014;by no means an exhaustive list:

<p>In the Bantu Homelands:</p>

<p>Garankuwa, Pretoria; Umlazi, Durban;</p>

<p>Zwelitsha, King William&#x2019;s Town; Temba, Hammanskraal;</p>

<p>Lenyenye and Kowakowa, Letaba; and the townships at Vaaltuin (Potgietersrus) and Umkomaas.</p>

<p>In White Areas:</p>

<p>Daveyton, Benoni;</p>

<p>Kwa Thema, Springs; Mamelodi, Pretoria; Kwa Mashu, Durban;</p>

<p>Meadowlands, Johannesburg; and the great residential complex south-west of Johannesburg.</p></li>

<li>(3) The advertisement refers to development<br/>opportunities in both the Bantu homelands and townships in South Africa. These opportunities exist for the practising of administration, commerce and all trades and professions, apart from providing for cultural and religious activities. Political development can be achieved in the Bantu homelands, starting with the Transkei, for whose proposed Legislative Assembly consisting solely of Xhosa under their Chief Minister and a Cabinet, Transkei citizens living all over South Africa will be able to vote if qualified to do so, and, if nominated, to be elected to that Assembly.</li>

<heading>COMPENSATION FOR INJURIES THROUGH CRIMES OF VIOLENCE</heading>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I move the motion standing in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to consider the advisability of appointing a commission to consider compensation for injuries through crimes of violence; to examine the results of studies made of this problem and to consider further evidence on it; to decide whether a basis exists for legislative action; and if it finds that such a basis exists, to make recommendations on the right of victims and/or their dependants to compensation, the nature of the compensation to be paid, the method of dealing with claims, the crimes to be included in the scheme, and all other relevant matters.</block>

<p>In moving this motion I want at the outset to make one thing clear. There must be no misunderstanding on this point. This motion is being moved not in connection with any threats of violence of a political character which may be in evidence in South Africa to-day. This motion is moved purely because of developments in the outlook of society and the concept of criminal law throughout the civilized world, and has nothing whatever to do with any political difficulties that may exist in South Africa. The fact that we are a multiracial state does affect the possible implementation and the possible consideration of this measure by the commission to be appointed. With that I shall deal as it arises. But the motion should be seen as an attempt to keep pace with the social concept of the redress to which victims of crimes of violence should be entitled.</p>

<p>In primitive societies that redress consisted of simple revenge. If somebody killed your father it was the accepted social reaction to go out to look for the murderer and to kill him; or if one had a fine sense of justice one would kill the father of the criminal as well. But as time went on society found it necessary to regulate this simple process of revenge, and so there developed what is known as the <i>lex talionis</i> which was summarized in the Old Testament by the expression, &#x201C;An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth &#x201D;. Society took it upon itself to determine the extent of the revenge to which the aggrieved individual was entitled. Later still society prevented the individual aggrieved from taking violent revenge. His revenge had to be transmuted into some other consideration which would satisfy his desire for vengeance. So there developed in many societies complicated codes determining the redress to which the victim of a crime of violence should be entitled. The classic example is the well-known code of Hammurabi, which at great length tried to determine the compensation to which the victim should be entitled for all types of injuries. Attempts were made to define the monetary value to the victim of the loss of an eye or a leg or a finger&#x2014;a most complicated system for the substitution of financial redress for physical revenge. Society and states gradually claimed for themselves the sole and only right to act as the avenger. It is interesting that as the State pushed the victim aside as the exactor of justice, the emphasis fell more on the prevention of crime and the punishment of crime and the treatment of the criminal, <span class="col_2821-2822" refersTo="page_1425"/>and the victim of the crime tended to be forgotten. The object of punishment by the State until quite recently, certainly until the middle of the 19th century, was chiefly threefold: To obtain revenge on the part of society, because every crime of violence was considered also as an assault upon and a crime against society; secondly, to prevent a repetition of the crime by the person concerned, and thirdly, to deter others from committing a similar crime. But as our conscience developed, a fourth element in punishment received greater and greater emphasis, which was to cure and to rehabilitate the criminal. Throughout the Western world, and certainly in South Africa, the emphasis in our penal system to-day is more and more on the curative and rehabilitative aspects. But while we take great trouble to cure and to rehabilitate the criminal, while we give him opportunities to learn trades and to readjust himself to society, and where necessary give him the attention of psychiatrists and of sociologists, the victim is forgotten. It is as if society, sated with vengeance. assured that the criminal is rendered harmless and that other potential criminals have been duly warned, washes its hands of the unfortunate victim.</p>

<p>But as our social conscience continues to develop, many voices are being heard to-day and many reforms are being undertaken in order also to attend to the plight of the victim of the crime. The matter was very well put in a White Paper entitled &#x201C;The Penal Practice in a Changing Society&#x201D;, presented to the British Parliament in February 1959, paragraphs 24 to 27 of which read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The basis of early law was personal reparation by the offender to the victim, a concept of which modern criminal law has almost completely lost sight. The assumption that the claims of the victim are sufficiently satisfied if the offender is punished by society becomes less persuasive as society in its dealings with offenders increasingly emphasizes the reformative aspects of punishment. Indeed, in the public mind the interests of the offender are not infrequently seen to be placed before those of his victim. This is certainly not correct. It may well be that our penal system would not only provide a more effective deterrent to crime, but would also find a greater moral value if the concept of personal reparation to the victim were added to the concepts of deterrents by punishment and of reform by training. It is also possible to hold that the redemptive value of punishment to the individual offender would be greater if it were made to include the realization of the injury he has done to his victim as well as to the order of society by the need to make personal reparation for that injury</block>

<p>This changed attitude is based on many considerations. One is that the State has a duty in modem society to prevent violence, to protect its subjects against violence, and where it fails to give that protection, to accept a measure of responsibility for the consequences of its failure.</p>

<p>Some thinkers in jurisprudence to-day go so far as to say that the State has an absolute liability in a case like that. I do not think that can be supported, but there is this element in modern thinking in jurisprudence that the State has a measure of liability where it fails in its duty to protect its subjects against violence.</p>

<p>Can you quote one authority for that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I would recommend that my hon. friend read a report published in Britain two years ago by an organization known as Justice, which is the British section of the International Commission of Jurists. The publication is called &#x201C;Compensation for Victims of Crimes of Violence&#x201D;, and it is obtainable from Messrs. Stevens Publications in London for 7s. 6d. I can also recommend that my friend read a report by the Conservative Party&#x2019;s political centre, all eminent jurists, under the title, &#x201C;Victims of Violence&#x201D;, which is obtainable from the Conservative Party in London. I would also suggest that he reads the report of a working party of the British Parliament, or what we would call a Select Committee, published by Her Majesty&#x2019;s Stationery Office in June 1961, Document No. 1406. There are also other books available. My seconder will deal with certain authoritative writings on this subject, and so will other speakers on this side. But authorities abound for the statement I have just made. I would be perfectly willing after 4 o&#x2019;clock this afternoon to draw up a bibliography for the information of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman).</p>

<p>In fact, it has even been suggested that the-State, by demanding the sole rights to revenge, frustrates the victim in exercising his right to redress, and as the result of the actions of the State the civil remedy which the victim has against the criminal often becomes illusory. because the State may fail to apprehend the criminal. But more important, the State may decide to put the criminal out of the way permanently by hanging him or by sending him to gaol for an unspecified period, and while a man is in gaol it becomes extremely difficult for him to make reparation to the victim of a crime of violence. All these considerations lend strength to the concept that the State should accept liability in part.</p>

<p>In addition, the State, while it encourages people to protect their property, discourages them from protecting themselves against violence. I think the hon. the Minister of Justice would be a very unhappy man if all the citizens of South Africa walked about armed with pistols in their pockets in order to protect themselves against crimes of violence. In fact, that is obviously unnecessary, because crimes of violence are exceptional and would not justify extraordinary action by the individual to protect his person against violence. <span class="col_2823-2824" refersTo="page_1426"/>apart from the normal means of self-defence available to a human being.</p>

<p>It must also be realized that insurance is not the answer to this problem, as it is in the case of property. Crimes of violence against persons are less usual, and they affect the poor as well as people of means. The better-off people can often afford insurance, but even the poorest person has a body and he cannot always afford to insure that body.</p>

<p>We have these clear signs of the awakening of public conscience to the plight of the victims of crimes of violence. Now it is interesting that in our society we are much more aware of the need to compensate people whose property is damaged than we are of the need to compensate people whose persons are injured. Many of us know how often a man guilty of theft or embezzlement is given a suspended sentence and one of the conditions of that suspension is that he makes reparation to the person whose property he has stolen. Indeed, in our Criminal Procedure Act of 1955 there is a general provision to make compensation for crimes against property possible. Section 357 of that Act says that if any person is convicted by a superior court, a court of the Regional Division or an inferior court with jurisdiction in civil cases of an offence which has caused damage to or loss of property belonging to some person, the court trying the case may, after recording the conviction and upon the application of the injured party or the person conducting the prosecution and acting on the instructions of such a party, forthwith award him compensation for such damage or loss. Then follow certain provisos in regard to the amount of such damages, but the fact remains that we are aware of the need and we are willing to lend the authority and the resources and the strength of the State to give compensation to victims of crimes against property, while we are not so acutely conscious of the need for compensation to the victims of crimes of violence.</p>

<p>I think that is correct, but then the difficulty of doing justice should never deter us from doing justice. I think the hon. the Minister will agree with me that if it were possible easily by a simple calculation without incurring the State in unconscionable expenses, we should all like to see the victims of crimes of violence compensated. One of our fears, apart from the difficulties the hon. the Minister has mentioned, is that the extent of such an undertaking by the State in South Africa may be too large. In order to decide that, we have to consider the extent of crimes of violence in our country. In Switzerland, in Federal Germany and some of the Scandinavian countries, in Holland and in Belgium and the U.S.A., various types of legal machinery have been created to make such compensation possible in different degrees, but the problem there is more simple and indeed smaller than it is in South Africa. According to the working party of the British House of Commons to which I referred the hon. member for Heilbron, we find that statistics in England are much less alarming and startling than they are in South Africa. They find that of the following crimes, murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, felonious wounding, malicious wounding, assaults, rape and robbery, the total number of crimes committed in England and Wales in 1959 was 15,524. Of these 13.760 were malicious woundings, and the report says that the majority of them would not justify compensation because they arose out of brawls or family disputes, i.e. were unprovoked. Further, 1,745 were felonious woundings and 1,900 were robberies, some of which did not result in serious or lasting injury. But the position in South Africa is significantly different. The latest statistics I could get were for 1960, because that is the year dealt with in the latest report of the Commissioner of Police available to us as Members of Parliament. From that we see that in 1960 cases of common assault numbered 55.902 and cases of aggravated assault, 48,879. We had 2,356 cases of murder investigated which led to 625 convictions. There are other crimes which fall within the ambit of my motion, but these figures alone are alarming, and if they were comparable with similar crimes in the developed countries of Western Europe or the U.S.A. I would say that my motion immediately becomes quite impossible and it would be quite unnecessary to consider it. But I want the House to know that these figures are deceptive in the case of South Africa because of the racial constitution of our society and the level of development reached by the various peoples in our society.</p>

<p>The picture looks quite different if one looks at the race of the criminals concerned. I have the Police Report here for 1960, and looking at page 7 of that report I see that they deal with criminal acts of violence which led to the loss of life in that year. Altogether there were 6,493 such cases. Of them the race of the victims were Whites in 475 cases, Asiatics in 81 cases, Coloureds in 491 cases, and Bantu in 5,446 cases. I have here a similar analysis of cases of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm committed in 1960. The total number was 6.302 and in 6.385 of these cases the accused were Bantu. There is a table on page 8 of the report reflecting persons, White and non-White, prosecuted and convicted under the three classifications of assault; common assault. 72.930 people were prosecuted; about 4,000 Whites were convicted and about 50,000 non-Whites. In regard to assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, there was a total of 50,550 prosecutions, including about 400 Whites and 29,000 non-Whites. I think it would be wrong to conclude from this that our Bantu are innately more vicious than <span class="col_2825-2826" refersTo="page_1427"/>the Whites, Coloureds or Indians. I think the answer is simply this, that the concepts of justice and of law and order amongst primitive tribal people are vastly different from what they are amongst civilized people such as we are and such as the Coloureds and the Asians are to a large extent.</p>

<p>Are you advocating discrimination now?</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am merely pleading for us to accept the facts, as we have indeed in other legislation dealing with compensation such as the Unemployment Insurance Act, where we exclude tribal Natives and only include Natives who have become permanently detribalized and have accepted Western standards of life. I believe that if we want to do justice to the victims of crimes of violence, a similar distinction will have to be drawn in this particular instance, and the compensation by the State should be limited to those Bantu who have abandoned the tribal way of life and have become Westernized. I can give many reasons for that, but the chief one is that the Bantu who still adhere to the tribal way of life are under the tribal laws and customs and institutions protected against the economic consequences of any of the vicissitudes of life in a manner and according to a method which is foreign to an advanced Western state such as the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>In addition, we should remember that many of these crimes, even if we exclude the tribal Natives, will not be subject to compensation because many of them arise out of brawls, where people have a common purpose, and one cannot claim that the State should accept liability for the acts of people who were engaged in a common criminal act with them. Many arise from family disputes. This is a very difficult question which the commission would have to investigate very carefully, but I know from my own very small experience of cases of assault by a husband on his wife where, in the normal course, if any compensation was paid, it would immediately redound to the financial advantage of the husband and not of the victim of his assault. So there will have to be exclusions from the cases to be considered by this commission and it will be one of the tasks of this commission to decide what to exclude.</p>

<p>If we accept that some form of compensation should be paid, the question then rises what type of scheme should the commission investigate. It seems to me from all the evidence I have been able to consult that two major types of scheme deserve the attention of such a commission. One would be a statutory scheme similar to our Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, where the victim is paid a fixed rate according to his loss of faculty, similar to the compensation paid under our war pensions where the percentage of disability is determined medically. The victim is then compensated at a fixed rate, which is in fact merely a subsistence rate, and which can be adjusted from time to time as the victim&#x2019;s condition deteriorates or improves. The alternative would be a scheme based more on the principles of our common law, where the principle would be that compensation would be based on an attempt to determine the financial value of the pain and suffering of the victim, his loss of actual earnings, the potential loss of future earnings and the loss of the amenities of life. Each of these two schemes will have advantages which the commission would have to consider. Under a statutory scheme the advantage would be that all victims would be treated according to their injuries and their responsibilites.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>What sort of tribunal do you suggest?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I will come to that. It would do away with the criticism that one differentiates between the rich and the poor who have suffered similar injuries. The second advantage is that we already have machinery in existence, as for example in the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Department or even in the War Pensions Department on which such a scheme could be grafted. I think the advantages of the common law scheme are probably greater because it emphasizes a principle which is sound in justice, the principle of making actual reparation to the victim, where the basis of compensation must be the actual damage, must be the actual loss suffered by the victim. We have for this the very important precedent of our Motor Vehicle Act, the Third Party Insurance Act, where the courts determine the damages and where the public have developed great confidence in this sytem of reparation administered by our courts. It seemed only right that where the State may eventually seek to recover any compensation paid to a victim from the criminal the payment to be made to the State should be assessed on a similar basis as the payments were assessed which the State made to the victim. Then also the common law would cover the whole population whereas a statutory scheme drafted on to, say, our workmen&#x2019;s compensation machinery, would not cover those people who are not employed; it would not cover married women: special machinery to supplement existing machinery would still have to be created. It seems to me. although I do not want to anticipate the findings of the Commission, should the Minister agree to appoint a Commission, that the common law scheme has advantages which far outweigh those of a statutory scheme. Now, Sir, there should be an upper limit of compensation. Thus if a man is so wealthy that the compensation which he can expect for loss of earnings and the loss of the amenities of life would be extraordinarily high, the State should only accept part of that responsibility; for such a man would be peculiarly in a position to protect himself against all types of loss, all types of damage to his person or property by insurance. All that the State should perhaps <span class="col_2827-2828" refersTo="page_1428"/>contribute in a case like that is to grant some tax relief for the payment of premiums of insurance against damage to his person.</p>

<p>Another very important matter that such a Commission would have to consider is which crimes to include as crimes of violence for the purpose of my suggestions. I want to say immediately that obviously all injuries to the person arising from road or traffic offences will be out, where motor vehicles are involved, for the simple reason that these people are well looked after under our existing third-party insurance legislation. But the Commission will have to consider whether there should be a general definition of crimes of violence or whether perhaps in any legislation there should be a schedule listing the specific crimes which would be covered by such a compensatory scheme. The evidence seems to be against a general definition. First of all, it would increase the danger of fraudulent claims. I admit that this is a real danger in such a scheme. It would make it easier for fraudulent persons to try to institute claims within the framework of a general definition, and even in a general definition it would be necessary to exclude a number of crimes by listing them as exceptions. If it is inevitable I think it would be better if such a list was a positive one listing the specific crimes which would be subject to compensation by the State. Such a schedule would certainly mean less litigation because the law would be more specific and more clear; it would be simpler for the ordinary layman to understand; it would save time and make prompt decisions on particular cases possible and as I have said, it would eliminate fraudulent claims. Purely as a matter of interest, I wonder if hon. members would bear with me if I read out to them a schedule of crimes proposed by the Conservative Party&#x2019;s committee of lawyers which investigated this matter. They suggested that the following crimes should be included: Murder, &#x2014;I am using the British terms which include capital murder and non-capital murder&#x2014; attempted murder, threats, conspiracy or incitement to murder; manslaughter, infanticide, child destruction, wounding and other acts endangering life, administering poison with intent to injure, causing injury by means of explosive substances, causing injury by the use of firearms, endangering railway passengers, endangering life at sea, malicious wounding and other similar offences, assault, cruelty to or neglect of children, abandonment of children under two years, theft from persons, robbery with aggravation, robbery, various sexual crimes which I do not wish to specify, riot, affray, escape, rescue of prisoner from custody, breach of prison, resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, assaulting a prison officer in the execution of his duty, arson, piracy and smuggling. It seems that such a Commission would have an interesting time in determining which crimes should be included for purposes of compensation and how compensation should be circumscribed in the case of each crime. We know that there are many cases where it would be very important to determine the nature and the extent of the compensation to be paid. We know that suffering varies in these various crimes. We know that it is possible that a magistrate would enter an assault in his records as a case of aggravated assault, although the victim has suffered no personal injury at all, because that assault was accompanied by a threat of firearms, or something like that, which did not lead to actual injury. In other cases he may enter it as a case of aggravated assault because of the very nature of the injury suffered by the victim. The Commission would probably consider it unnecessary to award compensation to people where they suffered perhaps acute pain but of very short duration. I believe it certainly would be inclined to award compensation where the pain and suffering was prolonged and required medical and hospital treatment and led to a loss of income. The Commission will probably have to consider the total exclusion of small claims to prevent a multiplicity of small, insignificant claims. Claims where the claimant shares the guilt of the criminal would probably have to be excluded; claims where the victim was engaged in the pursuit of a common purpose with the criminal would probably have to be excluded; claims&#x2014;and this is particularly applicable in the difficult problem of sexual assaults&#x2014;where there was provocation and incitement and consent would probably have to be excluded; claims where there was contributory negligence on the part of the victim may have to be excluded. The problem where there is a business or family relationship between the victim and the criminal will have to be particularly considered. The position of people claiming in cases where the victim is dead or has been killed becomes very difficult and will have to be carefully considered by the Commission. There is also the very special case of assault upon police and prison officers: I think our public conscience would demand that generous compensation, much more generous than is available to-day, should be paid. That brings us to the case where members of the public come to the assistance of the police or prison officials in their dealings with criminals either at the request of the police or prison officers or of their own free will. There too. I think, the public conscience would demand generous compensation, perhaps on a more generous scale than is generally paid to-day. Then I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will also suggest that this Commission should consider a particular problem and that is the need for urgent help which often arises in cases of assault where the victim has no means. In many of our other laws of compensation we are aware of the tragic circumstances where a person may have to wait weeks or months, with no earnings, his expenses mounting, before he gets any compensation. I was interested to see that this Commission of International Jurists have suggestions for a form of first-aid payments, or what one might call preliminary payments to <span class="col_2829-2830" refersTo="page_1429"/>such people, which they suggest should be paid only after certification by a responsible police officer that in his opinion such a person was a victim of a crime of violence and would after apprehension and trial of the criminal be clearly entitled to compensation under such a scheme.</p>

<p>Then, although I have recommended that the common law system of compensation should be followed, I believe that it might be advisable not to follow the practice which is followed under common law awards of paying such a victim compensation in a lump sum. We all know that in cases of third-party recoveries, in cases of civil actions, the court awards a lump sum; it tries to assess the extent of the person&#x2019;s damages and even his future loss of earnings and then tries to compensate him for that by giving him one lump sum as an award. That leads to difficulties in the case of the improvident victim. It is also inelastic and does not allow adjustment where the victim&#x2019;s position may change in the future. I wonder if, if a Commission is appointed, it should not consider the question of adapting the common law system to some extent to bring it more in accordance with the statutory system which we have by making the award periodic and subject to revision either in favour of the State or in favour of the victim as the situation of the particular case may change. Sir. there is one other matter which I think the Minister should consider and that is to what extent the State should be entitled to recover any damages paid in this manner from the criminal. All I want to say here is that in view of our present attitude to criminals and their reformation, this question will have to be approached with great caution. Apparently the experts believe that if the compensation which has to be paid to the State by a criminal is very expensive, it hinders and delays and inhibits the reformation of the criminal. It would seem that the individual victim of a crime of violence should not have the right to proceed against the criminal directly, if the State accepts the liability; that the State should take over these rights and, circumspectly as one would expect from a State institution, consider each case on its merits.</p>

<p>Can you enlarge on that argument.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The point is a very simple one. First of all, in the cases that I have read the witnesses state that if the criminal has to make a payment which is an unconscionable burden and if he has criminal tendencies and proclivities, he is subjected to temptation to try to meet that obligation by committing crime again. Because he resents the claim, he tends to build up a resentment against the State and against society. Criminals should, I think, have to make reparations; they should try to reimburse the State, but it should be a right held exclusively by the State to obtain that recovery so that it can be circumspectly applied and due consideration given to the psychological effect upon the criminal to be reformed and rehabilitated. But, as I say, it is a matter for the Commission to investigate more fully; I am merely stating the problems.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister asked me about the administration of such a scheme. All the cases that I have been able to investigate are administered in a similar way or the suggestion is that they should be administered in a similar way. A special assessor or a compensation board should be appointed which can take immediate decisions, which can be assisted by the police or by the social welfare organizations already existing in various towns and various districts of South Africa. If the claim is denied or if the award is not satisfactory, the victim can go to court and ask the court to review the decision of the assessor or of the board. But in order to avoid unnecessary claims, I think it might be wise to make it clear that where the award of the board is not increased, the costs will be charged against the applicant.</p>

<p>Finally, Sir, what would such a scheme cost? I think if one looks at it superficially one may be unnecessarily frightened. I have certain information with regard to the cost of such a scheme which shows that it is remarkably low, provided one bears in mind what I have said before about the racial content of crimes of violence in South Africa, which are peculiar to a multi-racial society such as ours and which could be avoided by peculiar measures such as I have suggested. But, Sir, the British Working Party of 1959 did a full investigation and they found that in a country with the vast population of Britain and Wales, with the very high standard of living which obtains there which means that compensation is paid on a fairly high level especially if one applies common law, they found after a most careful investigation with the co-operation of the Department of Pensions and the Treasury, that a statutory scheme, similar to our Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act, which they would call an industrial injuries scheme, the actual compensation in a year would amount to &#x00A3;845,000, and the administration to &#x00A3;110,000, a total of &#x00A3;955,000. In a scheme based upon the common law system the compensation would amount to &#x00A3;1,150,000 and the administration would be considerably more expensive and amount to &#x00A3;367,000, a total of &#x00A3;1,500,000. It may be more or it may be less in South Africa, but it need not be disproportionate to this careful estimate by British Departments of State.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It may be, but I do not believe that the amount would be large enough to deter us from at least investigating the possibilities of arranging for compensation to be paid to the victims of crimes of violence. I want to emphasize that all that I am asking is that a Commission of experts be appointed to go into this matter fully in the light of the peculiar circumstances that obtain in South <span class="col_2831-2832" refersTo="page_1430"/>Africa; that it should go into it fully, and I am sure sympathetically also, to see what can be done. If such a Commission of experts after due consideration reports that no such scheme can be introduced under the peculiar circumstances in South Africa, we shall have to do without it; but it may be possible, if real experts are appointed who are sympathetic to the idea, as any man with a modern developed conscience should be, to come back to us with plans and suggestions which would make it possible for this Parliament to do justice to people who are neglected to-day by our society, the innocent victims of crimes of violence.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I second and I approach this matter from a rather different angle to that adopted by my colleague. I approach it rather as one who has had great experience of the victims of crime and the result of crimes of violence to them and to their families. I do not need to emphasize the number of these victims; reference has been made to the figures by my hon. friend. Those figures show the gravity of the problem. But what my colleague was unable to say, or at least with the same authority that I can say it, is that the damage and harm caused by criminals is a terrible thing in many instances. Very often the damages caused by such a crime of violence change the whole life of a family. A decent working man, a bricklayer or a carpenter, goes out one morning and finds a burglar in his bedroom and tackles him; he is either stabbed or hit with a stick. His whole character is changed; his brain ceases perhaps to be able to work at all; he is unable to earn a living for himself and his family, or perhaps a stab wound interferes with the use of his limbs. A respectable family that lived in reasonable comfort suddenly finds itself faced with poverty. Take the case of an old couple living humbly in a house. We often read stories in the newspapers about how these people are mauled about. The husband who may be a man of 60, in good health, puts up a struggle against the burglar; he ages an extra ten years, with the result that his wife is widowed ten years before she would have become a widow in the normal course of events. Take the case of the man who is a clerical worker and who sustains an injury to his right hand. The result is that he is unable to carry on with his clerical work. The children whom he had hoped to educate well, to send to a university, and perhaps rise above the position that he held, suffer. Instead of going to work at about 21 years of age when they have a university course behind them, have to go out and start as messengers, or something of that sort, in the hope that by their own efforts they will be able to lift themselves out of this rut. I have lived with these people the whole of my life and I think it is a crying necessity that we should attempt not to pay restitution but to make reparation, to repair the damage not only to the individual but to his family and his dependants. Gradually over the years the victims of crimes of violence have been pushed into the background. I think it is wise that we should go back a little into history. My hon. friend touched on it but I think there is a lot to be learnt from history, and I would like in a few words to go back and show how in olden times much more attention was paid to the victim than is the case to-day in our modern state. We find that in the old days reparation was much more important than the punishment. In fact, provided reparation was made, in many instances the crime was forgiven. In Hinduism we find that &#x201C;he who atones, is forgiven.&#x201D; Islam enjoins restitution and atonement. The law of Moses requires fourfold restitution for stolen sheep and fivefold for the more useful ox. The damage caused was compensated, it was repaired, and the payment was enforced not in the interests of the public but in the interest of the victim. During the Middle Ages the concept of restitution was closely related to that of punishment, and in several instances&#x2014;for example in early American law&#x2014;in addition to his punishment the criminal was ordered to return to the injured party three times the value of the stolen goods. Here we see the State coming into the picture; punishment is laid down for the crime but a great deal of attention is still paid to the victim. Gradually we find that the victim is put more and more into the background. This came about largely because the tribes settled down. Tribal law, as has already been mentioned, was one of vengeance, and so long as man was a caveman or a near-caveman it was the only recompense available. But with the advent of the feudal system, at least in medieval times, we find that the tribes had settled down and that the vengeance motive tended to be displaced by the repair motive. The reason for this was that in a settled community vengeance could not be carried out by the individual because it led to a permanent vendetta. It was really to abolish the vendetta that the settled tribes introduces a system of both vengeance and repair. Most important of all, however, was the reparation; that the man against whom the crime was committed should receive compensation or reparation. Unfortunately as time went on the greed of the feudal lords and the ecclesiastical authorities led to their demanding a commission. They enforced the law, and they enforced the law on the criminal and they claimed that they should receive a commission for doing so. At first the commission was paid by the criminal, but gradually the greed which I have already mentioned decreased the reparation and increased the commission until we arrive at our present state of affairs. The State inflicts a fine on the criminal and it leaves the unfortunate victim to make a recovery as best he can by the processes of civil law. That is how far we have gone. In doing this the State has deprived the victim of a right which he had in the past, because in the past he could take the law into his own hands. He has now been deprived of that right. It is true that he can institute a civil action, but of what value is a civil action where the criminal has no assets, and of what spiritual value is it to <span class="col_2833-2834" refersTo="page_1431"/>the unfortunate victim? I am not by any means suggesting that we should allow people to go out and wreak vengeance on people who have had harm done to them because they have no means to repair the harm done, but it is nevertheless the loss of a right to obtain damages, a right which is now denied to him by the State unless he goes through the cumbersome process of a civil action. I feel that over the years the attitude of the State, and really of society, has failed to appreciate that in its concentration on the criminal it has forgotten the victim. The State represents society and feels that it must protect society; that it must protect society first of all by its legal systems and then it will attempt, either to keep out of society or if it brings back into society a man who has criminal tendencies, at all costs to correct those criminal tendencies. While it might be very interesting one should realize that the unfortunate victim remains with his consequences while, having paid either in fines or in isolation or in forced labour for his crime&#x2014;the payment being to the State&#x2014; the criminal comes out of prison with clean hands into a welfare society which hopes to help him along. People search around for employers whom they say have a liberal outlook to offer this criminal employment; this man who became a criminal of his own accord. Nobody said he must be a criminal; he was given the same chance, perhaps a better chance, than the unfortunate victim in starting his life. Now everybody is trying to help him. If an employer looks down his nose at him and refuses to employ him or if other workmen refuse to work with him there is an outcry which says: &#x201C;How can we as Christian civilized people treat this man like this? He has expiated his crime and he must be given a fresh chance.&#x201D; I am not against it; far from it, but I say we have forgotten the unfortunate man who has a hole in his head or a paralysed arm or who has lost a leg. That is the man we have forgotten.</p>

<p>It would even improve the rehabilitation of the criminal, Sir. I am sure the hon. the Minister of Justice will agree with me when I say that if we could in the punishment, somewhere in the punishment, compound some return, some help, to the victim it would do the criminal good. He will at least have a feeling, when he sees his victim walking down the street on a crutch, that although he had done this crime he has nevertheless attempted to help his victim back. Perhaps in a moment of violence and anger he did something which he regretted and he will now feel that he is paying some compensation. I do not agree that all that compensation should be paid by the State; I believe that something should be recovered from the criminal because I think the actual recovery is part of the rehabilitation of the criminal. I think the fact that the man is trying to return something to his victim will be of spiritual benefit to him. If he sees a man walking down the street with a crutch he is less likely to commit crime again if he knows he is doing something to help that man recover, than if he walks down the street and he sees his victim and he feels so ashamed of himself that he has to cross to the other side of the street. It is part of rehabilitation that the criminal should feel that he is making some compensation. He should appreciate what he has done. Nothing will bring appreciation to his mind more than when he realizes that he is himself contributing to the reparation. I agree that the State, having mulcted him in fines, should contribute; I agree that there should be a fine, but I think it is criminal on the part of the State to benefit from crime. The State is benefiting from crime. We are taxed to provide protection against crime. It is the duty of the State to protect us against crime. It is morally wrong that the money which is mulcted when the State fails to carry out its duty&#x2014;not necessarily through any fault, sometimes the State cannot help it&#x2014;but nevertheless it is morally wrong. I do not say it is quite as bad as using stolen money but it is nevertheless morally wrong for the State to levy fines on crimes and use it for its own purposes.</p>

<p>Is that a general statement you are making?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about crimes. I know this gentleman to be a lawyer, but when he refers to money taken for parking offences, how can I possibly regard him as a serious individual? I am trying to plead for people who in many instances cannot plead for themselves; I am pleading for people whose lives have been changed; for those people who from being highly intelligent people have now to be content with selling newspapers on the street corners. It might even happen to one of the highly intelligent members of this House, Sir. That is what happens to some people who are involved in accidents. There may not be any evidence of outward damage but there is a change in their character, a change in their lives; damage which is difficult to assess in terms of money. This is really a very serious social problem.</p>

<p>The State already recognizes that compensation should be given for crime because it has insisted on third-party risks in the case of motor-cars. We know that in many of these cases the person who caused the accident is subsequently taken to court, the court inflicts a punishment and he either has to pay a fine or go to prison.</p>

<p>Even if there is not a conviction? Do you want compensation to be paid then as well?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to have a private conversation with that gentleman a bit later. Sir; he does not ask questions which are germane to the subject. Why did the State introduce compulsory third-party insurance? They introduced it because in so many instances, when the accident was over (whether it was criminal or not) it was found that the <span class="col_2835-2836" refersTo="page_1432"/>party who was at fault had no resources. Before the introduction of third-party insurance I often attended to people who had been injured in motor-car accidents. I put them in hospital, cared for them and did the best I could to rehabilitate them but when they brought an action in court or tried to bring an action or persuaded a lawyer to take it <i>pro Deo,</i> what did they find? That the other man had no assets; or if he had had assets, knowing what was coming, he had already disposed of them. That still occurs, Sir, in instances of crime. So long is it before the civil action can be brought that the criminal has disposed of his assets, if he had any.</p>

<p>We live in a violent state; it is a state in which a large number of its population react to injury, to insult and even to argument, by striking. A civilized man does not do that. He argues and if he feels he is injured he takes his recourse to law. But in our country we have a large population who use a stick on the slightest provocation and not so often use a sharp instrument. It is an unfortunate fact that the violent section of our population almost invariably strike the head. Among themselves it is not so important because their skulls are more resistant than they are in the case of the more civilized group. Had they not developed a hard skull they would not have survived to the extent they have. I was once involved in a riot&#x2014;at least I was not in the riot but I was involved in the care of those who took part in the riot&#x2014;in which the Durban police put a barrier across the street because the Natives were coming down, although not in the hordes which we have to-day. The Chief Constable got all the pickhandles he could find and he armed his men with those. They blocked the road and as these Natives came down they were hitting them with both hands with pick-handles on the head. I have decided from personal experience that it takes five hard blows by a European to render a Bantu unconscious&#x2014; hard. And only in a few instances does it result in a fractured skull. No European could stand that. That is what happens; when a European is struck on the head by a hard stick, such as the Natives carry&#x2014;although it is not only the Natives who do this, nevertheless it is largely they&#x2014;the injured man&#x2019;s character can be changed for the rest of his life. Therefore we face this extra risk in this country. Few countries run the risk which we run.</p>

<p>My hon. friend has said that the hon. the Minister of Justice would never agree to everybody carrying a revolver, but unless we do something like that what can we do? A man of my age cannot protect himself physically. He has to rely on the State to do it. If the State fails then&#x2014;it may not be its fault&#x2014;I believe that it is the duty of the State to make reparation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Before replying to the mover of this motion I want to make a few remarks in regard to what has been said by the hon. member who has just sat down. To my mind he has a very strange idea of criminal law. He tries to equate criminal law with compensation; to his mind compensation and punishment are apparently tautological terms. I object to his contention that punishment by the State in the form of a fine is immoral, as he has put it. I think that the hon. member has gone much too far in making that allegation. That is one of the forms of punishment and he ought to know it. If he has made a study of criminology he will know that punishment assumes various forms. Where punishment is imposed it is for a crime not only against the victim but against the State itself against society. It is society which suffers in the first instance and that is why the punishment is imposed. That is why it is society in the first instance which can exact that punishment. It is not immoral at all. I take exception to that approach.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the mover of this motion. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) made a speech here in support of his motion, and in that speech he gave us information which was certainly not covered by the wording of his motion. His motion is framed in particularly vague and wide terms. It asks for a commission of inquiry to&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; consider compensation for injuries as a result of crimes of violence.</block>

<p>His motion simply means that consideration should actually be given to the compensation which has to be paid in terms of our existing law, our existing civil law, by the wrongdoer to the injured party. It was apparent from their speeches that the hon. member for Yeoville and his seconder made use of the reports of certain foreign commissions, particularly the commission in Great Britain to which the mover of the motion referred with a great flourish and which, as it so happens. I have also read, to prove that it is desirable for the victim of an act of violence to be compensated by the State. The hon. member for Yeoville is apparently greatly impressed by those reports. It was because he was impressed by those reports that he apparently placed this motion on the Order Paper, and he has done so at a stage when there is a high incidence of acts of violence in the country. He did say at the start of his speech that he was not introducing the motion with any political motives, but purely for other considerations. But it is strange that he should have come forward with this motion at this precise stage to try to create so much sympathy for the victims of acts of violence.</p>

<p>I take it that the hon. member&#x2019;s intention is that schemes should be investigated by means of which the victims of acts of violence can be compensated by the State or by a body created or designated by the State, and that by compensation he does not mean compensation which can be obtained from the wrongdoer under our existing civil law. To appreciate the motion and its implications I want briefly to mention the existing legal prin <span class="col_2837-2838" refersTo="page_1433"/>ciples in connection with this matter, particularly for the edification of the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) who has stated so glibly that the State is acting immorally in exacting punishment.</p>

<p>Under our law any deed or action on the part of any person may have two legal consequences. Firstly where that punishment is the legal consequence of an action, we are concerned with crimes and with criminal law. Secondly, where compensation is the legal consequence of an action, we are concerned with unlawful deeds and with civil law. Punishment is exacted by the State in terms of the criminal law because the safety of the state or law and order in the state and the safety of society as a whole is placed in jeopardy. Under civil law. compensation is granted to the injured party because the rights of that particular individual have been violated. It often happens. Mr. Speaker, that not only can a penalty be imposed for a crime, but compensation can also be demanded under civil law. It is true that a person who commits an act of violence is usually a poor person, a person from whom nothing can be recovered, and in those cases compensation usually cannot be obtained by an injured party. It looks as though the hon. member for Yeoville no longer wants compensation in the case of acts of violence to be claimed from the wrongdoer by the injured party but that the State, in terms of the schemes which he mentioned, should be responsible in this regard. This principle whereby the State has to be responsible to injured persons as the result of acts of violence is of course completely foreign to our Roman-Dutch Law. It is also foreign to British Law. These are the two legal systems which are applied in South Africa to-day to a greater or lesser extent. The principle whereby the State is held responsible for the compensation to be paid to an injured party as the result of a crime was formulated by a committee of the British Parliament to which the hon. member also referred. This principle is the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The obligation to the victim of a crime rests primarily on the society which has failed to protect him against crime and can only effectively compensate him.</block>

<p>This is the ground on which it is contended that we should act in this way. This argument is typical of Socialism and I want to emphasize it, Mr. Speaker. This argument is a typical argument of the &#x201C;welfare State&#x201D;. The poor State is expected to be the willing packhorse which has to carry all the sorrow and suffering of humanity in order to assure a heaven on earth for mankind. As is the case of all ideas of Socialism and its &#x201C;welfare State&#x201D; the end of this sort of thing can never be foreseen. The eventual size of the snowball can never be estimated.</p>

<p>At this stage supporters of the motion may work out that this will cost the State R1,000.000 or R2,000,000. but I predict that within a few years it may easily cost the State R10,000,000 or R20,000,000, or very much more. Apart from the fact that the whole idea underlying this motion is the &#x201C;welfare State&#x201D; idea I still have the following doubts. If the State has to pay compensation to injured persons in cases of violence, how can one justify the withholding of compensation in the case of other crimes? There are many cases, for example, of heartless fraud in which many victims are robbed of their hard-earned savings. Why should a person who has been robbed of R1,000&#x2014;because robbery is an act of violence in terms of our law&#x2014;be compensated by the State for the loss of that R1.000, while the person from whom R1,000 is stolen&#x2014;because theft is not a crime of violence&#x2014;receives no compensation for it? Both are affected in the same way. Can one find any moral justification for such discrimination? I do not think so, Mr. Speaker. One cannot justify such discrimination. The mover did not try to justify this distinction between crimes of violence and other crime. He did not discuss this question at all.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>It is already applicable in the case of property.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to the case of property which the hon. member mentioned. But if it cannot be justified then compensation must be paid by the State in all cases of crime. If the hon. member cannot justify that discrimination, morally or otherwise, then compensation must be paid for all crime. The hon. member unfortunately did not quote the following statement from that report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A scheme of universal compensation would, however, involve unpredictable and unlimited commitments and its operation would either require an elaborate administrative machine or place great additional burdens on the courts. Even a scheme restricted to victims of crimes of violence raises most formidable difficulties in the determination of the victims who are and who are not entitled to compensation.</block>

<p>This brings me to my second doubt. Is it the intention of the mover that the victims should be compensated only where the wrongdoers are convicted, or does he mean that all these victims should be compensated whether there are convictions or not? If compensation is to be paid to the victim only where the wrongdoer is found guilty then there is a real objection to it. The hon. member for Durban (Central) made a very strong plea that this should form part of the punishment but what about all the wrongdoers who are not found guilty? Should the victims of their acts of violence not receive compensation because the perpetrators of these acts of violence have not been tracked down? He did not go into that aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>I want to mention a few cases of public violence. According to the Police Report of <span class="col_2839-2840" refersTo="page_1434"/>I960 from which the hon. member quoted in that year there were 170 convictions involving 2,045 accused persons, but only 1,100 persons were found guilty. This was in regard to public violence. We do not know how many victims there were. There might have been a large number of victims or there might have been only a few. In a case of public violence there may be many or few victims. However, the report did not mention the number of victims. The fact is, Mr. Speaker, that more than 2,000 persons were charged and only 1,100 were convicted. Let us take assault: 124,800 persons were charged with assault but only 85,000 were convicted. The others were found not guilty. According to the hon. member for Durban (Central) the victim cannot be compensated if there is no conviction. He did not go into that aspect of the matter. I just want to show that 78.66 per cent, which is almost four-fifths, of our crimes consist of assaults.</p>

<p>As the hon. member said, &#x201C;these figures are deceptive &#x201D;. The high figure in South Africa is due to the large number of non-Whites who are involved in this matter. He particularly mentioned the Bantu and said: &#x201C;The Bantu are more vicious</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Then I accept the word of the hon. member, Mr. Speaker, that &#x201C;they are more violent&#x201D;, but the hon. the mover of the motion ascribed this very high figure to the fact that the offences were committed mainly by the &#x201C;tribal Natives&#x201D;, His figure is totally wrong in this regard because not 10 per cent of the total number of assaults are committed in the Bantu areas. They are all committed outside the Bantu areas. He said that a scheme should be worked out to cover the &#x201C;detribalized Natives &#x201D;. When I asked him whether he wanted to discriminate, he said &#x201C;No&#x201D;, he was merely thinking of the &#x201C;tribal Natives &#x201D;. Apparently he wants to deal with the &#x201C;detribalized Natives&#x201D; in the White area on a different footing. How does he want to deal with them? Is it possible for us to continue with these schemes when we bear in mind the multi-racial community that we have to deal with?</p>

<p>I want to emphasize the fact that we are not disinterested in the victims of crimes of violence, particularly since we know that many of these victims are Whites. But the hon. member did not discuss this problem of our mixed society at all. He has not convinced us at all that this is a problem which should be tackled, nor has he told us how it should be solved. He has not told us what the terms of reference of the commission should be in connection with that aspect of the matter. Should they all be excluded or should they be included? If we exclude them we shall be left with a very small percentage of crimes in which violence is involved and this will be a matter then which we shall probably be able to dispose of quite easily. But if we include them, then it becomes a very difficult matter because if one bears in mind that 124,000 persons were charged with assault in 1960, and if one accepts that at least one person was the victim of every assault, so that in 1960 alone there were 124,800 victims of assault, and we then assume that each one has to be paid a minimum of R10 by way of compensation, then that compensation alone would amount to R1,250,000. This is an aspect of the matter which the hon. member did not investigate at all, but I want to return to the point that there is no justification for drawing a distinction, as far as injured parties are concerned, between cases where there are convictions and those cases where convictions are not secured. What is more, there is no justification either for limiting compensation to the victims themselves. Take the case of murder, which is a crime of violence. Because the victim is dead, he cannot be compensated. His dependants should then be compensated and if his dependants are not compensated, his estate should be compensated. Where there are no dependants, I think that the estate should be able to claim that compensation. Or does the hon. member also want to draw a distinction here? Now I want to ask the hon. member where he is actually going to draw the line. As I have said, this is a snowball. If one says A, one then has to say B; and if one says B, one then has to say C; one then has to go the whole way, and I am sure that if we consider this matter carefully in relation to the multi-racial society in which we find ourselves to-day, all South Africa&#x2019;s gold and mineral wealth will not in the long run be sufficient to compensate for all the various types of crimes of violence which are committed.</p>

<p>I come to my third doubt. Why should the State not recover the compensation from the wrongdoer? The hon. member gave some attention to this point. He said that this was a possibility but he tried to close the subject by saying: &#x201C;This matter must be approached with caution &#x201D;. Here a real principle of our law is involved. If the State is able to exact punishment and is also able to demand compensation from the person who is charged, that punishment will actually be a double punishment because then the compensation also becomes a punishment inasmuch it is recovered from him by the State. We would therefore be applying two principles of our law simultaneously. I want to refer again to the report to which the hon. member referred. and I want to read out a quotation to <span class="col_2841-2842" refersTo="page_1435"/>him in connection with another aspect of this matter.</p>

<p><i>Inter alia,</i> the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The principle of punishment by the State for an offence against the law and the principle of requiring the offender to make full restitution for a wrong done to his victim &#x2026;</block>

<p>There are two principles therefore which are applied simultaneously. The Report states that this is an extremely far-reaching change in the law, a change which is completely foreign to the British legal system and which is also foreign to our legal system, of course.</p>

<p>This brings me to my next misgiving. If this offender has to make restitution, there are very serious practical difficulties involved. In the case of a serious offence the offender is punished for a long period. He may be imprisoned for ten or 20 years or even for life. Where and how is he to earn the money to make restitution? Or will only the wealthy ones have to make restitution because they have goods that can be confiscated? There is no necessity for this step in these cases because compensation can be obtained from a wealthy person by way of a court action. But let us imagine that the offender is able to make restitution, that he has earnings from which he can make such restitution; then we still have another question to answer: Which persons and which claims should be given preference as far as the money earned by that person is concerned? Should he first be allowed to provide for his own support&#x2014;if he does not go to gaol&#x2014;and that of his dependants, or must he first make restitution and allow his dependants to go hungry? These are difficulties, real difficulties which in my view the hon. member should have dealt with when he was discussing this matter.</p>

<p>I come now to my last and most important objection and this is an objection in principle, namely, that the State has no obligation to compensate its citizens for injuries which they suffer because of criminal conduct on the part of other citizens. The State has no part in that criminal conduct. To contend the opposite is to say that a policeman who has to combat crime is co-responsible for a crime if he cannot prevent it; that because the State cannot prevent it, it is co-responsible, and therefore it has to pay compensation. In other words, it also has to be penalized. This to my mind is the crux of the whole motion and for this reason alone the motion is to some extent a pernicious one. In this connection I want once again to quote from this Report. On page 7 I find this interesting statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The proposition that the State has the duty to protect its members from unlawful violence and that if it fails to do so, it should pay compensation, seems to us to be both fallacious and dangerous; fallacious because we do not believe that the State has an absolute duty to protect every citizen all the time against the other citizens, dangerous because acceptance of public liability for offences against the person could be the basis for a demand of acceptance of liability for all offences against property.</block>

<p>I am well aware of the fact that the hon. member for Yeoville has only argued that a commission should be appointed to investigate these matters. He actually makes three allegations in his motion; firstly, that consideration should be given to the principle; secondly, that the results of studies that have already been made should be investigated and that further evidence should be obtained. In the third part of his motion he states that if there is some basis for his argument, the practical steps to be taken should then be investigated and recommended by a commission. I am also aware of the fact, as he is, that the merits of the case are actually not in issue here. He said that very clearly. My reply to that is that I contend that the principle itself is fundamentally unacceptable because the State is not responsible for crimes committed. For this reason alone a commission is unnecessary at this stage. But the principle itself is unacceptable, and if one rejects a commission on those grounds it is hardly necessary to deal with the other points. Notwithstanding this fact, however, let us consider the other points as well. The second part of his motion states that studies which have already been made should again be investigated and considered. This simply is an investigation into an investigation already held because the studies which have been made already constitute a thorough investigation. A large part of the speech of the hon. member was merely a repetition of what we find in this Report. There is nothing in his speech which is not contained in this Report. For example, he had a great deal to say about what the definition of &#x201C;crime of violence&#x201D; should be. This question is dealt with at length in the Report and the hon. member has merely repeated it this morning. The greatest part of his speech consisted of a repetition of the contents of a Report which was submitted to the British House of Lords. For example, he mentioned two schemes. These two specific schemes which he mentioned this morning are mentioned in the Report and are dealt with in detail in the Report, far more effectively than the way in which the hon. member dealt with them this morning. But the matter which is not dealt with in detail in this Report is the part which insurance can play in this connection. The hon. member dealt with this question in a few words when he said: &#x201C;Insurance is not the answer &#x201D;. I want to ask why it is not the answer? We have many insurance schemes, against crimes of violence in this country, many cheap schemes of insurance&#x2014;R2 per annum <span class="col_2843-2844" refersTo="page_1436"/>for R2,000 of insurance against crimes of violence. This is a very cheap premium and perhaps this is where the answer lies. But probably because it was not dealt with in this Report, the hon. member did not go into it either. On the grounds which the hon. member submitted, I ask myself whether it is necessary for us to have an inquiry into an earlier inquiry? Cannot we simply refer the hon. the Minister to this Report? Indeed, I presume that the hon. the Minister has already read this Report.</p>

<p>But when I asked the hon. member whether he wanted to discriminate, he steered clear of the subject. He did not want to say anything about it and he did not deal with that aspect of the matter at all. But this is the important point: If an investigation is to be made, the question which has to be investigated in South Africa is this: To what extent is it practicable in a multi-racial state such as we have in South Africa?</p>

<p>The hon. member is now contradicting himself.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No. I say it is not practicable in South Africa at this stage, although we are not opposed to it because we know that most of the victims are Whites and we are not indifferent towards them. We may perhaps be able to have an investigation like the one that I want to suggest in a moment.</p>

<p>As far as the third portion of his motion is concerned it was, as I said, practically just a repetition of the report of the commission. But there was one matter in this report of the commission that I wanted the hon. member to discuss and which he did not mention. On page 41 the report sets out a number of criteria for compensation, but the hon. member did not discuss them. I want to mention these criteria briefly one by one. The report states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be possible to justify it (that is to say, compensation) on grounds which do not postulate state liability for the consequences of all crimes, whether against a person or against property.</block>

<p>In our Criminal Procedure Act we have a provision which states that if a person is punished for a crime against property, the magistrate or the judicial officer may also order that he should compensate the victim for the crime. The hon. member did not ask for it, but I want to suggest a departmental inquiry to the hon. the Minister. I want to emphasize, again that I am not disinterested in the victims of crime nor is the Government disinterested. I want to suggest that the hon. the Minister may perhaps be able to have a inquiry instituted to ascertain to what extent one can also extend the system which now exists in respect of property offences, to personal injury, in the sense that where punishment is imposed, the punishment may for example, be suspended on condition that some measure of compensation is paid to the person who was assaulted. This is a simple system which might easily be introduced without the big schemes which the hon. member suggested here this morning, schemes which will probably not be successful in our country. I think that this is an easier method which might perhaps be introduced into our criminal law.</p>

<p>I come now to the second criterion which is mentioned in the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must provide an effective practical means, whether by definition or otherwise, of distinguishing the types of crime for which compensation is to be paid from those for which it is not.</block>

<p>I also want to recommend again that it may be practicable to adopt the principle in our criminal law that the judicial officer should have the power to order that a certain amount of compensation be paid and then to suspend or reduce the sentence subject to that condition.</p>

<p>I come to the third criterion mentioned in the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must provide means of distinguishing the deserving claimant from the undeserving or fraudulent, which will both be effective in operation and appear manifestly clear and fair.</block>

<p>The hon. member did not discuss this aspect either. It is obvious that many kinds of claims will be made against the State by people who will simply say that they have been assaulted while in fact they have not been assaulted at all. There are numbers of frauds of this kind which may arise and which are mentioned in this report. The hon. member did not give his attention to these matters either.</p>

<p>Then there is the other criterion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must not prejudice the work of the criminal courts or of the police.</block>

<p>Sir, a general system such as that advocated by the hon. member may adversely affect the &#x201C;criminal court&#x201D; and hamper the work of the police. Because what will be the position? It will look to the public as though the police are associated with the criminal, as though the State is associated with the criminal, because both will have to pay compensation then for the crime committed by the one.</p>

<p>The hon. member also mentioned the administrative expenses involved although he did not discuss this question either, while the report which I have mentioned does deal with this matter. It shows that the administrative expenses will amount to almost as much as the amounts paid by way of compensation.</p>

<p>What is the use of these proposals to have a general investigation of this nature? As I say, basically we are not in favour of a welfare State and we are opposed to the idea that the State should compensate people for crimes committed against them. Secondly, an investigation has already been made and recommendations have also been made. Why should we cover all this ground again?</p>

<p>I want to ask, therefore, although we are not disinterested in these people, that a departmental inquiry be instituted to ascertain whether a provision similar to that which exists in respect of compensation for damage to property cannot be introduced into our criminal law, and then we can leave it to the discretion of the courts as far as the application of this principle is concerned. I think that will be more adequate in a multi-racial country like South Africa. To introduce a detailed scheme such as that advocated by the hon. member is quite impracticable and impossible in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to congratulate the mover of this motion, and the seconder, for two very objective speeches relating to a problem which I think is a problem which all civilized societies to-day are going to have to face up to, and, as I shall try to demonstrate, are beginning to pay more attention to, and are beginning to appreciate is a problem which the State itself is going to have to do something about. I am sorry that the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has taken up the attitude that he has. I am sorry that the hon. member does not think that there is any basis in the principle which is involved.</p>

<p>I think this motion should only be rejected if it is felt that there is no foundation for the principle, that there is no room in our society, in our state, for the principle that the State should assume some responsibility for the victims of crimes of violence. Perhaps I can put it at even less than that: The principle is whether or not there is some room for an investigation into the question whether or not the State should be responsible for compensating victims of crimes of violence.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron suggested that this whole debate is quite unnecessary and we should refer to the hon. the Minister of Justice the report of the English Working Committee which was formed at the behest of the Home Secretary. I think the hon. member for Heilbron forgets two facts. One of them is something which struck me on reading that report: It was obviously compiled by a lot of English lawyers, lawyers whose minds are plagued, when one compares it with our legal minds, with a series of pigeonholes. Everything has to go into a pigeonhole before it could be assimilated into the general law. I must say that looking especially at the introductory paragraphs I was a little disappointed to see the approach that was adopted. I believe, Sir, that we can adopt a much better approach. I believe we have a flexible system of law which can adapt itself very much more easily to the problem which is involved than the English system of law. But if the hon. member for Heilbron has looked at this as carefully as perhaps he should have done, he would have seen on pages 9 and 10 an examination of the offences which were &#x201C;likely to be eligible for compensation &#x201D;. The offences which are listed are murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, malicious wounding, and so on and so on. One of the most interesting aspects of these figures is that the total number of those offences was 15,524, of which 10,000 were malicious woundings, &#x201C;the majority of which would not justify compensation because they arose out of brawls or family disputes &#x2026; &#x201D;. They were not unprovoked, as they say. Surely such a statement in itself is a reason why we should have a commission in this country. I think the position which exists in this country is quite different from the conditions which exist anywhere else.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) has already mentioned that we have a class of people in this country to whom stick-fighting for example is I would call, a national sport, and I am referring to certain of the Bantu people in their Bantu areas. And those persons have no parallel I believe in any other civilized country. But I do believe there is another feature, and that is that the criminal class of this country is, I think it is fair to say, if one looks at the statistics as to what races commit crimes, mainly the Bantu. This is perhaps one of the most important aspects which underlies why &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, also Bantu upon European, Bantu upon White. This I think is one of the most important aspects of this debate. As I shall indicate, our law has for a long time provided that there should be a method whereby compensation can be claimed by a victim from the offender. As the hon. member for Yeoville has pointed out, that certainly applies so far as property is concerned, and this of course is in our code, and as the hon. member for Yeoville also pointed out, a sentence can be suspended on certain conditions. Section 352 of our code says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever a person is convicted before any court of any offence, other than an offence specified in the Fourth Schedule &#x2026;</block>

<p>I think that is murder, rape &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<p>Yes, and offences for which there is a minimum penalty prescribed&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_2847-2848" refersTo="page_1438"/>&#x2026; or an offence in respect of which the imposition of a prescribed minimum imprisonment is compulsory, it may in its discretion &#x2026; postpone the passing of sentence and release him on certain conditions &#x2026; whether as to compensation, the rendering to the person aggrieved of some special benefit, or service in lieu of compensation &#x2026;</p>

<p>Likewise it may suspend the sentence on the same conditions. Clearly that section brings into the ambit of our criminal courts the remedy to the victim to get compensation from the offender for crimes of violence as well.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>But not from the State.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Those provisions are found in most civilized countries of the world. In most of those countries you do not have a Bantu population like we have and you do not have the class of person like our Bantu, who commit the majority of the crimes. Indeed, the experience, certainly in Durban, is that in so far as housebreaking and assaults and robberies are concerned the persons, almost without exception, who commit them are Bantu. They are least qualified of all to provide any compensation to their victims and in the result they are able to gamble the more readily, having nothing to lose, in trying to gain something through an assault or a housebreak. I say that I think this is an important factor. The extent to which it is a valid point is something which no one in this House can determine. I do not believe that any investigation has been made into those facts, and <b>I</b> believe that it is very important that it should be made, and that a commission such as this could investigate this position. That is all this motion asks for. It asks for an investigation by a commission to enquire into all the many factors which the hon. member for Yeoville enunciated in introducing the motion.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron asked why crimes of violence should be separated from other crimes. I want to point out to the hon. member that our law already discriminates in this regard. It provides for State assistance in the recovery of compensation for victims of crime where property is involved.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, mainly because it is a liquid claim.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, except in cases of stock theft, where a valuation has to be placed on the value of the stock stolen. There the court puts an arbitrary value on it, as it would have to do in the case of an injury. It would always have to put an arbitrary value on the injury done to a person. But as far as stock theft is concerned, it is really a question of damages, and it is really an illiquid claim. In the other case, where it is proved in the court that money was stolen through embezzlement, the court has proof of how much money was stolen and it orders reparation of that amount of money.</p>

<p>But there are other examples in our law as to the principle which is involved. I have mentioned Section 357 and Section 352 of the Code, and under the Children&#x2019;s Act is provided that where the court has convicted a person of having conduced to the commission of an offence it may order the said person to pay to the party injured by the offence compensation and costs. There is another example of State aid in the recovery of compensation. I do not think that is necessarily restricted to crimes relating to property. One might be found guilty then of action relating to the person of a child. Under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act the provision in the original Act was re-enacted only last year that in relation to offences committed under that Act compensation could be summarily decided upon by the Minister and his order would then become a civil judgment, another example of the direct intervention by the State to help the victim to get compensation for the loss he suffered at the hands of the offender. In that regard I may say that the offences which may be committed under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act involves injury by animals but I can think of more examples of offences involving injury to persons than I can of offences involving injury to property. The principle which the hon. member for Heilbron will not accept has therefore already been accepted in our law, in regard to property.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Is it not true that in the cases quoted by you now there is only reference to State aid in recovering damages from the offenders, while this motion asks that the State should pay the compensation?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I specified exactly what it was, and it must be obvious to the hon. member, who is a lawyer. I said it was an example of the State helping a victim to get compensation from the offender. I am talking about the principle involved, whether or not the State should have anything to do with it. The State, I submit, should have something to do with it.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) made it very clear and I think the hon. member for Heilbron misunderstood him, because he took great exception to his saying that it was morally wrong for the State to take money in the form of fines and other penalties for injuries to victims of crimes. But I think the hon. member for Heilbron should look at the matter in its proper perspective, in the perspective in which the hon. member for Durban (Central) put it. If you look at it objectively, what happens is that the State gets the money and the victims gets nothing at all. The victim is in fact the only one who really suffers, because it is the policy, I am very pleased to say that the Minister of Justice provides as much rehabilitation as he possibly can as far as offenders are concerned. Much has been done in that regard, but as the hon. member for Durban (Central) said, nothing whatever is done for <span class="col_2849-2850" refersTo="page_1439"/>the victim. It is all done for the offender. The State goes out of its way to rehabilitate the offender, but does nothing whatever for the victim.</p>

<p>It is true that you can get hospitalization from the State, but you are not compensated for the effect of the injury done to you by a member of society, and that is the point. The hon. member for Durban (Central), I think, raised a very important aspect of this matter, and that is the question of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. The hon. member said that there you have what amounts to State compensation, because the State has made it compulsory for motor vehicles to be insured under this Act, and the result is that everyone who is injured by negligent or reckless driving is compensated by the insurance company through the direct action of the State. It may be that some sort of thing like this may be the answer in relation to victims of crime. I do not know, but I think this is something which should be investigated. But what I want to point out is that in relation to the Motor Vehicle Insurance Act every single person who is knocked down and injured and claims damages, has been injured as the result of a criminal offence, because it is a criminal offence to drive negligently or recklessly. In that regard, and in that regard only, does our law provide for compulsory compensation to the persons who are the victims of these crimes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>Is not the basis of that because you drive a potentially dangerous vehicle?</p>

<p>Yes, but all people who own firearms own potentially dangerous weapons, but there is no law which says that owners of firearms should be subject to compulsory insurance. This is not entirely different. The Motor Vehicle Insurance Act shows that there is a direct responsibility on the part of the State for persons who injure other persons.</p>

<p>Before I leave the hon. member for Heilbron, there is one other thing I would like to reply to. He thought this motion was quite unnecessary because we are not a welfare state. I know that, and I do not think America is a welfare state, or that Western Germany is a welfare state, but in those two countries you do find the state taking an active part in seeing that some sort of reparation is made by the offender to the victim.</p>

<p>To what extent?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I will deal with that. I think that one can divide into two categories the sort of legislation which exists. On the one hand there is the legislation whereby the State helps the victim to get compensation from the offender, and the other is where the State itself provides compensation where the offender does not pay. That I have only been able to find in Switzerland. The last example, which is the ideal I think we should all strive for, is found, as far as I have been able to ascertain, strangely enough, only in Cuba. Of course that was before the advent of the present regime. I think that this is something the Commission should investigate, that there should be some relationship between the sentence for the crime and the compensation for the crime. As I say, I think that can be broken up into two categories. In the first place you get those cases where instead of imposing a fine you impose a sentence of compensation to be paid over a certain period, with a sanction attached to it that if the offender does not pay that fine in the instalments ordered he will go to prison.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. I am just saying that that is the one thing. Then the other category is the case where such a course is impossible, in other words, where it is quite impossible for the victim to recover from the offender, because the latter has nothing to give him. In those cases the pattern one sees in many of the Western countries obviously does not come into operation, but the very fact that it is not possible for the victim to get anything from the offender is, I think, a very good reason why the State should interfere and itself provide the compensation. All our rules of self-help, all the rules of law which started with self-help, the shortage of police, the reasons for self-help, community development in the early days, which strangely enough were very well put forward by the hon. member for Durban (Central) who is not even a lawyer&#x2014;indicate quite clearly why our law has developed to-day as it has. The fact that the offender has no money was dealt with in the old days by the community. If the offender could not pay it, the community did, and in some of our tribal societies, even in South Africa amongst the Bantu, we find something very similar. It is the community which is responsible.<span class="col_2851-2852" refersTo="page_1440"/> The responsibility of the State, inasmuch as the State is the vehicle in which society travels on the road it is going, is to the community, to society, and society is composed of a lot of individuals. I do not think it stretches any of the rules of legal thought to suggest that an assault upon an individual is an assault upon society. Indeed, I think that is the justification for the statement that the State concerns itself with an offence against the individual.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Before we adjourned I was dealing with some of the arguments put forward by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman), and I indicated that I would deal with the figures and the systems which had been adopted in other countries. Before I do so, there is one other aspect of this matter which the hon. member for Heilbron referred to, and that was the cost. I think that if this House could say right now that the cost would be so prohibitive, that would be a good point for rejecting this motion. But can we say that? Can we say how many victims of crime there will be until we have had an inquiry into the matter? I mentioned earlier that one of the interesting aspects of the British White Paper was that of the assaults there was something like 10,000 out of 15,000 which they disregarded as not warranting compensation. In our law in South Africa I think it is fair to say that until we have had a proper break-down of the crime figures and a proper examination, it will be impossible to say how much this scheme will in fact cost. If it is going to be exorbitant, naturally it will not be proceeded with, but I do not think that at this stage we can determine whether it will be exorbitant or not. Take the crime of robbery. That is a very serious offence. South Africa unfortunately has a lot of robberies, but anyone who has practised in the courts will appreciate that robbery takes various forms. You have, e.g., the robbery committed by a Bantu upon a Bantu, which might take the form of bag-snatching at a bus queue. I venture to suggest that certainly on pay-day there must be several such robberies committed in each town, but it is of a minor nature. No injury is sustained by the person robbed. Robbery is theft accompanied by violence, such as hitting the man&#x2019;s arm and taking a bag out of his hand, but there would not be any compensation required in such a case and in respect of that person. I cannot say how many such cases of robbery there are, because I do not think the matter has ever been investigated, but I believe it should be investigated.</p>

<p>One of the reasons why the figures were so low in Britain in relation to their population is that many of those assaults were put out of the scope of the proposed scheme, and they did so because they arose out of brawls, etc. Now how many of the assaults committed in this country arise out of brawls? How many disturbances of the peace are reported to the police which are technical assaults, and in how many of those cases is anyone injured? In the example which the hon. member for Durban (Central) gave of fights between Bantu, specially when using sticks, an assault which would be an aggravated assault in the case of Whites, would be nothing at all to them and they would not require or expect any compensation. So I feel that if one has regard to the figures as they stand, <i>prima facie</i> the hon. member for Heilbron would appear to have a case, but when you break those figures down the position may be different.</p>

<p>In England and Wales there were 15,000 cases which they thought would not fall in the category where compensation has to be paid. If one takes the 750,000 offences committed by Bantu in this country, one still has in proportion to our population approximately seven times the number of crimes committed in respect of one-third of the population, compared with the whole of Great Britain. This is a matter which the commission could investigate, and likewise the matter of insurance. The point was made that people can insure. People insure when they have property. Those are the people who can afford insurance, but people do not necessarily insure their lives. The factor which determines that is whether they are able to afford it. The Minister asked me to give him a survey of the figures in other countries. In France civil actions can be pursued at the same time, but the French system is one where the question of damages and compensation rests essentially with the civil law. In Holland they specify three different criminal offences, manslaughter, wilful or negligent injury, or maiming any part of the body, where the injured person can claim. In those cases the State aids the individual to get compensation from the offender.</p>

<p>That is so. But this is covered by the motion, although the hon. member for Yeoville indicated that he would rather the State assume liability, and so would I, where the victim has no other remedy whatever. Nevertheless this does fall within the scope of the motion, as to what sort of remedy the State is prepared to give. As I said, Cuba is the only country where there is an absolute liability by the State. If someone is injured through a criminal offence, the State provides compensation to the victim, and then the State also assumes the right to recover <span class="col_2853-2854" refersTo="page_1441"/>it from the offender. In Switzerland they have a very complicated procedure, but they do provide in the law that if the offender does not pay, the State will pay the victim out of the proceeds of the sale of confiscated objects and goods, etc., which go to the State, and the amount which the State can demand from the offender as a guarantee for his keeping the peace. Those are the two aspects, the absolute liability which is assumed in the cases where the offender does not pay, where the State sees to it that there are some funds from which compensation can be paid, as in Switzerland. The hon. member for Durban (Central) made the innuendo that the money taken in fines from the criminal should be used for this purpose to compensate the victim. We normally pay for the policing we get. The taxpayer pays his taxes to the State, and in exchange he expects to get some protection, which he does in the form of the Police Force. But no Police Force in any country in the world, let alone this country, where there are so many imponderables, can ever prevent all crimes being committed, and that is the point. Inasmuch as it is a responsibility which the State has assumed, and it is lacking in certain regards where someone is injured, in that regard our society leaves a gap which has not been filled. The State, in my submission, should fill that gap and the State should do something for the innocent victims.</p>

<p>Sir, it is a pity that the hon. member for Heilbron did not read the report which he has relied upon so much. It is a pity that he did not appreciate that here was a report in which one had English legal minds hamstrung by the pigeon-holes which formulate their thought in law. We are in a country which, I venture to suggest, has the finest legal system in the world. A legal system based upon broad principles which can assimilate a scheme such as this quite easily. We are not faced with the dilemma that all the other countries are faced with. We are not faced with the dilemma that they have, for example, in America with all their conflicting jurisdiction, with the basis of law not based upon broad principles as ours is. But nevertheless you find in a place like New York State that every year the Probation Department collects something like $200,000 as compensation for victims. We do not have any machinery of that kind. I think if the hon. the Minister will have regard to what is involved here, he will find that it is just this: the principle of whether or not it is worthwhile investigating; in other words, whether or not the Minister thinks that the principle involved here, namely that the State owes some responsibility to its citizens who are ravished by criminals, from whom no compensation whatever can be obtained, is worth investigating, and whether it is worth investigating whether that principle can properly be applied in our law. Sir, we are very lucky. One finds throughout all these various countries that they are faced with the problem of whether or not they should exclude or include certain things. In this country every victim has a right in law to claim against the man who has assaulted him, the man who has killed the person on whom he or she was dependent. The problem which faces us, the essence of the problem, is not that with which the young Conservatives were faced. The essence of this problem is whether or not this House thinks that the State should assume some responsibility for the innocent victims of crime.</p>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>In the first place, I think the crucial question is whether a responsibility rests upon the State to compensate persons who have been injured as a result of crimes of violence. I want to deal with the merits of that question in greater detail at a later stage; but for the moment I just wish to refer to a few remarks made by hon. members on that side of the House in connection with this crucial question. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) said that there was no absolute responsibility on the State to pay compensation. He admitted that only an element of responsibility really rested upon the State towards those people, as he himself put it. The hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) watered down that same idea a little more. He said that the question which had to be considered was, to use his own words, &#x201C;the principle that the State should assume some responsibility &#x201D;&#x2014;not that a measure of responsibility rested upon the State, but he asked whether the State should not assume a measure of responsibility. I think that considerably waters down the idea that the State is indeed responsible and that is the crucial question with which I shall deal in greater detail at a later stage. The hon. member for Durban (North) raised another aspect of the matter arising from the point made by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) that if the State had to accept responsibility in cases where people had been injured as a result of acts of violence you should ask yourself this question: Why should the State not <span class="col_2855-2856" refersTo="page_1442"/>also assume responsibility for financial compensation to people who suffer a loss as a result of other criminal acts. Hon. members on that side of the House have not as yet replied satisfactorily to that question. The hon. member for Durban (North) fell into the trap when he mixed the two; he said: &#x201C;In Natal the crimes of housebreaking and robbery are mostly committed by the Bantu &#x201D;. According to the suggested scheme compensation will have to be paid in the case of robbery but in the case of housebreaking no compensation will be paid.</p>

<p>Robbery is theft accompanied by violence. It does not necessarily mean that robbery should cause injury, but because there is violence it is to be expected that robbery can also be accompanied by injuries. That was one of the examples given of possible crimes in which injuries could be sustained.</p>

<p>I first of all want to analyse the motion as it appears on the Order Paper and as introduced by the hon. member for Yeoville. He asks in his motion for the appointment of a commission to investigate, <i>inter alia,</i> the following (I have classified them separately): Firstly, compensation for injuries sustained as a result of crimes of violence. I want to emphasize this question because if possible I should like to have clarity on it from the hon. member for Yeoville. I want to emphasize the word &#x201C;injuries &#x201D;. I think this is the important sentence in his motion: Compensation for injuries sustained as a result of crimes of violence. In other words, where compensation is paid there must of necessity be injuries and I think the interjection which the hon. member for Yeoville made a moment ago proved that that is what he has in mind. Secondly he asks that the investigation which have already been made should be carried further. Thirdly he referred to the right of the victims and/or their dependants to compensation. He then refers to the nature of the compensation; the next is the way in which claims should be treated and lastly the crime which will fall under the scheme. I want to ask the hon. member for Yeoville whether he suggests in his motion, by implication or otherwise, that compensation should also be paid where death occurs?</p>

<p>I am inclined to disagree with the hon. member if he says that where you speak about injuries in a motion death is necessarily included. But we are not now in a court where we expect a person to stand or fall by the motion which he has introduced; I just wanted to get clarity in that regard because, as I read it, this motion does not make provision for cases were death occurs. Personally I feel that a commission of inquiry, as requested by the hon. member for Yeoville, is totally unnecessary and a waste of money because I feel that the State is not responsible for injuries sustained by an individual as a result of violence in all circumstances. In the second place I feel that a scheme as proposed will be totally impractical because of the complications and difficulties involved in it. That is also the reason why schemes of this nature have not been proceeded with in other countries, or in England, amongst others, after they have investigated them, in spite of the very popular idea that you should help people who have sustained injuries or who have suffered as a result of one or other crime. That is why I say that a scheme of this nature is not acceptable nor do I think that a commission as requested by the hon. member for Yeoville will take the matter any further. Mr. Speaker, I have asked myself why the hon. member has introduced this motion in this House. I read in the <i>Burger</i> this morning that he was a very clever man; they made a comparison between him and another political figure in England. I think that if the <i>Burger</i> says that the hon. member is very clever &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>You doubt it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; I think we should take note of it; there may possibly be an element of truth in it. But the <i>Burger</i> does not only say that he is clever; the <i>Burger</i> also says that he is a good &#x201C;plotter &#x201D;. I am not quite sure what that really means, the <i>Burger</i> goes on to say that he is also a good &#x201C;schemer&#x201D;. Because he possesses that qualification I feel that this motion is not as innocent as it appears to be on paper. I think the hon. member probably has ulterior motives with this motion of his. We all know that it is a very popular idea to want to assist the &#x201C;underdog&#x201D;, the person who has suffered one way or another. I doubt, however, whether this motion which the hon. member has introduced in this House and which he hopes will perhaps bring him political or other benefits, will have that effect as far as he is concerned. This matter is fraught with more problems that we can envisage. I am also sure <span class="col_2857-2858" refersTo="page_1443"/>that he conceived this idea because of a memorandum which was submitted to the British Parliament in 1959. There reference was made to a memorandum drawn up by the late Miss Marjorie Fry in which she expressed the idea that society had an obligation towards the victims of crimes because, as she put it, society ought to protect the victims from such crimes. She also suggested a scheme whereby compensation should be paid to such victims. A works committee was then appointed, as hon. members have already told us, which submitted a report. This question was also discussed in fairly great deal by the House of Lords in England on 5 December 1962 and just as we in this House have expressed sympathy for those people, this matter was also treated with a great measure of sympathy in England. Warning voices were, however, raised. Amongst others, Lord Denning warned that they should be very careful about accepting that people had a legal right to compensation by the State and he went on to make a very important comparison. He put it this way: How can we justify the payment of compensation to the children of a husband who has murdered his wife and subsequently commits suicide thus leaving the children orphans, whereas compensation will not be paid where a husband and wife both die in an accident. That is the sort of comparison which we can make not in their dozens but probably in their hundreds, where compensation will have to be paid in the one case under such a scheme, and where, in other cases, where the same loss is suffered and perhaps a greater loss, no compensation will be paid. As I said just now, to me the crucial question, the most important question, is whether the State is responsible, whether a responsibility rests upon the State to compensate individuals where they sustain injuries or where they are killed as a result of the crimes of other individuals. I say that I can find no justification whatsoever to accept such a statement, either absolutely, as the hon. member for Yeoville now admits it is not, or even partially as he maintains it indeed is. I personally am of the opinion that where injuries are sustained or hardship suffered in circumstances for which the State, the Government of the country, is partly responsible, as in the case of a war or riots which arise as a result of the policy of actions of the Government, you can contend that there is a measure of responsibility because the Government, as a result of decisions taken at top level, is partly or out-and-out responsible for the circumstances which have arisen and the injuries sustained as a result of those circumstances. But as far as the relationship between individual persons is concerned I think the duty of the State is only to maintain order and to call criminals to book and to punish them, in the first instance, thereby creating a deterrent so that in future those crimes will not be committed by other persons. But where such crimes are committed by one individual towards another, I do not think the State can in any way be held responsible. If a responsibility rested upon the State in respect of such injuries, it could be accepted that the State would be liable to pay compensation, but if the State carries no responsibility and we embark upon a scheme such as this, compensation will purely and simply be paid out of sympathy for the victims of those crimes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>A noble motive.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, if the hon. member for Yeoville agrees with me we have a basis for discussion, namely that such a scheme must be accepted merely because of sympathy and not because of a sense of responsibility on the part of the State. We are all sympathetic and if it is only a question of sympathy then no responsibility rests upon the State and we will just be introducing such a scheme because we feel sorry for those people and because we want to compensate them for any loss they have suffered. But then we come up against numerous problems, an endless row of problems, so many problems that we can hardly entertain the idea of carrying on with a scheme such as this.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not at this stage want to go into the financial aspect because the hon. member for Heilbron has already dealt with that to some extent but I want to emphasize that if we want to compensate people for injuries sustained as a result of violence we should also seriously consider making provision to compensate people for financial loss suffered as a result of the misdeeds of others. A moment ago I referred to the example which was given in the British House of Lords and I think there are numbers of other examples which can be given. We so often hear of cases where shares are sold to a widow which are supposed to be good shares. She invests all her savings in those shares and to-morrow or the day after when she wakes up she finds that those shares are practically worthless and that she has lost all her money. If hon. members opposite have in mind that in such cases, cases which are as fraudulent as any other crime, we should try to reinstate those persons in their former position or that we should try to repair their loss, we could consider such a suggestion. If we accepted this idea of the hon. member for Yeoville we can certainly not stop there; then we should also make provision for compensation in other cases. If we want to make provision for such cases because of sympathy the question arises where the money must come from. The hon. member for Yeoville suggested that provision for such cases should be made from State funds. I think he takes it that such funds should not be raised by way of certain contributions by the people who are covered, but that compensation should be paid from the State coffers only. Well, that may perhaps be a wise course because had he suggested a form of insurance, such as we have, for example, <span class="col_2859-2860" refersTo="page_1444"/>in the case of third party insurance, I want to say at once that that is not a State undertaking; why then can it not be done by way of insurance because we have forms of insurance to-day which cover cases such as those. I admit that in the circumstances it will probably be better that such payments as he has suggested should be made from the State coffers, from the ordinary taxes which are collected. But in that case we shall be faced with a hundred and one difficulties. In the first instance, in the case of violence, I take it that they will not be willing to make a payment to somebody who was to some extent or to some measure himself responsible for the violence which took place. In other words every case will have to be investigated. If, for example, I had to some extent provoked the person who attacked and injured me surely I would not be entitled to compensation. In other words, each individual case will mean endless investigation and the administrative costs will be exceedingly high. There are other ways however, in which these people can also be assisted. The hon. the Minister of Social Welfare meets these needs to a great extent, as has already been pointed out. The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) said that the person who had perhaps lost a leg or an eye were pushed aside and that he was not looked after. Those cases can receive State assistance. The State pays disability allowances in such cases.</p>

<p>Subject to the means test.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller_">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>That is the following point which I was coming to. That was also raised by the hon. member for Yeoville who also previously interjected and said &#x201C;subject to the means test&#x201D; I think it is accepted by every member of this House that where State money is used for social work, it should be used in order to enable people to live and not to make them rich. The hon. member is leaning backwards with surprise, but that is a fact. Where a man has lost an arm or an eye, will any member opposite be prepared to say: &#x201C;In spite of the fact that you are worth R100.000 or R50.000, we are still going to pay you R1.000 or R5.000 in respect of the injury you have sustained &#x201D;. Why do you pay that amount to the person? He is already very wealthy and he is already able to live from his own money. Why should he receive a monthly allowance as suggested in this scheme? That is surely not what the hon. member for Yeoville envisages. Social work has only one object in mind and that is to enable those people who cannot make a decent living or who have no other income, to live and even if a scheme such as the one suggested by the hon. member for Yeoville ever sees the light of day, it will surely have to be a scheme under which rich people are not enriched further but whereby provision is only made for people in need and who cannot live without that assistance. Where somebody has been a bus driver, for example, and he loses his eyes with the result that he can no longer drive a bus but has of necessity to do other work at a much lower salary, it is a noble idea to say that he should be assisted, nor is there anything wrong with that in principle. But hon. members opposite do not want the means test to be applied; they want to pay a large amount of money to those who have been injured irrespective of whether he is a rich or a poor man. Surely that is something unheard of! I say there are channels whereby those people can be assisted according to their needs. There is provision for family allowances to be paid to widows in cases of death and there is provision for disability allowances which can be paid to persons who have lost an arm or an eye or a leg. But over and above that people can take out accident policies for their own protection, policies which provide this protection. Hon. members may perhaps tell me the poor people in any case do not take out those policies; that is true, but they are always available to the person who wants that protection.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of this matter and it is this: There is nothing in our laws which prevents me from instituting an action against a person who has harmed me. In other words, if the person who has injured me as a result of violence, has any assets, I can take action against him in court and claim compensation for the damage which I think I have suffered as a result of that injury. Nor do I agree with the hon. member for Yeoville when he said this morning that one should be compensated for pain and suffering.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I said that he should not be compensated for that except where it leads to loss of earnings.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#muller_">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULLER</person>:</from>

<p>In that case I agree with the hon. member because in principle. I think, that in considering any scheme such as this, pain and suffering cannot be a consideration. You can perhaps in certain respects claim a certain amount from the guilty party for pain and suffering because he is responsible for the act which has given rise to that pain and suffering, but definitely not against the State. Anybody who has been injured is at liberty to institute a claim in the civil court against the person who has injured him.</p>

<p>I do not quite agree with the hon. member for Heilbron as far as one statement of his is concerned. If it is necessary for us to consider this matter and that we should make it easier for those who are injured and who have grounds for a financial claim, I think we <span class="col_2861-2862" refersTo="page_1445"/>could perhaps do it in the same way as prescribed in Section 357 of the Criminal Procedure Act.</p>

<p>I do not think we understand one another fully. Section 356 only makes provision for damage to property. If a person has committed a criminal act towards me and my property is damaged as a result and he is charged in court with a crime, the magistrate can on the same occasion order him to pay a certain amount in respect of the damage I had suffered. That order of the magistrate has the same effect as a order issued in a civil court. Mr. Speaker. I feel that if it is necessary for us to make it easier to take action against criminals who commit acts of violence thereby causing injury, we could perhaps consider making this section wider. If that was what the hon. member for Heilbron said then we are in complete agreement. I thought he argued against that. I think we can then consider making that section wider so that the magistrate in such a case can also order the criminal at the criminal hearing to pay a certain amount of compensation to the person against whom he had committed the crime. I only mention this as something which can be considered so as to make it easier. I am aware of the fact that a very large section of our population&#x2014;everybody as a matter of fact, but more particularly the less privileged &#x2014;do not easily go to court with a civil action. After such an event has happened and the criminal action has been disposed of, they feel that the risk and the costs involved are so high that they would rather not proceed with the civil action. I feel therefore, that if hon. members think it is necessary, that we should rather consider it that the magistration should be able to make an order at the criminal hearing without compelling the people to institute a civil action.</p>

<p>In those circumstances I consider it undesirable to appoint a commission of inquiry. A commission costs money; it is not done free of charge. The matter which has to be investigated is unacceptable in principle, apart from the fact that it is fraught with difficulties and problems. It will be nothing else, in my opinion. than a waste of money. For that reason I am inclined to vote against the motion of the hon. member for Yeoville.</p>

<p>I do not understand why the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) who has just sat down should come to the conclusion that the basis of the motion put forward by my hon. friend, the member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) should be objectionable in principle. My hon. friend for Ceres seems to take the strict legal view that it is objectionable for an individual who has been injured as a result of a crime&#x2014;any type of crime, not only a crime of violence&#x2014;to be able to obtain compensation other than through the ordinary courts of law when suing under a civil action. That objection was raised in a different form by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). He did not object to the principle for the same reason but he objected to it because, so he believed, it savoured of the sort of enactment one finds in a welfare state to which I gather he has the greatest objection. Neither of these points of view is consistent with a person who is prepared to accept South Africa, its administration and its laws as they stand at the present time. My hon. friend for Ceres, if he is consistent, and if he rigidly adheres to the principles which he has expressed, must automatically object most strongly to the legislation which presently stand in respect of third party insurance, namely that system of legislation which enables a person who is a victim of a motor-car accident to recover compensation from an insurance company. He should be against old age pensions; he should object strongly to the railwaymen receiving pensions when they retire; he should be against workmen&#x2019;s compensation: he should be against unemployment assurance.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ceres should be against all those Acts, as should the hon. member for Heilbron, as being the hall-mark of a welfare state, according to my hon. friend. There is no civilized country in the world at the present time which does not have some legislation of a type to be found in a typical welfare state. You cannot say that you are against this because you find it in a welfare state and that you are in favour of that because one does not find it in a welfare state. In modern society there is always a measure of overlapping; there is always a compromise to be found between the strict principle that an individual is there to look after himself and the principle that the State has some obligation to perform towards its citizens. As an industrial society grows in any country and as the position of an individual citizen in a society becomes less secure and subject to greater dangers, so does this type of legislation become more and more evident in the laws passed in this House and any other Legislature in the civilized world.</p>

<p>So one cannot say that one is against this motion in principle for either of those two reasons and vet at the same time support the sort of legislation which has passed through this House with Government support this very Session. It is all a question of degree, Sir. There must be social legislation of a kind which you find in a highly socialized state or in a welfare state. There will always be some type of legislation of that kind. It depends how far you take it. I can drive home this point perhaps a little better if I refer the hon. member who has just spoken and my hon. friend from Heilbron to the Motor Vehicle <span class="col_2863-2864" refersTo="page_1446"/>Insurance Act of 1942. It has been said by both those members &#x201C;What is wrong with ordinary insurance? They said that ordinary assurance provided such remedy as was required by those who might be injured as a result of crimes of violence. Ordinary insurance, being through the medium of private companies seems to satisfy their consciences in that it has not that element of a welfare state about it. But both those gentlemen, being lawyers, and members of the legal profession, seem to forget that there is a provision in the Motor Vehicle Act whereby if the private insurance companies are not willing to insure motor vehicle drivers and so provide a remedy to those people who are injured as a result of motor-car accident, the head of State&#x2014;the Governor-General as he then was &#x2014;can set up a State Corporation to provide the benefit to those who have been injured which they could not recover by suing the individual wrongdoer in an ordinary court of law. There is the principle, enshrined in our Statute Book 13 years ago, against which both these gentlemen expounded so eloquently to-day.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Presumably we have a civilized Government. This legislation which this Government brought up to date, I think, during its tenure of office does no more in principle than what the hon. member for Yeoville asks this House to do in principle by supporting his motion.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, it is accepted legal theory&#x2014;and I am sure that both those two hon. members will agree&#x2014;that the State must accept responsibility for the suppression and the prevention of crime. That must be accepted. One realizes that the old primitive idea, that when a crime has been committed against a member of one&#x2019;s family, the head of that family must exact retribution from the family to which the wrongdoer belongs, is gone. It has been taken over by the idea that the State is the person against whom a wrong is committed when a crime is committed. If one accepts that principle, as we all do because we believe it is the responsibility of the State to charge such people, then one must also accept that there is some responsibility on the State to compensate those who suffer in a crime of violence due to the inability of the State power to prevent that crime from taking place. Surely, Sir, that is irresistible? If you as the State power are bound to see that a crime does not take place, then you must accept some responsibility for the results of that crime through your inability to see that that crime did not take place. That seems to be irresistible. The State these days is the keeper of the public conscience, that is becoming more and more apparent, and in that sense it must also protect the lives and property of its people. If one accepts that then too one is driven to the conclusion that the State must take some responsibility for the individual who is the victim of a crime and who cannot exact his retribution through the civil courts.</p>

<p>This is a particular problem, Sir, in a society such as we have in South Africa. My learned friend, the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) has touched on the point that we here in South Africa are in a peculiarly different position because we have two sections of our society, one of whom is particularly prone to crimes of violence and the other section which is particularly the victim of crimes of violence. We have two sections, Sir&#x2014;they happen to coincide with different colours&#x2014;one of which is highly civilized and particularly sensitive to crimes of violence because they themselves have been brought up in a society which shuns that type of thing, and living side by side with them you have another community which is particularly prone to the commission of that type of violence due to their historical circumstances. That does not arise elsewhere in the world, Sir, as it does here. It is necessary that one takes cognizance of that because it is a reality of the situation and of the society in which we live.</p>

<p>If one follows the argument of the hon. member for Ceres and one says: &#x201C;But you can always follow through your remedy in the courts of law&#x201D; does that provide a remedy in a society such as this, when one bears in mind that at the present time that section of the society which is particularly prone to this type of violence very often have little &#x201C;straw&#x201D;, if I may put it that way, from which one can exact retribution? Let us look to the future. We are apparently shortly to live in a society where those people who are prone to commit these crimes, are not going to live in our State but they are going to live in some other State. They will have their property against which one is entitled to exact retribution situate in a State over which our courts have no control. If one recovers a judgment in the South African courts against these individuals how is one going to execute against their property which is situate elsewhere?</p>

<p>How do you do it in the case of Rhodesia?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>That can be done, Sir, when one can enter into an agreement with a friendly neighbouring power, but if one cannot enter into an agreement whereby a writ of execution can be endorsed in that neighbouring power and acted upon there, then your remedy in the ordinary courts of law is absolutely worthless. For the sake of making it absolutely clear we say again that we are apparently to enter into a situation where the majority of people living in our society will be those who are prone to commit acts of violence. I say that merely because statistics make that clear. They will be here in our midst. <span class="col_2865-2866" refersTo="page_1447"/>Yet having committed any act of violence quite clearly they will move to another sphere from which, unless our relationship with that State is a particularly friendly one, the injured party will not be able to recover any compensation of any kind. If we wish that to be the state of the society in which we live, if we believe that that is the correct form of society in which to live, then particularly is it the duty of the State to provide an alternative means from which the injured party, the victim of a crime of violence, can recover his compensation. If he cannot recover it from an individual then there is only one other course open and that is for some body to be set up, some fund to be set up, from which the injured person can recover his compensation. So it seems to me, Sir, particularly at the present time, in a country such as South Africa where we are apparently to embark upon the changes which I have mentioned. that it is necessary that there be an exploration of, at least, that there be an inquiry into, the provision of relief to persons who have suffered from crimes of violence, such as the hon. member for Yeoville suggests.</p>

<p>I wish to emphasize, Sir, that one does not have to be wedded to any particular scheme at the present time, provided that in this discussion we have raised sufficiently the problems of the individuals who have suffered. Even in that event we have said enough to require that this motion be approved of.</p>

<p>I personally believe that whatever scheme one might set up, an inquiry will reveal that there is merit, with respect, in what the hon. member for Ceres has said namely that you must always have that element which compels the wrongdoer to pay first. Only in the event of his being unable to do so do you have recourse to some other fund. I believe it is essential that the individual who has been wronged should be encouraged to seek his remedy against the wrongdoer. I believe it is essential that we retain the thought in the mind of the wrongdoer that he will have to pay. Only in the event of his being unable to do so that there should then be a remedy to the victim against some sort of State fund. This is not a new thought, Sir, because motor vehicle insurance in France operates in much the same way. They do not have the form of insurance which we have in South Africa. They have, I believe, a special fund which is set up by way of a levy on the price of petrol. When one is injured by the driver of a motor vehicle one sues that driver or owner in the ordinary way and you execute against his goods. Only in the event that you are unable to recover damages from him or his property may you make a claim against the State fund. I believe it is a good system because it does make the wrongdoer pay if he possibly can. It does not smack of this element of the welfare state which the hon. member for Heilbron finds so objectionable.</p>

<p>Let us have an inquiry into that, Sir, and see if a scheme can be evolved whereby you can sue an individual if he does something wrong and only in the event of his not being able to pay may you make a claim against the State fund. I do not think that would be an unduly expensive system. There is an interesting article in the <i>South African Law Journal</i> of 1955, volume 72, about motor vehicle insurance. This article deals with a system analogous to the French system which I have just outlined. It says that a levy of &#x00BD;d. per gallon on petrol consumed in this country &#x2014;and that was nearly ten years ago&#x2014;will produce an annual fund of over &#x00A3;750,000 from which to draw. Comparing the figures with those in the Blue Book which emanated from the Department of Justice, I think one will see that this will not necessarily be a tremendously expensive fund at all.</p>

<p>The point has been made that because of our non-European population living under a tribal society where it is almost a term of endearment to hit a man over the head with a stick, the thing would become unwieldy and expensive. But, Sir. that is not so. After all, a tribal society has means whereby retribution or compensation can be given or paid by the tribe. One could exclude from a scheme people living under that type of society. One would accordingly, on the figures available in the Blue Book, exclude a great many of what might appear at first sight, to be claims made on this fund.</p>

<p>I was surprised by the assertion of the hon. member for Heilbron that, because a working party in Great Britain had investigated this matter in Command Paper No. 1406 and come to certain conclusions, we in South Africa should have nothing to do with it. As the hon. member for Durban (North) has said that sort of point of view can be explained only upon the basis of a British bias. It is surprising, Sir, that a staunch Republican such as I imagine the hon. member for Heilbron to be, should be so persuaded by the views of a British White Paper; more particularly where, as a staunch Republican, if he were consistent, he would also have followed the views of the British Parliament which rejected republicansim in the 17th century. Be that as it may, Sir, there is some interest in the British White Paper, more particularly if one examines the reasons why they rejected the scheme in favour of State insurance, the scheme whereby one should be allowed firstly to sue in the courts of law. They mention a number of advantages which that scheme will have, such as that a form of compensation determined by the cour&#x2019;s will be likely to command greater public confidence than one settled by some sort of extra-judicial tribunal. Of course that is quite correct. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A court scheme &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is a scheme of suing through the courts&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; would afford better protection against fraudulent or exaggerated claims.</block>

<p><span class="col_2867-2868" refersTo="page_1448"/>I think, Sir, that this question of exaggerated claims is overrated. This is a point touched upon by the hon. member for Heilbron. Why in all conscience should any scheme which provides for relief in matters of this kind be easily the subject of a fraud? After all, a man who is going to get awarded some form of compensation is a man who has had a physical injury. We are dealing with crimes of violence. Why should somebody break his own leg in order to claim compensation? Why should somebody smash his own face in order to claim compensation?</p>

<p>I would not be the least surprised if the hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) were to do something like that. But let us face facts. The ordinary man does not do that. I think the hon. member who seconded this motion could decide in a matter of moments whether a man&#x2019;s injuries were real or imaginary. If the injury is real it is usually quite simple to decide whether that was done as a result of a crime of violence or whether it was done deliberately by the individual concerned. It happens in the courts every day. If the courts can take decisions of that kind, under the scheme which I suggest, the courts would still have to come to a decision of that kind. After all the Minister of Justice these days has to take decisions in respect of matters far more important in circumstances which are far more difficult and he has no difficulty in coming to conclusions which he is absolutely satisfied are without any doubt correct, on evidence which is far more difficult to sift.</p>

<p>The practical difficulties of proof, the practical difficulties of attributing blame are things which cannot these days be an insuperable problem to the scheme which would emerge were the motion of the hon. member for Yeoville accepted.</p>

<p>It is said that insurance companies provide such protection as the individual needs in matters of this kind. We all know that most policies of insurance have exceptions and that paragraph after paragraph of those exceptions deal with situations arising out of civil commotion and matters of that kind. It is particularly insurance policies which pertain to this country that have exceptions of that kind. One knows that European policies have exceptions along those lines but none of them are as wide as the exceptions which pertain to policies covering the property and life in South Africa. That is understandable. But it does give the lie to the argument that this problem can be dealt with merely by the taking out of a R2,000 insurance policy at a premium of R2 per year. There are a great many situations which cannot possible be covered at a reasonable premium by insurances of that kind.</p>

<p>I wish to come back for a moment to the argument that what is being asked in this motion is really something outlandish and foreign to our system. The problem is put clearly in a recent book by Professor Fitzgerald, a professor at the University of Leeds, called &#x201C;Criminal Law and Punishment&#x201D; where he deals with the question of compensation and restitution. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">One feature notably lacking in the different types of punishment so far considered is the element of reparation. While it would seem an elementary demand of justice that the wrongdoer should be made to compensate the victim of his crime, the various sentences available to criminal courts take little account of this.</block>

<p>I mention this because it seems to have been overlooked that it is an elementary demand of justice that the wrongdoer should be made to compensate the victim of his crime. There is no doubt about it. We all wish that that could be done, and it is because of the shortcomings in the form of punishment which our law allows the courts to inflict &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#cadman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CADMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then, Sir, there can be no objection to the principle. If one concedes that there are shortcomings on the aspect of retribution in the amount or the type of punishment which a court can inflict, and if one concedes that there are shortcomings in the ability to recover compensation in a civil court for injuries that have been done to one as a result of the crime, and thirdly, if one concedes the principle that it is the state&#x2019;s duty in modern times to prevent the committing of crime and to protect citizens from the infliction of criminal acts, if one accepts those three principles, then one cannot but accept that the state has some duty (I will not define it) to attempt to restore individuals who are the victims of crime and who have suffered damage to what they were previously. I say no more than that, and if one accepts those three principles, then one must accept that it is a good thing that it is inquired into to find ways and means of overcoming the shortcomings. One need not be wedded to any particular form of relief. I doubt whether the hon. member for Heilbron will reject any of those principles that I have just put forward, and if one accepts those principles then one must accept that it is a good thing to inquire into and try to determine relief in those circumstances. One cannot say that because the British Working Party found it difficult and rejected the scheme, that we must automatically reject it here.</p>

<p>Before I branched off to this section of my argument, I touched on the reasons given by <span class="col_2869-2870" refersTo="page_1449"/>the British Working Party for rejecting a scheme whereby one would sue in the courts and only recover a short-fall from some sort of state fund. The first two arguments against it were really in favour of it, as I have pointed out. The third one was said to be this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Cases where the decisions on the guilt of an alleged offender and the entitlement to compensation of an alleged victim were in conflict, would be less embarrassing if both decisions were taken by a court.</block>

<p>Again an argument which is more in favour of a scheme than against it. Then one comes to the fourth one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A court will be better able than a tribunal to make an appropriate award.</block>

<p>Again an argument in favour of what is suggested and not against it. Fifthly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Under an industrial injury scheme, types of benefits and classes of persons eligible to receive them would have to be carefully considered in relation to national insurance, whereas a court scheme could be devised without regard to such considerations.</block>

<p>Again a conclusion in favour of the scheme and against the principle to reject, which this working party eventually decided upon. Then one comes to the next&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That compensation awarded under a court scheme would be in the form of a lump sum.</block>

<p>That apparently is taken as being adverse to the scheme. Sir, there is no reason on earth why an award should take the form of a lump sum. It could perfectly easily, as in maintenance judgments, be on the basis of a periodical payment. Then finally, the argument is &#x201C;that a court&#x2019;s award would be final and could not thereafter be changed &#x201D;. Consequently in the case of a man injured and subject to periodical treatment that would be an argument against the scheme. But as anyone who is a lawyer in this House knows, the courts meet this problem daily and account is taken in the amount of the final award of any further treatment which the individual might be likely to have.</p>

<p>There are other reasons set out in this document, but there is no doubt that the overall impression one comes to is that a court scheme of this type is probably the most feasible of the lot. In Great Britain, they have many additional types of welfare funds and welfare administrations which could be utilized for the purpose of dealing with a fund of this kind, but I do suggest that it would be the most appropriate type of administration for this sort of fund in South Africa.</p>

<p>May I say in conclusion that listening to the arguments which have been presented to-day, at least this much can be said without any doubt that sufficient has been aired by way of discussion to-day to enable one to say confidently that a case has been made out for an investigation, that enough interest has been raised to warrant one in saying that there ought to be a commission of inquiry into this matter, and I do believe that if the hon. Minister accepts the principles which we have set forward as being those principles which guide a civilized Government, or a civilized state in this field, if those principles are to be accepted, and I believe the hon. Minister has accepted them, then it follows as night follows day that there must be conceded the desirability of a commission of inquiry into this matter, and consequently that the motion of the hon. member for Yeoville should be accepted.</p>

<p>The Government is requested in terms of this motion to consider the advisability of appointing a commission of inquiry and it is my humble opinion, after having heard the hon. member for Yeoville, his seconder, and the other two speakers on his side putting their case, that no grounds exist for the appointment of such a commission. I want to put a few questions to the hon. member for Yeoville in regard to the information which he gave us here. He quoted from the Report of the Commissioner of Police for 1960 to show that about 150,000 persons were charged with acts of violence, assaults, rape, attempted robbery and so forth.</p>

<p>According to the Report issued by the committee in England the cost of the scheme there was based on far fewer offences than those committed in the Republic. Based on the crimes committed in 1959 the amount would have been &#x00A3;334,000, and this did not include Scotland. They stated further that if it was accepted that 10 per cent of crimes were committed in Scotland, the costs would have been &#x00A3;110,000 and &#x00A3;367,000 respectively, a total of nearly &#x00A3;500.000. So much with regard to England. It has been suggested here that a person who is entitled to compensation should receive an average amount of &#x00A3;60 or R120. The hon. member for Yeoville agreed that <span class="col_2871-2872" refersTo="page_1450"/>there were about 150,000 convictions in the Republic in 1960. If we assume that for every person who was convicted there was at least one person who was assaulted or who suffered harm and we work on the basis of &#x00A3;60, it would have cost the State an amount in excess of R14,000,000 or &#x00A3;7,000,000 in direct disbursements to such persons. This is what it would cost if the scheme advocated by the hon. member for Yeoville was instituted in the Republic. But what the hon. member forgets is that an administrative office will also have to be brought into being to deal with such claims. In his introductory speech he said that offices would have to be established in all the main centres in the country, because where could a man lodge a claim if there was no office; would he have to go to the larger cities and incur extra expense? The hon. member was correct in saying that there would have to be an office of this nature in every town of any importance. This would necessitate the establishment of an additional Department in the Public Service. When one considers the administrative expenses, salaries and so forth, one realizes that the scheme advocated by the hon. member would cost us millions and millions of rand.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker, but the National Party will have no objection provided the Native pays the same premium as the White man; then he can receive the same compensation. It is based on a premium. If he insures his life with an insurance company, he pays the same premium as the White man and he receives the same insurance cover that the White man does.</p>

<p>So much with regard to the question of costs. But the motion of the hon. member for Yeoville was also discussed in the House of Lords in England in December of last year and after the pros and cons had been heard, the motion was withdrawn by the mover. He realized that there were many objections to it. I want to say that in connection with the Justice Report, Lord Rancroft had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">They underestimated the administrative difficulties and costs of producing this scheme.</block>

<p>This was one of the main reasons why the motion was withdrawn in the House of Lords. I am convinced that the hon. member for Yeoville did not consider this motion carefully before he moved it.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) who mentioned various cases which he used as examples to show why this scheme should be instituted. For example, he said that provision was made in the Children&#x2019;s Act and in the Stock Theft Act for certain amounts to be paid, but it is not the State which pays those amounts. They are paid by private individuals. The State helps the complainants to collect the amount just as the State helps in a civil case where judgment has been obtained to execute the judgment. Property is sold by the State, by the messenger of the court or the sheriff, and the State is the agent. But the State itself does not pay a penny.</p>

<p>Reference was also made to third party insurance, but third party insurance is a form of insurance. The Government enacted the law and compelled the individual to take out motor vehicle insurance. If hon. members on the Opposition side are prepared to do so, we may perhaps be able to pass a law to compel every individual to insure himself against <span class="col_2873-2874" refersTo="page_1451"/>assault or crimes falling under this motion, but it is not the duty of the State to pay compensation to every person who is injured. In connection with third party expenditure, I just want to say&#x2014;and this supports my argument &#x2014;that third party claims rose from R4,000,000 in 1957 to R12.000,000 in 1961. In this case too the claims will continue to increase. The hon. member for Durban (Central) said that the State was not concerned about the victim and that the victim had to incur expense in lodging a claim if he wanted compensation. That is quite true, but in this case will a similar procedure not also have to be followed when a victim wants to claim compensation if the State makes the disbursements? It has already been indicated here that there must be a difference. The hon. member for Durban (Central) asked the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. Muller) whether he would be satisfied to receive a small amount of compensation if he lost a leg. This indicates that the intention is to pay out considerable amounts in connection with losses suffered by people. The case would have to be proved. A <i>quasi-court</i> would have to be brought into being at every place where a person can lodge a claim and this <i>quasi-court</i> would have to hear all the cases. Evidence would have to be adduced to prove the injuries suffered, to prove the degree of pain and suffering, just as is the case in an ordinary court to-day. How otherwise could such a council or court reach a decision regarding the amount to be paid to a victim? This would also lead to additional expense. Take the hon. member for Durban (Central) who made an earnest plea here. In his day he was a doctor and if he had to give professional evidence before such a council in connection with injuries suffered by a person, he would probably charge a good fee which would also increase expenses. He would not be so charitable as to do it for nothing. That is why I say that if one takes the picture as a whole, one realizes that a scheme such as this would cost millions of rand. Who would have to pay this money? It would be the taxpayer. I predict that if the scheme did materialize more money would have to be made available on the Estimates for this purpose and it would cost us considerably more than the R42,000,000 which is now being paid out to pensioners by the Department of Pensions.</p>

<p>In Section 389 of the Criminal Procedure Act, No. 56 of 1955, provision is made whereby a person can claim compensation from a person who assaults him, because that section reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Neither a conviction nor an acquittal following on any prosecution for any offence shall be a bar to a civil action for damages at the instance of any person who has suffered any injury in consequence of the commission of that offence.</block>

<p>We had an example in the Cape Supreme Court in 1938 where compensation was paid to the widow of a person who had been murdered, and in that case the person accused of murdering this woman&#x2019;s husband was found not guilty of murder. Notwithstanding this fact, she sued him for damages after he had been discharged by the court, and compensation was paid to her. This principle was also laid down in the case of Union Government v. Lee in the Appeal Court in 1927 and our Roman-Dutch Law is also based on it. There it was stated. [Translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the Roman-Dutch Law the principle is that a widow does not step into her husband&#x2019;s shoes, but that she has an independent right to seek redress on her own behalf and can claim damages where she has suffered injury as the result of her husband&#x2019;s death, or as a result of the fact that because of an accident he can no longer care for his wife or his children, or whatever the case may be.</block>

<p>They have a right to claim compensation. The argument of those who are in favour of the motion is: &#x201C;Yes, but if a person owns nothing, then the State has to pay.&#x201D; I cannot see why the State should have to pay in such a case. We can go further then and say that the State should also pay if I do business with a person and I suffer a loss as a result of that transaction. Should the State also pay in such cases? I think for example of hire-purchase agreements in respect of fixed property, where we so often find that after a man has paid instalments for five or six years, the seller goes bankrupt, and because the property rights are still vested in the seller, the trustee in the insolvent estate takes the property back and all the instalments which have already been paid to the seller are forfeited; the buyer only has the right to an ordinary claim against the estate of the insolvent seller. In such a case we will also have to make provision for such a person to be paid out because in most cases these are persons who cannot afford to buy property for cash or through the medium of a building society and to have the property registered in their names immediately. A man may lose all his savings in this way. He and his wife and children suffer more than in the case of a person who is injured in a crime of violence. I really feel that this is a case which this House certainly cannot deal with. The hon. member for Yeoville also mentioned various crimes and he said that certain types of crimes would have to be defined by the commission as being crimes falling under this law. In my opinion it is impossible to make a distinction in this regard. Hon. members here mentioned the case of fraud. At the present moment there is a case before the court in which an amount of R2,000,000 is involved. There are many persons who lose in such cases. Should the State not make provision for this type of person as well?</p>

<p><span class="col_2875-2876" refersTo="page_1452"/>At 3.55 p.m. the business under consideration was interrupted by Mr. Speaker in accordance with Standing Order No. 41 (3) and the debate was adjourned.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. L. H. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>When there is a motion dealing with minimum wages before this House it certainly deserves the serious attention of everyone of us, even if it is because of no other than purely humane and altruistic considerations, that is to say to ensure that every worker and his family, White or Black, can live a life worthy of a human being. That is an ideal which every civilized government in every civilized country probably strives for. It is certainly an ideal which we in the Republic of South Africa also strive for. But the problem really lies in determining what is &#x201C;worthy of a human being That differs from time to time, from place to place and from race to race. What was regarded as a luxury article by the one generation is regarded as a necessity of life by the next generation. Think of the possession of a telephone, a frigidaire, a radio and even a motor car. Previously all these articles were classified as luxury articles; to-day people desire most of those articles; they are as necessary as your daily bread. I also said that it differed from race to race. It is all a question of the standard of civilization which the race has reached and to which it has become accustomed. In any case these are all considerations which the Government has to take into account when it considers a motion dealing with minimum wages and when it has to determine what is meant by &#x201C;worthy of a human being ". But there are also other considerations which the Government has to take into account. Those are the more practical considerations as, for example, the carrying capacity of the country&#x2019;s economy. It would, for example, be stupid to introduce national minimum wages which will result in disrupting the economy of our country, of forcing factories to close thereby creating large-scale unemployment. Such a national minimum wage scale would indeed be a national catastrophe. Nevertheless it remains the objective of this Government to keep our economy at the highest level possible so as to ensure that the basic needs of the workers and their families are met. The Government is doing everything in its power to stimulate our economy and to keep it virile. Nobody less than our highly esteemed Prime Minister gives his personal attention to this matter by means of his Economic Advisory Council and the Minister of Economic Affairs gives his personal attention to it by ensuring that our economy is maintained at the highest possible level by seeking export markets, for example, for our products. Think of the missions which are sent overseas timeously to look for export markets for our products. All these things are done to keep the wheels of our production machine in motion thereby providing employment for our workers. Under the guidance of our hon. Minister of Labour and his energetic Deputy, the Department of Labour is continually aiming at providing work for all those in the Republic who want to work, and it does so very successfully. In terms of world standards we have full employment in South Africa to-day. Our unemployment figure is only .7 per cent whereas 2 per cent is regarded throughout the world as full employment. The entire labour machinery is put into action every day with the object of providing employment at decent wages, wages worthy of a human being; think of the employment sections; think of the industrial councils which act as arbiters between employers and employees in respect of wages and conditions of employment. Think of the Wage Board which lays down minimum wages for unskilled and unorganized labour in relation to its productivity and within the limits of the carrying and paying capacity of the industry. Think of the Central Bantu Council which has already done such a great deal to improve the wages of Bantu workers. No industrial agreement which affects the Bantu worker is approved by the Minister of Labour unless it has been previously submitted to this Council for its approval. All these measures have so far had a favourable effect in South Africa. That is best proved by the fact that we enjoy industrial peace and quiet in South Africa to-day. That is the final and underlying test. But having said that, we do not maintain that we have reached the stage of perfection. Wages can, of course, always still be increased. Socio-economic conditions can always still be improved. We never achieve the highest ideal. As Robert Louis Stevenson put it in his essay &#x201C;Eldorado &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Happily we all shoot to the moon with ineffectual arrows:</block>

<block name="quote">Our hopes are based on inaccessible Eldorado.</block>

<p>But in the same essay he comes to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive and the true success is to labour.</block>

<p>All of us must also labour. The entire burden cannot simply be placed on the shoulders of <span class="col_2877-2878" refersTo="page_1453"/>the Government or on the shoulders of the Department of Labour, as hon. members opposite and also the hon. member for Houghton want to do. It is surprising that people who continually object strenuously to any form of State interference, actually come and plead for State interference in this case, people who often lead you to think that they are disciples of the anarchist William Godwin who stated his attitude as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Government, even in its best form is an evil.</block>

<p>It surprises you, Sir, that people such as those come and plead here for State interference. It is really a pleasant surprise. It seems to us that the hon. member for Houghton is beginning to see the light of day. If she continues along those lines she will soon be sitting on this side! But it is of course a clever tactic in order to place the whole burden of improved wages and conditions of employment on the Government. The point is, however, that everyone in the Republic must co-operate in order to bring this improvement about. Industries can make the first big contribution in this connection. Nobody and nothing prevent them from paying more than the minimum wages laid down. The hon. member for Houghton may say that there is indeed something which prevents them from doing so, namely, the economic laws and the laws of competition. But there is a stronger economic law which ought to encourage the industrialist to pay higher wages and to improve working conditions and that is the law of self-preservation. Wise employers throughout the capitalistic world have long since realized that by rationalizing the capitalistic system, by introducing reforms of this nature, they create the only alternative to Socialism and Communism, because they are the people who are most likely to suffer if Socialism and Communism were to take hold of a country. It is in the interests of the industrialist, therefore, in the interests of the maintenance of the capitalistic system, that they should effect these reforms, because they run the risk of suffering most if the two other systems should be introduced. I say that the employers and industry themselves can make the greatest positive contribution to avert this danger.</p>

<p>I also maintain that the Bantu himself can make an important contribution towards combating poverty and under-feeding. As could be seen throughout this entire debate the hon. member for Hougton only thought in terms of minimum wages for the Bantu because she hardly said a word about minimum wages to the Whites. I repeat that the Bantu himself can in the first place make an important contribution towards the combating of poverty and under-feeding. This brings me to a point which I touched upon two weeks ago when the time allotted to the debate had run out. I referred to the large-scale, unplanned, irresponsible, reckless extra-marital procreation among the Bantu, particularly in the cities and I said that that was one of the main causes of poverty and under-feeding and that it was not merely a question of insufficient wages, as the hon member for Houghton tried to make us believe. It is nothing unusual in the big cities to see a Bantu woman carrying two children at the same time, the one on her back and the other still to be born in the front with one on each hand and in many cases those four children are the children of four different fathers. I hope you will allow me. Sir. to give certain statistics to illustrate this tragic tendency which is evident in our country to-day. I found the following report in the <i>Transvaler</i> of 2 March 1963 in regard to Pretoria under the heading " Decline in the Birth Rate &#x201D;. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The birth rate in respect of all races in Pretoria, except in respect of the Bantu, shows a declining tendency. In the case of the Bantu there is a considerable increase in the birth rate. In his latest report the City&#x2019;s chief medical officer says that the birth rate in respect of Whites is 25.45 as against 26.43 for the previous year. In the case of Asiatics and Coloureds there has been a greater decrease. In the case of the Bantu, however, the birth rate has risen to 38.54 whereas it was 33.43 the previous year.</block>

<p>Now I come to the most important part&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the case of all races there has been an increase in the number of extra-marital births. In the case of the Whites 1.32 per cent of the children born are illegitimate but in the case of the Bantu the figure is 41.8 per cent.</block>

<p>That incidentally brings me to something else. They also refer to the mortality figure in the case of children in this report. The hon. member for Houghton, of course, always accuses us and says that the State grants very little assistance to the Bantu but I wish to draw attention to an important phenomenon and that is that the mortality figure in the case of children has declined considerably over the past 30 years. I quote Whereas the mortality figure in the case of White children stood at 68.44 in 1933, it has dropped to 26.08. In 1933 the mortality figure in the case of Bantu children was 742.42 but to-day it is 112.42.&#x201D; That is what the Whites have done for the children of the non-Whites. In another debate the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter) pointed out that as far as Durban was concerned approximately 60 per cent of the Bantu children born were illegitimate. I want to go further and say that although this tragedy is mainly confined to the cities, it is nevertheless not exclusively confined to the cities. Even in the Bantu areas there is concern to-day. Under the heading <span class="col_2879-2880" refersTo="page_1454"/> &#x201C;Bantu Authorities want to force fathers of illegitimate children to pay&#x201D; the <i>Transvaler</i> of 27 October says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the Ciskeian Authorities have their way, all Bantu who are responsible for illegitimate children in the Bantu areas will in future be obliged to compensate the unmarried mothers and their relatives preferably by going to work in the mines.</block>

<p>One tribal chief said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is Bantu custom that people should pay for their deeds. Many people no longer own any stock. The only way in which compensation can be obtained is to send them to places where they can work. The people are worried about this new tendency amongst the Bantu.</block>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. member not think that the disruption of family life which is caused by temporary labour has a great deal to do with the increase in the number of extra-marital births?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. L. H. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. To try to suggest, therefore, that under-feeding amongst the Bantu is &#x201C;a national scandal&#x201D; as the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> put it, and as confirmed by the hon. member for Houghton, that it is merely a question of insufficient wages, is an oversimplification of a very complicated problem. It is a problem which must be very throughly investigated. If there is any question of a &#x201C;national scandal&#x201D; then it is most certainly this irresponsible and reckless way in which Bantu bring illegitimate children into the world. In order to combat this problem of under-feeding and of poverty, it is necessary for the Bantu first of all to act more responsibly in this matter and to exercise greater self-control. To want to place the entire burden on the shoulders of the Government and to want to compel it in turn to force employers to pay sufficiently high wages to feed the thousands of illegitimate children, is to expect the Government to subsidize prostitution and to place a premium on immorality. That is why I say that the Bantu can in the first place make the first great contribution towards the fight against this problem of poverty and under-feeding by exercising a little more self-control and acting with greater responsibility in these matters.</p>

<p>While we are talking about contributions which can be made, I wish to say that every White housewife in South Africa who has a Bantu woman in her service can also make a very important contribution in this respect, and this also applies to the old women of the Black Sash and of the National Council of Women. They can all assist in this upliftment work and they should rather concentrate their activities on educating the Bantu women in their service. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Houghton says they are doing that but she must admit that so far they have not done so very successfully. Those who have made a study of this know that the urbanization of the Bantu is the main cause of this tragedy and of the evil of poverty and under-feeding that goes with it. That is my reply to the question of the hon. member for Houghton. The hon. Opposition can also make an important contribution by supporting the Government when it introduces measures to prevent and to combat the urbanization of the Bantu. I think in the first place of the influx control measures which are aimed at stopping the influx of Bantu to the cities. In this connection I just want to point out that in terms of the residential qualifications laid down a Bantu has to work for ten years with the same employer in order to be allowed to live in the city and in this way migratory labour is discouraged. In this way Bantu are encouraged to remain with one employer. When a Bantu has been in the employ of one employer for ten years or when he has worked for 15 years with different employers he qualifies for residence. That will result in an increase in his productive capacity. I say the Opposition must support us if they are really serious in wanting to solve this problem. Secondly I think of the border industries which will mean that the Bantu will be able to earn his bread at his doorstep without disrupting his family life; he will be assured of a wage worthy of a human being and the lights of the cities will continue to become less attractive to him. Thirdly, I wish to mention the city councils and the contribution they can make by ensuring that the industries in their White areas are kept White as far as possible by ensuring that the correct ratio between White and non-White staff in factories is maintained.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the Opposition asks in their amendment, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Government itself should set the example by paying its employees decent wages. I just want to point out that the wages of the railwaymen and of the postmen were recently increased and the Government is continually keeping a watchful eye on this matter and seeing to it that people are paid a wage on which they can make a living worthy of a human being. That is why I support the amendment of the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) and I trust that our friends opposite will agree with us that that is the right policy and that the Government is on the right road.</p>
