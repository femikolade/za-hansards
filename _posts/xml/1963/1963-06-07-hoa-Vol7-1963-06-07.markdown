<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>In terms of the provisions of the existing Constitution the remuneration of a member of the Executive Committee, if he is also a member of the Provincial Council, consists of allowances laid down by the State President in respect of Provincial Councillors in terms of Section 74 of the Constitution and, secondly, of an amount laid down by the Provincial Council itself with the approval of the State President in terms of Section 76 (3) of the Constitution. The advantage of these provisions is that a member of the Executive Committee, who is not a member of the Provincial Council only receives the additional remuneration due to a member of the Executive Council and not the allowance due to a member of the Provincial Council although there are also a few disadvantages attached to this system. The first is its rigidity with the result that it cannot be adapted to the developments which have taken place since 1910. The second is that it is not always possible to control the total amount of the remuneration of an M.E.C. and the third is that any proposed increase in the remuneration of a member of the <span class="col_7447_7448" refersTo="page_1056"/>Executive Committee is immediately affected when members of the Provincial Council get an increase in terms of Section 76 (3). These are the main reasons why the Government feels that the existing position should be changed. The existing position is briefly that the State President is obliged, in terms of Section 74. to treat all members of all the Provincial Councils on an equal basis. They must all receive the same allowance. But because a Provincial Council determines the remuneration of the members of that province&#x2019;s Executive Committee alone, it follows of necessity that the remuneration paid to the members of the various Executive Committees differs, although members of the same Executive Committee must receive the same remuneration because there is absolutely no provision for it that a difference can be made between members of the same Executive Committee.</p>

<p>For a considerable time since 1910 the existing system has worked exceedingly well but due to the tremendous development which has taken place in the Transvaal it has gradually become essential for the members of the Executive Committee of that province to devote more and more attention to their duties until in the early &#x2019;fifties most of them, if not all of them, were obliged to devote all their attention to those duties as against the members of the Executive Committees in the other provinces who have always, and still are, only devoting their attention on a part-time basis to their duties. The time which members of the Executive Committee devote to their duties in the other provinces also differs from province to province and even from one member of the Executive Committee to the other in the same province. Where a member of the Executive Committee is obliged to devote more and more time to his official duties it follows of necessity that his private business suffers. From the nature of things it is practically impossible for a member of the Executive Committee in the Transvaal to devote any attention to anything else but his official duties. Although the members of the Executive Committees in other provinces do not devote all their attention to their official duties, their official duties have increased to such an extent in some cases that they have to neglect their personal affairs. This state of affairs is exclusively due to the tremendous development which has taken place in the Republic during the last decade. All the indications are there that there will be even greater development in future and this increasing development is going to cause an increase in the official duties of members of Executive Committees throughout the Republic with the possibility that some members of the same Executive Committee will be occupied part-time, and others fulltime, with their official duties. Apart from this state of affairs, the possibility always exists that a Provincial Council, as has already happened in the past, may appoint a member to its Executive Committee who is not also a member of the Provincial Council. In such a case it cannot be expected that that member of the Executive Committee must receive the same remuneration as a member of the Executive Committee who is also a member of the Provincial Council, because the Provincial Council duties of the latter justify a higher remuneration.</p>

<p>For these reasons, therefore, it is proposed to amend the Constitution so as to make it possible, in the first instance, for different amounts to be laid down as remuneration for members of the same Executive Committee apart from the existing power to lay down various amounts as remuneration for the various Executive Committees.</p>

<p>The second defect in the present system to which I have referred is that it is difficult to control the total remuneration received by a member of the Executive Committee. When determining the remuneration of a member of the Executive Committee in terms of Section 76 (3) the position of the members of an Executive Committee as a whole is taken into account because it is not always possible to say when an M.E.C. is solely occupied with M.E.C. duties or with M.P.C. duties. The difficulty in this connection is that when the total amount of remuneration of an M.E.C. is calculated, that total remuneration can quite easily become disproportionate by a change in the allowance of an M.P.C. At the present moment the Government is still considering a report of a committee which sat under the chairmanship of Dr. Holloway to determine to what extent the allowances of members of the Provincial Councils should be increased. If the position remains as it is to-day. an M.E.C. receives a certain amount but every time his allowance as a member of the Provincial Council is increased his remuneration increases accordingly.</p>

<p>We think the position of the M.E.C. is analogous to that of a Minister and the only solution is apparently to introduce the same principle of an all-embracing allowance in respect of an M.E.C. as exists in the case of Ministers and as suggested in this Bill. As hon. members know, a Minister does not receive an allowance as Minister and also as a member of the House of Assembly or of the Senate, but he receives an all-embracing allowance.</p>

<p>The third defect to which I have referred is the fact that any increase in the remuneration of an M.E.C. in terms of Section 76 (3) has to be submitted to a Provincial Council by an M.E.C. The only person who may suggest an increase in the allowance of M.E.C.s is of course a member of the M.E.C. itself and that places these people in an awkward position. That is why it is suggested that the State President also be empowered to determine the allowance of an M.E.C. just as he has the power to-day to determine the allowance of an M.P.C. without the co-operation of the Provincial Councils. I want to state clearly that the allowances of M.P.C.S are laid down by the State President without consulting the Provincial Councils.</p>

<p><span class="col_7449_7450" refersTo="page_1057"/>To sum up, therefore, the position is that it is suggested in this Bill that the State President be empowered to lay down an all-embracing allowance for M.E.C.s which may vary from province to province and which may also vary in respect of the individual members of the same Executive Committee. The position may arise where a province would like to have two full-time members of the Executive Committee and two part-time members because the work does not justify four full-time members.</p>

<p>If this Bill is approved by Parliament it will, as soon as the various all-embracing allowances have been determined, come into operation on a date laid down by the State President by proclamation in order to ensure that in the meantime M.E.C.s do not lose that portion of their present remuneration which they receive as members of the Provincial Council.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House do not object to the principle of the State President fixing the remuneration of members of the Executive Committee, but we do object to discrimination. The Minister has mentioned the reasons for the proposals to discriminate between members of the Executive Committee in the different provinces and also between members of the Executive Committee in the same province where some may be full-time and some part-time. He has also dealt with the question of members of the Executive Committee who may not be members of the Provincial Council. At this stage I do not think it is desirable, although it may have been done in the past on one or two occasions, to have members of the Executive Committee who are not members of the Provincial Council any more than I think it is desirable that we should have Cabinet Ministers who are not Members of Parliament. I think the whole of our democratic system is based on the principle that people who hold office in Parliament should go before the electorate and be elected as Members of Parliament before they become Cabinet Ministers. I do not think anyone would quarrel with that proposition. Similarly I think it is desirable that members of the Executive Committee should be men who are prepared to face the hustings before they become Provincial Councillors, and then they can be elected by the M.P.C.s as members of the Executive Committee. If we are going to discriminate between M.E.C.s as far as their allowances are concerned, I think it is the thin end of a wedge which the present Cabinet would like to be used in its own case. If we are going to have discrimination between one member of the Executive Committee and another, are we going to have discrimination in Parliament between one Minister and another? If that is the position, we could suggest a few names which might be put on the discrimination list. There are some members of the Cabinet who work a good deal harder than others and there are some who seem to do very little indeed; the members of their staff seem to do all the work. If the amount of work performed by Cabinet Ministers is to be the criterion for fixing their salaries, then I am afraid some Ministers would have to shed a considerable proportion of their salaries. I do not think that there should be discrimination between one Executive Committee member and another. In commerce and industry you do not find discrimination between the members of a board unless in some cases they are employed full-time, but even in companies the extra amount is treated as a salary as distinct from directors&#x2019; fees. In commerce and industry members of the board carry an equal responsibility. In the Cabinet I do not think there should be discrimination between one Cabinet Minister and another, except for the Prime Minister. We accept that the Prime Minister should receive a higher remuneration, not only because he carries a higher responsibility but also because he has to cover up for some of his Ministers and take the responsibility for the actions of the whole of his Cabinet. I do think that in the case of M.P.C.s it is desirable that there should be no discrimination as between one member and another. If their duties are such that some have to work full-time and others part-time, I think there should be a dispersal of duties. The Cape has managed to arrange its affairs in such a way that there is a dispersal of the duties of M.E.C.s In the Transvaal membership of the Executive Committee has been made a full-time job. In the Free State and in Natal they have arranged their affairs in such a manner that the duties are divided equally as far as possible between the members of the Executive Committee. If the Minister feels that the present members of Executive Committees cannot carry out their duties, then it may be necessary to increase the number of Executive Committee members in certain provinces, just as this Government since coming into power has found it necessary to increase the number of portfolios. But when we come to the provinces, I think it is most undersirable to say that a member of the Executive Committee in the Transvaal is worth more than a member of the Executive Committee in Natal or the Free State. Each Executive Committee member has his specific responsibilities. Sir, there are some men who have the facility to delegate work. There are some men who think that the only way in which they can show that they are doing the job is to work all day long and show how busy they are. Those men generally are not the most efficient. The most efficient people, quite often, are those who are able to delegate their duties, who are able to choose the people to whom certain duties can be entrusted and then see to it that they get results from time to time. It is very easy for a member of the Executive Committee to clutter himself up with all sorts of duties in order to convince people that he is busy. I am quite sure that the most efficient members of the present Cabinet are those who are able to delegate certain duties. I do not want to mention names across the floor of the House&#x2014;this is not the time or the place to do it&#x2014;but we see and the public sees that there are certain people who have the facility <span class="col_7451_7452" refersTo="page_1058"/>to administer their particular portfolios in such a way that they only do the work which requires ministerial attention. They delegate the detailed work to officials and they are careful in choosing those officials. They know to which officials responsible work can be allocated. The same demands are made on members of the Executive Committee. They should know to whom they can delegate work; they should know which officials they can trust, and if the responsible officials are incapable of carrying out the work, they should be relieved of their duties and other officials appointed in their place. I think the position is not solved by simply raising salaries and ensuring that the men work full-time. Sir, while the Minister has endeavoured to make out a case for this Bill, I am afraid we are unconvinced. We feel that not only should there be no discrimination between one M.E.C. and another, but there should be no discrimination between one province and another. I am sure that in my own province, Natal, the work devolving upon M.E.C.s, having regard to the ratio of the races, involves just as much responsibility as the work of some of the M.E.C.s in other provinces. I am quite sure that the Minister of Labour will be the first to agree that the members of the Natal Executive Committee carry out their work efficiently and that they know how to delegate their duties. I am sure the Minister will find that the new Administrator of Natal would be the first to agree that he has had the utmost co-operation from his Executive. They work well as a team and they have arranged their duties so that as far as possible the load is evenly distributed. I think what is necessary is that the Minister should go back to the Executive Committees and ask them whether it is not possible to distribute their duties in such a way that the load falls evenly upon all members. He should also ask them to examine their duties to see to what extent they are doing work which should be done by officials, and to what extent they can relieve themselves of work presently being done by them by delegating that work to officials. It may be necessary to employ more officials, highly qualified officials, to do this work. I think if we are going to have the democratic system in operation in our Provincial Councils we must have Provincial Councillors who are elected by the people. They themselves must elect the members of the Executive Committee, and as far as possible members of the Executive Committee should deal with policy matters and not detail. If they delegate to officials matters which require detailed investigation, we are going to get a more efficient administration. This position cannot be solved simply by raising salaries, and while there may be a general case for increasing the salaries of M.P.C.s, I think the Minister&#x2019;s proposal to discriminate both as between provinces and within the provinces, is one which we cannot support, and we want to indicate to the Minister at this stage that we propose to vote against the second reading of the Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Fortunately I can speak of five years&#x2019; experience on an Executive Committee; I therefore know what I am talking about. I think the allegation by the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell), that there will be discrimination, is a bit far-fetched. The position is as follows; The members of the Executive Committee of the Transvaal are full-time members. Those M.E.C.s fall under the same regulations as Ministers; their position is the same. They receive salaries on the basis of full-time work on the condition that they do not occupy any other position. They had to give up all their private interests. Some members of the Transvaal Executive Committee had very large financial interests which they had to relinquish just like that with the result that they suffered financial losses. If Natal or the Orange Free State, for example, were to decide that their work justifies a full-time M.E.C. the idea is not that he should receive less than the M.E.C.s of the Transvaal. They will receive exactly the same salary. The State President will lay down the salaries of full-time M.E.C.s. As a matter of fact, the Provincial Administrations have already been informed that the allowances which the Transvaal M.E.C.s receive will be regarded as the allowance which will also be paid to any other M.E.C. in any other province who works full-time. There is no discrimination, therefore, between the various provinces. But when a province sees its way clear to manage with part-time M.E.C.s those members are at liberty to do other work as well. They can, for example, continue to practise as attorneys or to farm or to remain in business. I know of an M.E.C. in the Cape Province, for example, who is an official of some big company; he can retain his position. If he is a part-time M.E.C. he is at liberty to earn an additional income. If a province chooses to have part-time M.E.C.s only the remuneration will be laid down by the State President, whether he be a part-time M.E.C. in the Transvaal, Natal, Cape Province or the Free State; no differentiation will be made between the various provinces. In the Cape Province the Executive Committee members meet at certain set times and when the Executive Committee is not in session the Administrator has to do all the work. When the Executive Committee is in session, however, the various members are responsible for their particular sections. The Administrator of the Cape Province has informed me that he does not think the work of the Cape Province is such that it justifies four full-time Executive Committee members. As a matter of fact he told me that some of his best men on the Executive Committee whose services he would not like to lose did not see their way clear to give up their other work in order to become full-time members of the Executive Committee. The Provincial Council of the Cape feel that it would greatly assist the Administrator if they gave him two full-time M.E.C.s and two part-time members. The salaries paid in other provinces to full-time M.E.C.s will also be paid <span class="col_7453_7454" refersTo="page_1059"/>to full-time members here, and the same applies to part-time members. There is no question of discrimination. We are not saying, for example, that because Natal is a smaller province its members must receive less. I am aware of the fact that the members of the Natal Executive Committee work very hard and I am aware of it that the members of the Orange Free State work very hard. Three possibilities will exist under the machinery which is being created here. All the members can be full-time members; all the members can be part-time; and some members can be fulltime and others part-time. We are not going to discriminate between the various provinces because of the fact that full-time members in the one province have perhaps to work harder than the full-time members in another province. That also applies in the case of part-time members. I feel, therefore, that hon. members opposite should rather welcome this Bill than oppose it. I really do not know why they are opposing it. For the reasons mentioned by me I think it is a great improvement.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made the point that all members of the Executive Committee must be members of the Provincial Council. I think the hon. member has lost sight of the fact that Provincial Administrations are not quite the same as the House of Assembly. If Provincial Councils have gone off the rails since 1910 by concerning themselves too much with politics the Constitution cannot be blamed for that but they themselves are to blame. They are in reality provincial administrations and if some members in the Provincial Council feel that there is nobody within their own ranks who is sufficiently capable to become a member of the Executive Committee they choose somebody, through the Provincial Council, who is not an M.P.C. It happened in the earlier days that people who were not members of the Provincial Council were appointed as M.E.C.s but I do not know of anybody who has lately been appointed to the Executive Committee outside the Provincial Council.</p>

<p>My colleague informs me that there was a case three years ago in Natal where it was considered desirable to appoint somebody to the Executive Committee who was not a member of the Provincial Council. We are not effecting a change here because it is allowed under the existing Constitution. I think it will happen more and more rarely that an outsider will be chosen as a member of the Executive Committee because I think that is really a reflection on the members of the Provincial Council themselves if they cannot appoint somebody from within their own ranks. But if the members feel that a certain person will be a very good administrator and that they ought to appoint him why should we prevent that because that person is not a member of the Provincial Council? It is not a highly political body. The hon. member must also remember that the members of the Executive Committee do not have to account to their voters as members of the Executive Committee. They have to account to their voters as members of the Provincial Council. But when they are chosen as members of the Executive Committee they form the Executive Committee together with the Administrator. What happens here cannot happen in the Provincial Council, namely, that a member of the Executive Committee must account to the Provincial Council for his actions. I feel, therefore, that the hon. member went somewhat far with his objection. This is a healthy kind of discrimination; it makes it possible to treat those people on a very reasonable and honest and equal basis.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask for the privilege of the half-hour? There are various matters which my colleagues and I would like to discuss with the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs. A deputation of important Coloured people, including important Coloured trade unionists, have asked my colleagues and myself to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the lack of co-ordination which exists between the Coloured Affairs Department and other Governmental Departments in relation to matters concerning the Coloured people. They are greatly concerned about the fact that decisions are made by other Departments affecting the daily lives of the Coloured people about which the Coloured Affairs Department apparently knows very little. They have particularly drawn our attention to the fact that decisions have been made from time to time by the Department of the Interior and also by the Department of Labour where the Coloured Affairs Department was apparently completely left in the dark. These decisions have affected our Coloured citizens tremendously. In the cases which have been pointed out to me it would appear that the Coloured Affairs Department was not even consulted. Mr. Chairman, this is most disappointing. After all the Coloured Affairs Department exists under a separate Minister and has been established with the idea of attending to all matters affecting the interests of the Coloured community of this country. I suggest, therefore, that it should be an established practice that Governmental Departments should not make any decisions affecting the Coloured people without first consulting the Coloured Affairs Departments and without allowing the Coloured Affairs Department, as the mouthpiece of the Coloured people, to make the necessary representations.</p>

<p>I want to deal particularly with an unfortunate decision that was made quite recently by the Department of Labour which affects our Coloured people. I have no desire to discuss the question of job reservation. A decision was made recently which affects many Coloured artisans in Cape Town and which I am certain would not have been made had the Coloured Affairs Department been advised of the fact that these deliberations were taking place and had that Department been given an opportunity of making its representations to the tribunal that had been established to consider that particular aspect. There are a number of Coloured artisans in Cape Town who are most adversely affected by a decision which has unfortunately been made and which I hope the hon. the Minister will try to have amended. In terms of a decision that has been made Coloured artisans are now restricted in certain trades to confine their work to the areas in which they were working at the time that this determination was made. I have no doubt that if the hon. the Minister will now make representations to the Minister of Labour these hardships which undoubtedly exist will be eliminated. In the course of a discussion in this House the attention of the hon. the Minister of Labour was only drawn to this aspect for the first time. I have no doubt that if the Minister of Coloured Affairs makes representations <span class="col_7457_7458" refersTo="page_1061"/>to the Department of Labour this unfortunate situation will be remedied.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is this that it should be an established practice between Governmental Departments that in relation to all matters concerning the Coloured people no decision of any importance should be made unless and until the Department of Coloured Affairs has had an opportunity of making representations. There should be co-ordination between the Departments and the Coloured Affairs Department. I should like the hon. the Minister to give us an assurance that he will see to it that wherever possible in future that co-ordination will exist.</p>

<p>I now want to pass on to some other matters affecting the interests of the Coloured people. In the near future the hon. the Minister, in his capacity as Minister of Coloured Affairs, will be taking over the control of Coloured schools in terms of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Education Act which Parliament passed this Session. The hon. the Minister has indicated inside and outside this House that under his Department the Coloured people can expect far better treatment than they have received hitherto under the provincial administrations of this country. I sincerely hope that that will be the case. I want to commend to the Minister to give the most careful consideration, under his policy of taking control of Coloured schools, to the re-introduction of the school feeding scheme for our Coloured children. I would ask the hon. the Minister to give that his most careful and earnest consideration as early as possible. The Minister will remember that the official school feeding scheme was abandoned by our authorities in 1958, since when the feeding of the underprivileged children became the responsibility of a voluntary organization. I would like at this stage, as briefly as possible, to pay the greatest possible credit to that organization for the wonderful work which they have performed in stepping into the breach in order to help these poor unfortunate and indigent children when the school feeding scheme was abandoned by the authorities. I think it is necessary for me to point out that the number of school children who are fed every day has increased from 8,100 in 1958 to over 74,000 this year, what is more important, Sir, of this number 63,836 are Coloured children. In the same period the number of schools has increased from 19 to 154. To the credit of this organization and to the citizens of Cape Town of all sections, who have responded wonderfully to the appeals that have been made to them from time to time, I should like to point out that no school application has been turned down and that no means test has been applied. At the cost of two-thirds of a cent per day each child receives a simple but nutritional basic meal consisting of a half a pint of hot thick broth with a slice of bread and peanut butter. This happens in the winter months. In the summer months this meal is varied by a jug of skimmed milk with bread and jam, if jam can be afforded. For many of these children this often is their only meal of the day. Since the scheme was started, Mr. Chairman, on this voluntary basis in 1958, over 2,000,000 loaves have been cut up, 127,000 lbs. of jam and peanut butter used and over 16,000,000 pints of milk and soup have been distributed. All this has been done on a voluntary basis by collecting the necessary funds from our citizens. From the figures I have mentioned it will be obvious to the hon. the Minister that the vast majority of all these facilities have been distributed amongst indigent Coloured children.</p>

<p>Medical officers have reported that school feeding, particularly among the Coloured children, has greatly improved their health and their well-being. Many were the occasions when Coloured children used to faint from hunger at school. This is very rare now. Doctors and principals have reported upon the greatly improved conditions which are a direct result of this midday meal. The position has been reached where this voluntary organization, which is approaching the fifth year of its existence, is obliged to close by reason of the fact that it is now running out of funds. Since its inception this organization has raised nearly R300,000 to carry on this very noble work. It has now reached the end of its available funds. Unless the public again respond to appeals, which can only tide the organization over temporarily, this vital and humanitarian work will have to be discontinued. I feel that this is a matter which must be tackled by the Coloured Affairs Department without any delay whatsoever. I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to give his most serious consideration to the reinstatement as soon as possible of some form of school feeding scheme under the control of his Department. It will be a policy, apart from the humanitarian considerations, which must pay dividends in eliminating disease and ill-health among a large section of our population. The fact that nearly 64,000 Coloured children are affected indicates the importance of this matter. The Government will appreciate that nearly every other civilized country in the world, including Russia, has some form of school feeding for its future citizens. Why South Africa abandoned this scheme in 1958 is beyond me. I do say this that our Coloured children of necessity require the help of the Government. This is one of the most pressing needs of the Coloured community at the present moment. I strongly commend this most earnestly to the hon. the Minister in the hope that he will be able to give us an assurance that as soon as his Department takes over the control of Coloured schools he will give the most earnest consideration to reinstating this school feeding scheme for these poor indigent Coloured children.</p>

<p>I now want to go on to another matter which is also of great importance to the Coloured community, particularly to the Coloured teachers. I have been asked by a body of Coloured teachers to raise this issue with the hon. the Minister in the hope that he will make a public declaration in reply to these representations which will eliminate the fear <span class="col_7459_7460" refersTo="page_1062"/>which exists in the minds of these people in regard to the matter I am now going to raise. Under the provisions of the Coloured Persons&#x2019; Education Act, Section 19, any teacher employed at any State school is obliged to place the whole of his time at the disposal of the school at which he is employed and shall not, without the permission of the Secretary for Coloured Affairs, perform any other remunerative work. Many Coloured teachers are considerably alarmed at this provision and feel that a strict compliance with that provision will seriously affect their livelihood. The hon. the Minister will appreciate this that in order to supplement their meagre earnings it has become necessary over the years for many Coloured teachers to engage themselves in other remunerative work after school hours. It is an absolute necessity, because without this additional remuneration they are not able to make ends meet. It must be borne in mind that there is a great difference between the remuneration received by White and Coloured teachers in this country. I do hope that under the new administration, the hon. the Minister will try to bridge that gap as soon as possible. For the present, at any rate, there is this difference in pay. The salaries which Coloured teachers are getting are in many instances wholly insufficient for their needs. It is vitally important to them to have some means of supplementing their income. I have been asked to raise this matter with the Minister in the hope that he will be prepared to say publicly that he will issue an instruction to the Secretary for Coloured Affairs to deal with the Coloured teachers in this regard in the most human manner possible. I would ask the hon. the Minister to state that it would be his policy to permit Coloured teachers to undertake other remunerative work provided such work in no way interferes with their employment as teachers. I do hope the Minister will try to allay their fears because this matter is very vital to them. In other words, Sir, if the other remunerative work undertaken by them does not interfere with their work as teachers they should not be denied the opportunity of earning this additional income. I do urge upon the Minister, in the course of his reply, to make an announcement which will allay their fears.</p>

<p>Another question that I have been asked to take up with the hon. the Minister under his Vote is the question of the possibility of Coloured teachers being banned from active participation in public affairs and in politics. Either in a declaration in this House or in a statement outside the hon. the Minister has indicated that it will be his policy to ban, I think that is the term used, Coloured teachers from active participation in politics. In this connection a large section of the teachers have expressed the hope that the hon. the Minister will not impose a complete ban upon Coloured teachers from taking part in the public affairs of this country. In approaching this matter, Sir, I want to say immediately that I am fully alive to the fact that there exists unfortunately among teachers a few extremists who lose no opportunity in attempting to encourage their colleagues towards adopting an extremely anti-Government attitude on every possible occasion. We know that they exist. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Chairman, these trouble-makers exist among all sections of our multi-racial community; they are not exclusive to the Coloured community or to the Coloured teachers. They can never be completely eliminated. On the other hand, the vast majority of Coloured teachers consist of moderate men and women who play an important role in their endeavours to uplift the standing of their people. The hon. the Minister will know from personal experience that there are many moderate leaders among the Coloured teachers who have played an important role in the affairs of their community. Why should these moderate Coloured people be silenced? Why should they be prevented from voicing their views and giving moderate leadership to their people? I think it would be a retrogressive step on the part of the Government to ban Coloured teachers holus bolus from taking an active part in public affairs. I know that White teachers as a body do not participate actively in politics but their case is totally different.</p>

<p>For this reason that the interests of the White teachers are taken care of by their own provincial councillors who represent them in the Provincial Administration. Unfortunately the Coloured teachers have no direct representation since they have been taken off the Common Roll. The only way in which they can voice their views is by voicing their views publicly or making representations direct to the Minister in the hope of improving their conditions.</p>

<p>What about their Provincial Councillors?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>They have lost the right of voting for their own Provincial Councillors. They only have a meagre representation there on the same basis as they have in this House. The additional factor must be borne in mind that under this new Act which we passed this Session Coloured education is now being taken away from the Provincial Administrations and vests in the Minister. In the case of the White teachers they have almost direct representation in the legislative bodies which control their affairs. This position does not obtain in the case of Coloured teachers. In their case they are obliged to voice their own grievances and in doing so they may at times introduce a political angle to their protests. I think the hon. the Minister should not impose a complete ban, but that he should be prepared to deal with each case on its merits. The Coloured teacher has played a very important part in exercising a restraining influence over the political life of the Coloured people. I feel it would be quite wrong that, because of <span class="col_7461_7462" refersTo="page_1063"/>a few extremists which do exist, every law-abiding Coloured teacher should have a complete ban placed upon his activities. I appeal to the Minister to make a public declaration of his policy in this connection which will remove the fears which exist in the minds of the Coloured teachers.</p>

<p>Another matter that I want to deal with is a matter which emanates from a speech made by the hon. the Minister himself. He gave an indication of something that was going to be introduced by way of legislation affecting the political rights of the Coloured people. This has aroused a great deal of interest among the Coloured people and their European friends. It would appear that on 13 May 1963 the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs, in the course of a public speech at Paarl, was reported to have stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was the intention of the Government to introduce legislation next year to put the political rights of the Coloured people on a sound footing.</block>

<p>As you can well imagine, Sir, this has caused a great deal of interest among Coloured leaders. They feel that at long last some proper attention is to be given to their political rights and that some amends are going to be made at long last for the manner in which their political rights were dealt with some few years ago. The very fact that the hon. the Minister used the phrase &#x201C;that next year the political rights of the Coloured people were going to be put on a sound footing&#x201D; quite clearly implies that the political rights presently enjoyed by the Coloured people are not on a sound footing.</p>

<p>Then I would like you to explain what the hon. the Minister meant. I would like you to explain what the ordinary meaning of what I have just read really is. I would like to ask the hon.

I think the Coloured people and this House are entitled to know what the hon. Minister has in mind in regard to the future political rights of the Coloured people. What are the Government&#x2019;s intentions to counter the appeals which have been made over these years now to put the Coloured people back on to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll? Obviously the Minister has got something in mind. The very fact that he made this public declaration indicates that some decision has been arrived at by the Cabinet in regard to the future political rights of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>In the course of the same speech, the hon. Minister went on to say that 80 per cent of the Coloured people were poor and backward and their leaders wanted to get away from their own people. Then he went on to add that all the Coloured people could show for more than a hundred years of equal political rights was that 80 per cent of the Coloured people were poor and backward. Mr. Chairman, the Coloured people, I suggest, are entitled to know how the Government intend remedying the position which the hon. Minister indicated in his speech, and particularly what the Minister and the Government have in mind with regard to their future political rights. Quite obviously he indicated twice in that speech the intention of the Government to introduce legislation next year to put the political rights of the Coloured people on a sound footing. We have been told by the hon. Minister himself. We appreciate the fact, that the Government has shown its intention to eradicate slums among the Coloured people, that it is the intention to establish a garden city for the Coloured people and that it is the intention to build thousands of houses for the Coloured people and so on. The Coloured people by and large are highly appreciative of what is being done for them in that connection. I think we all appreciate that in that tangible respect something is being done for them. In all fairness, however, it must be realized that as ordinary citizens of this country and as an important section of our community, they are entitled to get this attention from the Government in relation to the elimination of these slum conditions, etc., and the establishment of a garden city, better schooling facilities and so on. But the Government must not think that by merely eliminating slums, that can be regarded as a <i>quid pro quo</i> for depriving the Coloured people of their political rights. If the Government intends putting the political rights of the Coloured people on a sound footing the Coloured people are entitled to know how that is going to be done, and they are entitled to be told that what the Government is doing for them in other respects by way of eliminating slums, etc., is not to be taken as compensation for having deprived them of these political rights.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>I listened with appreciation the other evening when the hon. the Minister explained his and his Department&#x2019;s plan for the Coloured community. I must say that when I think of this. I can almost say, problem of the Minister&#x2019;s I have a great deal of sympathy with him because it is probably one of the most difficult problems with which we are faced to-day. The task which we have to tackle and try to put right is one which has been neglected and in that sense one realizes only too well what a difficult task the Minister and his Department have to carry out to-day.</p>

<p><span class="col_7463_7464" refersTo="page_1064"/>In expressing my appreciation to them I want to plead with this House, and through this House with the people outside, to show that spirit of co-operation which the Minister needs in order to fulfil such an important task in the proper way. It will cost much more than has so far been spent in this regard and the increased amount of over R5,000,000 which is provided for in these Estimates for the Coloureds is, I am convinced, only the beginning. It is not nearly enough and we as the taxpayers in the country will have to realize that if we want to do our duty and if we want to develop the Coloureds to the benefit and welfare of this country, we shall have to do a great deal more than that. When we consider the backlog which has built up over the years, nearly over a century, and we realize how essential it is that we should tackle the position and improve it, I think we cannot be otherwise than concerned, because when we think of what 1,500,000 people mean to us in South Africa to-day, with our background, we realize how important it is that these steps be taken. We were given a general picture of South Africa when the Foreign Affairs Vote was under discussion and I maintain that our objective today should be to develop every one of those people in such a way that he will be an asset to us and this country in future, so that when difficult days dawn for South Africa those 1,500,000 people will be a very important factor in the future welfare of our country and our nation as a whole. I do honestly and sincerely believe that those people are at our disposal and if we are up to the task we can do with them what we like; we can convert those people into a great source of power, an inexhaustible source of manpower, for South Africa in times of war and distress. Just think for a moment what the position would be, Sir, if we were to think that we could evade our responsibility and allow those people to degenerate into a dissatisfied hostile group; just think what the results would be. In the abovementioned circumstances I hesitate to think what harm such a large section of our population could do in such a small country as ours. I therefore want to plead with the hon. the Minister and this House to tackle this big task in all seriousness and to support the Minister because this is perhaps the most important Department in South Africa; let us assist him so that he can develop that potential in such a way that South Africa will derive the greatest possible benefit and advantage from it.</p>

<p>I want to raise another matter. Apart from the Minister and the Department it is the duty of every man and woman in South Africa to show a feeling of goodwill, to create a human relationship, a relationship that will eliminate that estrangement which has developed over the years and which I regard as exceedingly dangerous to South Africa to-day. I recently read in a Church magazine&#x2014;I appreciated it greatly that the Reformed Church referred to it&#x2014;that what we perhaps needed more than anything else in South Africa to-day was to promote and to establish better human relationships between the various racial groups in South Africa. That is the spirit and the approach which I think are still sorely lacking in South Africa. We want to hold the Government responsible; we want to make the Department responsible for a certain task and that is the end of it. But that is not the end. My attitude and my behaviour towards the people whom I meet on the street and whom I have in my employ, determine the relationship between people; the respect which people have for each other engenders either respect or hate. That is why I plead for it that that relationship in South Africa should receive the greatest possible attention.</p>

<p>I want to bring something to the attention of the hon. the Minister as far as my own constituency is concerned. I want to raise the question of the Coloureds there not because I think the Coloured Representatives do not do their duty here in Parliament. After all there are only four of them and they have to plead the cause of 1,500,000 people. I know a position is developing in my constituency which more or less amounts to this that those Coloureds who are getting old and can no longer work for the farmers on the farms&#x2014;I am talking about the platteland&#x2014;have nowhere to go. What must happen to them? They cannot go to the town. That Coloured man is somebody who has worked on the farm until he can work no more. We cannot expect him to go and live in a Coloured residential area in the town because he cannot afford to do so. I want to plead with the Minister to approach this problem in a practical way. Give them land in an area where there are facilities such as a post office and a police station where they can build a church and a school and where they can establish their own community; an area where they will be in the position to have their grandchildren with them so that those children can go to school and become educated. There are no school facilities for the Coloured people in that part of the world. True, there are school facilities in the towns but there are no such facilities on the platteland. The district of Vryburg is so big that the Molopo area is 170 miles away from the town. How must they attend school? We shall have to do something in this direction. I want to refer to an even more difficult problem. In a town like Mafeking you find that there are 200 Coloured children all huddled together in one little room under conditions hardly imaginable. I and other important guests were invited to visit them. When that group of Coloured children got up to sing &#x201C;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&#x201D; I got a kind of lump in my throat. They have no space and something ought to be done immediately. The hon. Minister has now taken Coloured education over and the question arises whether it is not going to take a long time to finalize the transfer from the provinces to the Union with the result that the position at Mafeking will still perhaps obtain for many years. Mr. Chairman, those Coloureds told me that because there were no facilities they were obliged to send their children to the Roman Catholic school where they could be accommodated. Those are Protestant children and if they go to <span class="col_7465_7466" refersTo="page_1065"/>those schools they are often lost, according to their parents, to their own communities and their own Church. I was told that by the Coloureds. I want to bring that to the notice of the Minister and his Department. This is a matter which ought to receive immediate attention and I hope and trust that this Department and the Minister will be given the necessary funds to tackle the necessary work in connection with this important matter so that a better mutual relationship can be established than has existed hitherto.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>May I claim the privilege of the second half-hour? The hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) has passed certain comments in regard to the Coloured community and many of those comments are comments with which we on this side of the House agree, for instance the necessity for obtaining the goodwill and the co-operation of the Coloured community. That is of paramount importance in bringing about a happier situation in South Africa. And the points that he raised in connection with bringing about a greater degree of happiness, goodwill and co-operation with the Coloured community are points which deserve serious consideration and sympathetic support.</p>

<p>I want in the main to deal with the position of the Coloured community in the Province of Natal. We know that in terms of legislation that was passed by this House, there is a dwindling number of Coloured persons on the Common Roll in Natal. I think it is appropriate that the hon. Minister should give some indication to the Committee as to what the political future is of those Coloured people living in the Province of Natal. The fact that the numbers on the Common Roll are dwindling, means that the Coloured community have no political representation as such in regard to their own community, and those who are living in Natal are frustrated by this continual elimination of their political rights in that province and in the country as a whole. The hon. the Prime Minister in December 1961, at Cape Town addressed the Union Council of Coloured Affairs and made a very important statement in regard to the political future of the Coloured community and he referred to the possibility of the Coloured community having their own Parliament with certain powers. Mr. Chairman, according to the <i>Daily News</i> of 3 October 1962, the Government briefed a Cape Town advocate to prepare a constitution for this proposed Coloured Parliament. Therefore as a matter of policy it would be interesting to hear from the hon. Minister what progress has been made in this regard and whether he is able to furnish this Committee with any further details.</p>

<p>The position of the Coloureds in Natal which in wish to mainly bring to the notice of the Minister is in respect of the welfare services that are provided for the Coloured community in that province. The main basis of the items appearing on this Vote of some R17,660,000 concerns welfare services for the Coloured community. However, the overall function of the Department of Coloured Affairs, which normally issues an annual report but which has not been forthcoming for some considerable time, is as follows. May I say in passing that I hope to hear from the hon. Minister when the House may expect to have tabled the latest report of the Department because information given in the last report that was tabled reveals that certain alterations have occurred not only in regard to matters of administration, but also in regard to subsidies that are paid for instance in regard to child welfare and in respect of children who are committed in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act of 1960, and certain other financial subsidies and assistance rendered to welfare organizations performing a duty and providing services to the Coloured community. In Natal the position is that some 45,000 Coloured people depend to a large measure on the attitude of the Department of Coloured Affairs in regard to their welfare and well-being. If we look at the everyday life of the Coloured community, we find that poverty is perhaps one of the main difficulties facing the majority of these Coloured people, because the various welfare organizations that render services to the Coloured community are welfare organizations that also render services to the European community, and it has been found that that works in a satisfactory manner. For instance the largest child welfare society in the province, the Durban Child Welfare Society, recently appointed an additional two Coloured social workers to assist in the work amongst the Coloured people, and they now have four full-time Coloured social welfare workers on their staff. Similarly an institution such as the Blind Association covers Coloured and European blind people and the various organizations work together for the benefit of the Coloured community. I think it is of interest to note that experienced Coloured social workers who are attached to welfare societies, such as the Durban Child Welfare Society, in all their reports have brought to the notice of the public and of the society concerned that poverty is one of the main causes and one of the main reasons in respect of which welfare societies are called upon to render assistance. Some of these reports indicate the difficulties that exist amongst the Coloured community. For instance a report here by a social welfare worker states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The problems dealt with during the year seem to have been caused mainly by a low income or no income among the Coloured people.</block>

<p>The difficulty experienced by a number of Coloured people in finding employment is a very real problem indeed. Leading members of the Coloured community in Natal recently formed a committee in an endeavour to assist Coloured persons to find employment. The avenues of employment, particularly for the young Coloured persons, are indeed limited, and I think that the hon. Minister can do a great service to the Coloured community in Natal if his Department will assist this committee <span class="col_7467_7468" refersTo="page_1066"/>and if in co-operation with the Department of Labour, they will investigate possible new avenues of employment for the Coloured community in the Province of Natal. It is most frustrating for a number of Coloured youths who attain certain scholastic degrees of efficiency to find that there is only a very limited number of avenues of employment open to them. In some instances they have to accept employment which is far below the scholastic attainment they have achieved. I think that that particular aspect of employment&#x2014;the problem of unemployment amongst the Coloured community&#x2014;requires the urgent attention of the Departments concerned, and the Department of Coloured Affairs could perhaps assist in an investigation and make approaches to commerce and industry and to local authorities and the provincial administration and the Government Departments to see whether there are any avenues of employment that could be opened up for members of the Coloured community.</p>

<p>The question of poverty amongst the Coloured people and the difficulties experienced by them, I believe can be tackled in a positive manner. Some of the suggestions I wish to put forward are put forward in an effort to try to bring about a happier state of affairs particularly in regard to the Coloured community in the Province of Natal. I mentioned the question of finding avenues of employment, which is of prime importance. But in regard to the other matters, covering mainly welfare services that are rendered, I would like to remind the hon. Minister of a reply that he gave to a question, or a series of questions that I put in the House on Tuesday, 5 March 1963. The questions I put to the hon. Minister were aimed at ascertaining the number of Government institutions, such as homes for the aged, cr&#x00E8;ches, registered children&#x2019;s homes, institutions for physically handicapped and mentally defective Coloured people in the Province of Natal. The reply was that there are no such Government institutions under the control of his Department catering and providing for these persons in need. Similarly I was informed that there are five Government-assisted registered children&#x2019;s homes and another five privately administered children&#x2019;s homes. I might mention here too that the hon. Minister in his reply mentioned that a place of safety and detention for Coloured children was to be opened in April of this year. That is indeed welcomed by those persons connected with welfare services among the Coloured community. It was welcome news that this place of safety and detention is now coming into operation. But coming to the homes for the aged, I believe that this is a most important factor in assisting the Coloured community. The Minister in a speech earlier on said that the decrease in the Vote of R25.400 under Item J did not indicate that there would be any decrease in the services for the care of the aged and infirm, because he said that the reduction was mainly due to the fact that on the Vote last year there appeared an amount for certain additional buildings for the care of the aged. But in the Province of Natal there is no such State institution, and when we consider that the aged Coloured community is living on a very small pension indeed, we can realize how difficult the position is. In terms of the policy of the Government their pension is one half of the pension that is paid to the European community and therefore amounts to only some R12 per month. I believe that a very good case exists indeed for the State to establish a home for the aged Coloureds in the Province of Natal. Coloured people cannot care for their aged people because of the low standard of living and the low incomes received by families of these aged persons, which necessitates their removal to a place where they can be cared for. As there is no such place in Natal, it means that they have to leave the province and come to the Cape, and we know that many of these families wish to have such members of their family close by so that they can visit them and assist them. They do not want to lose entire contact with these people.</p>

<p>The lack of other institutions for the Coloured community in Natal raises another aspect and that is the question of a children&#x2019;s home, particularly for young Coloured males, because under present conditions there is no State home for these children, and as referred to in a report by one of the qualified social workers attached to a large child welfare society, who has been with the society for some nine years, it is stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At present all Coloured boys over the age of 12 years have to be sent to institutions out of Natal, if they cannot be placed in the custody of relatives. This severs them from their normal home environments. The need for a children&#x2019;s home in Natal to cater for these boys is one of urgency.</block>

<p>This is another aspect, another need that requires attention.</p>

<p>There are other matters which also require the attention of the hon. Minister. I mentioned the lack of any facilities to cater for the mentally defective Coloured children and also the question of the physically handicapped Coloured children. These are all services which I believe could do a great deal towards making the position of the Coloured community a happier one in that province. Coming to the question of maintenance grants, the Government saw fit to increase these maintenance grants slightly two years ago, but there is another aspect in regard to maintenance grants which perhaps should receive the attention of the hon. Minister. That is the question of the extension of the grant to the child who is over the age of 16 years for educational reasons. It is found that a number of these Coloured youths from families receiving maintenance grants lose the grant as soon as they attain the age of 16 and then they have to go out to find employment. Some of these youths, if they could have received further education, would have been a greater asset to <span class="col_7469_7470" refersTo="page_1067"/>the community, but because of economic reasons they were unable to continue their education. I believe that sympathetic consideration should be given to extending these maintenance grants for educational reasons to youths over 16 years of age.</p>

<p>The question of providing sufficient educational services for these Coloured people to encourage them to become more efficient and productive is a most important matter. Here, too, I think a great deal more can be done in regard to vocational training, particularly for the Coloured youths in Natal. These services are urgently required by the Coloured community in their endeavour to better themselves and to make it possible for them to attain a higher degree of efficiency in their employment. I mentioned earlier the question of welfare organizations and societies which are rendering invaluable services to the Coloured community. I want to pay tribute to those organizations and I hope that they will continue to receive financial assistance from the Government, and that that financial assistance should be further increased when it is found that they are unable to keep pace with the enormous demands made on their funds. There are a vast number of welfare organizations in Natal and one welfare worker names 22 welfare agencies who assist the aged and the Coloured children. There are also societies who assist the poor, and this worker believes that without this one society many of the aged Coloureds would have died from starvation or lack of accommodation. I think that more or less sums up the position in regard to the necessity for obtaining additional State aid for the Coloureds. The main function of the Department of Coloured Affairs at present seems to be to do welfare work amongst the Coloureds, and pensions are also important to the Coloureds. It is hoped that the Department will see fit to extend the services of the welfare societies and organizations and wherever possible will establish institutions, particularly for the children and the aged, and if possible the Minister should do more to care for the physically handicapped and the mentally defective amongst the Coloureds.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down will forgive me if I do not follow his discussion of the problem of the Coloureds in Natal. Those are matters about which he has a peculiar knowledge and we are grateful to him for having raised them here.</p>

<p>I want to confine myself to certain problems in connection with the Coloureds in the Western Cape and I want to return to the speech made by the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) the other day when he alleged that there was an acute shortage of Coloured labour here, such a shortage that farmers stole each other&#x2019;s labour, which is a very serious charge against the farmers of whom the hon. member is one. That charge has already been adequately refuted both inside and outside this House. I just want to say that I am sorry that the hon. member as a farmer made that charge because farmers usually get on well with one another as far as labour problems are concerned. Through organized agriculture the farmers have an understanding amongst themselves in respect of labour matters and had the hon. member had a justifiable grievance, although it was only in respect of one instance, as appeared from his speech, he was at liberty to discuss it with his local farmers&#x2019; union. I am afraid, however, that the hon. member does not really know his own farmers&#x2019; union and his fellow farmers in his own area hence his unjustifiable attack on his fellow farmers.</p>

<p>I wish to refute the statement by the hon. member for Sea Point that there is an acute shortage of Coloured labour on the farms in the Western Cape. What is perhaps true is that we are experiencing a process of urbanization which is also affecting the farmers. I want to read a few extracts from a population study made by the Natural Resources Development Board, particularly in respect of the position of the Coloureds in the Western Cape. The report says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the urban-rural ration is concerned, it is noticable that as far as the Coloureds are concerned, the Western Cape still has a predominantly platteland character, in contrast with the Whites in whose case the urban population to the total was already 80.2 per cent in 1960; with the exception of the big urban areas Cape Town and Port Elizabeth and the wine and deciduous fruit growing areas, fewer than half the Coloured population lived in towns. In the extensive farming areas along the West Coast you find a ratio of even less than one-third, but as opposed to that in the intensive wine and deciduous fruit growing area you find a much higher ratio which immediately indicates the diversification of labour to urban industries where the basic industry is highly productive.&#x2026; Judging from this it is very obvious that in the intensive wine and deciduous fruit growing areas where, incidentally, industrialization is taking place comparatively quickly, the Coloureds will soon become urbanized.</block>

<p>That is what is happening in the agricultural areas to which the hon. member for Sea Point has incidentally referred. As in the case of the Whites the Coloureds are also in the process of becoming urbanized. They make the further point in this report that in many cases the Coloureds are already working in industries in urban areas but are still living in the platteland because of a housing shortage in the urban areas. This phenomenon is nothing strange and organized agriculture is aware of it and they know that in order to retain their Coloured labour they will have to compete. We are faced with specific problems. One is the question of housing to which I have referred but which I shall rather not discuss under this Vote. The other is the question of <span class="col_7471_7472" refersTo="page_1068"/>regulating labour. The following significant statement appears in the same report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is remarkable, is the fact that as far as the Coloureds are concerned in the Western Cape the unemployment figure is 15.2 per cent which is more than four times as high as in the case of the Whites in the Republic.</block>

<p>That completely refutes the statement by the hon. member for Sea Point. I say it is a question of regulating Coloured labour. Because we have this process of urbanization you find there is a flow of Coloureds to the towns, even in the Karoo; because farms are divided into camps you require much less labour on the farms. They are, therefore, moving to the towns where many of them are unemployed. That is why I view the problem as being one of regulating labour. There are also certain specific industries in agriculture to which the Bantu have gained access in preference to the Coloured because the Bantu has a natural aptitude for them, although he has no previous experience. The two industries I want to mention are the dairy industry and poultry farming, both of which have only recently been developed on a large scale in the Western Cape. On farms where 20 years ago only two cows were milked and where the farmer believed that he himself should milk those cows, 40 to 50 cows are being milked to-day and the Coloured has never had the opportunity of becoming proficient as a dairyman. The Bantu, who in his most primitive state was at least a good dairyman, got the work, I mention this in respect of the problem of regulating labour. I wish to point out that where there are such spheres of agriculture for which the Coloured has not been trained and to which the Bantu has easily adapted himself, we are faced with an unemployment figure of 15.2 per cent in respect of the Coloureds in the Western Cape. In other words, what does require attention is the question of making Coloured labour productive. That is why we are so grateful to the Minister for his idea of having agricultural gymnasiums to train Coloureds for agricultural work. Seeing that a start is to be made at Kromme Rhee where Coloureds will undergo short courses as farm labourers, I want to appeal to the Minister to see to it that special attention is given to the fresh milk industry and poultry farming so that the Coloureds can replace the Bantu and so that we can do without the Bantu.</p>

<p>I think I shall be failing in my duty if I did not, on behalf of the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux) who is unfortunately still in hospital as a result of an operation, thank the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) for the manner in which he has brought certain matters affecting the Coloured community in Mafeking and Vryburg to the attention of the Minister. Coming from the hon. member for Vryburg and because he stated his case so well, I hope the Minister will give special attention to them. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>When the Foreign Affairs Vote was discussed reference was made to the recent conference of Africa states at Addis Ababa where a positive attempt was made, the greatest attempt hitherto, by the Africa states to form a united front against South Africa. When I heard about it the first question that arose in my mind was what was our reply to it. The Minister of Defence has given a reply; he spoke about 140,000 men that were at our disposal. I wonder whether the answer does not lie not only in the number of men and weapons which we have but in our racial groups as far as this country is concerned. There is no doubt about it that we in South Africa are in a position to reply to the world outside and to the Black states. We should not only mention the number of Whites but the number of non-Whites whose salvation is tied up with that of the Whites, those non-White races which also want to see Western civilization maintained in South Africa, which also not only want to see White citizenship maintained but who want it for themselves. I think that reply would have been a much better reply to the world outside. We have a White population of 3,500,000, an Indian population of 500,000, a Coloured population of 1,500,000 and a Bantu population of over 10,000,000. The question arises what percentage of them are on the side of the White man? That brings me to the Coloureds and the Indians. The position is that they resent the idea of Black domination in South Africa to which they will have to subject themselves. It is stated that the Whites will fight for their birthright and for the civilization as they know it and for their citizenship and freedom as citizens of South Africa. The question which arises is this: Do these two national groups whom I have mentioned, like the White people, have reason to say that they will in all earnestness fight for the retention of what they have in this country? I do not want to discuss the Indians but I want to confine myself to the 1,500,000 Coloureds, most of whom are represented by us in this House. If the evil day should arrive when we have to take up weapons to fight for what we have will we, as Whites, with a clear conscience, be able to depend on the moral and active support of those 1,500,000 Coloureds?</p>

<p>Can we honestly say that if such a day should dawn we shall no doubt be able to depend on it that those people will support this Government with their heart and soul and fight for what we have? Anybody in this House or outside who knows what happened during the past wars will agree with me when I say that when a soldier is in danger he will much rather fight with a soldier at his side who shares a common loyalty with him and who will stake everything he has to fight for what he has, than a mercenary who is forced or paid to be there.</p>

<p>I want to deal with that. We have progressed in certain respects. The position is that something happened recently which has never happened in peacetime&#x2014;I can almost say never in wartime&#x2014;namely that the Coloureds have been considered to form part of the armed forces of South Africa. [Interjections.] The hon. member says that is right, but he would never have said it was right had General Smuts done so. That is why we say progress had been made. The Cape Corps has been re-established as part of the armed forces; they will be trained in the handling of weapons. Hon. members know that even during the war General Smuts could not do that for fear of political reactions. We have made progress and we appreciate it. But what are we really doing to make those people as proud of their citizenship as we are? We are told that there are going to be Coloured and Indian auxiliary police but have those people got the holy sense of duty which the White man has when it comes to saving South Africa? The attitude of the White man is that the Coloured belongs with the White man. They have a Western background; they observe the Christian religion and they speak Afrikaans. Never in the history of this country has the Coloured been unfaithful to South Africa. It is stated that the Coloured is on the side of the White man and does not make common cause with the Bantu, but what happens in actual fact? [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself particularly with the remarks made by the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne). He referred to an occasion when a number of children sang &#x201C;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&#x201D; and he said that it touched him. I happened to be in Namaqualand when the hon. the Prime Minister visited it last year. A Coloured teacher came there with a number of school children and there on the wide open plains of Kamieskroon paid tribute in the Prime Minister. On that occasion the children sang &#x201C;Die Stem van Suid-Afrika&#x201D; and we were all touched. Our Coloureds are part of our country and we have to evolve a pattern which will create the necessary harmony between the Brown man and the White man. I want to pay tribute to the Minister and his Department for what they have done in the past four years in this direction. The Government&#x2019;s socio-economic policy of uplifting the Coloured people has recently been receiving attention. We have recently had many examples of developmental programmes in respect of under-developed communities in the world. Once you start comparing them you find that not one of them can be compared with this socio-economic upliftment policy of the Government in respect of the Coloureds. The impact of this policy has been terrific but what is more important is the fact that in all its facets this plan has all the characteristics of practical reality in a world where we sometimes have exaggerated and misplaced humanitarianism. There is one aspect of this policy which worries me and it is this, that if we analyse this plan closer, we find that the effects of this upliftment policy are to a very large extent neutralized in the form of increasing numbers instead of those effects being enjoyed in the form of a higher standard of living. The position is that since 1950 the natural growth in the case of the Coloured has exceeded that of all other national groups in South Africa. According to the most recent figures the birth rate in the case of the Whites is 25 per 1,000 per annum, in the case of the Bantu it is 30, 33 in the case of the Indians, but 47 in the case of the Coloureds. As far as the death rate is concerned, it is 8.6 per 1,000 in the case of the Whites, 13 in the case of the Bantu, 9 in the case of the Indians and 17.5 in the case of the Coloureds. The effect of our policy is to reduce the death rate greatly amongst the Coloureds. That brings us to the position where the natural increase in respect of the various groups is as follows: Whites 1.6 per cent, the Bantu 1.5 per cent, Indians 2.4 per cent, and Coloureds 3 per cent. What is the result? These figures clearly show that as far as the Coloureds are concerned there is a demographic gap at the moment, a gap which is really caused by an increase in the excess of births over deaths. If we do not tackle this big human problem within the framework of our socioeconomic policy I predict that the burden of responsibility for the Coloureds will in future rest even heavier particularly on the shoulders of the White taxpayers. We shall have to tackle this problem in a realistic way. I wish to draw attention to a serious warning which was issued last year by Dr. Eugene Black, chief of the World Bank, when he warned the developed countries as far as their assistance schemes to under-developed countries were concerned and said that the effect of those schemes was really worthless if the natural increase in respect of those under-developed nations who were assisted remained in the vicinity of 2 per cent and 3&#x00BD; per cent. I have pointed out that in the case of the Coloureds it practically bordered on the biological maximum of 3 per cent per annum. It is a fact that particularly in the Eastern countries a great deal has been done recently on the part of the authorities as far as birth control is concerned. I want to point out that in a country like Japan, for example, after the Government has stepped in, about half the number of children are born than 30 years ago. In countries like India and Pakistan as well the Governments arrange programmes to encourage birth control. I realize that in view of our religious feelings we cannot openly come and advocate birth control. The only way left to us in this connection is to come forward with a planned policy of guardianship towards the Coloureds within the framework of the present policy on the initiative of the Department <span class="col_7475_7476" refersTo="page_1070"/>of Coloured Affairs. I know the hon. the Minister announced last year that the State would make bursaries available in the Western Cape for degrees and diploma courses in the social sciences for the training of social workers. Viewed against the background of this broader policy of ours this is a very great investment on the part of the State and I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to double and more than double the amount which is made available. This is an investment on the part of the State. I want to plead with the hon. the Minister to be very realistic in this matter and to make more assistance available in this connection.</p>

<p>There is a second aspect which concerns our policy, namely, the presence of thousands and thousands of single Bantu males in the Western Province where the greater proportion of our Coloured population live. It is a fact that that which the White man generously spends on the upliftment of the Coloured community is mercilessly broken down and neutralized by the thousands and thousands of single Bantu males in this vicinity. In this connection I want to refer to the Cape Flats. We are creating a new Coloured community there, practically a metropolis, which will eventually, as far as numbers are concerned, exceed our mother city, Cape Town, in its thousands. In the very heart of this new development you find a Langa and a Nyanga, a Langa with 18,000 single Bantu males. Mr. Chairman, it is impossible to describe the merciless way in which the Coloured women are exploited in this area. It is true that the Government regard the Bantu in the Cape Province as temporary sojourners and that is why I want to plead for it that under the guidance of the Department of Coloured Affairs, greater protection should be given to our Coloured people, particularly in the western areas of the Cape Province. It is possible to incorporate greater protection for our Coloureds on certain train routes established for their conveyance and in the planning of our cities and towns. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like to confine my remarks particularly to two items on page 257, the items being F and T, &#x201C;Child Welfare&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Western Cape University College&#x201D;. Sir, we now have this Department of Coloured Affairs, and I think it is the desire of both sides of the House and of the whole community to see that this Department operates efficiently and effectively. We are all anxious to assist. I do not think at this stage there can be any criticism that is not helpful criticism. I saw the other day that at a graduation ceremony at the Western Cape University College 10 or 12 students had graduated in science and were going to teach in the schools. I think that is a very creditable performance. It is something which we are not able to achieve in our universities for White students. White students have greater careers open for them and we find it very difficult indeed to get the good science graduate to teach in our secondary schools. It is a very difficult thing to-day to prepare our men of science and, from them, the technologists who are going to give South Africa what we need in the way of know-how and technical service. We in South Africa to-day are eating the seed-corn; we are not getting the quality of men that we should like to have in the schools, but I see that in the Coloured schools we are getting a start in the right way in the secondary schools and I hope that they will be supported in these secondary schools by the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I come now to this question of child welfare. I see that there is an increase here again of R123,000. The increase in the case of the university college was approximately R124,000. I should like to revert to what the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has said. He has told us that the average cost of school feeding for a Coloured child is two-thirds of a cent per day, and for that they can obtain at the 11 o&#x2019;clock interval half a pint of hot broth, a slice of bread and peanut butter. I think that is an excellent thing to give a child at the 11 o&#x2019;clock break. Sir, I was associated with school feeding when we had in South Africa, and especially in the Transvaal, a poor White problem. I think this school feeding at the 11 o&#x2019;clock interval is exceedingly important. What is it going to cost the hon. the Minister? He has increased the Child Welfare Vote by R123,000. We are told that the cost per child per day for school feeding is two-thirds of a cent. That means that you can feed a child for a whole year, extending over 200 school days, for R1.34. We can therefore feed 1,000 of them for R1,345, and altogether, with an increase of less than R100,000, less than the increase this year, we can feed 71,000 Coloured children for the whole year. The hon. member for Peninsula is not asking much; he is asking very little. We can do it with that small amount. Sir, how is it to be carried out? I know the difficulties. I do not want to put too much work on the staff. If it can be done voluntarily it should be done that way. And if you can do it voluntarily with the co-operation of the school staff, especially the women on the staff, so much the better. That is the perfect arrangement.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, with the co-operation of the parents as well. They used to do this when we had school feeding in White schools. I would recommend this very strongly. I support what the hon. member for Peninsula has said.</p>

<p>I now come back to this other point that we have discussed, the question of an education Bill for Coloured people, and the question of the freedom of the teacher. How far can the hon. the Minister go in this matter? I know how he feels about it; he has told us. In regard to this question of extra work outside school hours, I think the manner in which it should be tackled is this: I think the hon. the Minister should say by regulation: <span class="col_7477_7478" refersTo="page_1071"/>&#x201C;There is a maximum amount of time.&#x201D; I would suggest that that maximum should be seven hours per week, during which the teacher may be permitted, provided he is a satisfactory teacher&#x2014;that is most important&#x2014; to devote to additional work approved of by the Department. One should think of the dignity of the profession. There is certain work that the teacher should not be allowed to do because it might be that the teacher would then lose caste in the eyes of the parents. I would suggest a maximum period of seven hours per week.</p>

<p>The second point is the teacher&#x2019;s part in public affairs. In every community the teacher has to play a part in public affairs. He is very often in the church as a lay preacher; religion is part of public affairs in our lives. Now, Sir. what should he be permitted to do? I know teachers may serve on our White municipal councils. They may not perhaps belong to a political party, although in the Transvaal they may. But let us accept that they may not belong to a political party when they stand for municipal councils. They do stand for ratepayers&#x2019; associations and taxpayers&#x2019; associations and residents&#x2019; associations. And if it is possible for the White teacher to serve his own community in that way, I think the hon. the Minister should consider the position of the Coloured teacher very sympathetically. But this time I am afraid he cannot do it by regulation; this time he must use the old jargon of administration and say that every case will be considered on its merits. But I think teachers should have the opportunity to give that service, and I recommend that very strongly to the hon. the Minister, with the assurance that we are making these suggestions to-day to assist him in carrying out the very important task that has fallen to his lot.</p>

<p>When we judge the actions of this Department I think we must view them against the very clearly defined policy of the Government, a policy which was very clearly outlined by the hon. the Prime Minister in a speech. I want to read from a brochure issued by the Information Service of the Department of Coloured Affairs in which the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister in connection with the Union Coloured Affairs Board has been reproduced. Allow me to read a few short extracts which very clearly illustrate the policy of the Government. It is against the background of this policy that the actions of this Department should be viewed in order to criticize and judge their work. The hon. the Prime Minister said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To start with you must take certain facts into consideration. The first is that the four groups in South Africa, the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu, are all different. The fact that that is so need not be an unpleasant one nor need it lead to the one group looking down on the other.</block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister went further and he made a second statement which I think is very significant&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dr. Verwoerd said he admitted that he had seriously asked himself whether the advocates of a completely common society were fair and reasonable but that he was convinced in his soul that success could not be achieved along that road in a country like South Africa.</block>

<p>Then this further quotation which states the policy very clearly; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That is why our attitude is the so-called four-stream policy.</block>

<p>The final quotation I want to read before submitting my plea is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is realized that most Coloureds work on White farms and in the cities. That had to be taken into account in the search for a solution. Realizing what the position is opportunities and rights for the Coloureds must be sought along the road of separation so that they will have the opportunity of having their own local authorities to control their own affairs.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. DE K. MAREE</person>:</from>

<p>When business was suspended I was reading certain extracts from a speech of the hon. the Prime Minister in which he stated the policy of the Government very clearly and unequivocally, namely that the future of the racial groups in South Africa had to be sought along the road of separate development. I maintain that the actions of this Department must be viewed against that background. If we ever want to have good race relations in South Africa it is necessary for the races in South Africa to live in harmony alongside one another. The policy of the Government is that there should be good relationship between the various races in South Africa: that the races should live happily together in South Africa. Unfortunately there are many people who cannot understand the concept of a happy co-existence. They regard it as integration or oppression. The policy of this Government is a happy co-existence of the four racial groups in South Africa, the Whites, the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu. And in that pattern of four racial groups it is an acknowledged fact that the Coloureds live predominantly in the western Cape and that they can therefore to a great extent claim protection in the labour market in this area. Formerly the Coloureds and the Whites did practically all the work in this area. In the past the Whites and the Coloureds were responsible for the labour in this area and it was also their undisputed labour market. That is why the Government approaches this <span class="col_7479_7480" refersTo="page_1072"/>question, firstly, from this point of view that it is its responsibility to see to it that the Coloureds are protected against unfair and unreasonable competition in this labour market. That is something which is not always correctly understood and the attitude of the Government is often criticized. I want to say immediately that there are some people in this country who, the moment you talk about labour, get panicky, as we saw the other day in the case of the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) who got so panicky that he even confused his telephone numbers and mentioned the names of people who did not even exist. There is no reason to panic. The Government has deliberately embarked upon a policy of meeting the labour requirements of commerce and industry in the western Cape. The Government is fully aware of it that it cannot afford to undermine commerce and industry by allowing them to experience a labour shortage, but on the other hand the Government is fully conscience of the Coloureds&#x2019; rightful claim to this labour market. The Government has now introduced measures for which I really want to congratulate the hon. the Minister, his Department and the Government, measures to give effect to their policy without doing any harm to anybody. The Government has established a big extensive organization in respect of labour in the western Cape. The Government has established committees with a view to gradually replacing Bantu labour by White and Coloured labour in the western Cape and with that object in mind, the object of gradually replacing Bantu labour by White and Coloured labour without disrupting commerce and industry and agriculture, the Government has introduced a very extensive scheme. In the first place the Government has formed a Cabinet committee to take charge of this matter. The Government has furthermore established an inter-departmental committee. When we study the composition of that inter-departmental committee we notice immediately that due regard is taken of the interests of all groups concerned. The following Departments are represented on that inter-departmental committee: Coloured Affairs, Community Development, Housing, Labour, Immigration, Bantu Administration, Economic Affairs, Transport, Lands, Forestry, Water Affairs, Agricultural, Economic and the Provincial Administrations. We see, therefore, that all interests are well borne in mind. That inter-departmental committee will from time to time advise the Cabinet committee and keep it informed of developments.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>When my time expired I was putting the point that we on both sides of the House as representatives of the White population groups loudly proclaim and adopt the attitude that the Coloureds are of Western origin, that they have a Western background, that they have a Christian religion, that Afrikaans is their mother tongue and that they are therefore close to the Whites and that their salvation is tied up with that of the Whites. But what is the true position? We can start here in this House where we are gathered. We find that in this House the public are admitted to the public gallery. There is a small bay set aside where Coloureds may sit together with other non-Whites. If a Coloured comes to the House of Assembly to listen to debates and he leaves here and goes to any other public building, he finds that there is segregation between Coloured and White and that for those purposes he is classified with the Bantu. When the Coloured boards a bus or a train, he finds that segregation between White and Coloured is rigidly applied and the Coloured is classified with the Bantu. When a Coloured boards a bus the apartheid provisions are applied and he is separated from the Whites and classified with the Bantu. I have personal experience of this and I want to tell the Committee what happens on railway buses, particularly in the Eastern Province in the Transkeian Territories and Natal. Last year I had to travel from Durban to Griqualand East by bus. There were two compartments in the bus; it was divided into two parts. In the front section where I was sitting there was one White woman and there was the driver. In the rear portion of the bus there was one Coloured person, a member of the National Coloured Council. Some way along the road we came upon a bus which had a flat tyre, a bus that was carrying Bantu passengers. There was room for 22 people and at Kokstad when the people left the bus 36 Bantu got off. When there was no more room for baggage it was loaded in the White section of the bus and the driver warned me to come and sit in front with him because that baggage was sometimes full of lice. When I asked him whether the one man who was sitting in the rear position and who was dressed as we were, a member of the National Coloured Council, could not be removed from the tribal Natives and allowed to sit in front, his reply was: &#x201C;Sir, I would like to do it, but I am afraid that it would be against the regulations.&#x201D; But I have to say to that Coloured: &#x201C;Your future does not lie with those people with whom you are classified for the purposes of bus travel, people who do not have your standard of living, your way of life, your background, your language and your religion: people who do not have your washing habits and your bathing habits, but you may not sit in the front portion of the bus; their contaminated baggage can be piled into the front portion but you are contaminated by the fact that your skin has a different colour.&#x201D;</p>

<p>I may have expressed myself strongly but that is what actually happened. Is this the way in which we show the Coloureds that in our everyday life they are regarded as persons representing a national group whose salvation lies with that of the Whites? I can give numerous examples. It is <span class="col_7481_7482" refersTo="page_1073"/>no good the hon. member for Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) talking to me about apartheid.

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish we would forget about the word apartheid. That word was all very well in the days when you scored political victories with it but that word has to-day become an embarrassment to South Africa. I am not pleading for apartheid between the Coloureds and the Natives. What I am pleading for is that the White man should change his attitude towards the Coloured man in everyday life in such a way that the Coloured will actually feel that he is part of society in this country and that his interests really lie with those of the White man.</p>

<p>Pin-pricks of that nature, those dagger and spear stabs which are inflicted on those people every day as a result of legislation, as a result of regulations which can be changed, are all things which estrange the Coloured man from the White man. I can give another example. There is a park next to the National Road at Humansdorp, the town of the hon. Leader of the House. Ten yards inside the gate there is a monument with the names of the Coloured soldiers who were killed during the First and the Second World Wars in the service of South Africa. On the one side of the gate there is a notice &#x201C;No Dogs Allowed&#x201D; and on the other side of the gate there is a notice &#x201C;Whites only And when the Coloured ex-soldiers of Humansdorp ask for permission once a year to hold a memorial service at that monument they are refused admission because only Whites are allowed.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, now I am called an agitator I want to say this to that hon. member that had God punished him with a darker skin that he has he would have been an instigated person. It is unreasonable to hurl things like that at me when I am simply stating a fact. I am referring to the things which these people have to undergo every day of their lives. They are the people whose salvation, we maintain, lies with the White people. Unwittingly and silently we are depending on that national group in case the evil day which we hear so much about in this House should ever dawn for South Africa. In practice it amounts to this that in our attitude towards him, we do not show the Coloured that what we are saying we are carrying out in practice.</p>

<p>I repeat what I have already said on other occasions that if I have to have that man, properly trained to handle a weapon at my side in times of stress, I do not want him there merely because he had no choice. I want him there because of the love in his heart and the desire to risk his life for South Africa, for something which he has, something which he cannot find anywhere else and something which he stands to lose.</p>

<p>At a recent meeting of the Coloured Affairs Board a member quite rightly got up and said: &#x201C;We are told that the policy is one of parallel development. The question I want to ask is: Parallel with what?&#x201D; He gave numerous examples, some of which I have mentioned here. That man is not an agitator; he is not an extremist. The officials of the Department and the Minister himself know that person. He cannot be labelled an agitator. But those are the things which he as a Coloured person has to undergo every day. He brings it home to the White man and the Government of the day via the correct channels and I as his representative in this House regard it as my duty to bring it to the notice of the House. Mr. Chairman, when are we going to place the Coloured in the position where he can say: &#x201C;I, a citizen of South Africa, am proud of my citizenship; I shall risk my life to retain what I have?&#x201D; We cannot only concentrate on the material things. Recently in a debate the Minister, in reply to an interjection of mine, said fairly heatedly that he was doing much more for the Coloureds than I. I admit that. Heaven help the Minister of Coloured Affairs if he does not do more for the Coloureds than an ordinary representative. No Coloured representative can get this House to vote money to build houses for the Coloureds or to improve their rural areas or whatever it may be. But it does not help us one bit to go back into history for decades in order to prove what a sound position obtains to-day because of separate representation and to prove that the attitude towards the Coloured has improved because they are no longer on the Common Roll. Because in that case our minds go back to what was said from platform to platform about the Coloureds in those days. I do not want to have anything to do with that; that is something of the past. Nor does it avail us to boast about material things if we do not do something to the innermost soul and state of mind of the people. [Time limit ]</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I realize time is getting on and that we cannot have a full discussion on the very many subjects that I would have liked to raise. I will merely indicate to the Minister some of the questions which I feel should be attended to during the ensuing year. There is some consternation amongst the people about the position of the Coloured schools in present areas which have been declared European and which have apparently not yet been fully replaced in the Coloured areas to which these people have been moved.</p>

<p>I want to say this to the Minister in regard to his statement about the political rights of the Coloured people that <i>I</i> want him to consider very seriously to see that the Coloured people of the Transvaal, the Orange Free State and Natal are represented in this House by Members of Parliament. I think we should get away from the 1910 complex when the <span class="col_7483_7484" refersTo="page_1074"/>right to have representation in this House was only given to the Coloured people of the Cape. I know the Minister has accepted the principle by giving them representation in the Coloured Council but I do think the time has arrived that they should have direct representation in this House. I shall not take this matter any further in that respect.</p>

<p>Another question I wish to raise is the question of the differentiation in the pension between the Coloureds and the Whites. I think the time has arrived that old-age pensioners and blind pensioners should not receive half of what the White man receives. Talking about pensions, Mr. Chairman, I think it is my duty to pay tribute to a well-known firm in South Africa who have started a pension scheme for their non-White workers. I refer to the report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 4 May 1963 to the effect that Woolworths, a national chain store organization, has joined a small but growing group of South African firms which operate pension schemes for their non-White workers I think we owe a debt of gratitude to Woolworths for having started this scheme. I do hope the Department of Coloured Affairs will find some way of encouraging other firms to start a similar scheme. If this is done then I think there will be some hope for those Coloured people who have served the firms which have employed them faithfully.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with those matters already raised by the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg). I just want to say this in conclusion that during this Session we have had many debates which have indicated the lack of skilled people in South Africa in practically every sphere of our activities. This has been clearly illustrated particularly in the debate on the Apprenticeship Act. I want to say this that there are thousands of educated young Coloured youths who can step into the breach. It should not be necessary for us to have to complain about a shortage of material in commerce and industry and in every other sphere of our activities. We have the material. That is why I say we should rid ourselves of that unfortunate outlook that the Coloureds cannot be integrated with the Whites in every phase of our economic life.</p>

<p>Those were the few points I wanted to raise. I want to place on record that it was only because time did not permit that we did not raise many other aspects. In regard to some of them we are able to congratulate the Minister and his Department and in regard to others we have some criticism to offer. Our silence on these matters must not be construed as acquiescence but merely because we want to honour the agreement as to the time factor of the House.</p>

<p>I do not think that the time for the discussion of this Vote has been inadequate. Nearly 3&#x00BD; hours has been spent on this discussion. My impression of this debate is that it has been a testimonial for the Department of Coloured Affairs, and I thank hon. members for that. I thank the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) in particular for having introduced the debate on a very high level the other evening. I am sorry that he could not be here this afternoon. He told me that he would be unable to attend. I feel that I must make use of this opportunity publicly to thank the officials of the Department of Coloured Affairs and of Community Development and Housing for the goodwill and the devotion with which they are performing a very difficult task in our country. When tributes are paid to these Departments it is to the credit and honour of those officials who are doing more than their duty. I want to thank them publicly in this regard.</p>

<p>There is a second impression that I have gained from this debate, particularly after the speeches of the Coloured Representatives, and that is that we have to guard against one thing. While we appreciate the value of the Coloureds in our economic life and while we appreciate the value of good feelings between the various race groups, we must take care that we do not become so over-sent mental that we only appreciate the worth of the Coloured and not at the same time bear in mind the fact that the survival of the Coloured in South Africa and his safety is absolutely dependent upon the survival of the White man. I think that we must go a little more out of our way when we talk with the Coloureds to make them understand this fact.</p>

<p>I did not mean it in an insulting way. I said that the hon. member was at least a White person and that is why he should agree when I put the attitude of the Whites. I can see nothing wrong in that. But there is a tendency in this House to keep on telling the White man how dependent he is upon the other race groups. I think the time has come for the other race groups to realize what the survival of the Whites in South Africa means for them. I want to say this afternoon that this is the spirit in which I administer these <span class="col_7485_7486" refersTo="page_1075"/>Departments. I administer them in this spirit &#x2014;that the interests of the White must in no way be adversely affected. Only when I have satisfied myself in this regard am I prepared to act justly and fairly in regard to the others. I am not prepared to administer these two Departments by currying favour with the other race groups without always bearing the interests of the White man in South Africa in mind. I want this to be clear in regard to any discussion that may affect the administration of my Departments.</p>

<p>I want to discuss a second principle as well. I want to give this friendly advice to the Coloured Representatives for whom I have great respect for the way in which they are representing the Coloureds here: Do not create the impression on the part of the Coloured people who are to a large extent still a backward people that all they have to do is keep on asking for things. Hon. members have a responsibility towards that backward people and that is to show them their responsibility and to lead them along the road to self-help. One simply cannot go on dispensing charity and telling them that they are being unjustly treated. One will get nowhere in that way; one will not get the best out of them in that way. I know what the reactions are of the Coloureds because I also talk with them. I probably talk with the Coloureds more often than those hon. members do. Their contact with the Coloureds is restricted; I meet the Coloureds throughout the country and I know the effect of talking with them, telling them: &#x201C;You have to show a sense of responsibility; you must help yourselves; you have to help your own people&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I am coming to that; I will reply to the hon. member. I did not interrupt the hon. member while he was speaking; on the contrary, I gave him a chance. I hope that he will remain silent. I say that it will be fatal to suggest to the Coloured people that they are being unjustly treated. The fact is that under this Government the real needs of the Coloured people are being looked after more than ever before in our history. The Estimates that are before us are proof of this fact. Not one single word of criticism could be expressed of these Estimates that have now been before this House for some months. This proves what this Government is doing for the real needs of the Coloureds.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) who cannot be here this afternoon asked a number of questions. If the hon. member had been in this House yesterday evening he would not have asked half of the questions that he did ask. The points that he raised here this morning in a half-hour speech were put to me by the hon. member for South Coast and I gave him a full reply. The hon. member for Peninsula who could not be here the other evening for some or other reason, has now repeated the questions that the hon. member for South Coast put to me. He must not resent the fact that I do not intend to repeat my replies. I will reply to a few fresh points that he raised. He said that there was no co-ordination between the Departments. Let me tell him that there is the closest co-ordination between my Department and the other Departments. Indeed, there is an inter-departmental committee of departmental heads which meets regularly under my chairmanship. If I cannot be present it is under the chairmanship of the senior secretary. In the second place there is consultation with all other Government Departments at departmental head level in regard to each of these matters that are affected. When the Departments cannot agree and when a decision has to be taken in regard to a principle, the Minister takes it up with his colleagues, no matter which Minister it may be. If the hon. member wants to suggest that State Departments simply act on their own without the Ministers knowing anything about those actions, I want to tell him that I am co-responsible for each one of the steps that my colleagues have taken in regard to the Coloureds. I hope that that is an adequate reply to the hon. member. I hope that he realizes now that there is sound co-operation and consultation between the various Departments.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked me about school-feeding. Let me tell him quite frankly and honestly that if I am asked to set up the school-feeding scheme as we have known it up to the present then I must immediately say no. The question of an improved school-feeding scheme has on our request been referred to the National Bureau for Social Research to see whether anything can be done in this connection. Unless a practical scheme that does not result in any wastage, that will not result in any exploitation, can be drawn up, I am not prepared to consider the reestablishment of a rotten system.</p>

<p>In the third place the hon. member asked me about the rights of Coloured teachers. Mr. Chairman, we delegated this matter for a long time a few weeks ago. Now the hon. member has again asked me to state my standpoint publicly. I stated my attitude in this House in regard to every clause in that Bill. I am certainly not going to repeat this afternoon what I stated publicly about five weeks ago. What I said here I said to the Coloured educational leaders who differed from me in regard to the principle of take-over. I met them after that Bill had been passed. They know precisely what my attitude is. There is no doubt on the part of responsible Coloured leaders in regard to this matter. Other matters that he raised dealt with political rights to which I referred specifically the night before last. He can read my speech if he is interested.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Umbilo) (Mr. Oldfield) made a positive contribution to this <span class="col_7487_7488" refersTo="page_1076"/>debate for which I want to thank him. He did at least deal with the matters that are of real importance. I want to tell the hon. member that in the granting of pension rights and welfare services to the Coloureds we must guard against one danger&#x2014;I think that he will agree with me in this regard&#x2014;and that is in the first place the abuse of pensions. After I became Minister I sent a circular to all social welfare officers and all magistrates&#x2019; offices dealing with these matters in which we warned them against certain abuses. I want to mention these abuses this afternoon. In the first place I said that the Department would oppose the misuse of pensions or welfare moneys by persons who did not form part of a family, particularly the workshy type living with pensioners or people receiving grants and thus living on State money. Secondly, I asked them to guard against illegitimate children being left in the care of pensioners and supported by means of State funds, while the parents shirk their responsibilities. Thirdly, I asked them to guard against employers who administer their employees&#x2019; pensions and pay those pensions to their employees together with low wages to create the impression of high wages and by so doing subsidize those low wages by means of State funds. Fourthly, I warned them against the wasting of pension grants on strong liquor. I think that this is an evil that we must guard against, particularly as far as the Coloureds are concerned. In the first place, I asked officials not to make grants available to Coloured women drawing allowances while they are able to work and while their husbands who cannot work because of some disability or other are able to look after the children at home. These are negative aspects but I think that they are in the interests of the Coloureds. There is the question of child care in regard to which I agree with him because it means a saving of manpower. I think that it is a Christian action that must be taken. I am aware of the shortcomings. Although we are already subsidizing certain institutions in Natal and starting a place of safety there, the hon. member must remember that we have a growing Department that cannot provide all these services simultaneously at every place. As we receive the money we will provide these needs. I can assure him of that. We will take note of the problems that he has raised here this afternoon. I will ask the Department to see whether it is possible to make additional services available.</p>

<p>The hon. member said another interesting thing. He spoke about the Coloured children who receive a certain training in school and who then meet with frustration on the labour market. That is precisely one of the reasons why a few weeks ago I introduced the Coloured Persons Education Bill. We want to avoid that frustration. We have the position to-day that we are giving academic training to the Coloureds irrespective of whether they are capable or not. Owing to a lack of differentiated education, we are actually preventing their taking their proper places in our economic life. In that way we are making frustrated beings of them. We hope to be able to eliminate this gradually after Coloured education has been taken over. I agree with the hon. member that it is a real problem. As far as the problem of employment is concerned, I can give him the assurance that my Department goes out of its way through the medium of its regional offices to have these people placed in employment. There is the closest co-operation with the Department of Labour and there is continual consultation. But I also want to take this opportunity to make an appeal to employers. Everything should not be left to the State. Employers also have an obligation, and particularly in the provinces outside of the Cape where we do have established communities, I feel that employers should give a little more attention to the needs of the Coloureds there and see whether they cannot employ the Coloureds more than they have done up to the present.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit), the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) and the hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) made three very interesting speeches and all made positive contributions to this debate. I want to start with the hon. member for Vryburg and I want to make an accusation against the Mafeking town council. He complained here about the conditions in Mafeking. He knows that the Mafeking town council is not in the hands of Nationalists and at the same time he knows that the town council of Vryburg is in the Nationalist hands. He will agree with me that if he looks at the conditions under which the Coloured people of Vryburg are living and compares them with the conditions under which the Coloured people at Mafeking are living, he will not believe that those people are living in the same vicinity. The difference is that the people of Mafeking talk about their goodwill towards the Coloureds and the people of Vryburg show that goodwill. I want to tell the hon. member that through my Departments, particularly the Department of Housing, the Mafeking town council has been asked and directed time and time again to make use of the means at its disposal in the form of State assistance for housing but it has not done anything. I want to give the hon. member notice to-day that if they do not bestir themselves&#x2014;I hope that he will convey this to them&#x2014;we will get them moving; we have the power. The hon. member must discuss the matter with his United Party friends at Mafeking and tell them to bestir themselves because the conditions prevailing there as far as the Coloureds are concerned amount to a public scandal. The same thing holds good for the school. The town council of Vryburg made provision for a decent school building in the heart of its Coloured housing scheme, and if it could do that, the big men of Mafeking can also do something in that respect.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Stellenbosch and the hon. member for Moorreesburg raised interesting <span class="col_7489_7490" refersTo="page_1077"/>points and in connection with Krommerhee I just want to say that as soon as that agricultural gymnasium comes into operation we hope to be able to train between 200 and 300 labourers in agriculture by means of short courses each year. As a start, these courses will be short and as Krommerhee progresses we will prescribe longer courses. If Krommerhee appears to be a success it is my intention to establish similar gymnasiums elsewhere in the Cape. But we must first be sure that Krommerhee is a success. I can give him the assurance that we have the closest co-operation between the Department and the agricultural unions. We also have leaders of the agricultural unions on the advisory committee of Krommerhee.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Moorreesburg raised the question of the high Coloured birth rate. This is a difficult question to discuss publicly because it is so easy for one to be incorrectly interpreted and malicious propagandists can derive a great deal of poison from a matter such as this. But I think that the hon. member has raised this question timeously because it has been brought to my notice through the medium of welfare organizations of Whites who are interested in the welfare of the Coloureds, women&#x2019;s organizations and so forth, that thousands of the Coloured people themselves are very concerned about what is happening in this regard&#x2014;that families are absolutely uncontrolled and that many Coloured men accept no responsibility in regard to those families and that the Coloured women have simply to try to make do by means of State assistance. This is a matter that cannot be rectified by the State alone. But what can happen is that through the medium of proper welfare services&#x2014; I mean welfare services in the sense of proper information and the cultivation of a sense of responsibility towards families&#x2026;</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>That is not something that falls under my control. We are training welfare workers at the moment. For the first time we are creating the opportunity for the training of Coloured welfare workers at the University College of the Western Cape and once we have trained them we will employ them at our regional offices throughout the country. We have these regional offices at most of the large centres in the country and we hope that by means of that information we will also be able to cultivate a sense of responsibility on the part of these people towards their families. I think that a first requirement is that our White welfare organizations in each town and district should take far more interest in the welfare of the Coloured. I think that there is too little interest on the part of the responsible Whites in our towns and districts in respect of these people in instilling into them a sense of responsibility in this regard. We simply cannot continue to pay out children&#x2019;s allowances and pensions. I told the House just now about the requirements that I had laid down in regard to the granting of benefits. I think that we must obtain greater co-operation in order to create this sense of responsibility on the part of these people. I do not want to initiate a debate on the western Cape again but I agree with the hon. member that unless we can effect a proper separation between the Bantu and the Coloured we will create misery in South Africa. That is why I go out of my way as far as residential areas are concerned and in all other spheres to try to effect this separation as soon as possible because it is this Government and this Government only that removed the Coloureds from the Bantu locations in the northern provinces and resettled them in their own communities and by so doing at least restricted this process to a minimum. It is strange to me that our Opposition friends whose official attitude is the acceptance of the Coloureds as an integrated part of the Whites&#x2014;as they put it in their official policy; the virtual absorbing of the Coloured in the life of the White&#x2014; cannot see the fatal danger that they are heading for with their policy by merely continuing to advocate larger and larger numbers of Bantu being allowed into the western Cape. Because if one adopts the attitude that the Opposition adopt, that the Coloureds must gradually be integrated, and one starts at the lowest levels, what will one be doing? Because in the lowest strata of the Coloureds one has miscegenation and intermingling with the Bantu, one will not only be destroying the Coloureds but one will also be making an assault upon the lowest strata of the White people in terms of that policy. One would be following a gradual policy of surrender. From the point of view of the Government and from the point of view of the National Party which is that we want to promote the identity and own characteristics of the Coloureds, it is important that that segregation should be implemented as effectively as possible. That is why, in their communal life, whether in rural housing schemes or in urban schemes, where they can live as a community, we are trying more and more to give the Coloureds their own opportunities in their own post offices and in regard to the other facilities that have to be provided. Now the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) is complaining because we have not advanced sufficiently in order to effect that segregation. But I want to ask him what his standpoint is in connection with this matter. If the hon. member&#x2019;s attitude is the correct one he will not pay so much attention to the minor points but he will make it his aim to have that principle that he is in favour of adopted throughout the country and as soon as possible. I know that the hon. member for Outeniqua holds the same opinion in this regard as the United Party does.</p>

<p>I dealt with the two principles just now. Was the hon. member not listening? That is my answer. There are of course still places in regard to which I feel it is not right for the Bantu and the Coloured to be grouped together. That is not in conformity with our policy but we are moving in a positive direction. However, we are being hampered in moving in this positive direction and stumbling-blocks are being placed in our path by people who reject this principle and who say: No, you can allow the Coloureds to die out amongst the larger numbers of Bantu. They want to allow an assault to be made upon the lowest strata of our White population through the Coloureds.</p>

<p>Yes, but the hon. member is also a supporter of the United Party.</p>

<p>Let me just tell the hon. member for Moorreesburg and the hon. member for Stellenbosch that we have the greatest measure of co-operation to-day of the economic groups on the public committee that has been brought into being in connection with the western Cape problem. On that public committee we have people of divergent political opinions and people who represent different economic interests. That public committee has already met; I have met them already; district committees are being set up; our interdepartmental committee is functioning and we have already received our first reports that are the fruit of that co-operation and those discussions and we hope to submit those reports to the Cabinet shortly. In other words, we have the necessary co-operation and consultation amongst people who do not hold the same political views as the Government as far as economic interest are concerned. Farming interests are represented and industry is unofficially represented. We have ensured that the various sectors are represented on that public committee. The spirit on that public committee is very good indeed and I have only the highest regard for people who may differ from us politically but who in connection with this matter are prepared to give us their advice and assistance in order to give effect to the policy of the Government in this regard as far as possible. We are making progress. I believe that unless we deal swiftly with this problem of the western Cape, we will be creating misery for our future generations and particularly for the Coloureds in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore)&#x2014;if I misunderstood him I hope that he will tell me&#x2014;said that in his opinion the training of B.Sc. students, students who have got their degrees and who are now teaching, was tragic.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that after having accepted the fact that I did raise certain anomalies in connection with our daily treatment of and attitude towards the Coloureds, the hon. the Minister tried to evade the issue and to drag politics into the discussion by talking about a United Party attitude. I adhere to my statement that I am a representative of the Coloureds and that I speak for the people whom I represent. One finds oneself in this unenviable position that when the hon. the Minister wants to dispose of an argument&#x2014;I give him credit for his political Ingenuity&#x2014;he drags politics into the discussion and simply says that it is a United Party attitude, and that is the end of the story. But since I as a Coloured representative have to put the case of 1,500,000 people, all of whom are covered by the Coloured Affairs Vote, I find myself in the position that I have to negotiate with the Opposition whips for more time and that I am simply told that the time is limited. I thus find myself between two fires. I adhere to my statement that I represent the Coloureds here and when I adopt an attitude I do so on behalf of the people whom I represent, irrespective of the political parties that exist. I want to add that no political party exists in South Africa to-day that is representative of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>It is my view that in referring to the Coloureds, one can hardly omit to point out that at the moment there is no political party representing the Coloureds here. I want to make it clear that we on these benches in no way deny that this Government has done a very great deal for the Coloureds. I would be neglecting my duty if I did not say that as far as essential matters such as housing and education and the resettlement of Coloureds are concerned, this Government has done more than any previous Government in recent years. I want to add that the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs is a capable and energetic Minister. But the hon. the Minister is head of a family, the head of his own home&#x2014;I do not mean this personally in any way&#x2014;and the head of any household will agree with me that the wellbeing of a household does not only depend upon the material things that are made available in that home; it does not merely depend on the toys which the children receive and the food that they receive and the nice clothes that they wear. If one does not have mutual trust and understanding and love in a home there will be no happiness in that home. The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) referred to the attitude of the Coloured representatives in regard to the Department of Coloured Affairs. I want to say here that it would be stupid for us to discourage our people from operating through that Department because the Department is the only body to whom they can look for assistance. As far as I am concerned I encourage my people to make use of everything that is given to them by the Department in regard to the university college and in regard to possibilities in the economic sphere. But that is not all that counts. I have confined myself to-day to the feeling that exists towards our Coloured fellow-citizens and to the question as to how far we as Whites have gone in our efforts to convince the Coloureds that we have accepted them as fellow-citizens who have a common allegiance, people who feel that they have something that they do not want to lose at any price. We have made mistakes, although a great deal has been done for the Coloureds. I want to point out in all sincerity that in 1948 this Government came into power on the political basis of apartheid. The Government kept its word and placed on the Statute Book certain measures that were in conformity with its policy of apartheid. But has the time not come for us to think of starting to remove some of these measures which have become obsolete and unnecessary and which are also offensive to the people to whom they apply? The Government will not lose any status by doing so but will win the goodwill of the people with whom we have to deal.</p>

<p>That hon. member has been a member of this House for 20 years and he ought to know. In the short time still left to me I want to deal with another matter. Mention has been made of pensions for Coloureds. The 12:6:5 ratio as far as pensions are concerned has been more or less restored but I think that the time has come for us to realize that the cost of living of the Coloured is certainly not half of that of the White man and I want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister and his Department to go into the matter and to see whether any relief can be given in that respect. I also want to bring another definite matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister, and that is, the manner in which district medical officers in certain districts treat Coloured pensioners drawing disability pensions. Last year I brought a man to the office of the Deputy Secretary, a man with an open wound in his foot. People in the office who saw it felt ill. But the district medical officer in that town declared that man to be &#x201C;fit for work&#x201D;. There are numbers of examples of this kind and I feel that district medical officers ought to be a little more careful. No opportunities for sheltered employment exist in the rural areas.</p>

<p>I understand that, but the fact remains that it is the Minister&#x2019;s Department that has to take action as far as pensions are concerned when it receives these reports from the district medical officers. The hon. the Minister spoke about inter-departmental liaison and that is why I want to bring this matter to his attention. I want to ask him to put in a word there for the Coloureds which will carry more weight than mine.</p>

<p>There is one other matter that I want to bring to his attention. At the moment there are welfare organizations which are investigating the possibility of establishing an institution for cerebral palsied children at Durban, an institution that will also serve the northern part of my constituency, an institution for handicapped children. This is something that means a great deal to me. Thank God for the development that has already taken place, but I know of a child who could possibly be admitted to that institution, a child who is helpless, and I hope that when I give the facts and statistics to the hon. the Minister this case will receive special attention. That institution is very necessary at the moment. All the plans are ready. The Department of Indian Affairs and Bantu Administration and Development have agreed to provide clinical facilities there.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of community development which I want to raise with the hon. Minister. The first one is on the question of group areas. Some considerable time ago, we had an accumulation of hearings and very few decisions, and I would like to cite one specific instance of this, although I think there are many others, because many other cases have been brought to my attention. However, I think if I quote to the hon. Minister the determination for Isipingo, he will probably find a number of cases on all fours with this particular case. In the latter part of 1961, a hearing was held at Isipingo, and it included both the rail and beach areas, and the chairman at that hearing gave the undertaking at the meeting that a determination would be given within three months.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>Was that Isipingo Rail?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>It covered Isipingo Rail and Isipingo Beach, but the hearing was for the Isipingo Beach area. There was a little complication in connection with the Rail although evidence was led in respect of both areas. The undertaking was given that a determination would be arrived at within a period of three months. It is going on between 18 months and two years now and no determination has been published. On 12 September 1962 I had a letter from the hon. Minister in which he said that he was now going to draw up an annual list of priorities regarding the planning, proclamation and development of group areas. I would like to know from the hon. Minister, among other things, how successful that priority list has been and if it has in fact cut down the list of outstanding proclamations? You see, Sir, to me it seems so foolish that one should hold a large series of hearings in areas, upset the economy and the whole balance, especially in these smaller places, and then leave it in a state of confusion like that for a period of some two years, in some cases I believe even longer. Surely the hon. Minister could plan more intelligently and when he is ready to go into the case of a particular area in full, to have the hearing and get on with the job, give a decision and disrupt the life of that community as little as possible. That seems to me a far better way than to just conduct a large series of hearings and then find that the evidence which has been collected cannot be processed, cannot be handled by his Department so that a state of confusion and chaos exists until such time as it all can be sorted out and something done about it. Here in this particular area the confusion has been greater because, as you know, a new oil refinery has been established in that area. The people who are going to work at that refinery are going to use this area as a dormitory, and what is happening? People are afraid to build houses and to provide accommodation, and generally speaking, chaotic conditions have been created in this small area. Just imagine what the effect would be in a bigger area! I would like the Minister to take notice of this. I quote only this particular case. I can quote others, but I do not want to take up the time of the House. I believe that where the Minister has hearings, better planning must take place to do away with all the confusion and chaos into which these areas are thrown pending the publication of the proclamation. Everybody makes up his mind as to what will happen and you hear 10 or 12 different rumours in regard to the decisions to be made.</p>

<p>The other point I want to come to is the question of proclamations&#x2014;mostly in the small country towns. I have a cutting here about a proclamation in Bethal. I am paying particular attention at the moment to the Indian community there, because they are the ones mostly affected, and secondly, because it seems from the debate which took place on another Vote that the Minister of Indian Affairs is not going to be much help to these Indians, and that it will be little use appealing to him for aid. In certain of these cases the local authority in the smaller country towns is accepting delegated powers from the Minister&#x2019;s Department, to carry out the determinations of the board, and from evidence I have &#x2014;and I should like the Minister to have this investigated more thoroughly, because I have not the opportunity to do so&#x2014;it would appear that this is not going to be a good thing. It might be all right for the Minister to delegate his powers to the larger local authorities, but from the evidence I have it would appear that it will be a very bad thing indeed in the case of the smaller towns. I have had evidence in regard to one of these small towns that as soon as the proclamation was published the local authority accepted the delegated power to carry out the determination, and immediately a group of people got together and like vultures over a carcass, they are seeking out the spoils. I think that is a very bad thing, and I do not think the Minister should allow it to happen. I think if he is going to proclaim group areas in the areas of these small local authorities, he must not pass the buck; he must assume responsibility for the proper carrying out of the determination. Where he hands it over to a local authority he must ensure that there is adequate supervision over the carrying out of the proclamation and that everyone will receive a fair deal.</p>

<p><span class="col_7497_7498" refersTo="page_1081"/>The next thing I want to mention in regard to the same thing is this. What steps does the Minister take to satisfy himself that these small communities&#x2014;in Bethal there are 365 Indians&#x2014;can in fact still exist when he removes them from the areas in which they have been for a long time? In this case they have been living in that area since 1885. What steps does the Minister take to ensure that they will make a living in the new area? In Durban we have the same problem and I was very shocked to see a report in a Durban paper on 4 June that it is now possible that all the Indians will be removed from the city of Durban to some place north of Durban.</p>

If it is not true, the Minister can say so, but if it is true I would like the Minister to cast his mind back to the evidence that was given on the zoning of Cato Manor. A statement was made that 93 per cent of the Indians living in Durban are living below the breadline. Whether that is correct or not I do not know, but if such a large percentage is living below the breadline when the Indians are allowed to trade within the city of Durban, what will happen if they are moved out of Durban?

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">W. C. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>The fact that the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) raised only a few minor local matters is to my mind the biggest compliment to this young new Department that came into being less than two years ago. In that time it has achieved so much that I feel I must extend my hearty congratulations to the hon. the Minister and the Department on what they have done in this short time. This Department has actually taken the lead in the world to-day. In our present-day world more and more emphasis is being placed on community planning and community development. It so happens that our policy of separate development is the one factor which is responsible for the fact that we have made so much progress with this idea of community development. It was our particular circumstances in this country that gave rise to the establishment of that Department. When we look at what is going on in America to-day, where there has been no planning in regard to the various races, and consider the large-scale race disturbances which are taking place there because the necessary planning has not been done, we can only be grateful to the Government for having established this Department about two years ago. When we look at the report submitted by the Secretary for the Department, we are proud that we have such an active young Minister and such an energetic Department and that they have been able to produce a report of this nature in less than two years. They have, of course, been feeling their way. Originally we had the Group Areas Board and thereafter the Group Areas Development Board that had to give effect to the idea of separate development. But now those various boards are consolidated under this one Department. It is obvious that a great deal of attention is being given to the planning of group areas for the non-White groups by this Department because those groups need more assistance and attention but it is certainly not the only task of that Department to plan for the non-Whites alone. Where necessary, careful attention is also given to the planning and development of areas for settlement by Whites. This Department prevents the unplanned development to which the hon. member for Umlazi referred. I admit that difficulties still exist because the Department is not yet two years old, but I want to give the hon. member the assurance that those difficulties will very soon be eliminated.</p>

<p>In regard to this question of a new township for Indians to the north of Durban, I am sure that it is not intended for all the Indians at Durban but only for a group of them. However, I do not want to discuss this matter any further. I want to return to the policy of this Department, a policy which is not merely to build residential areas but to guide developing towns, cities and rural communities in their development. I want to point out that this Department will have a very important task in connection with the great Orange River plan that lies ahead of us. That is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister, in regard to the Orange River plan, to ensure that he and his Department have the necessary powers to guide that development along the right lines, as far as the settlement of the various <span class="col_7499_7500" refersTo="page_1082"/>communities is concerned. If we do not make use of this opportunity we may possibly have chaos and that is why I want to ask the hon. the Minister to insist that the necessary powers be given to him and his Department to undertake the necessary community planning under those schemes so that they will also be able to provide for orderly planning in this regard.</p>

<p>I want to express my heartfelt gratitude once again to this Minister and his young Department for the very good work that they have done in less than two years, and I want to express the hope and faith that they will go from strength to strength to make an orderly, planned community of South Africa. We need this Department very much indeed, particularly in view of our special circumstances, so that we can obviate race disturbances such as those taking place in America to-day. I firmly believe that with orderly planning we will not be faced with those difficulties.</p>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to agree with the hon. member for Paarl (Mr. W. C. Malan) that the hon. the Minister of Community Development, this young and energetic Minister, has a wonderful opportunity, because the very nature and the name of his Department are a challenge to develop the various communities which make up the South African population and which makes all of South Africa a picturesque and interesting country. But I want to put to the Minister the case of one community in particular, a community which, at the moment has no vote in this House and in regard to whom we must apply principles of justice and fair play and humanity. I refer to the Indian community, and especially to the Indian community of the Transvaal, the province from which I have the honour to come. More particularly, I refer to the 22,000 Indians in Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Now these Indians in Johannesburg have recently been hard hit by the application of the Group Areas Act. No fewer than 200 of them, I am told, had to give up their businesses in Sophiatown; 31 businesses in Martindale had to close down. But the most recent announcement in May this year that the suburb of Pageview, part of Vrededorp, has been declared a White group area, has come as a shock to the whole community of Johannesburg. Pageview is an old Asiatic location, where it is estimated that about 5,000 of Johannesburg&#x2019;s 22,000 Indians live and are in business. The proclamation must have tragic results for these 5,000 people who are now expected to move to Lenasia more than 20 miles away on the Potchefstroom Road and who are also expected to close their businesses in Pageview. This removal must have disastrous effects of the businesses of those Indians who are mostly traders and are therefore dependent for their livelihood on the greater community of Johannesburg. They cannot possibly continue their traditional occupations if they are to be completely dependent on themselves, separated from the mainstream of economic life in Johannesburg, of which they are an inseparable part by tradition. These Indians have been traders and have been active in the Transvaal since 1881. They got the special protection of the old Republican Government and of President Kruger. But now we find that they are asked to isolate themselves from the mainstream of life in the City of Johannesburg, and in the Transvaal for that matter. This cruel action by the Government contradicts recent statements by various authorities, including the Prime Minister, that all hope of repatriating the Indian community has been abandoned and that the South African Indians are now accepted as a permanent part of our population. I tend to believe that when repatriation was still actively considered by the Government as a possible solution to the Indian problem, the vicious administration of the Group Areas Act was regarded as a means of compelling Indians to leave South Africa by making their lives intolerable here. One cannot understand that the Government wishes to continue creating intolerable conditions for people whom they now accept as a permanent part of the population. We on this side of the House wish to repeat that although we can see virtue in the establishment of separate residential areas for the various races, especially while race relations remain such a vexed problem in our multi-racial country as they are to-day, we believe that the establishment of such separate residential areas should be subject to two prime conditions. The first is that the area should be established in such a manner and should be of such a nature that the separation will tend to take place voluntarily. The emphasis should be on separation by the creation of separate attractive establishments, rather than by compulsion. Secondly, we believe that this process of separation should in no way interfere with the traditional way in which people prefer to earn their livelihood, and should not destroy the assets which people have built up over generations through service to the community. It is a form of spoliation to which no Government should lend the resources of the state. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity of telling the House how he sees the future in South Africa of the Indian community, who are now no longer regarded by the Government as foreigners and interlopers who have to be repatriated and got rid of, but who are now accepted as a permanent part of the population. Where do they fit into the pattern of South Africa? I think we cannot continue with the attitude that these people have to be degraded and deprived of their traditional ways of earning their livelihood.</p>

We have heard repeatedly that the Indian population should become more versatile in the occupations they follow, and they should not all be traders or servants in the catering business. But I would like hon. members opposite to tell us, if the Indian people are not to be traders or waiters or domestic servants, what are they to do?</p>

<p>What other employment? There are a number of traditional colour bars and job reservation determinations which limit their opportunities for employment.

On what principle of justice can that be done? Who are we to say to any community: You may not follow this calling, but you must do this? The mere fact that we usurp to ourselves this semi-divine right is a degradation of that community. But I do not want to start such an argument. I want to appeal to the Minister who, as I said at the outset, is a man with tremendous opportunities for good in the life of South Africa, to do what his colleague, the Minister of Indian Affairs, so miserably failed to do, and to take us into the confidence of the Government and to tell us what the Indians&#x2019; future role and status will be, and what opportunities there will be, for this newly accepted permanent part of our population, the Indians.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) gives me the impression that in the absence of the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) he is trying to get a lead as to what the United Party should say in connection with the Indians because they no longer have a policy. I think the matters raised here by him in connection with the Indians and the way in which the Indians have to fit into the South African life do not fall so much under this Minister. We have had the statements by the hon. the Prime Minister and by the Minister of Indian Affairs during this sitting and I think if the hon. member for Yeoville wanted to do justice to the discussion of this Vote there are many matters which he could appropriately have raised.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but to pose the question where the Indians really fit into the South African life has not only got to do with group areas.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Paarl, namely, that we are very grateful for the report issued by this Department. It puts the position very clearly and it shows how effectively the Department functions. What I regard as very important in the second place is this that it is clear that the activities of this Department have brought it right up against the whole problem of town planning. I think we have to be realistic. It is true that the report refers to the friendly co-operation between the Department and the local authorities but we must realize that those negotiations were conducted with great difficulty and that it must obviously have been very frustrating to the Department in this difficult task it has had to fulfil, to have had to deal with a multitude of organizations whose approval it had to obtain. I believe that where this is the first report we have received, it will become clear in future that the Department of Community Development will have more and more to do with the whole problem of city-building, and I use the word &#x201C;city-building&#x201D; deliberately as the equivalent of &#x201C;town planning&#x201D;, because I think &#x201C;town planning&#x201D; is an artificial word which does not really convey what it ought to. I think community development cannot be separated from city-building and in order to fulfil its functions effectively this Department will have to concern itself more and more with city-building. As far as I am concerned, nothing will give me more satisfaction than the knowledge that a State Department is actively engaged in town planning. As a matter of fact, we city dwellers would like to regard the Department of Community Development as the farmers regard the Department of Agriculture, a Department which concerns itself with the whole problem of our city life, of smog and noise and traffic jams to congestion and the changing of the city. We are only at the commencing stages of industrialization and in every industrialized country the problem which the cities present is probably one of the greatest problems. I am not exaggerating when I say that. I have here a quotation of what was said by Professor Penn of the University of Winscon-sin last year. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the United States to-day we may fairly say that community land use planning, i.e. zoning, local government, etc., is a public policy matter second only to international relations.</block>

<p>That is how seriously they view the matter in America where they have reached a much further stage of industrialization. We in South Africa only had a glimpse of the scope of this problem last year when an investigation was conducted in Cape Town by Justice Diamond when he drew attention to the serious defects in our town planning which have led to serious malpractices. It is a pity that those things have happened because town planning is a recent technique. It is something which <span class="col_7503_7504" refersTo="page_1084"/>has developed in the &#x2019;thirties and anything of the nature which has happened here in Cape Town can only lead to the public distrusting town planning and to regard it as a technique whereby certain people can benefit themselves at the expense of the whole community. It is not only here in Cape Town, where we have had a glimpse of the whole position, where this is happening. It is happening all over the country. Look at any city in South Africa and whether or not they have a planning scheme hardly makes any difference. You find congestion, obsolescence, deterioration and what one might call a conglomeration everywhere. The objectives of town planning ordinances, namely the promotion of safety, order, convenience and general welfare, are indeed strived at but they obviously have a tendency of always evading the planning authorities. There is a tremendous amount to be learnt in this process and that is why it is such a pity that things have happened which, have aroused distrust in this technique. I think there are two things which we shall definitely have to face up to as we go along and that is that as far as town planning is concerned the relationship between the State and the provinces will have to be revised; that the powers in connection with town planning which were handed over to the provinces in 1927 by way of financial regulations will have to be reviewed because in those days we were only starting with town planning and since then there have been developments in this country which have made it necessary for us to revise the whole system. One of the aspects to which I want to refer hurriedly is the fact that we have handed these powers in connection with town planning to the provinces but that we omitted to make the necessary financial arrangements at the same time so that the towns and cities could be properly planned. A city council or a local authority which introduces a planning scheme lays itself open to claims for compensation and they lack the means to pay those claims. They consequently plan with a view to avoiding payment of compensation rather than to lay down requirements beforehand. As our cities grow we shall always, as they did in other countries, come up against the problem of the obsolescence of our cities, against the problem of city rebuilding which we shall never be able to tackle in South Africa unless the financial relations between the State and the provinces are completely revised. A commission is at the moment investigating the position and I hope they will go into this question. There is, for example, a person like Mr. Fraay of Unit Securities who wrote about this matter last year in his chairman&#x2019;s address. He is the chairman of a company which is interested in many of these urban developments. He suggested that a large number of our South African towns should be re-planned and that blocks of flats should be limited to a minimum height of four stores in order to put an end to the present position where large sections of our White population are crowded together in blocks of flats without sufficient space and to put an end to the exorbitant land prices which have come about as a result of the present limitation on areas destined for blocks of flats. That was only one instance to which I wanted to refer hurriedly but there are a tremendous number of problems connected with this matter. In the past the Central Government has completely dissociated itself with this problem. I think the new Department which has been established should really be the place where co-ordination and research should take place and where information and knowledge should be collected and which will provide the whole country, not only the provinces, but the whole country on a national basis, with certain standards founded on a scientific basis and that planning techniques should not more often than not like to-day, just bear the stamp of the arbitrary whims of the authorities in one province to the other province and from one city to the other city. Mr. Chairman, that is all I have to say. I hope in the days that lie ahead the Minister, with the study which his Department is conducting, will succeed in giving us a directive at this stage already. I also hope in particular that we shall have the heartiest cooperation of the provinces and the local authorities. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I do not wish to follow the hon. member in regard to urban planning because the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s responsibilities go much further than that. The Minister in fact is a key cog in the overall machine which is responsible for partitioning South Africa into watertight racial groups, and in that capacity he carries a tremendous power for good or evil affecting the lives of tens and hundreds of thousands of people. I want to join the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) in appealing to the Minister to do all in his power to eliminate delays in deciding issues of this nature. The Minister shakes his head. I know that he says that it takes a long time and that he blames the Provincial Administration and the city councils but the Minister is the responsible Minister and he must be aware of the tremendous hardship which is occasioned. Let me give him just one example. I wrote to the hon. the Minister on 22 October last year in regard to a particular problem where a person was going overseas and wanted to sell a property and did not know to what race he could sell it. The matter was referred at the time to the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development because it was stated in the reply from the Minister of Community Development that the area had been earmarked for some possible future extension of Kwa Mashu. That was in October last year. Last week I was finally advised by the Minister of Bantu Administration that it had now been decided that that particular property had now been earmarked for Indian occupation and not for Bantu occupation. I will give the hon. the Minister the name; I refer to the farm Richmond 846. After some eight months the owner of the ground is now able to do something about it, but for eight months he had not <span class="col_7505_7506" refersTo="page_1085"/>been able to sell his property. He has gone overseas; he has had to pay rates and taxes. No White man will buy it because it is obviously earmarked for one or other non-European group, and only last week I was advised that it has now been earmarked for Indian occupation. I quote this as one example out of many to indicate the tremendous hardships which can be brought about by delays in finalizing the problems. I hope the hon. the Minister will now be able to give me some reply in regard to the question, which I discussed with him, of life-saving facilities for the Indian beach in Durban, a matter of tremendous importance to the residents of the area concerned, but one of these matters which also has dragged on month after month and year after year. These issues are issues which, because they involve a mass of paper work, take a long time to settle, but while they are being settled the lives, the habits, the comforts and the recreation and enjoyment of people are affected. I think the importance of disposing of these matters expeditiously is not fully appreciated. Some official has a file placed before him and he says, &#x201C;oh well, this must be dealt with,&#x201D; and he then puts it into a &#x201C;pending&#x201D; tray or an &#x201C;attention&#x201D; tray; he thinks that a month or two or six months will not matter. Sir, it does matter to human beings. I would therefore add my plea to that of the hon. member for Umlazi.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with one other specific point. In February of this year the hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. H. J. Botha) gave an undertaking to his constituents that the magisterial district of Matatiele was and would remain a White area, and in fact he included Mt. Currie in that undertaking, but he warned those areas not to consider the question of amalgamation with Natal because he said (and I quote his words) &#x201C;if East Griqualand joins Natal I wonder if the Government would be prepared still to safeguard its White future.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That statement was made by the hon. member for Aliwal. That matter is under discussion this week by groups of people there and there is concern about that question and about the question of borders, etc.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>My point is that if this area was and is to be guaranteed for White and Coloured occupation, then this Minister, occupying the portfolio that he does, has the necessary machinery for making such a declaration, and he is not using that machinery to give any security or guarantee of occupation to the White or Coloured races. For instance, let me mention that as the result of this insecurity, in the district of Matatiele the transfers of farms sold by private treaty have dropped from 37 in 1953 to 10 per annum in 1962. In the Mt. Currie district they have dropped from 64 per annum to 16 per annum in the last 10 years, and that is the position because there is this insecurity. People do not know what their future is, and if you look at the map of that area you realize why people have that feeling of insecurity. I have here the speech of the chairman of the East Griqualand Farmers&#x2019; Association at the congress held on Wednesday this week, in which he dealt with this position. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Historically we have been areas of varying fortunes from no-man&#x2019;s-land to part of the Cape.</block>

<p>This Minister is the Minister who shares the responsibility for the partitioning up of South Africa into racial areas. He could, at least in the towns with which he is dealing at this stage, give the security of Group Area proclamation to indicate that these are to be areas for White and Coloured occupation. But in the meantime, in Matatiele for instance, they do not even fall under the Department of Justice for judicial purposes; they fall under the Department of Bantu Administration. Appeals have been made but nothing has been done about it. Sir, the indication is that there is a danger that they may not be declared White areas because of the overriding responsibility in judicial affairs of the Department of Bantu Administration. This same chairman of the congress said that representations had been made to have the White area of the Matatiele district transferred from the Department of Bantu Administration to the Department of Justice as has been done with the Mt. Currie district but a reply is still awaited. In other words, the fear is there, the insecurity is there, and this Minister is the Minister who can help to eliminate that insecurity, but he has not used the machinery at his command to give the security for which the people in those areas ask. I would ask him personally therefore to indicate that it is part of his overall planning to regard these areas as areas for White occupation and White ownership and to repudiate the warning given by the hon. member for Aliwal on 12 February this year that any request to be transferred to Natal would endanger the White status of those areas. The Minister is concerned because in Kokstad there are many non-Europeans. In that whole district there are Coloureds, and the Minister himself has a responsibility in this matter. I <span class="col_7507_7508" refersTo="page_1086"/>want him to make it clear that that was merely a political statement without foundation, that it was not a threat and that he is in fact dealing with this question of granting security to this important area, Matatiele and Mt. Currie. I hope the Minister will deal with this matter in his reply.</p>

<p>In view of the limited time at our disposal I want to rise immediately to reply to a few of the points which have been raised here. A few of the matters which have been raised by hon. members of the Opposition are matters which to a large extent have been misrepresented in the Press over the past week and I think that it is time the position was clarified.</p>

<p>With regard to the matter raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) in regard to the Durban City Council&#x2019;s difficulty at the beach, I want to say to him that I will write to him personally and let him have all the relevant information in due course, but I am not in a position to reply to him to-day. As far as Matatiele and Mt. Currie and the other districts to which he referred are concerned, he must have this matter out with the hon. member for Aliwal (Mr. H. J. Botha) about the future of those areas. All I can tell him is that those areas are controlled areas under the Group Areas Act, and when we come to them, we will deal with them in the same way as we dealt with other towns and cities.</p>

<p>I can only say that an investigation will have to be instituted at those towns by the Group Areas Board, and eventually the board will report to me whether it is necessary to proclaim Coloured and White residential areas.

<p>Because if they had read the Report they would have seen that paragraph 30 of the Report gives a resum&#x00E9; of the progress that has been made in the planning and the proclamation of group areas. They would also have seen that surprising progress has been made over the past few years as far as the rate at which proclamations are made is concerned because we have this effective machinery to-day. Let me quote from the Annual Report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From 1 April 1959 to 31 July 1961 189 group areas and 68 centres were proclaimed, and from 1 August 1961 to 31 December 1962 116 group areas and 48 centres were proclaimed.</block>

<p>This indicates the rate at which group areas are being proclaimed. But what is my difficulty?</p>

<p>I hope the hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) will help me; I hope that after the prorogation of Parliament he will go back to Natal and have a talk to the Executive Committee there. I am going to give him the information to-day. I am in the same position as he is as far as Isipingo is concerned. The report in regard to Isipingo was submitted to the Executive Committee on 14 May 1962 and since then I have not heard a word about it. I wrote to them, I spoke to them personally over the telephone and I sent telegrams to them and yet they sit on the matter.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>No, the Administrator can only act under the Group Areas Act together with his Executive Committee and I accuse the Executive Committee of Natal of purposely trying to obstruct me in the execution of this task. Sir, I want to give the Committee another example. The plans with regard to Durban Central were submitted to the Executive <span class="col_7509_7510" refersTo="page_1087"/>Committee on 10 May 1962. Grey Street was submitted to them at the same time. Cato Manor was submitted to them a couple of months ago and I cannot get anything out of them, and yet when I introduced the measure I was accused in this House of overriding the powers of the provincial authorities and of taking all the powers into my hands to do whatever I like without consulting the provincial authorities. The legal position is that before I can make any decision on a report of the Group Areas Board, that report has to go to the Administrator and the Executive Committee, and I can only deal with it after I have received their report. If the hon. member wishes to complain I would like him to complain to the Executive Committee and to help me to wake up those people in Natal. The same applies to another part of the administration of the Department of Community Development and that is the establishment of local authorities for Coloureds and Indians. I said to the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) the other night that the other three provinces, namely the Free State the Cape and the Transvaal, had already come to a decision in this matter, that they had already drafted and passed their ordinances and that together with my Department they were actively busy with the establishment of local authorities. Natal, however, has not moved one inch in this matter. I cannot get any promise from them that they are going to act. Sir, I wish to say, and I say it deliberately, that unless Natal gets a move on before 1 September I shall use the machinery of the Department of Community Development to establish those local authorities. I shall give them time until 1 September. They will have ample time therefore to tell me what they are prepared to do, and unless they do so before 1 September they must not complain if I exercise the powers vested in me under the Group Areas Act to establish those local authorities.</p>

<block name="quote">What are the factors contributing to this state of affairs under which the Indian readily accepts this policy of segregation of his own free will?</block>

<p><span class="col_7511_7512" refersTo="page_1088"/>There are three factors that are creating this unsavoury situation: (1) the exorbitant rents and goodwills Indians have to pay in flats and dwellings; (2) the attractively low monthly instalments that the City Council asks for its houses in the various housing schemes; (3) the uncertainties experienced by the Indians under the Group Areas Act, but the most vicious evil that is forcing Indians to accept the housing schemes is their exploitation by Indian landlords.</p>

<p>*I want to say here this afternoon that most of the opposition to the Group Areas Act and most of the gossip that appears in the Press in regard to the oppressive measures comes from these property owners who exploit their own poor Indians.

<p>No, I do not say that the hon. member for Durban (Point) does. But I am going to quote here from an article which appeared in one of our leading papers a couple of nights ago, on 4 June, an article written by a former editor of one of our biggest English newspapers in South Africa. I refer to Mr. Horace Flather. In this article he refers to the Bantu Laws Amendment Bill and to its poisonous effect; I am not going to deal with that. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">At the very moment when this Bill&#x2019;s provisions are seeping like poison into the minds and hearts of the urban Bantu out comes the news that in the Transvaal whole communities of Indians are to be arbitrarily extruded from areas where they have lived harmlessly and peacefully for generations and thrust into the outer darkness.</block>

<p>I say that responsible newspapers give prominence to this sort of contemptible thing in South Africa and then we wonder why this libelling of our country affects us so adversely. I am sorry, but I had to refer to this case. This man was the editor of a leading newspaper and his methods are being followed by other newspapers. I want to make this point. In the first place, these people write these articles knowing that what they say is untrue. I will invite this Mr. Flather&#x2014;I want to invite him publicly to-day&#x2014;to come to my Department. There I shall show him the areas from which we are removing these Indians and the areas in which we are resettling them. If he still has the slightest respect for the truth, he then will withdraw these words. But he will not come; he will not investigate the position; he will use these words to his own shame and to the detriment of his country and he will not make sure of his facts.</p>

<p>The second point that I want to make is that these people play into the hands of the exploiters, the people who exploit and destroy the poor Indians. These Indians come to our Department for help. I want to refer briefly to the objections of the hon. members for Umlazi and Yeoville in regard to certain specific matters. The case of Page View has been mentioned here. Mr. Chairman, do you know what happened in Page View? I want the hon. member for Yeoville to listen to this. Does the hon. member know that in 1956, that is to say, seven years ago, Page View was proclaimed a future White area under the Group Areas Act? The Johannesburg City Council has known all this time what has been planned for this area. It was not finally proclaimed a group area for the very reason we wanted to have time to make proper arrangements for the future; we did not want to uproot these people suddenly. The Johannesburg City Council knew this. The Johannesburg City Council owns a great deal of property in Page View. It is actually farming with slums there.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>That is a shameful thing to say.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_community_development">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</person>:</from>

<p>It is true. The Johannesburg City Council is farming with slums. I want to give you the figures, Mr. Chairman. There are 4,119 Indians, 59 Chinese and 1,346 Coloureds resident in Page View, of whom 2,496 Asiatics and 1,162 Coloureds live in slums. Now that Page View has been finally declared to be a group area, after they have known for seven years what we have had in mind with Page View, a great fuss is being made in the Press. I say this afternoon that action will be taken in regard to Page View under the Slums Act and under the Group Areas Act. I want to tell the House what action will be taken. In the first place the Act provides that the people will not be removed until removal notices have been served on them. Those removal notices are not usually served until a year after the proclamation has been issued. In other words, another year still has to elapse. This has now been going on for eight years. The Act provides further that at least three months&#x2019; notice in the case of residential occupation and 12 months&#x2019; notice in the case of businesses has to be given before those people can be compelled to move. In regard to residential properties, these people have known the position for eight years now and in regard to businesses they have known the position for nine years. Then there are areas like Fordsburg, in regard to which, as hon. members know, we have already stated publicly that the dealers who have to be uprooted will be resettled under permit. We are not forcing all these various Indian dealers into their proclaimed area. Hon. members <span class="col_7513_7514" refersTo="page_1089"/>know further that the Act provides that where hardship can be proved, an exception may be made in favour of such a person by way of permit. Furthermore, hon. members know that I made a statement in this House last year. I stand unreservedly by the statement that appeared in Hansard of 14 June 1962. The hon. member can write down the reference and read what I said. In terms of that statement we are giving preference to residential removal; we have various ways in which we resort to the resettlement of communities according to the circumstances in every town or city, and we will not disrupt business interests to such an extent that these people will lose their means of livelihood as a result of our actions.</p>

<p>This brings me to Bethal. A report appeared in the Press on Bethal. I am certain that those reports were sent overseas and that they adversely affect South Africa. What is the position in Bethal? The position is not as stated in that Press report&#x2014;that those people are being thrown out without any means of livelihood. The facts are as follows: The distance between that area and the Bethal city hall is one mile. This is just by way of example. The second point is that in the area to which that residential area is being moved there will eventually be 4,000 Whites and more than 8,000 Bantu, representing a potential purchasing power. I said in my statement last year that the Government had no control over clientele. Cannot we come to our senses in South Africa? Cannot we stop sending this sort of report out into the world, reports which suggest that we are treating these people mercilessly and cruelly? Is it in vain that I make an appeal to the Opposition to assist me, since all of us want certainty in regard to group areas, to put and end to these stories that are being broadcast to the world? I do not think it is asking too much.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked me to give an explanation in regard to the future of the Indians. My hon. colleague gave a very clear explanation the other day. He told the House that in regard to the Indians we were moving along the same lines as in the case of the Coloureds. We must have these people settled in urban communities if we want to assure them of a decent livelihood. We must have proclamations if we want to ensure that they have occupation and property rights. Unless we are prepared to perform that task we must be prepared, like the Johannesburg City Council, to farm with slums.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Innesdal (Mr. J. A. Marais), and the hon. member for Paarl expressed very kind sentiments with regard to the Department and I thank them for what they said. I may just remark in this connection that during the recess, as they know, a thorough investigation will be made into the question of physical planning, the settlement of communities and also in regard to what we can do to restrict to a minimum the great deal of duplication of work that we have in South Africa as far as planning is concerned. I believe that the Department of Community Development will have to take an active part in this regard. I want to give hon. members the assurance that any assistance that they can give to assist us to overcome the problems of South Africa as a developing country, will be welcomed. I thank them for the contributions that they have made thus far.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to an article which recently appeared in the <i>Argus</i> in connection with the standard of national housing. The article reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Houses erected to the standards laid down by the Housing Commission might have to be demolished to comply with the Slums Act&#x201D;, the chairman of the Cape Divisional Council&#x2019;s House Scheme said at a special meeting to discuss the raising of the sub-economic standards yesterday afternoon.</block>

<p>I do not propose to deal with the whole article but this question of the standard of sub-economic housing has been referred to in the Press. It has also been referred to in my own province, particularly in connection with Indian housing. There have been complaints about concrete housing. The houses have cracked and in many instances it has been suggested that they are injurious to the health of the people. I know Bantu housing does not fall under this Minister but I do know that where concrete houses have been erected in Natal several of them have had to be abandoned and contractors called in to put them right. It does seem to me that there is a tendency on the part of the Tender Board to take the lowest tender. One sees the merit of that but that lowest tender may be based on alternative methods of construction. If a house is to last for 20 or 30 years, and that is obviously the intention when the loan programme deals with 20 or 30 years, the standard of the house should be such that the house can last for 20 or 30 years otherwise the whole object of the loan fund is destroyed. The object of the loan fund is to borrow money for these houses with a capital redemption spread over a period of some 20 to 30 years. If the houses are of such a standard that they cannot last for that period there is going to be a drain on the community in subsequent years to the extent to which those houses may have to be abandoned. I hope the Minister will give us. <span class="col_7515_7516" refersTo="page_1090"/>some indication as to whether it is his intention to give consideration to the question of standard both in the case of sub-economic and economic houses to ensure that there will be no doubt that the houses will last for the whole of the period of the loan. I know the Minister understands the economics of this. The Minister is not only responsible for housing but for community development as well. I suggest to the Minister that if these houses are to be occupied for the full period, if they are not to revert to slums, it is essential that in planning these houses he should also take into consideration the other services, such as roads, shops, and so on. If the Minister goes to Natal he will find that in many cases the topography is such that serious drainage problems present themselves. While a housing scheme may look very attractive when it is new, when the summer storms come, the housing scheme may require a great deal of attention as a result of the erosion of the drains and so forth. This may involve his Department or the local authorities in further expenditure in subsequent years. It is therefore essential for the Ministry of Housing to ensure that houses are constructed in an area where the drainage is adequate to ensure that the houses and the roads that serve them are not damaged by storms and so on. If those houses are to be occupied for the whole period of 30 years it is essential that the other services, such as transport, shopping centres, etc., must be co-ordinated. I hope the Minister will be able to give us some information as to the extent to which his Department is co-ordinating with other Departments, because I think it is folly to spend a large sum of money on housing unless you provide the other services with it. If you do not provide these other services these houses are going to be abandoned in subsequent years because of the fact that the transport service is such that people decide to move to areas nearer the city.</p>

<p>I submit it is essential, when we vote these loan moneys for housing, that adequate attention be given, not only to the short-term aspect of providing housing immediately, especially for the lower income groups, but to the long terms aspect as well, namely, that those houses should last for the full period of 30 years and that those adequate services should be provided. In that way we shall ensure that that housing scheme will be of lasting benefit and that it will not in subsequent years revert to slum conditions. I hope the Minister will be able to give us some further information because I feel that to provide the cheapest houses possible is not the answer if we want a well-planned housing scheme both in the sub-economic and economic field.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>I want to start by thanking the hon. the Minister for the initiative that he has shown and the encouragement that he has given since he became Minister of Housing so as to overtake the backlog in respect of housing. We still talk of a housing shortage, but we must not forget that since the Government came into power in 1948 it has done a great deal and that it has done its duty to meet our housing needs. Out of money that the Government has voted annually the National Housing Commission has either built houses itself or granted loans for the building of homes. From 1948 to 31 March 1962, no fewer than 37,993 houses at a total estimated cost of R144,000,000 were built. That is apart from houses that have been built under Government guarantee and houses made available to public servants and railway officials.</p>

<p>In spite of everything that has been done the fact remains that there is still a shortage of houses, particularly for the lower paid groups. That is why it is encouraging to see the enthusiasm and the energy with which the hon. the Minister is tackling his task. I think the hon. the Minister has already proved to the country that he is in earnest in regard to this matter and I think he ought to have the co-operation of everyone connected with this matter. The various town councils particularly ought to go out of their way to assist the hon. the Minister and his Department in this task. I should say that every town council should make a positive contribution, firstly, by making available as many plots as possible, sufficient plots to meet the need in its particular area, and secondly by making them available as cheaply as possible. That is why I also want to express my appreciation to the Secretary for Housing for the fact that he recently advised the Bloemfontein City Council that the expenses in connection with services which they are supplying should rather be met on a long-term basis. It is only right that future generations should also help to pay for these services because, after all, they will make use of them in the future. In this way we will be able to make cheaper plots available. In the second place I think city councils themselves should take the initiative in tackling housing schemes.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that I am pleased that the dispute between the Bloemfontein City Council and the Department of Housing has apparently been settled. The hon. the Minister will remember that I drew his attention last year to the very serious housing shortage in Bloemfontein, as I had also done on previous occasions. The hon. the Minister subsequently paid a visit to Bloemfontein&#x2014;I want to thank him very much indeed for having done so&#x2014;and gave an interview to the city council. The Secretary for Housing said in a Press statement that altogether 165 houses would be built by the Department and the City Council of Bloemfontein in the General de Wet extension. He mentioned the fact that a further 500 plots would possibly be made available by the Bloemfontein City Council. I am very grateful for this announcement, Mr. Chairman, but I think the hon. the Minister should make a statement about the whole position in Bloemfontein. We would <span class="col_7517_7518" refersTo="page_1091"/>like to know when his Department thinks that the housing shortage in Bloemfontein will eventually be overcome. Although I am grateful for the progress that has been made, 1 still want to point out that I feel concerned because I think that 165 houses are far too few to meet the needs of Bloemfontein. The Department of Housing recently made a statement in the Press to the effect that there was a shortage of 1,000 houses for people in the lower income groups in the Republic, and that almost half of this shortage existed in Bloemfontein. In other words, there is a shortage of about 500 houses in Bloemfontein. According to information which the hon. the Minister gave us in 1961, there was a waiting list of about 600 persons in Bloemfontein. It seems to me that 165 houses will be far too few to supply housing to all those on the waiting-list. I have in mind the fact that the city council may still make 500 plots available but, as far as I know, this is still only a possibility, and yet Mr. Niemand, in his Press statement, said that he thought that sufficient relief would be given within two years, particularly in regard to the lower income groups in Bloemfontein.</p>

<p>I want to express the opinion&#x2014;and I think the hon. the Minister and the Department will agree with me&#x2014;that once a start is made on the building of these houses, the waiting-list will not shrink but will tend to grow. That has always happened in the past where we have had to deal with housing schemes. I shall be pleased, therefore, if the hon. the Minister will throw some more light on the housing position in Bloemfontein. I would also like to know from him whether he has anything to add to the statement already made by the Secretary for Housing.</p>

<p>I want to bring a few matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister. Firstly, I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not think that the time has come for the means test in regard to the purchase of homes and the renting of homes to be reviewed. I am sure that the hon. the Minister will agree that R140 per month, which is the yardstick, is very low. It is easy for a person to-day to earn R140 per month. If he exceeds this amount he does not qualify under a certain scheme. We find it very difficult to accommodate people earning slightly more than R140 per month. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to go into this matter and to change this provision if possible.</p>

<p>There is another matter that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister and this is something that particularly affects my constituency. We have the suburb of Paarlshoop in which the Langlaagte Orphanage is situated. Great changes were made there last year as well as this year. Thousands of rand were spent on new houses. The position is that there are houses in the vicinity which have been declared to be slums. There are vacant plots there as well. There are almost 100 vacant plots there and it is possible that a further 100 houses will be demolished. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether something cannot be done to force the owners to sell those vacant plots. These owners ask fantastic prices for these vacant plots. A few years ago the hon. the Minister agreed to put up houses there if the plots could be purchased at a reasonable price. There were owners who wanted as much as &#x00A3;1,500 or R3,000 per vacant plot. This is a very attractive suburb that can be extended. It has a very convenient bus and train service. But nothing can be done because of the fact that the owners are asking those exorbitant prices for their plots. If the hon. the Minister does not have the power to do so, cannot he obtain the power to expropriate land that has been unused over the years so that houses can be built for both the middle and lower income groups? There is a great demand for houses and we cannot afford to have vacant plots alongside a city.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I read the combined report of the National Housing Commission and the Bantu Housing Board with interest. This is the first report of its kind that has been issued and it covers the period 1958-60. I see too from the Estimates that the capital of the Housing Fund amounts to R21,840,000, but no details are given. I would like to know from the hon. the Minister how much of this amount falls under the Bantu Housing Board and how much under the White Housing Board. I have two problems that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. I do not quite know how they can be solved. The one is in connection with housing at Ladysmith. There is a very great shortage of houses there, mainly because it is a very large railway centre. The town council of Ladysmith started a small housing scheme there two years ago. It is a very old place and all the houses are occupied, or, at least, most are occupied by railway officials because the rentals are very low. But it is not desirable that that housing should remain there. The position there is impossible. For example, one comes through the front door straight into the kitchen; the bathroom and a small partitioned-off section&#x2026;</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>To the town council of Ladysmith. But it is not desirable that those houses should remain there any longer. I have been in touch with the town council there and each day in my work as Member of Parliament I deal with people who are in the service of the Railways there and who tell me that they have no housing. The hon. the Minister will know that the policy of the Railways is not to let houses any longer but to sell them to railway officials. I can get no assistance there. The Lady-<span class="col_7519_7520" refersTo="page_1092"/>smith Municipality told me that they sent out a circular asking people whether they would be interested and how many of them would be interested if money could be obtained from the National Housing Board in order to build a new housing scheme there. They say that the replies that they received were very unsatisfactory. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister can assist me in regard to this difficulty. On the one hand there is this unsatisfactory housing scheme there&#x2014;it is called Pretoriusdorp and the houses are rented to railway officials at a very low rental&#x2014;and on the other hand the Ladysmith town council say that they are afraid to borrow money under the housing scheme because they do not know whether they will be able to let those houses since there was no reaction to their circular. Can the hon. the Minister advise me in this connection? What can be done in this regard?</p>

<p>There is another thing that I would like to know. Because the amount of R22,000,000 has not been sub-divided, I do not know how much if any of this amount is available for Bantu housing. I want to ask the hon. the Minister therefore whether money is readily available to municipalities. I take it that the rate of interest charged is &#x00BE; per cent for sub-economic housing schemes. Or must a municipality which makes application in this regard wait for a while before its request is acceded to and how long will it take before the municipalities will receive the money? Is a reasonable sum of money available?</p>

<p>I want to tell the hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S.

But I want to tell the hon. member immediately that we are no longer making sub-economic housing available to the Bantu.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>At the prevailing rate of interest. <i>I</i> may just say that we have reached the position where the average income of the Bantu is such that he can bear the cost of his house; he earns more in a year than his house costs. We have brought the cost structure down by means of better building methods and designs, which still conform to the standards laid down by the Building Research Institute which is a scientific institution with which my Department co-operates most closely.</p>

<p>This reply also holds good for the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell), The C.S.R.R. co-operates most closely with the Department of Housing and there is continual consultation. As far as standards are concerned we apply no standard without having consulted them. They usually take international standards into account. I may tell the hon. member that I have proved that the standards which are applied in South Africa for sub-economic houses and for our lower-income groups are higher than the standards applied in most other countries for the middle-income groups. I know of no people who have left their homes. All I know is that we still have a shortage. But I hope that after the study tour that we are planning we will be able to consider everything and try to learn what we can in connection with future housing.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) asked me about the 500 plots in regard to which negotiation are taking place. My reply is that the city council has undertaken to make those sites available. They will be made available, I hope, in a smaller size so that the services will be cheaper because the larger the plot that one makes available, the higher the costs of the services. It has definitely now been arranged that the 500 plots will be made available. The Bloemfontein city council must continue by means of loans that it receives from the Housing Commission and also by means of individual loans to make those plots available to persons who need them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Langlaagte (Mr. P. J. Coetzee) spoke about the loan limits. I think I shall be able to satisfy him in a short while. As far as Karelshoop is concerned, my reply is more or less that we do not like interfering with private interests but I would rather the hon. member discussed his problems with the head of my Department so that we can consider the circumstances prevailing there.</p>

<p>*With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I want to make a statement on behalf of the Government.</p>

<p>INCOME LIMITS</p>

<p>As hon. members know it is impossible to assist all families to acquire dwellings in <span class="col_7521_7522" refersTo="page_1093"/>terms of the Housing Act. In the first instance, should such action be contemplated, it would conflict with the interests of private enterprise and in the second instance the State would never be able to find so much money. Provision has therefore been made in the Housing Act, in terms of which it must be determined, which categories of persons and families should be provided with housing out of the National Housing Fund, and the degree of assistance that should be made available in this regard.</p>

<p>Therefore, it was at that time determined which families could not provide in their own housing needs without State aid, and the following income limits and norms were fixed in respect of the categories who would qualify for assistance out of State funds, on the sub-economic or economic basis.</p>

<p><i>Sub-economic families</i></p>

<p><i>White Coloured Asiatic.</i></p>

<p>*Scheduled areas R60 p.m. R40 p.m. R40 p.m. Non-scheduled areas R50 p.m. R33 p.m. R33 p.m.</p>

<p>(*Scheduled areas are those areas where the wage rates of artisans in the building industry are determined by legislation, whilst nonscheduled areas are areas where wage regulating instruments do not apply.)</p>

<p><i>Economic families</i></p>

<p>R140 p.m. for all racial groups in all areas.</p>

<p>However, it has now been concluded that these limits are no longer actual in the light of the present value of the monetary unit and the wage structure that has in the course of time developed in consequence thereof. Families which originally qualified for assistance do not therefore to-day qualify for such assistance as their present earnings exceed the limits which had been fixed previously, whilst these families are not any better off financially.</p>

<p>It has further come to light that the difference which existed formerly between the cost of dwellings in scheduled and non-scheduled areas does not exist to the same degree to-day, and that the difference which is still to be found is so negligible, that different limits for the respective areas do not appear to be justified.</p>

<p>It has therefore been decided to adjust the existing limits to the present day economic position in the country so as to ensure that the same categories of persons and families which qualified for assistance originally, will again qualify for such assistance.</p>

<p>I am therefore pleased to be able to announce that the following new limits will apply as from 1 July 1963.</p>

<p><i>Sub-economic Families</i></p>

<p><i>White. Coloured. Asiatic.</i></p>

<p>All areas &#x2026;&#x2026; R80 p.m. R50 p.m. R50 p.m.</p>

<p>(You will note that in future no difference is being made between scheduled and other areas.)</p>

<p><i>Economic families</i></p>

<p>R180 p.m. for all families of all races.</p>

<p>This is an important concession and it should to a great extent meet in the existing need for State assistance by families both in the sub-economic as well as in the economic income group.</p>

<p>I do not think that it will be inopportune for me to make use of this occasion to say a little more about the existing loan facilities offered by the Department of Housing.</p>

<p>As you are aware there are several economic housing loan schemes in operation in terms of which any individual who is not already the owner of a dwelling and whose income does not exceed the applicable income limit can be assisted to acquire a dwelling for occupation by him and his family.</p>

<p><i>Individual Housing Loan Schemes</i></p>

<p>In the case of individual housing loans which are obtainable from local authorities or the Commission itself, an individual must make a cash contribution of 10 per cent of the cost of his land and proposed dwelling. He can then obtain a loan to a maximum amount of R4,500 redeemable over 30 years at a monthly instalment of approximately R26 p.m. which included capital redemption and interest. However, the dwelling that he may erect may not cost more than R5,000. A borrower may therefore in addition to his cash deposit of 10 per cent, contribute a further R500 towards the cost of his dwelling if he so choose and has the necessary money.</p>

<p><i>Economic Letting/Selling Schemes</i></p>

<p>To meet in the needs of persons who are unable to, or who do not wish to avail themselves of the schemes. I have just mentioned, local authorities or the Commission itself may erect dwellings for sale or letting to families with income not exceeding R180 per month.</p>

<p>The same limits applicable to the loans to individual schemes, as regards period of redemption, <span class="col_7523_7524" refersTo="page_1094"/>cost of erection of dwellings and maximum loan obtainable are in operation also in respect of this type of housing. However, if a family purchases such a dwelling it is only required to make a cash deposit of 5 per cent of the purchase price or R200 whichever is the lesser amount and to repay the balance in equal monthly instalments over 30 years. When such dwellings are let rentals are determined in such a manner that provision is only made for moneys sufficient to cover the local authority&#x2019;s or the Commission&#x2019;s actual disbursements in connection with the dwelling; neither the local authority or the Commission may show any profit.</p>

<p><i>Sub-economic Housing</i></p>

<p>As far as sub-economic housing is concerned, the new income limits of which, I have just mentioned, namely, R80 in respect of Whites and R50 in respect of Coloureds and Asiatics, I wish to emphasize that this type of housing is intended to meet in the need of families falling in an income group in which privation already exists. In view of their meagre earnings the families in this group, and they are generally large families, are already experiencing want and have to do without a large variety of essential requirements for life in the form of food, clothing and other personal requirements.</p>

<p>It is therefore, most essential that any accommodation that is provided for them must be provided at a rental which will be so low that it will make only the smallest possible inroad on their earnings, in order that their want will not become totally unbearable. If this can only be achieved at the cost of dispensing with non-essential requirements such as bathrooms, hand-basins, ceilings, wooden floors, or even by the provision of only two-roomed dwellings as a basic unit, we must accept that position as being preferable to increasing their want, as no greater assistance can be afforded families in terms of the Housing Act 1957, than the provision of a low rental dwelling erected out of &#x00BE; per cent sub-economic funds. Because the State itself carries an interest loss of 4&#x00BE; per cent on the cost of sub-economic dwellings the monthly payments in respect of interest and redemption on a loan of say, R500 on dwellings erected on this basis, amounts to only R1.97. It would therefore, appear that it should be possible to provide suitable sub-economic dwellings at reasonable rentals, but it is nevertheless experienced that this is not always the case. Local authorities administering sub-economic dwellings charge full economic consumer tariffs in respect of water, electricity and other municipal services provided, which in many cases amounts to much more than the interest and redemption payments on the land and dwellings, with the result that tenants find it difficult to meet their commitments.</p>

<p>It is in this respect that improvement can be brought about in our system of assistance to families already suffering from want. I, therefore, want to appeal to local authorities that they, in the same way as the State when it affords assistance to all its inhabitants requiring assistance, should in the case of families residing in their own areas also consider the granting of any additional aid required, by adjusting their tariffs in respect of services rendered to such schemes, in such a way, that the families concerned will be able to subsist in a reasonable manner, free from want of the primary necessities for living. I am sure that the average tax payer of any town or city will have no objection to affording such a degree of assistance to his less privileged fellow citizens. In this connection I may mention that as far as the provision of loan moneys for the laving on or provision of such services is concerned, the municipal tax payer is not affected in any way as the Department of Housing provides loan moneys therefor on the merits of each case, in respect of economic as well as sub-economic housing schemes.</p>

<p>This announcement should not be seen as a new approach towards sub-economic loans. The effect will only be a continuation of the existing policy, adjusted to reigning circumstances.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>With your permission, Mr. Chairman, and, I believe, with the agreement of the House. I just want to refer to one single matter before this Vote is discussed. It so happens that to-day is the last day on which the Commissioner of Prisons, Mr. Verster, will take his place in the officials&#x2019; bay, a place which he has probably occupied for a longer period than any other head of Department. Although he will only be retiring <span class="col_7525_7526" refersTo="page_1095"/>at the end of this year, this is the last day on which he will be present here. He was also the last official to be appointed as head of the Department of Prisons from outside the prisons&#x2019; service.</p>

<p>It is well known to hon. members of the House that for some years in the past the Department of Prisons was perhaps the Cinderella of State Departments. Mr. Verster became the head of that Department in 1952 and I think I speak on behalf of all hon. members when I say that in him we have had an official who has brought a great deal of lustre to this Department.</p>

<p>He is an official who has not only brought great credit upon himself but upon his country, the Republic, in the international sphere by the manner in which he has discharged his duties. He is an official who revolutionized the prisons system here in South Africa. Since this will be his last appearance here in his present capacity, it is my earnest desire not only to thank him very much indeed but also on behalf of this House to wish him everything of the best for the future.</p>

<p>I have already made this announcement but I want to draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the fact that for the first time a person who started at the bottom will now become head of the Department of Prisons&#x2014;Brig. Steyn, an ex-S.S.B. lad who has not only climbed high in the Department of Prisons but who during his years of service has so improved his academic qualifications that to-day he has an M.A. degree&#x2014;certainly a wonderful achievement which was made possible by the guidance that was given by Mr. Verster who is to retire at the end of this year.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that one day when the history of our prisons&#x2019; service is written the names of our present State President, Mr. Swart, and of Mr. Verster will be given very honourable mention in that connection. I felt that on behalf of hon. members of this House I should convey our gratitude and good wishes to an excellent, loyal and faithful official.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>May I have the privilege of the half-hour?</p>

<p>I should like immediately to associate this side of the House with the thanks which have been expressed by the hon. Minister to Brigadier Verster and with him I would like to congratulate the retiring Director on a very distinguished career and on behalf of all of us to wish him a very happy retirement which we believe has been well earned, although like to many persons who have led a very busy life, he will probably find that he will be busier than ever once he retires. But we do wish him well on his retirement and we do hope that from time to time he may still be able in some capacity or other to serve this country which he has served so well.</p>

<p>Then I would like to associate this side of the House with the welcome to the new Director of Prisons, Brigadier Steyn. It says very much for his qualities, and augers well for the service which will be rendered by Brigadier Steyn, that he is one of a number who years ago joined the S.S.B., an organization that did a great deal for the youths at that time, an organization which many have felt from time to time might well be revived. I would like to say to Brigadier Steyn that we congratulate him on this achievement that having started from the S.S.B., he has not only progressed in rank but that while he was doing so he qualified himself in the manner in which he has done so. As I say, it speaks well of him and augers well for the service he will render in the field of which he will now be in charge.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I believe that in this Committee we have a very special responsibility this year and that the hon. Minister has a very special responsibility because although there are always many important matters one can refer to under the Vote &#x201C;Justice&#x201D;, there is one subject which falls under the hon. Minister which I believe is foremost perhaps in the minds of all of us. I would like to say that I intend very largely to confine my remarks to that subject, but that other hon. members on this side of the House will deal with other matters which fall under the various Votes of the hon. Minister. Sir, I would like to refer of course to the position in which the hon. Minister of Justice has been placed, that not only does he exercise greater powers than any previous Minister of Justice, but I want to say to him straightforwardly that he carries greater responsibilities I believe, than normally have to be carried by a Minister of Justice, and it is right in those circumstances that we should discuss some of those responsibilities and ask the hon. Minister to tell us quite frankly what the position is and how the matters entrusted to his charge are progressing.</p>

<p>I would like to refer immediately to the fact that among the very great powers vested in the hon. Minister are those powers under various Acts of Parliament which have been passed over the last period of 15 years, culminating in the passage of a further Act in this series a little earlier during this Session which has vested in the hon. Minister powers, which as I say, place upon him a very great responsibility. In this regard I would like to say that there is only one check on the powers of the hon. Minister and that is the check of Parliament itself. That being so, it is our submission that it is the duty of the hon. Minister who is charged with that duty to take this House into his confidence, reporting to us very fully, as I am sure the hon. Minister will do, as to the exercise of these powers by him. There are a number of matters on which we would like to have a full report from the hon. <span class="col_7527_7528" refersTo="page_1096"/>Minister in regard to the exercise of these powers with which he is now vested. The first point I would like to put to the hon. Minister is this that one is disturbed, if the reports we have received are correct, that witnesses in trials concerning the safety of the State have had to be masked so that their identity should not become known? It is of course a serious matter, but as the hon. Minister knows this side of the House agrees that the old Roman Law still stands that the safety of the State is a matter of the most paramount importance. We accept that position. But it is disturbing when one finds reports of this nature and one can only hope that it will not be very long before the situation is such that this will no longer be necessary. Sir, I would like in this connection to refer to the interim report of Mr. Justice Snyman, from which it is clear that it was the opinion of that honourable Judge that in the circumstances which existed, the State was not always in the position to protect its witnesses in this type of trial. It is unquestionably a matter which must cause us all very great concern, and I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what progress he has made and whether he feels that that position has been or is being overcome. We will be very glad to hear from the hon. Minister in regard to this matter and have not only a report on the factual position at the present time, but also to hear from the hon. Minister what his expectations are in the light of his experience in respect of the months which lie ahead.</p>

<p>Then I must say that we have been distressed to find that there is a possibility that the report of Mr. Justice Snyman will not be available before the end of the Session. This is a document of very great importance. We know of course that Mr. Justice Snyman is a careful judge who would not wish to rush his report, but we can only hope that the Minister will do everything he possibly can to ensure that the final report is tabled and made available to hon. members in time for it to be debated in some of the debates which yet lie ahead. There is no question but that this report will contain some very important findings and recommendations in respect of Bantu administration in the urban areas, and that is a matter which concerns this House very deeply, and I hope that the Minister will be able to give some assurance that this report will be available in time, if possible. It would naturally be expected of Parliament that if there are urgent recommendations we should consider them, and I hope the Minister will be able to assure us that the interim report, as the result of which certain legislation has already been passed, might be regarded as having resulted in the placing on the Statute Book of the final volume of the legislation in this series; because I am sure that all hon. members in this House would like to see the end of emergency regulations. The problem also arises, if the Minister is going to make recommendations in regard to additional legislation which, unlike the emergency steps he recommended, would perhaps ease the burden, it is very important that it should still be considered during this Session. If the Minister finds that he is unable to table the report before the end of the Session, I would like to suggest to him that if there is legislation of the nature of the legislation I have referred to, which will relieve the burden on the people, he should ask Mr. Justice Snyman to report specially in order that the matter may still be considered during this Session.</p>

<p>I then come to a matter which has received great Press publicity and a matter of great concern to all hon. members of this House, namely the organization called Poqo, which is condemned, as it has been by all sides of the House, and which has been condemned in the interim report of Judge Snyman. Parliament would like to know from the Minister whether he can give us any assurance that this organization has been smashed. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to give us such an assurance. I should like to ask whether the Minister can give us any information in respect of leaders who have disappeared without trace. It is a matter which must cause concern when the Minister has at his disposal a tremendously efficient Police Force, that leaders of organizations such as this are constantly succeeding in escaping the net. I want to ask the Minister specifically whether he can give this House any information in regard to Leballo who must have escaped from Basutoland on to Republican territory, unless of course he is still in Basutoland, as is possible.</p>

<p>Then there is the other organization, the A.N.C., and its militant wing, the Spear of the Nation. Can the Minister give us any further information in respect of this organization? In particular, I would like to ask him whether he has any information in respect of the reported decision of the A.N.C. to resort to violence and murder in future. We know that at one time it indicated that it would not do these things, but there has been a report that a change has taken place. If the Minister can give us information, we would like to have it.</p>

<p>Then there is a matter which has caused us all great concern, namely the fact that there are schools for the training of saboteurs outside the borders of the Republic. This is a matter which is freely reported in the Press. Can the Minister tell us whether any arrests have been made and whether prosecutions are pending, and in particular I want to ask the Minister whether he believes that the measures taken are such that if any of these persons did return to the Republic they would very soon be discovered by our police?</p>

<p>There is another question I would come to, and that is the Transkeian Proclamation No. 400, which is still in force. Is the Minister in a position to tell us whether an emergency still exists in this area, and whether he does not believe the time has come when he is in a position to repeal this proclamation? Because <span class="col_7529_7530" refersTo="page_1097"/>it must obviously be a matter of concern to the Government that it is starting the Transkei on the road to self-government at a time when that territory is governed by Proclamation No. 400.</p>

<p>No, I know it is not the Minister&#x2019;s proclamation, but it is a matter which affects the Minister&#x2019;s Department. It was passed in respect of matters in regard to which I believe the Minister is the one who is responsible to this House.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY-CHAIRMAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is not relevant. I rule that it cannot be discussed. The hon. member may discuss the action of the police, but he cannot discuss the proclamation itself.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>May I put it this way. Can the Minister tell us whether he has an assurance from his police that the situation in the Transkei is under control, and can he tell us from the information he has from the police whether it is believed that in fact that situation is under control? He may then be able to raise with his colleague and with the Cabinet the question of the continuance of that proclamation.</p>

<p>I come now to Sections 4 and 17 of the General Laws Amendment Act, and I would like to ask the Minister whether he can tell us in respect of that matter whether what was clearly the intention of this House has been carried into effect. In other words, what steps has the Minister taken to ensure that a person detained in terms of these sections can have his position fully protected by the responsible authorities? These are powers which go very far indeed, and I am sure the Minister will agree that a great responsibility rests upon him in respect of these persons. Then I should also like to refer to the families of these persons, and I hope it will be the view of every hon. member of this House that steps should be taken to ensure that notwithstanding what may have been the crime of the persons who are dealt with in terms of these sections, we will as an act of mercy do what we can to ensure that the families of those persons are reasonably provided for.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF JUSTICE</person>:</from>

<p>I thought of that in 1960 already when I was Deputy Minister of Social Welfare.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I will be glad if the Minister will tell the House of the steps he has taken. We know of the powers that exist, but what we really want the Minister to tell us is whether those powers are being exercised, and whether he is satisfied with the steps taken. The Minister will remember that provision was made in the time of the previous Government for the families of these people who were interned. Obviously the Minister is not concerned with that matter, except to ensure that proper action is taken by his colleague&#x2019;s Department, and we would like to have an assurance from the Minister that these cases are brought to the attention of the proper Department so that the proper steps can be taken.</p>

<p>Then, can the Minister tell us how many persons have been detained under each of the sections mentioned above? It will be a matter of great interest to this House to know the extent of the steps which the Minister and his Department have considered essential, and in that respect I would like to ask whether the Minister can tell us whether this detention of persons is having the desired effect which the Minister had in mind when he asked for these wide powers.</p>

<p>Then I would like to ask how many of the detainees have been released after inquiry. I think that if it is found that persons need not be further detained, they should be released at the earliest possible moment, and I am sure that will be the policy of the Minister but we would be glad to have an assurance to that effect.</p>

<p>Then in respect of the future, I should like to ask the Minister whether in his view it will be necessary to exercise these powers widely in future. It is a matter on which I think the Minister ought to be able to give us an estimate. Obviously it is an unknown factor to some extent, but the Minister must be aware, from the success of whatever steps may have been taken, as to whether he can reasonably give the country an assurance that he has brought the position completely under control.</p>

<p>I would also like to ask the Minister whether he agrees that it should be the aim of this House and of any South African Government to bring about such a situation in this country that it will not be necessary to retain these extraordinary provisions on our Statute Book. We know what is usually the result of the passing of such legislation. We have seen it through the years. Legislation heaps up on our Statute Book, and we so seldom see legislation repealed. But in respect of legislation of this very special type, I submit to the Minister that it is in the interest of our country for this legislation to be removed from the <span class="col_7531_7532" refersTo="page_1098"/>Statute Book as soon as the situation is such that it is possible to remove it without endangering the safety of the State. That should be our aim.</p>

<p>Finally, I should like to say to the Minister that the record of this country in respect of our judicial system and the administration of justice has in past years been rightly regarded as among the best in the world. I hope that the Minister will agree that it is now in the interests of this country, and it is a duty which rests upon us all, and I am prepared to state that the Opposition would be prepared to co-operate in this regard, to remove from the Statute Book as soon as possible all the emergency legislation which exists, because as the Minister knows we have a very difficult problem facing us as a nation, and it is my firm belief that when we reach the day when we can remove all the legislation of that type from the Statute Book, we as South Africans will be able to believe, and with justification, that we are approaching a situation of bringing about harmony in this country. The present situation is one which obviously must cause great concern to the Government. It causes great concern to the people, and certainly to the Opposition. We believe that the Minister might perhaps be able to persuade some of his colleagues that the remedy for these matters does not lie in his hands alone, and that a great responsibility lies on his colleagues as well. What should be our aim is to remove legislation of this type from the Statute Book, and to get back to the ordinary operation of the law and to the position that safeguards which have been removed, temporarily I believe, can be restored, because it will be in the interest of this country if we can get back to a simple system of justice based on the best precedents. Then we will be able to claim that something real has been achieved for this country, because once again our system, which I fear can never again enjoy the respect with emergency powers existing which it otherwise would have enjoyed, will be restored to the position where it will again be respected by the world. We believe that in dealing with these tremendous problems, this Minister perhaps carries the greatest responsibility of all, and it has been said that from him on whom has been placed the greatest responsibility the most may be asked. We then ask of this Minister that he should set as his aim the bringing about of a different state of affairs in this country so that we can remove these provisions from our Statute Book.</p>

<p>Just before concluding, I should like to pay tribute to our South African Police, who I believe have discharged their duties with very great distinction indeed throughout this difficult period. [Hear, hear!] I think that from the Commissioner down we can be very proud of our police. There have been isolated instances where things have been which we do not like, but I believe that during this difficult period the S.A. Police has acquitted itself with very great distinction, and I am glad to tell the Minister that that is a source of great pleasure to the Opposition, as I know it is to him and his colleagues. We can only say that we hope that they will succeed in their task of dealing with these subversive elements and bringing them before the courts, and restoring South Africa once again to being a happy and harmonious country in which we will not have the problems and trials we have at present. But I should like to say something else to this Minister, and I think that hon. members opposite are inclined to forget it on occasion. That is that the problems which we face in this regard, although they are the special responsibility of the Government, are a matter of deep concern equally to members on this side, because it is on our success in meeting this situation and building a country which acts in accordance with the highest precepts, that we can ensure the future for the coming generations. In that spirit I ask the Minister to report to us fully. If it should be that there are difficulties in the intervening period, or if there should be a desire to deal with the removal of some of these powers, the Minister might even consider the calling of a special session of Parliament to deal with the matter, because I believe that Parliament, which is the only body which holds responsibility to check some of these powers, should in the circumstances of the present day be called together again if necessary in the interests of this country.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the sentiments expressed by the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) in regard to Mr. Verster. If there is one person who is aware of the conditions that prevailed before Mr. Verster was appointed to the prisons&#x2019; service as director, it is 1. To put it in a few words, the conditions were chaotic and there was corruption.
