<li>(ii) Mr. J. A. Erasmus, B.Comm., B.Admin.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(c) To investigate and report on the representations for an independent university at Port Elizabeth, with special reference to the following matters:

<ol>

<li>(i) Is the Mayor and community aware of the contribution which will be expected from the private sector for the establishment and running of a separate university?</li>

<li>(ii) Could actual and sufficient financial support be expected from the private sector: commerce, industry, city council and well-to-do individuals?</li>

<li>(iii) What is the total population and in particular the school population from which the university could draw its students? An analysis should be made of the matriculants (exemption) over a period of several years. How many of them proceed to a university and how many potential university students do not proceed to a university by virtue of the fact that they cannot afford to attend a university away from Port Elizabeth but who would otherwise have attended a local university?</li>

<li>(iv) Is the allegation correct that the Mayor has not the support of (i) his council and (ii) organized commerce and industry to break away from Rhodes?</li>

<li>(v) What is the actual position in regard to the ground offered to the university? Is the city council legally and morally bound to place the ground at the disposal of Rhodes? Is alternative ground available and, if so, would the city council be willing to place it at the disposal of a second separate university?</li>

<li>(vi) What are the financial implications for the State should an independent university be recommended?</li>

<li>(vii) Is there a reasonable degree of certainty that suitably qualified personnel would be recruited should an independent university be recommended? Is the problem to recruit suitable personnel fully realized?</li>

<li>(viii) A university provides in its capital needs mainly through loans. What assurances have those who advocate a university at Port Elizabeth that loans will be obtained?</li>

<li>(ix) A full report on the attitude of Rhodes. Why is Rhodes of the opinion that Port Elizabeth should not have its own university? Is its contention that Port Elizabeth should for ever be an adjunct of Rhodes or is it of opinion that this division should or could eventually develop into an independent university? Should they agree with the foregoing sentence, could they at this stage give any assurances?</li>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in dealing with this Bill the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) asked two questions. One was why sub-section (6) refers to only two paragraphs of Section 21 (2) of the principal Act and not to the other paragraphs of that section. It is clear, however, when one analyses Section 21 of Act 12 of 1960 that the other paragraphs of the relevant sub-section refer to powers which the Minister has in granting prospecting leases. They give him the right to lay down the scale on which prospecting is to be done and what returns have to be furnished by the lessee during the period of the lease, and also to determine the rental. Then there are other provisions in connection with the area to be mined, etc. The two paragraphs to which he has referred, namely (a) (vii) and (b), provide that the Minister has the power to determine the rental but only after consultation with the board, and (b) also gives the Minister certain rights, but only after consultation with the board, in connection with the payment of certain amounts by the lessee. In both these cases therefore the Minister has certain powers but he can only exercise them after having consulted the Mining Leases Board. Under the existing legislation therefore the Mining Leases Board is already a consultative body, and since we are now establishing a second body here, the whole intention of sub-section (6) is to make it clear that the committees which are to be established will not be consulted in so far as the powers of the Mining Leases Board are concerned. In other words, as far as the lease is concerned and the rental which is payable, as well as any other payments which have to be made by such a prospecting lessee, that will still be laid down by the Mining Leases Board.</p>

<p>The other question was what the powers of these committees would be. Sub-section (4) makes it perfectly clear that the intention is that these committees are to make recommendations to the Minister in connection with prospecting leases. Their main function will be to make recommendations. Amongst other things, they will be able to examine the applicants and make recommendations as to how they should be grouped together. Those will be the committees&#x2019; only functions, and once those functions have been performed, the committees can be dissolved.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand (Mr. G. de K. Maree) referred to the possibility of rich deposits in this area. It is correct, of course, that diamonds were discovered in 1928 particularly in Alexander Bay and that this led to the establishment of the Alexander Bay State Diggings. Great wealth has been produced there in the years since 1928. Then there is also Kleinsee, but we have no knowledge of other large deposits, although there are frequently rumours to that effect. I hope that prospective applicants will not allow themselves to be misled by that sort of thing. I notice that in a magazine which appeared towards the end of last year it is stated, amongst other things&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is said that the Cabinet has decided to open up sections of the area &#x2026; the Coloured reserve where three inches of concrete has been laid over certain portions to preserve the vast diamond wealth there.</block>

<p>There is no truth in those rumours, and I hope that people who want to invest their money will not take any notice of such rumours. The fact of the matter is that there are only diamonds where they are actually found, and it takes an enormous amount of time and money to search for diamonds. It is not clear where the diamond deposits of that area come from. Various theories are held by people who have gone into the matter, people such as Dr. Merensky, for example, who believe that these deposits come from the sea. There are others again who contend that they come from the interior, but there is no certainty in that regard. The fact remains that the large deposits that have been found, are in old sea terraces which in some cases are situated up to six miles away from the coast. They are situated high above the bottom of the sea, as we know it to-day. Whether these diamonds come from volcanic pipes is something that we do not know. It is true that there are volcanic pipes in the interior which contain Kimberlite and in which diamonds have been found. There are many pipes which are of a volcanic nature but which contain no diamonds, as was pointed out yesterday by the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel). The presence of volcanic pipes therefore or even of Kimberlite does not mean that there are diamonds. There are many theories with regard to the origin of these pipes. The geologists talk in terms of millions of years, and they believe that these volcanic pipes were formed 60 to 90 million years ago when the various territories such as Africa, South America, Australia and the South Pole region formed one continent; that they drifted apart and that with the breaking up of the continent enormous forces were unleashed which caused these fissures volcanic pipes in which diamonds are found. But again I say that these are only theories. There are other people who contend that the diamonds were carried down from the interior by old rivers, and in support of that theory they point out that the biggest diamonds have always been found in close proximity <span class="col_4359-4360" refersTo="page_0754"/>to estuaries. That was the experience at the Orange River as well as at the Olifants River, and the same applies to the Buffels River and the Swartlyntjies River, but in Namaqualand many of these deposits where diamonds may possibly be found have been buried under masses of Kalahari sand. There axe certain parts where prospecting is taking place and where sand to a depth of 90 feet has to be shifted. Hon. members will know what it means to shift a solid mass of sand 90 feet in depth in order to find a few inches or a few feet of quartz, and even then there is no certainty that it is diamondiferous. The fact remains therefore that although there is a possibility that these areas may be rich in diamonds, they have to be discovered first and there is no certainty in that regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Namaqualand has suggested that the development of diamonds or prospecting for diamonds will lead to the discovery of base minerals. That is quite correct. Because large areas are closed to prospecting for diamonds, they are also closed to prospecting for base minerals, and once this measure is in operation and prospecting for diamonds has taken place on State land and it appears that that land is not diamondiferous, it is the intention to throw it open immediately to prospecting for base minerals. It is a well-known fact that Namaqualand is very rich in base minerals. The Cape Town University is taking part in the geological survey of that area and it is possible that this may lead to the discovery of even greater base mineral deposits in Namaqualand and that it may offer opportunities for further development. I hope therefore that this preliminary investigation in connection with diamonds will also lead to further discoveries of base minerals.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked that we should see to it that these activities stimulate the economic development of that area. I have already indicated that according to an estimate made by the head of the State Diggings it will cost anything from R 1,800,000 to R2,000,000 to undertake proper prospecting operations in only one of these 20 areas. In the nature of things the prospecting operations over the whole of this area will stimulate great economic activity in Namaqualand. It will create avenues of employment; it will introduce a greater purchasing power and also offer the opportunity for shareholdings in that area, so we can rest assured that these activities will have a stimulating effect on Namaqualand.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked that we should consider the workers of Alexander Bay. It has always been the policy of the State to give preference to the inhabitants of Namaaualand in engaging employees for the State Diggings. At the moment the State Diggings employ 1,800 workers, of which 40 per cent are Whites. There is not a single diamond mine in this country where such a large percentage of Whites is employed as at these diggings. It is the policy of the State to employ the Whites of that area. It is estimated that the life of Alexander Bay will extend up to 1970. This is a comparatively short period and we would be well advised therefore at this stage already to bear in mind that here we have new fields which may come into being where these people who have the necessary knowledge and experience of the diamond industry can be given employment again. The preliminary prospecting will take a few years before we shall be able to determine whether it will, be possible to undertake mining development on a large scale. By that time there will in all probability be a decline in the activities at Alexander Bay and the question of stipulating in th&#x00E9; mining leases that as many of these people as. possible must be given employment there is one which can be considered.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Christiana referred to the professional diggers of the Transvaal and the Cape Province. Here we have a small group of 400 to 500 people who make their living out of digging. They are the last remnants of a large group because it has been the policy of the Department for years not to issue further diegers&#x2019; certificates. This group is becoming smaller and smaller therefore. The active diggers are those persons who work for six months or longer per annum. I am not referring now to holders of certificates because their numbers are greater, but the number of active diggers in the Transvaal is estimated at a little more than 200, and in the Cape Province there are about 270 of whom 70 are non-Whites. They are people who will probably remain diggers for the whole of their lives because it is in their blood. They always live in hopes that what they cannot find today will turn up to-morrow, and that is what keeps them there. The problem is to find sufficient ground for them. It is also possible that these diggers, just like other groups, may form companies and submit applications, and my information is that they have already formed such companies, and their applications, together with the others, will be referred to this committee.</p>

<p>As far as the employment of these people is concerned, experience has taught us that it is well worth while making use of their services. With the development of the West Coast mines their services have been used on a considerable scale. They have been employed there at fixed salaries which give them a much better income than they would have had if they had continued as private diggers. These people also have diggers&#x2019; licences and they have the necessary knowledge. We hope therefore that quite a number of these people will be employed by these companies, and we might even make representations in an attempt&#x2019; to obtain employment for them. We do try to make openings for these diggers; but it is a problem to have privately owned land opened up for prospecting, and our latest efforts in this connection have not proved a very great success. The hon. member may rest assured. however, that we will try to assist. The granting of rights will not be in our hands, <span class="col_4361-4362" refersTo="page_0755"/>but this is a matter which can be submitted for consideration to these committees.</p>

<p>Eighth Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Nuclear Installations (Licensing and Security) Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill, the second reading of which I have just moved, is perhaps of a somewhat technical and complicated nature, but I want to give the House the assurance that it was drafted after very thorough consideration and investigation and after consultation with experts not only here in South Africa but in other parts of the world. The Bill also follows the same pattern on which similar legislation in various countries in the world is based.</p>

<p>As is evident from the long title and its contents, the Bill deals in the main with the responsibility for nuclear damage&#x2014;that is to say damage which flows from or is ascribable to the radio-active properties of nuclear-hazard material&#x2014;and the accompanying requirement that those persons who are responsible for such damage should give security for meeting such responsibility.</p>

<p>It is essential that this legislation be passed this Session because of the fact that the risk of nuclear damage will exist when the fuel elements for the reactor of the Atomic Energy Board start arriving later this year and when the reactor is expected to come into operation early in 1964, or becomes &#x201C;critical&#x201D; as the scientists put it.</p>

<p>As hon. members probably know this reactor was purchased in the U.S.A. It is the so-called Oak Ridge type with a capacity of 20 megawatts and the building in which it will be housed, as well as the necessary additional buildings, laboratories, offices, etc., are already being constructed at Pelindaba, about 18 miles west of Pretoria. Nuclear reactors are expensive installations and the one at Pelindaba, which is regarded as comparatively small, will cost approximately R2,000,000. The money has been provided by the State, the mining industry and other industries.</p>

<p>I may also mention that the Bill embodies recommendations by a committee which was appointed by the Atomic Energy Board towards the end of 1961 to study the legislation and regulations of other countries and organizations concerning third party liability for damage arising from nuclear installations and to recommend suitable legislation to determine who is responsible for any damage suffered because of nuclear explosions or accidents.</p>

<p>The Bill which hon. members have before them to-day is, therefore, to a great extent based on similar legislation in the United Kingdom and to some extent also on the provisions of The Convention on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (O.E.E.C.) and the Draft Convention on Minimum International Standards Regarding Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage of the International Nuclear Power Agency.</p>

<p>Firstly, provision is made in the Bill for the licensing, by the Atomic Energy Board, of sites used for nuclear installations or certain related purposes and it provides that no person other than the board shall use any site for the purposes of a nuclear installation, except under the authority of a licence granted by the board.</p>

<p>Such licences shall only be granted to a body corporate and will be subject to such conditions as the board may deem necessary in the interests of health and safety.</p>

<p>Provision is made for proper notification to local authorities and other interested bodies when application is made for a licence for such a nuclear site and an opportunity is given for them to make representations to the Atomic Energy Board. Representations can also be made to the State President as far as the promulgation of regulations in terms of the proposed legislation is concerned and whereby, <i>inter alia,</i> the steps to be taken to prevent nuclear incidents (occurrences which cause nuclear damage) from happening may be prescribed.</p>

<p>The board shall keep a list showing every site in respect of which a nuclear site licence has been granted together with maps showing the position and limits of each such site. This list must be available to the public and the public shall be given appropriate notice that these data are available to it for inspection.</p>

<p>We accordingly come to the most important objects and provisions of this Bill namely the question of the liability of the licensee for which provision is made in Clause 5 of the Bill.</p>

<p>In brief this clause provides that the licensee concerned shall be liable for all nuclear damage caused&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) by anything being or done upon such site or by any waste discharge (in whatever form) therefrom; or</li>

<li>(b) by nuclear-hazard material in the course of carriage to or from its site within South Africa&#x2019;s area of jurisdiction (whether it be carried to or from any place outside the Republic)</li>

</ol>

<p>except to the extent to which such nuclear damage is attributable to <i>vis major</i> or where the damage is done to a person or property who is on the site without permission or to any person or his dependants who deliberately caused or deliberately contributed to the cause of such damage.</p>

<p><span class="col_4363-4364" refersTo="page_0756"/>The licensee shall only have a limited right of recourse inasmuch as the damage is caused deliberately by somebody else and also inasmuch as he may have a right of recourse against somebody else in terms of a contract because, as in other countries, the object of proposed legislation here is to canalize liability for nuclear damage as far as possible to a single source, namely the licensee, so that the risk can be covered by one comprehensive policy.</p>

<p>If the right of recourse were to be retained without limitation (and if it were to apply also, for example, to a person who caused damage through negligence) it would mean that contractors and subcontractors of the licensee would also have to cover themselves by way of insurance and that the cost of their premiums (which are usually high) will also be a burden on the licensee which will mean a large additional expense to him. In the case of a nuclear incident there may then be numerous counter-claims which will cause considerable administrative trouble to the insurance companies and which may even jeopardize the payment of claims if it is not possible to determine without doubt which one of the insured is liable.</p>

<p>In order to eliminate endless and costly civil actions, and in order to conserve the sources of insurance cover, all countries who have so far been faced with the problem of obtaining cover for nuclear damage have been obliged to canalize practically all claims for damages to the licensee and to deprive him to a large extent of the right of recourse, including, for example, the right of recourse which he would have had against anybody whose gross negligence was the direct cause of the damage in respect of which damages are claimed. This legal concept which is a striking departure from the age-old legal philosophy concerning lawsuits based on unlawful acts, has also been incorporated in the relevant legislation in the United Kingdom, in the O.E.E.C. Convention, as well as in the Convention of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

<p>Then we have the question of security which is dealt with in Clause 6 of the Bill. As a prerequisite, the applicant for a nuclear site licence must, by way of insurance or in some other approved manner, provide security for a maximum amount of 1110,000,000 to ensure that any claims for which he will be liable will be paid. In each individual case the Minister of Finance has to be consulted as to the manner in which security has to be given, the manner and circumstances in which it shall be made available to any person who has suffered any damage, as well as the amount (the maximum being the R10,000,000 aforesaid) for which such security shall be given. This maximum amount of R 10,000,000 is approximately the same as the maximum which applies in European countries.</p>

<p>Additional security&#x2014;up to R10,000,000&#x2014;can be demanded or the amount of the security can be reduced or the manner in which security has to be given can be changed&#x2014;in all three instances after consultation with the Minister of Finance (Clause 6 (3)).</p>

<p>If, however, a nuclear incident occurs and compensation is claimed in respect thereof, additional security may be claimed in terms of Clause 6 (4), irrespective of the maximum of R 10,000,000, to the extent to which, in the opinion of the Minister, the existing security will be inadequate to cover further nuclear incidents. The idea is, therefore, that it must be ensured that additional security is given for possible future nuclear incidents to the extent to which a nuclear incident which has already occurred has given rise to claims against the existing security.</p>

<p>Clause 7 provides for nuclear incidents to be reported and for the Atomic Energy Board to make note of the details concerning the persons who were concerned in such an incident. These details have to be carefully noted and preserved in order to assist in proving subsequent claims or to dispute false claims. This provision is necessary because of the fact that radio activity only manifests itself after a long period.</p>

<p>Clause 8 provides that in the event of any claims for nuclear damage exceeding the amount of the security given, the State must assist in paying those claims by virtue of the same considerations which would have applied had it been a national catastrophe.</p>

<p>When the maximum amount of the security is decided upon in respect of a nuclear installation, the ability of both the licensee and the insurance market must naturally be taken into account&#x2014;if the last-mentioned has to be approached to provide the cover. The maximum cannot, therefore, be unlimited and, as in the United States, the United Kingdom and elsewhere, the State liability for claims that have been proved is accepted here in principle to the extent to which the total of such claims in any given case exceeds the amount of security given.</p>

<p>In such a case the licensee must immediately notify the Minister in writing giving the details of the total amount, the amount of the claims received and those which have been met, together with an estimate of the number and the amount of any claims which will still have to be met. If the Minister is satisfied that the amount of outstanding claims and the amount of the claims which will probably still be made will exceed the remaining amount of the security he must Table a petition for relief in both Houses of Parliament and, by notice in the <i>Gazette,</i> suspend all further payment of claims until such time as Parliament shall have decided on the petition for relief. If Parliament appropriates any moneys for the payment of such claims no claim may be paid without the approval of the Minister or an order of court.</p>

<p>In terms of Clause 9 no claim for compensation can be instituted if a period of ten years has already elapsed since the incident concerned or since the last event of a succession of occurrences.</p>

<p><span class="col_4365-4366" refersTo="page_0757"/>Clause 10 provides for the appointment of inspectors by the Atomic Energy Board to do inspection work and other duties which are considered necessary for the application of the proposed legislation. Section 15 of the Atomic Energy Act, No. 15 of 1948, applies in this respect which means that the remuneration and other conditions of service relating to the inspectors must be determined in consultation with the Minister of Finance.</p>

<p>Because important research and development works are, <i>inter alia,</i> undertaken at nuclear installations in respect of which, if the details are made public, their chances of being patented may be jeopardized, Clause 11 makes it an offence for any person to disclose any information obtained by him in the exercise of his powers without the authority of the Atomic Energy Board.</p>

<p>Because the Atomic Energy Board will itself operate nuclear installations and because it is a body corporate which can, as a separate entity from the State, summons in its own name and be summonsed, Clause 12 of the Bill places the same liability for nuclear damage on it as is placed on a licensee and it also has to give security for the fulfilment of its obligations and it must also comply with certain other provisions of the contemplated legislation. Penalties are also prescribed in the case of the board.</p>

<p>Clause 13 vests the State President with power to promulgate regulations which relate in particular to the protection of health and safety.</p>

<p>In terms of Section 30 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1948 the Atomic Energy Board must pay all reasonable expenses, including compensation, of any person who, while engaged in any capacity by or on behalf of the board in work connected with prescribed material or any produce thereof, suffers a personal injury or contracts a disease which is attributable to the nature or special properties of such material or product. In view of the fact that the provisions of the proposed legislation may, however, in practice be found to be more advantageous and not as limiting as those of the 1948 Act, Clause 14 of the Bill confers the benefits contained in the proposed new legislation on those employees to the extent to which they do not enjoy them under the 1948 Act.</p>

<p>In terms of Clause 15 the proposed legislation will also apply to South West Africa which, because of the absence of coal and other conventional fuels within its borders, may perhaps be the first area in southern Africa which will use nuclear fuel for the generation of electric power.</p>

<p>Before I conclude I should just like to inform you, Sir, that I intend moving certain amendments in the Committee Stage to Clause 8 of the Bill where the procedure is laid down in paragraphs (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) and in sub-section (3) of the same clause to be followed by the Minister when he appeals to Parliament for relief where, in the event of a nuclear incident, more damage is done than the amount of the security.</p>

<p>The amendments, which will appear on the Order Paper as soon as possible after the second reading, do not differ in principle from the existing sub-sections and are mainly aimed at bringing the contemplated procedure more in line with accepted parliamentary procedure.</p>

<p>In conclusion I wish to emphasize that this Bill covers a field where a great deal has still to be learned. My scientific advisers are satisfied that there is almost no or very little danger of a reactor exploding and that all safety devices which human ingenuity with its present knowledge has devised are being built into reactors. Nevertheless, because of the possibility of anything happening, and because the possibility of harmful gases, rays or materials escaping or being released cannot be regarded as impossible, the proposed legislation is regarded on all sides as essential and I now lay it before the House for consideration.</p>

<p>This is uncontentious legislation. The Minister has explained the Bill in great detail and, as he has said during the course of his second-reading speech, the Bill has been framed after a considerable amount of research. I think the Minister will agree with me that to a large extent it follows the legislation which obtains in Belgium today. The legislation which obtains in other countries using nuclear fission has been followed and we do not propose to delay the passage of this Bill. The Bill, as the Minister has said, provides for the protection of personnel and it is significant that Clause 9 of the Bill provides that a period of ten years is allowed in which actions may be brought, which indicate the very dangerous nature of this material and the necessity for ensuring that the public which may have to be protected should be given the maximum protection possible. The Bill also provides for licensing, which quite rightly is vested in the State to ensure that this new element is under proper control. It provides for regular inspection and it also provides for a report to Parliament, and as the Minister has said, he proposes in the Committee Stage to introduce an amendment to Clause 8 which will provide for certain amendments with regard to the report which will be tabled in Parliament. We support this legislation and we give it our blessing.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill which the hon. the Minister has put forward in great detail is one which I think the House and the country should welcome. I feel that one should place on record the appreciation of the House to the Minister and his Department for the very careful study which they have made of legislation in all parts of the world to ensure that as comprehensive a piece of legislation as possible is placed before the House in regard to this most important aspect of nuclear experimentation and development in South Africa. Although atomic energy was originally <span class="col_4367-4368" refersTo="page_0758"/>conceived for explosive purposes to be used particularly in wartime its uses in peacetime for the benefit of scientific advancement were very quickly realized. This fact was recognized very early after the war and considerable advances were made in countries like the U.S.S.R., Britain and America with regard to development of reactors, more particularly in order to establish power stations operated by atomic power. In fact in 1955 Britain embarked on a ten-year project. The United States, on the other hand, wanted to experiment as much as possible and is still proceeding with a great deal of experimentation. It has also been found that reactors can be used not only for producing power but for other purposes such as therapeutic purposes in medicine, electronics, and other control devices; so from the scientific point of view I think that this Bill was not only necessary but indicates immediately the progressive steps that our scientists are taking in order to bring South Africa abreast of modern atomic and nuclear development. One does appreciate that a great deal of the contents of the Bill will in the course of time require reconsideration and possibly even amendment, not because the powers provided for in this Bill are unsatisfactorily framed but because changes may be introduced in the light of experience gained. The public obviously has to be protected not only against any outfall but it has to be protected against the escape of gases but also against the possibility of the contamination of water which will be discharged from these reactors and flow into our streams and onto the land. The hon. the Minister has made the point that these reactors need not necessarily be placed at extremely great distances from towns, cities and places of habitation. It was thought at one time that reactors should be placed far away from any possible contact with human habitation but there has been a big advance made in this respect in the last seven or eight years, and we understand not only from the Department but from other sources which have conducted research that to-day there are safeguards which do enable us to have a reactor at Pelindaba only 16 or 17 miles away from Pretoria. In fact, talking to a medical man who has done a great deal of research into injuries resulting from radio activity, he seemed somewhat taken aback when I mentioned to him that the reactor at Pelindaba was only 16 or 17 miles away from the city of Pretoria. But I think it is clear to-day that safeguards have been developed which do not make the presence of a reactor so close to a large city the danger which it would appear to be at first glance. In studying this Bill very carefully certain problems have occurred to those who have gone into it. For instance, in Clause 5 (3) it is provided&#x2014;the licensee shall not be liable for nuclear damage to the extent that it is attributable to <i>vis major.</i> One immediately thinks of the possibility of a reactor being struck by lightning or other effects that the elements may have on the reactor, and one wonders whether <i>vis major</i> should be excluded as far as liability is concerned, but it does appear from experiments which have been made that there is no danger of any explosion or any other untoward incident through the effect of the elements on the reactor and on what it produces. I do believe, however, that that is a matter which will have to engage the attention of the Department. The other question, which was an obvious one and which might have been raised perhaps by other speakers who unfortunately have not got back to the House yet because of private business, is the fact that the amount of security has been limited to R 10,000,000. Sir, I accept what the hon. the Minister has said namely that we are following the precedent laid down by other great countries who have limited the amount of security to R 10,000,000. It is obviously impossible really to fix a figure at all. I presume that some norm must be laid down at this stage, however, and only time will tell whether the amount of security should be increased or not. I should also like to know from the Minister whether it is intended under this Bill to have discussion with insurance companies so as to arrange for some pool with regard to the security that will have to be provided. Obviously it will have to come from insurance. I should also like to know what steps the Department is going to take to get the insurance companies in principle to accept this large liability, a type of liability which they must obviously view with a good deal of caution. The Bill does provide, of course, that the Minister will report to the House with regard to any excessive liability which the licensee may have to face over and above the figure of R 10,000,000.</p>

<p>The other question which is also one which must cause some concern is the question of the limitation of the period for the institution of actions to ten years. One hopes that that will be an adequate period. One would only be able to tell after the passage of time whether this period is sufficient. But one understands from the results of the unfortunate incident in wartime Hiroshima that although a much longer period than ten years has elapsed, the effects of radiation are still being experienced there and that in fact it may even lead to hereditary defects in individuals. It may carry on from generation to generation. It is impossible to say therefore whether the period of ten years provided for here is long enough. As the reactor is obviously an experimental one and will be used for peaceful purposes and will not set off the type of explosion to which Hiroshima was subjected it is possible that ten years may prove an adequate period, but I do feel that this is one of the matters which will have to be taken into account.</p>

<p>Then I would like to know from the Minister whether any contact will be made with the large local authorities, particularly the local authorities in close proximity to these reactors and whether regulations will be published either through their health laws or under this measure to ensure that the public has adequate <span class="col_4369-4370" refersTo="page_0759"/>protection with regard to the escape of any matter into the streams or onto the land with detrimental effects upon human beings and upon agriculture. Sir, we do know that in so far as atomic power is concerned we have sufficient coal supplies, particularly in the northern areas, to make it unnecessary for us to contemplate the establishment of atomic power plants at this stage. It might well be a matter, however, for consideration around the coastal belt of the country, and I wonder whether the Minister contemplates that steps will be taken in that direction, in terms of the powers granted in this Bill, to ensure the establishment of some form of atomic power plant in the Republic. Atomic power plants are already being erected in Britain and by 1970 will probably be the main source of power supply because it has been found that it will be more economical in a country like Britain than the supply of power from conventional fuel. We on the other hand have the advantage of enormous coal supplies which will make it unnecessary in the interior of South Africa, although it might well be a matter for consideration in the coastal areas.</p>

<p>We feel that this legislation is certainly timeous; it is legislation which this country should have, and we can only express the sincere hope that after the careful attention which has been given to this matter, as this Bill demonstrates, care and caution will continued to be exercised; that continued consideration will be given to the matter from year to year, and that Parliament will be apprised from time to time of the advances we are making and the effectiveness of the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I should like briefly to thank hon. members on the other side for the support that they have given to this important Bill. I think they support it because we are all agreed that South Africa can still play a leading role in the world in the sphere of the production and the processing of uranium. Our uranium-bearing areas are amongst the largest in the world; we already have quite a number of trained scientists of a very high calibre and we are still training more scientists for this important research. I believe that South Africa, with the means at its disposal, is capable of great achievements, particularly in the sphere of the peacetime use of uranium. We are in this privileged position that while many other countries are spending large sums of money and devoting a great deal of time to research into the wartime use of uranium, we are able to concentrate our energies on the great possibilities of the peacetime use of this wonderful source of power. I am thinking here, for example, not only of the ordinary generation of power but of the very great importance of radio isotopes in the agricultural industry, in secondary industry, in the medical sphere and in other spheres. We are only at the threshold of a new era. One is amazed at what has been achieved already in the sphere of nuclear physics. The possibilities for the world are so staggering that I think we would be amazed if we could look just ten or 15 or 20 years into the future and see what use is still going to be made and can be made of uranium.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida has mentioned a few matters here, some of which can be discussed in the Committee Stage. It is very difficult to give a definite reply at this stage to some of his questions. We are only at the initial stage at present and we shall have to learn from experience over this ten-year period. As far as the R 10,000,000 security is concerned I just want to say, as I also said in my second-reading speech, that it is admittedly a large sum of money and that that is also the amount on which other countries have agreed, as the hon. member has correctly said. In the second place we must take into account the ability of the licensee to pay the premium. The premium is enormously high; it is R20,000 on R 10,000,000. I also want to say that we have already been in touch with insurance companies with regard to the establishment of a pool for this type of insurance.</p>

<p>As far as his last point is concerned, the question of co-operation with local authorities, I just want to refer to Clause 3 in which provision is made that before the granting of the licence there must be consultation with the local authorities. There will be consultation, where necessary, with all bodies, including local authorities, because we are dealing here with a matter involving the health and the safety of the public.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The introduction of this Bill gives me very great pleasure because it is the culmination of many years of hard work and thorough study by a large number of experts and interested persons who are undoubtedly going to contribute a great deal towards making worthy artisans in the true sense of the word of our young people.</p>

<p>Because of the tremendous industrial expansion that we have already experienced and are going to experience to an even greater extent in the future, it has become clear that we will have to adapt our training techniques to the modern development so that our artisans who have to keep the wheels of industry moving will have that expert knowledge to enable them to do their work properly. But not only this; we want the skill of our artisans <span class="col_4371-4372" refersTo="page_0760"/>to be accompanied by a higher standard of education. It is undeniably true that knowledge is power and in this modern age where competition in every sphere is becoming keener, it is also necessary for attention to be given to the academic training of our future artisans.</p>

<p>It has been felt for some time that the present Apprenticeship Act does not comply with all these requirements. The Act was passed in 1944 and came into operation on 12 March 1945. Together with its predecessor this Act has enabled us to train more than 170,000 apprentices. But the development in the technological sphere has advanced by such leaps and bounds over the period of 18 years during which the Act has been in operation that we were compelled to think along more modern and more advanced lines because we realized that there was much room for improvement in our training system. That realization, particularly having regard to representations which were made from time to time for a general revision of our apprenticeship system, caused the then Minister of Labour to decide in September 1958 to instruct the National Apprenticeship Board to investigate the existing apprenticeship system and to make recommendations for its improvement. The board then appointed a committee of inquiry of its own members to do the preparatory work in this connection. An invitation to all interested parties to submit their views was published in the Press in October 1958, and personal invitations were also sent to all federations, employers&#x2019; organizations and trade unions, to trade unions which were not affiliated to the federations, to all Government Departments, the Chamber of Mines, the various Chambers of Industry, all municipal associations, apprenticeship committees, youth councils and the Public Service Commission. You will realize, therefore, Mr. Speaker, that we approached all those bodies who were likely to be able to make some contribution in this connection. The response to this invitation of ours was extremely encouraging&#x2014; so much so that it took the committee of inquiry nearly two years to sift out all the comments that it received, to sum them up and, where possible, to tabulate the information in order to determine the value of the various opinions and proposals. I may perhaps just mention that apart from the representations from the various organizations to which I referred, comments were also received from no fewer than 23 private persons.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that all the divergent opinions and proposals were of real assistance to the National Apprenticeship Board in finding a solution to the practical problems experienced in the application and administration of the Act. The board eventually submitted its report in September 1960, and that report was tabled in this House last session. Hon. members who found time to read the report will agree, I think, that the National Apprenticeship Board made a thorough investigation and also made well-founded recommendations for the improvement of our apprenticeship system.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the proposed amendments in this Bill have a twofold purpose. The first is to remedy the defects in the existing Act in order to eliminate administrative difficulties. The second is to implement certain of the recommendations of the board. The provisions dealing with administrative difficulties concern matters such as the appointment of an Assistant Apprenticeship Registrar, the composition and dissolution of apprenticeship committees and sub-committees, the making up of lost time, the transfer of apprentices and so forth. I think the House will agree that it is not necessary for me at this stage to take up the time of the House in dealing with these matters. We can discuss them very fruitfully at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>The other provisions of the Bill refer directly to the training of apprentices and are designed to make better qualified and better trained artisans available to industry. The most important provisions are perhaps those contained in Clause 11 of the Bill which amends Section 16 of the principal Act. Hon. members will observe, however, that the provisions as such do not reveal very much, because in conformity with the pattern that has been followed in the existing Act, they are merely enabling provisions. They empower the Minister, after consultation with the apprenticeship committees and on the recommendation of the National Apprenticeship Board to prescribe certain conditions of training.</p>

<p>In view of that fact and in fairness to hon. members who are interested in this matter, I think it is no more than right that I should give the House a full explanation of the most important aims of the Apprenticeship Board&#x2014;aims with which I am in full agreement. As hon. members know, the position is that when apprentices are placed under contract under the present system they receive a certain reduction in the prescribed period of training in respect of their pre-apprenticeship academic achievements. Let me give an example. A lad with a National Technical Junior Certificate is at present entitled to a reduction of seven months and a lad with a National Senior Certificate (Technology) has his period of training reduced by ten months under the present setup. But in considering this matter the Apprenticeship Board felt that a reduction in the prescribed period of training should not be granted simply because a person desiring to become apprenticed possesses certain educational qualifications. The granting of such a reduction is regarded as being most arbitrary because the possession of such a certificate does not necessarily prove greater skill.</p>

<p>It was the general opinion of the board that an apprentice should rather earn a reduction in his period of training by undergoing a trade test at such stage of his period of training as may be determined by his educational qualifications. In other words, the period of training of an apprentice with a National Technical <span class="col_4373-4374" refersTo="page_0761"/>Junior Certificate will in future not automatically be reduced by seven months but he will be allowed to undergo a voluntary trade test after having served 3&#x00BD; years of a five-year apprenticeship. In the same way, an apprentice who is in possession of the National Senior Certificate (Technology) will not receive an automatic reduction of ten months but will be entitled to undergo a voluntary trade test after <i>2</i>&#x00BD; years. In this way, Mr. Speaker, the periods of training will not be automatically reduced on account of scholastic achievements but apprentices will have to serve their full contract period unless they pass a qualifying trade test at an earlier stage.</p>

<p>Another aspect in regard to which we have considerable changes in mind is the question of attendance at classes at technical colleges. Of course there are some apprentices living in rural areas who cannot attend technical colleges and who of necessity have to study through the medium of correspondence courses. Although the remarks that I now propose to make relate mainly to technical colleges they are also to a large extent applicable to these correspondence students.</p>

<p>The position at the moment is that an apprentice is compelled to attend technical classes for a minimum period of two years and his employer is compelled to allow him to attend these classes during ordinary working hours for eight hours on one day in the week or four hours on two days in the week at full remuneration. The apprentice is compelled to attend classes until he has passed the N.T.C. II, or at least two subjects, one of which must be trade theory. Once he has that qualification, he need no longer attend classes. But, Mr. Speaker, experience has proved over and over again that the vast majority of apprentices are not interested in their technical studies in spite of the fact that after the first two years they have to attend classes in their own time and in spite of the fact that if they attend 75 per cent of the total number of classes, the class fees which were deducted from their wages are refunded to them. This is an unfortunate fact, but unfortunately we have to deal with facts here. The result is that they never pass an examination but nevertheless have to attend classes for the full period of training. Because they do not want to learn but are compelled to sit at a desk their presence in class is a constant source of irritation to the lecturers and to the small group of apprentices who take their studies seriously.</p>

<p>That type of apprentice is keenly aware of the fact that artisan status does not depend upon the passing of any test at all; nor does he see any reason why he should put himself out in the least. Indeed, the employers&#x2019; organizations expressed the opinion that such apprentices regard the daily classes as a challenge to them to play truant without being caught or as a golden opportunity to avoid the practical work in the workshops on one or.two days in the week.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Mr. Speaker, the intention is that the attendance at classes in the employer&#x2019;s time, after the first year&#x2014;I want to emphasize this&#x2014;after the first year, will be dependent upon a satisfactory report from the technical college. In other words, as long as an apprentice continues to make satisfactory progress, he will be allowed to attend classes during normal working hours even though he has already obtained the minimum educational qualification.</p>

<p>In pursuance of what I have just said, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that apprentices who do not want to learn or cannot learn&#x2014;I agree that there are some of them who conduct themselves in the manner that I have just indicated not because they do not want to learn but simply because they are not able to learn&#x2014;will in future be expected to attend classes for two years, the first year in the employer&#x2019;s time and the second year in their own time. If at the end of the second year they have not yet obtained their N.T.C. I, they will not be compelled to attend any futher classes. Those two years will simply have been a waste of time and money.</p>

<p>I must admit that there is a sting in this concession because apprentices who have not obtained the N.T.C. II or who have not passed at least a trade theory test of N.T.C. II standard, will not be permitted to undergo a voluntary trade test. In other words, the first opportunity that they will receive to show their ability will be at the end of their period of training when they will have to undergo a compulsory test. I shall give the House more details in regard to this compulsory test within the next few minutes.</p>

<p>The proposal in connection with trade tests, Mr. Speaker, is an important departure from the present procedure but before I elaborate any further in this regard I want to tell the House something about the background to this matter.</p>

<p>I think that it is generally known that the vast majority of apprentices gain artisan status through the passage of time, and the question as to whether they are qualified artisans who are fully qualified in the true sense of the word can seldom be answered with any certainty. That is particularly so in the case of artisans in the rural areas where employers often do not have the necessary equipment and where the type of work does not vary sufficiently to train an apprentice properly in all the facets of his trade. Unfortunately, we also find employers here and there who do not have the interests of their apprentices at heart but place them in skilled employment at the lowest possible wages in order to make the maximum profit. These apprentices serve their period of apprenticeship and are then supposed to be qualified, but in fact they are not. Such people are very often a danger to the public and perhaps also an encumbrance to themselves and their employers. It is our intention to act a little more strictly in this connection.</p>

<p>Under the proposed procedure we intend rewriting the practical training courses for all the recognized trades in such a way that every facet of the trade in which training has to be <span class="col_4375-4376" refersTo="page_0762"/>given will be clearly shown. It is our intention to introduce logbooks. Logbooks will be issued to apprentices and they will be obliged to indicate in those logbooks by way of symbols precisely what training they have received. Copies of these notes will then be sent by their employers at the end of the quarter to the relevant apprenticeship committees.</p>

<p>Besides this, Mr. Speaker, it is our intention to appoint an adequate number of apprenticeship inspectors. These inspectors who are to be appointed will be trained technically and will be able to keep a watchful eye on the workshop training of apprentices. On their visits they will peruse the logbooks of the apprentices and they will have interviews with employers and also with apprentices. If it appears that an apprentice is not being properly trained, it will be the duty of the inspector to draw the attention of the employer to this fact and in the case of the apprenticeship committees, this has to be reported to the committee for further action. If the inspector feels that the committee is not succeeding in its efforts to induce an employer to improve his training facilities, the Apprenticeship Registrar may cancel that contract of apprenticeship and transfer that apprentice to another employer with whom he will be able to receive suitable training.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, hon. members are probably aware of the fact that since the 1951 amendment of the Act we have introduced compulsory qualifying trade tests in certain trades at the end of the penultimate year of apprenticeship. It is our intention now to postpone these compulsory tests until the end of the final year and also to introduce voluntary tests. Briefly the system will work as follows in practice: An apprentice may apply to undergo a voluntary trade test after he has received the necessary practical instruction during his prescribed training period. This period is determined of course in accordance with his academic achievements and pre-apprenticeship experience. In this connection I refer hon. members to the report of the Apprenticeship Board where they will obtain more details in this regard. But no apprentice will be permitted to undergo a voluntary test unless he has at least passed a trade theory test of N.T.C. II standard. If he passes the voluntary test he immediately gains artisan status, but if he fails, he may again undergo one or more voluntary tests. If he is unsuccessful in all those tests, he will have to serve his full contract period, and at the end of that period he will have to undergo a compulsory test. If he passes the compulsory test he will, of course, be recognized as a full-fledged artisan, but if he fails it will be a clear proof of his ineptitude because the compulsory test&#x2014;and I want to emphasize this fact&#x2014; may only consist of practical work and not theory.</p>

<p>This is an important change in our present system where a person gains artisan status through the passage of time, but I ask you, Mr. Speaker, is it right that a man who cannot even pass a practical test should be let loose in industry as a qualified artisan? I do not think so and the National Apprenticeship Board does not think so either, and I hope that this House agrees with us. That is why it has now been decided that an apprentice who fails this test will have to serve an additional year in a five-year training period. During that time he will however be entitled to apply for another voluntary test and, if he is not successful he will have to serve the full year. Only after that will he gain artisan status through the passage of time.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although it is certainly not the ideal that we are striving for, it is felt that the apprentice will be able to concentrate on his weak points during the additional period to such an extent that he will be able to become a useful artisan in the course of time. We were hesitant&#x2014;and I want to mention it here&#x2014;to make this concession enabling an apprentice to achieve artisan status through the passage of time, because, after all, if a man maintains that he is a qualified artisan, he ought to be able to prove that he has passed his final practical examination. That is obviously necessary. It will interest hon. members to know that 67 per cent of the organizations which gave evidence before the National Apprenticeship Board declared themselves in favour of the proposition that the granting of artisan status should be subject to a qualifying test while only 33 per cent of the witnesses advocated that artisan status should continue to be granted as it is at the moment, that is to say, through the passage of time.</p>

<p>We were prepared to make this concession because in the first place it is the first time in the history of our apprenticeship system that we are going to try to make artisan status subject to a final qualifying test. In the second place we were prepared to make the concession because it was recommended by the National Apprenticeship Board as a compromise in the light of the objections of a certain section of the trade union movement. I refer here to the Mechanics Union&#x2019;s Joint Executive and the Trade Union Council. According to their representatives on the National Apprenticeship Board, these two organizations had no objection to a qualifying trade test at the end of the final year of apprenticeship but they were strongly opposed to withholding artisan status from any person who has served his prescribed period of training, even though that person has failed his final examination. In other words, in the view of these people a man must be given artisan status whether he passes or fails his final test. These same organizations&#x2014;and it is interesting to note this fact&#x2014;were even more strongly opposed to extending the period of training of an apprentice when he fails his final test. Their main argument was that a person would be branded if his apprenticeship contract was endorsed to the effect that he had to serve an additional year before he became an artisan, and that employers would give preference to persons who obtained their artisan status through the medium of a qualifying test. That was the <span class="col_4377-4378" refersTo="page_0763"/>argument advanced by these two organizations. The representatives of these two organizations on the National Apprenticeship Board stated that they would rather have the original period of training increased and then reduced if an examination was passed successfully.</p>

<p>But, Mr. Speaker, with all due respect for the opinions of those organizations, I cannot understand what difference it will make as far as the final result is concerned. If a young man is going to be branded because it has taken him six years to learn a five-year trade, surely that same stigma is going to cling to the person who has entered into a six-year contract and has not been able to shorten his period of training by passing a trade test at an earlier stage. I cannot understand the opposition of that section of the trade union movement because the artisans in the engineering industry in particular have been agitating professional status for a number of years now and yet in this instance they are opposed to one of the most important aspects of professionalism&#x2014;proof of qualification. I cannot imagine any professional man being allowed to practise unless he has passed his final examination. Can you imagine. Mr. Speaker, a man being permitted to practise as an attorney or a doctor or an architect if he has not passed his final examination? And yet these two trade union federations insist that persons who have completed their normal apprenticeship without achieving any success in practical tests should be let loose in industry irrespective of how capable or incapable they are.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, now that I have told this hon. House about the opposition to these two important recommendations by these two trade union federations, I hope you will allow me to outline the other side of the picture as well. Amongst those who were in favour of the new proposals were the employers in two of our largest industies in the country&#x2014;the motor industry and the metal industry. But they were not the only ones who declared themselves to be in favour of these recommendations in their evidence before the National Apprentice-ship Board. The S.A. Federated Chamber of Industries also supported them; the Afrikaanse Handelsinstituut also supported them; the Railway Administration and the Department of Education, Arts and Science also supported them.</p>

<p>But besides these employers and State institutions there is a large section of the trade union movement that supports these provisions. Here I want to refer the House to the Confederation of Trade Unions, a Confederation consisting of three Federations and representing 160,000 workers. They are entirely in favour of these provisions.</p>

<p>As I have already indicated, of the 12 members constituting the National Apprenticeship Board, only one member objected to these specific recommendations.</p>

<p>But I want to explain to the House and also to the objectors that after careful consideration we have decided to protect apprentices against a stigma as far as possible, a stigma which may cling to them as a result of the additional year that they have to serve. You will note that in Clause 23 of the Bill powers are being asked for in terms of which certificates of competency can be issued to apprentices who have completed their studies in terms of the regulations. The form that this certificate will take is still under consideration but it is the intention to word it in such a way that it will serve as a proof of artisan status without revealing the fact that an artisan failed his final test and had to serve an additional year. In order to be able to differentiate between artisans who pass an artisan test and those who obtain artisan status through the passage of time we might possibly consider the question of issuing two different certificates as is the case under the Training of Artisans Act.</p>

<p>Besides this, we also intend to amend the form of the contract in such a way that it will contain no specific reference to the fact that an artisan had to study for an additional year because he failed his trade test. I think that in this way we are going as far as possible to assist those apprentices who fail and have to serve an additional year by protecting them from any stigma because we have a great deal of sympathy for the type of young person who is sometimes not able to pass these examinations, and it is not our intention to allow them to go through their whole lives with such a stigma. I think that this proposal ought to be regarded as a great concession in their case.</p>

<p>But I want to make it perfectly clear that the provisions in connection with artisan tests and the conditions of training in terms of Section 16 of the Act can be implemented only on the recommendation of the National Apprenticeship Board after consultation with the apprenticeship committees concerned. The passing of this Bill therefore will not automatically mean the incorporation of these recommendations. I am merely seeking the power to be able to take steps when industry approaches us for the implementation of this proposed legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, although we are now going to tighten up the provisions a little in connection with the training of apprentices in workshops and their studies at technical colleges, it is nevertheless our intention to make the conditions of service far more attractive, not only to attract more young men to the trade but also to encourage them to devote more attention to their technical studies.</p>

<p>In the first place, the National Apprenticeship Board recommended that the present system in terms of which apprentices are remunerated should be done away with. At present every industry prescribes its own wage scales for apprentices and those wages are written into the contract of apprenticeship. Generally speaking, the wages are not very high and the starting wages are particularly low; the wages stipulated in the contract are not periodically increased either as the apprentice <span class="col_4379-4380" refersTo="page_0764"/>progresses but remain practically static for the duration of the contract. The result is that these wages provide no incentive for young men to enroll as apprentices. Many of our young men who start work after leaving school are compelled to assist their parents financially and the result is that instead of their becoming apprentices they may prefer perhaps to become operators or lorry drivers and in this way our artisan potential suffers a great loss. Our intention is to remunerate them on a percentage basis in the future, a percentage of artisan wages. In this way an apprentice to a five-year trade will, during his first year, receive 30 per cent of the wages of a qualified artisan: in his second year, 35 per cent: during his third year, 40 per cent and during the fourth and fifth years, 50 per cent. In practice this will not only mean that apprentices will be able to draw higher wages, but their wages will also be raised if the artisans receive an increase in wages through the medium of wage agreements. I may just mention that an apprentice who does not pass his final trade test and who has to serve an additional year, will, during that additional year, receive 70 per cent and not 50 per cent of an artisan&#x2019;s wage.</p>

<p>Apart from the basic wages which we are proposing to improve it is our intention too to pay apprentices what may be termed an incentive bonus to encourage them to continue their studies. These bonuses may vary from a minimum of 50 cents per week for an apprentice with a Std. IX certificate and R1.50 for an apprentice with a National Technical Certificate, to as much as R2.50 per week for an apprentice with a National Senior Certificate. Apart from these bonuses a lad who is really interested in his studies, who excels and who obtains a National Diploma, will receive an increase of R4 per week over and above his basic wage.</p>

<p>But we are going even further. I have already said that a lad who fails his Technical College examination after he has attended classes for one year in his own time, will not be expected to attend further classes. But where a lad wants to work and obtains a certificate from the Technical College every year as proof of satisfactory progress, he will be permitted to attend classes in his employer&#x2019;s time during his full period of training at full remuneration.</p>

<p>Another concession that we are making is in connection with military training. Under the amended Defence Act all ballotees are now being called up for a continuous period of nine months&#x2019; military training and although it is our policy as far as possible not to call up apprentices during their period of training, it does happen that some of them sign on voluntarily and are therefore called up. This means that for nine months they cannot undergo training in their ordinary trade. On the recommendation of the National Apprenticeship Board it has been decided that apprentices will only have to make up for five months of that period of nine months during which they do military service; in other words, in the future they will receive a remission of 120 days instead of the 72 days per annum prescribed by the Act at the moment.</p>

<p>Another important matter for which this Bill makes provision is that all those intending to enter into a contract of apprenticeship will have to register with the Department of Labour. This is a particularly important provision because its purpose is twofold. In the first place all these young men who are registered with the Department of Labour will have to undergo an aptitude test which will be conducted by our professional extension officers in order to ascertain the particular type of work for which they have a flair. This will to a large extent eliminate the difficulty of what is generally called &#x201C;square pegs in round holes&#x201D;, or the right man in the wrong place. From these aptitude tests we will be able to ascertain the aptitude of a young man so that he can be properly advised as to the direction and trade he should follow. The second purpose of this amendment is to have the names and qualifications and suitability of all aspirant apprentices available at central offices of the Department of Labour. Employers will then not have to search for suitable apprentices but will merely have to telephone the departmental office for a suitable boy or girl and, similarly, the apprentice himself will not have to go from one employer to another looking for work; the Department will be able to give him the necessary advice.</p>

<p>Then I should just like to refer to Clause 24 of the Bill which amends Section 7 of the Training of Artisans Act. In terms of that Act provision can be made for the training of an adult person as an artisan and for the passing of a trade test by such a person but the difficulty is that the Act provides that a person who has served his apprenticeship under the Apprenticeship Act does not qualify for such training or test, and in this respect an important amendment is being made here. We often find that a qualified artisan wants to prove his ability by passing a trade test under the Training of Artisans Act but because he has served his period of training under the Apprenticeship Act he is not permitted to do so. One also sometimes finds that a person who has been trained under the Apprenticeship Act as an electrical wireman, for example, may desire, because of his contract with the work, to be trained as an electrician, a trade in which he has already gained experience. He now has to pass a test in order to qualify as an electrician. But he is prevented from doing so because he has been trained under the Apprenticeship Act. That is unfair. This provision was inserted in the Training of Artisans Act at the time because of objections by the trade union movement, or so I think, but it has appeared to be a very impracticable measure and we want to assist these people as far as we can.</p>

<p>I mention these details merely to draw the attention of hon. members to all the measures that we intend taking in order to attract apprentices <span class="col_4381-4382" refersTo="page_0765"/>to industry and I want to say that we will give them every opportunity to be successful. I sincerely trust that the powers for which we are asking will enable us to succeed in our main aim. In conclusion I want to sum up our main aim as follows&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) In this Bill our aim is to produce better qualified artisans;</li>

<li>(b) It is our aim to give our young people who have the necessary intelligence and the necessary ability the opportunity to qualify sooner and thus to strengthen our manpower;</li>

<li>(c) Thirdly, our aim is to ensure that those young people with a below-average intelligence and ability will also be given an opportunity in life;</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">we also want to enable them to stand on their own two feet in a world where competition is not becoming weaker but more and more keen.</block>

<p>Because representations have continually been made over the years for an improvement in our apprenticeship system I want to ask the House to give these new recommendations a fair test. I can give hon. members the assurance that I, or whoever has to deal with the Ministry of Labour, will not hesitate to come to this House again to ask for an amendment of this measure if it appears in practice that these provisions are not having the desired effect. We trust that this Bill will be considered in that spirit because I personally am convinced that this Bill will assist in giving us a better trained labour force which will be to the great advantage of the development of the country.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. Deputy Minister has given us a very good outline of what he intends doing as a result of the report submitted to him by the National Apprenticeship Board in regard to improvements in the apprenticeship system. I think, however, that the Deputy Minister will be the first to appreciate the difficulty that the Opposition faces in dealing with this problem in the light of the fact that the majority of the recommendations made by the board do not require legislative enactment&#x2014;they will be achieved by administrative action. The result is of course that the Bill does not contain any reference to some of the recommendations that the hon. Minister has accepted, and therefore in the Committee Stage we will not be in a position to deal with those in detail. We therefore have to deal with them during the second-reading debate. But this is the first indication we have had of those recommendations which the Minister has accepted which do not form part and parcel of this Bill, and it would appear that it would have been a far better proposition if the Minister had presented this House with a White Paper setting out which of the recommendations he was accepting. We would then have been in a far better position to assess and to debate this issue with him at the second reading, seeing that some of these most important recommendations do not form part of the Bill. Therefore my first criticism is one of detail in respect of the way in which the Minister has presented this Bill to the House. I think it is a very important point because of what is happening in respect of our apprenticeship system, and I think I should start my comments by bringing to the attention of the Minister something which I think is basic to this whole question of apprenticeships and the artisans&#x2019; future. I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to an article which appeared in the <i>Natal Mercury</i> on Wednesday, 10 April of this year. It is headed &#x201C;South Africa scraping bottom of the pot for apprentices&#x201D;. This is how it reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A careful, comparative analysis of the educational aptitudes of 2,000 apprentices over a period of six years has caused shock and alarm throughout Government and industrial circles, and any result flowing from its suggestions could have considerable impact on the future economy of the country.</block>

<p>I think it is generally admitted that in a country which depends so much for its future on its industrial expansion, the manpower we have to get by way of apprenticeship is one of the greatest importance and significance. I quote further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The report, sponsored by the Institute of Combined Certificated Mechanical and Electrical Engineers, was compiled by Mr. W. M. de Waard, headmaster of the Apprentice School of the Natal Technical College.</block>

<p>Here is a man who has a very wide knowledge of the subject and what he has to say about it is of considerable importance and has considerable bearing on this whole question of amendments to the Apprenticeship Act&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In an interview yesterday, Mr. de Waard pointed out that he was in no way a reformer. &#x201C;I am merely reporting the facts of about six years&#x2019; careful research.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The report shows that:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) South Africa is scraping the bottom of the pot for apprentices;</li>

<li>(2) in spite of almost five years of constant education, apprentices rarely improve their educational standard.</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">Mr. de Waard said that of 822 apprentices enrolled at his school in 1962, about 72 per cent had Std. VI or Std. VII education certificates.</block>

<p>Then he deals with the failures, and I think this is the aspect we should concern ourselves with particularly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Of 662 apprentices who completed their training in 1958 or later, 392, or 59 per cent, failed to gain a certificate, 5 per cent received only an elementary certificate and a further 15 per cent passed a National Certificate I.</block>

<p>That means that only 15 per cent in respect of this grouping will in terms of the amendment <span class="col_4383-4384" refersTo="page_0766"/>now indicated by the Minister be enabled to take the trade test before they complete their five years&#x2019; apprenticeship. In other words, the number that is going to be in a position to take a qualified trade test earlier than five years is going to be very small indeed because of the qualification the Minister has laid down that no apprentice unless he has got a National Technical Certificate II or a pass in trade theory of that standard will qualify to take a voluntary trade test before the end of his fifth year. The importance of these failures can therefore be seen in the scheme as outlined by the Minister. I continue to quote&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">These ex-apprentices were now classed as artisans and were drawn from three main sources&#x2014;general engineering (231), South African Railways (227) and the motor industry (204).<br/>Mr. de Waard said that while the percentage of students gaining the ordinary National Certificate in Engineering in Britain was 25 per cent, in South Africa the figure was 8 per cent. He said that the ability of many apprentices to do simple arithmetic was so low that it was necessary to teach Std. VI arithmetic.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if that is the position, I want to ask the hon. Minister whether he is accepting one of the recommendations of the Apprenticeship Board that the academic qualification must be lifted from Std. VI to Std. VII. The Minister gave no indication in his speech whether or not this recommendation was to be accepted. But the problem I am faced with if the Minister is accepting it, is that there are many youngsters who have only passed Std. VI, but who, had they had the opportunity, could easily have passed matric, and if the educational standard were to be lifted to Std. VII, it would mean that they would either have to go to school for a further year, or they would not be able to be apprenticed. The question then arises why children who have passed Std. VI and who cannot continue at school for a further year, should be eliminated. There we come against the question of economics again. It is a problem which we have got to face if we are going to solve the overall problem of getting the right type of youngster to come in as apprentices. But the final part of the report I have referred to gives what Mr. de Waard said he would like to propose. He says that he would like to propose a scheme for the country&#x2019;s less gifted children at the age of about 14&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Those who wished to become artisans would be enrolled at training centres, where workship practice would form the major part of the programme. A similar system is in existence in France. The duration of training would be four years and one subsequent year of improvership in industry without compulsory attendance should give artisan status. It would give the boy a chance to enter the most suitable trade instead of drifting into one as was at present often the case.</block>

<p>Well, Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether that is a worthwhile proposition but the fact remains that we have to face up to this problem of how to get youngsters into apprenticeship in a way that it is made possible for them to become first-class artisans. The Minister has indicated that he proposes to deal with this matter in two ways, firstly, that all apprentices will be registered as prospective apprentices and secondly, that they will have to pass aptitude tests. This is placing a tremendous responsibility upon those who have to compile the aptitude tests. It also indicates that the Minister has accepted, or the Department has accepted, that aptitude testing is something that we can rely upon entirely, but we are up against problems in that regard that I will deal with later on.</p>

<p>But I now want to deal in more detail with two aspects of the report which I feel require a lot of consideration by the House. I, like the Minister, went through the report and the recommendations of the National Apprenticeship Board in regard to this revision of our apprenticeship system, and my first criticism there is in respect of the delay which has taken place. This committee was appointed in 1958 and they submitted their report to the Minister in September 1960, that is to say, <i>2</i>&#x00BD; years ago, and here we are to-day dealing with the Bill. I do not know what has caused this long delay, but in view of the seriousness of the position this delay is very unfortunate. I think the Minister should tell us in reply to the debate why this has been held up for <i>2</i>&#x00BD; years. Because some of the recommendations which the Minister has accepted could have been brought into effect administratively almost immediately. They do not require legislation. As far as I am aware none of the measures the Deputy Minister has indicated he is accepting and which could be brought about as the result of the administrative action, have been actually brought about by administration action, and I ask the Minister to tell us the reason for this delay.</p>

<p>This report, I think, is a very valuable survey of the problems associated with our apprenticeship system, but taken in conjunction with the annual reports submitted by the Department of Labour, I think we also have got to accept that the whole position of the apprenticeship system is grave indeed.</p>

<p>Some of the recommendations have been accepted by the Minister, as I have indicated earlier on and they are embodied in the Bill&#x2014;some require legislation and some do not. But I now wish to deal with two of the recommendations which have been accepted and are given legal effect to in the Bill before the House.</p>

<p>The first of the amendments is in Clause 11. The Deputy Minister referred to this as being the most important clause in the Bill. It contains a provision which will enable the Deputy Minister to extend the period of apprenticeship <span class="col_4385-4386" refersTo="page_0767"/>in the case where an apprentice fails to pass the trade test during his normal period of apprenticeship. One year has been suggested by the Minister, but the provision in this Bill of course enables the Minister to lay down a longer period than one year. He has not restricted himself to one year at all. He has suggested in his speech that he does not intend to go further than one year, but I think it would be better if the Bill stipulated that the period of extension cannot exceed one year over and above the normal period of apprenticeship. The wording there indicates that the Minister has very wide discretion, and I say again that in his opening speech he has indicated one year, but there is nothing to prevent him from making it 18 months or even two years.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, so it appears, but I think we should have something more definite in the Bill itself in respect to the extent to which the Minister can go in extending the period of apprenticeship where an apprentice fails in the fifth year, or whatever year it is, to pass the trade test.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. Minister has gone into this question of this extra year very fully. The Minister did indicate that there was a difference of opinion on the committee and that certain of the trade unions opposed the extension of a further year of apprenticeship and that the proposal which the Minister is now submitting to us is the result of a compromise in this regard. I think one point which the Minister should have made, and which as far as I know is one of the main issues as far as the trade union movement is concerned, is that they would be prepared to accept not only the position of every apprentice passing a trade test before becoming an artisan and further the extension of a year to enable him to do that, but the proviso that they put forward was that the Minister should not permit any apprentice who fails to qualify from practising in the trade at all. Now this is a very important consideration, and I think the Minister will agree it would place the trade union movement in an impossible position if they were to agree that only apprentices who have passed a trade test could become artisans, then subsequently discovering that all who had failed could practise as artisans and possibly work at a rate far less than that laid down for artisans. So I think this aspect is one which we have to consider and we should not condemn the trade union movement for being tardy in accepting the further period of apprenticeship, or for their objection to an apprentice only becoming an artisan as a result of qualifying by way of a trade test. One can see the danger in which the whole trade union movement would be involved if there were two groups, those who have served their apprenticeship and failed and therefore could not become artisans, competing with those who have passed and who have become artisans, employed in the same field of work. That is an important issue and I think it explains why the trade union movement had difficulty in respect of the Minister&#x2019;s proposals. But I think that the compromise which has been reached is reasonable. I think also the fact that what is revealed in other reports to which I shall come presently in respect of the percentage of passes also indicates that we would be in an impossible position if we were to insist that only apprentices who have passed a trade test could become artisans.</p>

<p>I think, firstly, if we consider the annual report of the Department of Labour for 1961 we find a summary there of trade test results for the period 1959-61. This summary, I think, is one which we should consider most carefully because it discloses quite an alarming state of affairs. I am going to deal with three industries just by way of example, the metal or engineering industry, the motor industry and the S.A. Railways. I think the Railways is a good example because of the very wide variety of apprentices employed there and the over-all results of their trade tests. We find that in the metal or engineering industry in 1959 13.7 per cent passed the trade test, in 1960 17.32 per cent passed, and in 1961 15.52 per cent, all very low indeed. In the motor industry the position is considerably better. In 1959 22.3 per cent passed, in 1960 29.95 per cent, and then it dropped in 1961 to 23.30 per cent. Now we come to the Railways and we find that in 1959 the percentage of passes was as low as 9.7, in 1960 it was 16.04 and in 1961 16.16. Now one would assume that this result of the trade testing would indicate that there is something radically wrong with the educational standards of the youngsters, or with the training they receive. But if we examine the educational standards of the youngsters, I am taking 1957 as the year which would correspond with the entrance into the trade of those apprentices concerned in the trade test results I have just mentioned. We find that in 1957 in the same three industries, in the metal industry there were 212 apprentices out of a total of 1,500 who had Std. IX or X as their pre-apprenticeship educational qualification. In the motor industry 53 out of 1,263 had Std. IX or X, and in the Railways 58 out of 1,260 had Std. IX or X. If you look at the end results you discover that the engineering industry, which had the highest number of matriculants, has not got the highest number of passes in the trade tests. In the Railways, where there was the second highest number of those having Std. IX or X, the passes were the lowest of the three. But in the motor industry, which had the lowest number, 53 out of 1,200 with Std. IX or X, you have the highest number of passes in the trade tests. So it would indicate that it is not necessarily the pre-apprenticeship educational standards which determine the number of passes in the trade tests. I can come to only one conclusion, and that is that the higher educational qualifications at the commencement of the apprenticeship do not mean that there is a correspondingly <span class="col_4387-4388" refersTo="page_0768"/>high rate of passes in the trade tests. One can only assume from that that a higher standard of education in the commencement of the apprenticeship is not the complete answer. Secondly, that a higher standard of education cannot compensate an apprentice if he is apprenticed in the wrong trade.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the position in the motor industry. That industry maintains a higher percentage of success in the trade tests, although its educational standard is not the highest. I think there are probably two reasons for it, firstly that the motor industry on its own initiative has appointed designated agents in terms of the Industrial Conciliation Act to act as inspectors; and, secondly, I believe it is because the trade test is more closely linked with the actual experience gained by the apprentice in the motor trade. I think the motor trade is a more concentrated trade than possibly any other, and therefore I think the trade tests are far fairer than possibly in any other industry. The nature of the test bears a very close relationship to the general work done by the apprentice.</p>

<p>If this assumption is correct, is it not a pointer to the possibility that the other trade tests are suspect? Here I want to say that I have no detailed knowledge of the tests which are undertaken, but I have had considerable experience of the question of apprentices, the type of work they do, the suitability of the apprentice for that work and the value of such an apprentice to his employer. To put it another way, are apprentices in all the other trades obtaining a thorough training in all aspects of their trade? The Minister has referred to a possible remedy here and I thank him for the disclosure he made in respect of one of the recommendations which is not included in the Bill, and that is the appointment of technically trained inspectors as suggested in the report. I think that may be a step in the right direction, but I will come back to it in a moment. The Minister has indicated that the Bill provides for a system of log books. Now, I must warn the Minister that this may not be the complete answer, because this system has been in vogue in the Railways for many years. They keep what are known as apprenticeship progress records, yet the trade test results on the Railways are very far from satisfactory. Let me dwell there for a moment.</p>

<p>The Minister will remember that I dealt with this question of the poor results on the Railways in the trade tests. What have we got in the railway set-up? We have a very large number of apprentices, we have the shop steward system, together with the progress records to which I have referred, where every year an apprentice has got to sign such a card indicating that he has received the training laid down in the schedule, and he has to sign it in the presence of a shop steward who is present when he is interviewed by his workshop foreman. They discuss the progress he has made, and if it is found that the youngster has not been given the training he should have obtained, remedial action is taken. In spite of that fact, and in spite of every encouragement which can be given to an apprentice in the railway service, we find that the end result is worse than in the motor industry. Therefore I suggest that we must not place too much reliance on the log books.</p>

<p>But the Minister has indicated this second line of offence, and that is the introduction of the technically trained inspectors. I think the first thing we have to clear up here is that the Minister should indicate whom he will appoint as trained inspectors. Are they men who have come up through the ranks of apprenticeship themselves, or will they be men appointed from the administrative section of the Department of Labour? I think it is most important that we should have the details of what qualifications the Minister will lay down for the appointment of these technically trained inspectors. I should imagine, and my own view is, that any artisan who has achieved N.T.C. 3, or A.T.C. 1 or 2, would be a reasonable type of person to appoint as an inspector, but I think it is important that the Minister should indicate quite clearly what the qualifications are for the appointment of these inspectors. Their function, I feel, is going to be of the greatest importance in the improvement we all want to see brought about in the apprenticeship system. I think they can serve a very good purpose indeed, but of course they must be the right men for the job. I am not suggesting that they should be put in front of a committee or that they should pass an aptitude test; I think something more definite than that is required, but I do suggest that if there is to be considerable improvement in the system of training apprentices a lot will depend on the type of person and the qualifications of the persons who are appointed as inspectors.</p>

<p>Now, I have suggested that the trade tests themselves may be at fault. I want the House to consider this fact, that the vast majority of apprentices trained by the Railways are retained in the service as artisans, although they have failed their trade tests, and yet under the system of bonus working, the incentive bonus scheme operating in the Railways, these artisans who have failed their trade tests perform their work satisfactorily and earn a bonus under that system. That is an indication that although they failed their trade test they are able to compete with artisans of long standing in the work they are doing.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>When we adjourned for lunch I was dealing with the effectiveness or otherwise of the trade tests imposed by the Department of Labour and pointed out that although as far as the Railway Administration was concerned the percentage of passes in the trade tests for the last few years was only some 16 per cent, the apprentices in the railway service are retained as artisans, by and large, and are competing very well with artisans of long <span class="col_4389-4390" refersTo="page_0769"/>standing. This led me to believe that the Minister should have an inquiry into the trade testing system as such to ascertain whether the trade tests are fair and reasonable. I am not making this suggestion lightly; I am quite serious about it because I know that many an apprentice has failed his trade test because he was asked to do a particular job with which he is completely unfamiliar through no fault of his own, because in the particular workshop where he was trained that type of work was never done. There is also the other aspect, that he was unable to understand what was required of him in the trade test, with the result that he could not give of his very best. I suggest that where trade tests are given there should be a choice open to the apprentice to take Test A, B or C, so that he will be tested on the work he is familiar with. It is no use adopting a Utopian attitude in regard to the training of apprentices. It is not possible for every apprentice to cover every aspect of the work he will have to do as an artisan. I am convinced that many youngsters fail the trade tests because they are not familiar with the work they are asked to do.</p>

<p>I want to deal briefly with the proposal in the Bill for the registration of prospective apprentices with the Department of Labour. This is the second proposal I feel we should spend a little time on. The reason why I am a little doubtful about this proposal is because of the wording of the amending clause, Clause 12 (5) (a), which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Registrar shall not give his consent under sub-section (2) in respect of a minor who is not qualified to bind himself as an apprentice in terms of sub-section (1) and who is not registered for employment with the Department of Labour as a prospective apprentice.</block>

<p>The Department, in putting forward that amendment to the Act, has adopted in part the recommendations put forward by the National Apprenticeship Board. I think it is as well for me to read out what the recommendations were in this respect. The first was that all prospective apprentices should register with the Department of Labour and be placed with suitable employers in the trade of their choice, having regard to the outcome of aptitude tests to be conducted by the Department, and this is the proviso to which I wish to draw the attention of the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that the right of an employer to indenture such apprentices as he chooses be not affected.</block>

<p>Now it would appear to me that this amendment in the Bill which I have read out would preclude an employer from engaging an apprentice unless he were registered with the Department as a prospective apprentice. That is not what the board had in mind. The second portion of their recommendation says that a prospective apprentice in possession of the minimum educational qualifications of Std. VII or an equivalent certificate should compulsorily undergo an aptitude test, and that in the event of failure the employer shall retain the right to indenture such prospective apprentice, provided his continued employment after one year of apprenticeship shall be reviewed in consultation with the Apprenticeship Committee concerned and the inspector appointed for the area; and (c) that a prospective apprentice not in possession of the minimum educational qualifications of Std. VII and who has passed the aptitude test may by way of exemption be permitted to be indentured. Now, there are safeguards which I do not think the Minister has taken cognizance of in the framing of his amendment in the Bill, and I think that in his reply the Minister should indicate quite clearly what he is going to do in regard to the recommendations made by the board so that the system of compulsory registration of prospective apprentices will not be as rigid as it would appear to be from a study of the Bill itself. I think we should have clarity on this point so that we will know that it will be possible for youths other than those included in such a list held by the Department of Labour to be indentured if the employer so wishes.</p>

<p>Finally, I come to the question of the apprentice&#x2019;s wages. This is one of the aspects which we will not be able to deal with in the Committee Stage because there is no provision in the Bill itself for it. Yet the Minister has indicated that the powers he has under the Act as it stands will enable him to introduce the new principle of wages being based on a percentage of the wages paid to the artisan. In other words, the basic wage paid to an artisan will in future be the basis on which the apprentice will be paid, according to a certain percentage scale. I want to ask the Minister what he intends doing, firstly, in the application of this scale in respect of the apprentice who will be called upon to serve a sixth year. I think the report indicates that he should be paid 70 per cent of the artisan&#x2019;s rate of pay, but I do not remember the Minister saying anything about that.</p>

</speech>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I said it would be 70 per cent.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then that clears up that point. But I now come to the position that has developed as the result of the delay I commented on earlier on. the delay in giving effect to the recommendations of this Committee. recommendations which could have been given effect to without legislation being passed. The first group I wish to deal with is the wages of the apprentice now being paid by the Railway Administration. In September last year there was a rationalization of wages throughout the service, and as a result the apprentices now begin their apprenticeship in their first year at a salary of R60 a month. That represents 36 per cent of the artisan rate, and I ask the Minister what he is going to do when he finds that the percentage rate which he is laying down is not as high as the existing rates which have been established and laid down by the Railway Administration. I <span class="col_4391-4392" refersTo="page_0770"/>assume that what the Minister will lay down will be the minimum rates, and if there are other rates which are higher he will not interfere with them, but I think we should have clarity on that point as well.</p>

<p>As far as the railway apprentice is concerned he will start off with R60 per month and the maximum that he will receive during his five years&#x2019; apprenticeship will be R80, so the commencing rate has been stepped up considerably but the rate in the fifth year has not been stepped up proportionately. However, I think that is in keeping with the intention at the back of the minds of those who compiled this report. Sir, in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of Wednesday, 17 April there was an item dealing with the pay of apprentices, and it says this: &#x201C;Apprentices&#x2019; pay almost doubled by a Rand firm&#x201D;. It says also that this is a move to draw the best trainees, and it goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The firm has just almost doubled the pay of its apprentices so that first-year trainees now receive R50 per month instead of the Government laid-down rate of R28 per month. The new higher rates of pay will apply throughout the apprentice&#x2019;s training so that by the fourth year he will be receiving R65 per month instead of the official rate of R50 per month. Mr. G. M. Tomkins, technical director of the firm, said to-day: &#x201C;The standard rate of pay is unattractive to boys of good education, yet these are the boys we want.</block>

<p>I think this is particularly significant in view of what I have said in regard to the academic standard of the youngsters who have come into the trade in the last few years. The report goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; yet these are the boys we want. They are the raw material from which we recruit our future technicians. By raising our apprentices&#x2019; pay substantially we shall be considerably more selective in the young men we take and we shall use aptitude tests to prove that they are the right type to achieve what we have in mind.</block>

<p>This is being done by South Africa&#x2019;s biggest automotive engineering firm and, as I indicated earlier on, as far as the trade tests results are concerned, the best results are being achieved by apprentices in the motor industry, but despite that we have the largest automotive engineering firm in the country taking the initiative and voluntarily increasing the pay of apprentices, possibly following the line taken by the Railway Administration. Sir, I say to the Minister that in view of the fact that he had all the necessary power administratively to increase the rates of pay of apprentices from the time this report was submitted to him in 1960. the question is why he has failed to take the necessary remedial action. It is most unfortunate that we should have such a tremendous disparity in the wages paid to apprentices under the various industrial council agreement, as explained to us in the annexure to this report. Let me just give an indication as to what the position is in respect of some of these apprentices. In the metal industry the first-year apprentice receives 24 per cent of the artisan&#x2019;s rate; in the motor industry 21 per cent; in the building industry mainly 20 per cent; in the sugar and refining industry 26 per cent; in the printing industry we find that it is as low as 14 per cent in the first year, and going up to 19 per cent and finally 21 per cent according to the various groupings; in the grain milling industry it is as high as 30 per cent. You will see, therefore, Sir, that if the Minister is going to give effect, as he says he is, to the suggestion put forward by the board that there should be a commencing rate of round-about 30 per cent of the artisan rate, there will be an improvement in the scales of pay in the vast majority of apprentices. But my complaint is this: Why was this not done in 1960; why has the Minister waited until now? What has the passing of this Bill to do with the establishment of a better rate of pay for apprentices? That is what I cannot understand, and I would ask the Minister to give us some information as to what has caused the delay in giving effect to this recommendation which does not require legislation for its implementation. It may mean that we have wasted two years with regard to the recruitment of the type of apprentice we want, two years which we in an expanding industrial economy can ill afford to lose. These young chaps who would have been persuaded to come in as apprentices if the pay had been right, are lost to us; they are over the age limit now and we will never get them back as apprentices again, so this delay has had serious repercussions and I do hope that the Deputy Minister himself will give effect to the recommendation of the board as soon as possible. We regret that there has been this delay.</p>

<p>In summing up I can say that the official Opposition accepts this Bill as a measure designed to improve the apprenticeship system by the introduction of innovations which the Minister has indicated will be reviewed after a probationary period of five years. I think it is most essential that we should have this review because we are breaking new ground here; we are going to place terrific reliance on aptitude tests, and I do not know that it has yet been proved to be an effective system, but it is one that no doubt we will have to try out. I do hope, however, that we will have a review of these innovations and that the Department of Labour in its Annual Report will keep us well acquainted with the developments which are going to take place as far as the selection of apprentices is concerned, so that Parliament itself will be kept informed of the progress of these innovations.</p>

<p>I have dealt with the second point which I am going to make now, and that is that the principle of apprentices&#x2019; pay being calculated on a percentage of the basic wage paid to artisans be implemented as soon as possible&#x2014; that is what the Opposition would like to see&#x2014;and then, thirdly, that it would appear that <span class="col_4393-4394" refersTo="page_0771"/>the main difficulties facing the Department of Labour as far as the training of apprentices is concerned, appear to be problems which the Department of Education, rather than the Department of Labour can help to solve, and I think that the Deputy Minister of Labour who has introduced this Bill is in a very favourable position to keep in close contact with all the many problems associated with the training of apprentices in view of the fact that he is also Deputy Minister of Education, Arts and Science. The Deputy Minister is therefore in a favourable position to see that everything that can possibly be done to improve the educational standard of those who are going to become prospective apprentices, will be done by the Department of &#x00C9;ducation and the Deputy Minister, in his capacity as Deputy Minister of Labour will be in a position to see that the utmost advantage is taken of all the facilities provided by the Department of Education so as to make it possible for him to get the very best material for training as artisans of the future. Sir, this is a Bill which we welcome. It is a Bill which was preceded by a tremendous amount of study as the result of the appointment of the committee under the Apprenticeship Board and I only hope that the promise that some of these innovations hold out will mature and that as a result we are going to get a better type of apprentice, that the training of the apprentices is going to be better supervised so that in the long run we will get what we so badly need, a very big influx of first-rate artisans.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to express my thanks that the Opposition, as do we on this side, welcome this Bill as a step forward in the training of our apprentices. Although this is a Bill of a highly technical nature, we are dealing to-day with what is probably one of the most important Bills that we could deal with at the present stage and that is why I am pleased that the Opposition have seen their way clear to support this Bill in principle.</p>

<p>Over the past 20 years we have had a great deal of criticism of our apprenticeship system and people who know what they are talking about have often expressed serious criticism of this apprenticeship system. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) quoted this morning from a report of the speech of Mr. De Waardt, head of the technical training school of the Natal Technical College, in regard to his findings over six years of study. We also know that other people like Professor Duminy now Rector of the University of Cape Town, who for 16 years was head of the Technical College in Pretoria, have often expressed very serious criticism of the training system. Mr. Rowe, the head of the Witwatersrand Technical College, has also expressed criticism of this system on various occasions. This is a position that we can no longer tolerate in a young country like South Africa which has made all its preparations for a further step forward as far as its economic expansion is concerned, and it is something that we must try and rectify. We are called to compete not only with competition from outside as far as our internal market is concerned&#x2014;in this regard we still have certain steps that we can take to protect our local industries&#x2014;but we are called upon more and more to compete upon foreign markets that we have to find, conquer and retain. In that regard we cannot do otherwise than to try to increase and strengthen the quality and productivity of our labour. I say that under the circumstances in which we find ourselves as a young country we must make the best use of our limited manpower and that is why we are pleased that an effort is being made here to train this important section of our labour corps in South Africa in a better fashion for the task which awaits them. I also approached the Pretoria Technical College; I also want to make a contribution to show how serious is the position in respect of the training of our apprentices. As I said, I went to the Pretoria Technical College and asked them for statistics of the successful candidates at the end of last year. I must say that the results were disturbing and upsetting. If, for example, we take the examination for the Elementary Technical Certificate which is the equivalent to Std. VII, we find that last year at the Pretoria Technical College 375 candidates enrolled for the examination and of this number only 13 received their certificates. Of the 1,092 technical entries for that examination, 240 did not even turn up for the examination. Now that is a very large percentage; it is almost a quarter. Take the results which were achieved in the examination for the National Technical Certificate I which is the equivalent of Std. VIII. The number of candidates who entered was 614. Of these, 50 obtained the National Technical Certificate I and three obtained the Junior Technical Certificate. In other words of 614 candidates, only 53 obtained a full-fledged certificate. In the case of the National Technical Certificate II which is the equivalent of Std. IX, there were 623 candidates who entered for the examination. Of these, 54 obtained the National Technical Certificate II and one obtained the Intermediate Technical Certificate; in other words, 55 out of 632 candidates obtained a full-fledged certificate. I come now to the National Technical Certificate III which is the equivalent of Std. X. Here we had 442 candidates of whom 57 obtained the N.T.C. and seven the Senior Technical Certificate; in other words, a total of 64 out of 442. In order to give hon. members a general impression of the number of candidates who wrote these examinations, I want to put the matter in this way: There were 2,063 candidates at the Pretoria Technical College who entered for the four examinations and of these only 185 or 8.9 per cent obtained full-fledged certificates. This is a very low percentage indeed.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>These are sobering figures and that is why one is pleased <span class="col_4395-4396" refersTo="page_0772"/>that an effort is now being made to effect an improvement. This is the second time that this Government has taken important steps to effect an improvement in our apprenticeship system. The first step was taken in 1951 after the report of the so-called De Villiers Commission on vocational training. Legislation was then passed which was aimed particularly at enabling the enthusiastic and ambitious apprentice to reach artisan status more quickly. In that legislation the so-called compulsory artisan test was instituted if industries asked for it and the test could be taken in the penultimate year of the apprenticeship term. If the apprentice passed that examination he reduced his apprenticeship by one year. If he did not pass that test he simply achieved artisan status at the end of his apprenticeship term; in other words, if he completed the five years or four years or three years, whatever the term was, he became an artisan without passing any test.</p>

<p>I want to express my appreciation that some of the larger industries in our country asked for this test to be instituted. I understand that some of our largest industries such as for example the motor industry and the engineering industry, as the hon. member also mentioned, asked for this test to be instituted. A compulsory test has therefore already been instituted for those industries. I also understand that a trade like the hairdressing trade asked for the test and that apprentices take that test to-day. Mr. Speaker, this was a step forward and that is why one is not surprised that in the latest report of the Apprenticeship Board it is recommended that a compulsory test of this nature should be taken before artisan status is achieved. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana expressed certain doubts about this artisan test. He pointed out the small percentage of artisans who have passed the compulsory tests already instituted. I just want to say that the Department has given me the assurance that the test that will now be instituted will be a purely practical one. There will be no test of theory. The compulsory test which was instituted in the penultimate year of training which, if passed, could shorten the apprenticeship period, included a theory test, but the test that will now be instituted will be a purely practical test. So I cannot understand why certain trade union organizations object to it, particularly if one accepts the fact that it will be a purely practical test so that a man can prove that he can use his hands and that he can do the work expected of him in that particular sphere.</p>

<p>I also want to welcome the announcement made by the hon. Minister in connection with recommendations that he and the Department have adopted. These recommendations are going to help the intelligent and ambitious apprentice even further and one welcomes them because these are the people who must eventually become workshop managers and foremen. If we can help these ambitious apprentices it will be an important step forward. As the hon. Deputy Minister said, in future apprentices must obtain their A.T.C. II certificate which is the equivalent of the Std. VII certificate. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana also pointed out that there are Std. VI pupils who sometimes become very good artisans. I can only say that the Department has given me the assurance that although an aptitude test will now be taken and the A.T.C. II examination will be a requirement, the Std. VI boy will still have his chance; he will only have to undergo an aptitude test and if he proves that he has the ability, he can be trained as an artisan.</p>

<p>I think that a very important recommendation that has been adopted is the recommendation that the period of apprenticeship should be shortened by as much as <i>2</i>&#x00BD; years. It appeared from the statement made by the hon. the Deputy Minister that a person with an A.T.C. III certificate can now undergo a trade test after years and if his term is a five year term, he can in reality shorten his apprenticeship by 2&#x00BD; years if he passes such a test. This is a very important concession that is being made in the case of the intelligent apprentice who wants to work.</p>

<p>I think that another very important concession that is being made is that apprentices can earn bonuses by studying. I think that it is an important step forward to encourage our apprentices to study. If they obtain certain certificates they can earn a bonus which can amount to from 50c to 250c per week. One knows that an apprentice&#x2019;s wages are not very high and if an apprentice can add an amount of R18 to his monthly earnings by studying, this will be a very great encouragement to that boy to study. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana also expressed certain doubts about the recommendation that has been accepted that wages should be calculated on a percentage of the wages fixed for artisans. I just want to say that I think that this is a very important step forward. One of the great stumbling-blocks in the recruitment of apprentices in the past was the low wages paid to apprentices. Unfortunately, we have a high conjuncture economy to-day in which people find it easy to earn high wages. One is amazed to see what Std. VI boys and girls can earn. In other words, there has really been no encouragement for them to become apprentices because they have been able to earn far larger salaries and wages in other posts. I think therefore that this step of basing the wages of apprentices on the percentage of the wages of the artisan is going to be a very great encouragement. Its effect is also going to be that the apprentice&#x2019;s wage is going to rise when the artisan&#x2019;s wage rises. I think that this will be a very great encouragement to prospective apprentices.</p>

<p>I want very much to say something about the recommendation that Std. VII should be the minimum educational qualification for apprentices. I think that this is a very good recommendation but I want to bring one fact to the attention of the Government. This is a fact that sometimes worries me. It is that increasingly <span class="col_4397-4398" refersTo="page_0773"/>higher education qualifications are being required from boys and girls in various spheres of work and we are reaching the position to-day where it is very difficult for boys and girls with a Std. VI certificate to obtain work. I know for a fact that every year at the end of the school year it takes the Labour Bureau months to place these boys and girls in employment. I know that in Pretoria it sometimes takes up to three months to place Std. VI boys and girls in employment and if one is continually setting higher and higher qualifications, what work will eventually remain for these people to do? That is why I hope that in the application of this Std. VII provision all boys, and girls too, who want to become apprenticed will have the opportunity of becoming apprenticed if they pass the aptitude test. There has to be that encouragement to assure them of a standard of living which they would otherwise not be able to achieve with a Std. VI certificate.</p>

<p>The hon. member also expressed his doubts about the registration of apprentices with the Department of Labour. I think that this is a very important provision because with this we have the recommendation that they must take an aptitude test. The hon. member said that we must not place too much emphasis upon or expect too much of the aptitude test. He had certain doubts in that regard. I think that in our educational services we have reached the stage to-day where we can rely to a fairly large extent on these psychological aptitude tests. But there again the recommendation is that the aptitude test should only serve as an indication so that the prospective apprentice can be told: &#x201C;You have an aptitude in this direction and not in that direction&#x201D;, but that person is still free to follow the direction that he wants to follow and any employer is also free to employ him. That is why I say that this is an important step that we must welcome. This is something which is being followed more and more in the world to-day&#x2014;to test people for their aptitude.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by mentioning what I consider to be a very important provision in this Bill. I am a person who left school very early and by means of private study I was even able to obtain a university degree. That is why I want to emphasize this opportunity that one must give to the young people to be able to study further and I welcome this provision that any apprentice who wants to study further will be allowed to study in his emloyer&#x2019;s time. Under the previous legislation e was permitted to study for two years in his employer&#x2019;s time. If an apprentice shows that he wants to study he will now have the right to attend classes at the technical college in his employer&#x2019;s time for the whole period of his apprenticeship. I welcome this provision particularly because I believe that it will make a very great contribution in enabling pur apprentices to reach a higher educational Standard and will also enable them to play a greater role in our economic and industrial development. They are going to be a valuable addition to our technicians and our engineers in this country. I think this is an important step forward towards supplementing the engineering and technical forces that we will need in South Africa. That is why I also welcome this Bill. I think that the technical colleges in this country will be grateful for the amendments that are being effected here because the system in the past had a detrimental effect upon the intelligent student. The large number of students who did not want to study completely spoilt the spirit at the colleges and had an obstructive effect upon the progress of the enthusiastic student. As this measure will reduce the administrative work of the technical colleges and make it easier to control the classes, I think that the technical colleges will also welcome this legislation. Another important provision is the provision that we find in Clause 11 (h) which provides that the apprentice who does not want to study need not study; that he has only to study for one year and if he does not have a good report then he is compelled to study for a further year in his own time and after this period he is no longer expected to attend further classes if he does not receive good reports. One feels rather sorry about this but the fact remains that one will no longer be able to compel these boys to do things that they do not want to do, as was the case in the past.</p>

<p>We also welcome this legislation as far as this point is concerned. I just want to say something about the logbook about which the hon. member for Umhlatuzana also expressed some doubt. I do not want to say that this is going to be an infallible scheme. But where the 1951 legislation provided for the first time that a training roster should be kept and that every employer training apprentices should follow that training roster, I think that this is a very good addition to that provision. Many employers actually shirked their obligation under that provision and did not follow that roster. The only way to pin down the employer now is to place something in the hands of the apprentice by means of which he can indicate whether the employer is following that roster or not. And where we are now going to make use of a larger number of trained inspectors, I think that this is the only way to give those inspectors the opportunity to pin down those employers who are shirking their responsibility. That is why I think that this is an important provision although the hon. member expressed certain doubts about it.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to say something about the constitution of the board. I am very pleased that the hon. Deputy Minister and the Department have seen their way clear to give the employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations increased representation on this board. When the Apprenticeship Board was originally brought into being in 1944. the employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organization had only one representative each. This representation was increased to two each in 1951. It is now being further increased to three each. I think this is very important because this Apprenticeship <span class="col_4399-4400" refersTo="page_0774"/>Board has shown that it plays an important role in our industrial life. I think only of the report on which this legislation is based. That is a monumental work that they have done for our industries in this country. That is why I think that as it is the employers and the employees themselves who are interested in this provision in connection with technical training, it is a good thing that they should receive increased representation and that we should have the views of a larger number of representatives of industry on the Apprenticeship Board with a view to the advice which they give to the Department and to the Minister. We are dealing with an important piece of legislation here which is going to be of great value to our country. I am pleased that we have been able to discuss this legislation today and that it is going to be placed on the Statute Book.</p>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>As has been said, the Bill before us mainly arises from the recommendations made by the National Apprenticeship Board. The board was entrusted with the task, after years of negotiation with the Department of Labour, to carry out an investigation into the whole of our apprenticeship system and its terms of reference were very wide indeed. They investigated every aspect of apprenticeship training. The board has done a very thorough job and it should be commended for it, considering the fact that it consisted of both employee and employer representatives. They went to great lengths to arrive at a formula on which both these forces were agreed.</p>

<p>I want to associate myself with the remarks of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) about the time period. This board started its work through a sub-committee in September 1958. The report was available in September 1960 and it is now 1963&#x2014;some four years eight months after it started its task. The report has been available for two years. In supporting the hon. member for Umhlatuzana I should like to say that there is a number of recommendations in this report that could have been implemented before now without legislation being passed through this House. The recommendations, notwithstanding the delay, have by no means become out of date. The interim period has undoubtedly proved that the whole of the apprenticeship system needs a complete overhaul in order to produce artisans of a higher standard than we have to-day. The old saying, Sir, that anyone who is handy with his hands but lacked the mental ability to improve his education was the best material for training as an artisan has become outdated. There are exceptions, but they are very few indeed.</p>

<p>Industry in South Africa requires highly trained artisans and technicians to-day. Industrialists have and are still spending considerable sums of money on the training of artisans to become specialists in particular types of industry. I know that in the motor industry&#x2014; which is the industry I know most about&#x2014; motor car and truck manufacturers in this country run special courses at their factories at considerable expense where artisans are taken from their agents and put through an intensive course of training to bring them up to a high standard. The factories recognize the fact that in order to offer the best possible service and to keep their cars on the road in perfect condition, it is very necessary for the artisans to undergo this training. Industrialists in the motor trade have gone even further. In order to improve the technical standard of education of the artisans, the apprentices and the technicians, they have established the Institute of the Motor Industry with the cooperation of the technical colleges. The latter are conducting courses which will enable young men to qualify to become members of the Institute and thus go further in life.</p>

<p>Provided we adopt sound methods of training we should be able to provide a substantial portion of the requirements in the way of artisans in this country. We are always crying out for artisans but I do not think we are doing enough to generate our own artisan staff in this country. The higher minimum standard education recommended in the report plus aptitude tests will assist, I have no doubt, in eliminating to a large extent the misfits which we find in industry to-day. An apprentice can still be admitted with a Std. VI certificate. I hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will give serious consideration to adopting this portion of the report where they recommend that Std. VII should be the minimum qualification to enter a trade.</p>

<p>Clause 12 (5) of the Bill deals with the registration of the youth who wants to become an apprentice. My worry is about the rural apprentice. A youngster in Springbok or anywhere in the rural areas has not the facilities to register unless he goes to a city. If he is near Cape Town he has to come to Cape Town; if he is near Johannesburg he has to go to Johannesburg. One wonders whether facilities cannot be made available at the local magistrate&#x2019;s court or the local post office where such a youth can register. The same applies in the case of aptitude testing. We should like to hear from the Deputy Minister how this is going to be carried out.</p>

<p>The need to improve the standard of apprentices in technical training is reflected in the results of the examinations for 1961 and 1962. Figures have been quoted here to-day. In reply to a question which I asked on 18 May 1962 as to the results I was shocked at the reply which I received. In 1960-1 something like 22,749 White apprentices entered for examination. Only 1,696 candidates obtained a full certificate, and 4,000 obtained subject successes. There was a slight improvement in 1962. In 1962 22,931 candidates entered, 2,009 passed with a full certificate and 7,600 obtained partial certificates. This is a very low standard. Sir, and it reflects the very serious state of affairs that does exist at the present moment.</p>

<p>Clause 11 (a) gives the Minister powers to lengthen the period of apprenticeship. By putting this clause into the Bill the Minister has accepted the recommendation of the <span class="col_4401-4402" refersTo="page_0775"/>board. The board&#x2019;s idea was to encourage apprentices to take greater interest in their studies and to endeavour to pass a trade test during their penultimate year or to pass a trade test at the end of their final year. I have no doubt that when this Bill becomes law and when the minimum entrance requirement becomes Std. VII very few boys will have to go on to their sixth year. The old idea of a boy going into a trade, losing interest and just drifting along until he becomes an artisan just by the effluxion of time is out of date and is one which should have been taken care of a long time ago. I am pleased to see that the employers were able to arrive at an agreement with the trade unions on this particular matter.</p>

<p>Under Clause 11 (b) the Minister now has the power to vary the period apprentices are forced to attend technical classes. At the present time they have to attend for two years in the employer&#x2019;s time. Now the Minister can, on reports from the technical college, vary that period thereby eliminating the unsatisfactory apprentice, the fellow that has not the mental ability and the chap that just does not want to learn. This amendment is in a way&#x2014;I do not like to use the word &#x201C;defeatist&#x201D;&#x2014;an amendment which points to the fact that we have got to accept the unsatisfactory position that we have to allow this apprentice a let-out; the lazy and the won&#x2019;t-work will just stay away and he will not worry about going to college. It reflects the very poor standard of technical education that we have at the present moment.</p>

<p>There is no doubt about it, Sir, log books and the supervision by inspectors will remedy this position to some extent. Talking about inspectors and knowing them as far as industrial councils are concerned and the difficulty the Department of Labour itself has in obtaining suitable inspectors, I wonder where we are going to obtain these individuals to cover this very important job. The board recommends that industrial council inspectors should be used for this particular function but at the same time I think the Minister and his Department know that not all industrial council inspectors are qualified artisans. In nine cases out of ten they have purely administrative experience; they understand the agreements that they have to administer and it will be very difficult for them to decide whether or not an apprentice is being trained properly, if they are not qualified artisans themselves.</p>

<p>The Bill before us to-day is no cure for the troubles which we are experiencing in the apprenticeship field. It tries to improve matters without getting at the core of the trouble. The training of an apprentice is essentially an educational matter. I say this with due deference to the Department of Labour: The Department has done its best to make the system work; and has succeeded to an extent. But because it is not an educational body it has not been able to achieve the success which it would have liked. It has had to leave trade testing and other educational spheres to the Department of Education over which the Department of Labour has no control. The Department of Labour can in no way dictate to the Department of Education as to what courses apprentices should follow. I should like to say this, Sir, that at the present time there is the greatest liaison between those two Departments, but there is this vacuum between the two&#x2014;the one Department cannot run the other nor do they attempt to. The greatest weakness in regard to the technical training of apprentices is that the system in accordance with which apprentices have to be examined is totally out of date. Although this has been acknowledged by the Department of Education nothing has been done to bring this up to date. The last handbook and syllabuses for technical education were produced in 1951. It is out of print at the moment and has been unprocurable for several years.</p>

<p>In 1955 the employers&#x2019; section of the motor industry took the initiative and replanned the courses of interest to it. That might explain the remarks of the hon. member for Umhlatuzana when he said that the motor industry had the highest rate of passes as far as trade testing was concerned. They submitted proposals to the Department of Education and these proposals for the amended scheme were introduced in a pilot scheme in 1957 at the Witwatersrand Technical College. I would like to pay tribute to the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science for his work in this connection. Efforts to extend these courses have mainly failed due to the lack of finance. It is interesting to note that in 1961 the Secretary for Education informed the motor industry that the cost of equipping suitable workshops could not be borne by the State and that the funds would have to be provided by the industry. I must point out to the House that in this pilot scheme which was introduced by the Witwatersrand Technical College R2,000 was donated by the motor industry in order to carry out the scheme. I think it is a very sorry state of affairs if we are told that there is insufficient funds in respect of such an important subject as this namely the training of artisans. On the one hand we have the Minister of Defence battling to build up an army and telling us about the lack of technicians and on the other hand we are told that there is no money to train boys as artisans.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of technical education which is not very satisfactory and that is the provision of correspondence courses. If technical colleges are not available to youngsters they have to take these courses through the Witwatersrand Technical College. A youngster may leave school at Std. VI, VII or VIII; he may even leave at Std. X. He receives these courses through the post and in nine cases out of ten they are completely Greek to him. If he lives in Springbok for example there is no way of getting any tuition. There are provincial secondary schools available, but, it is not their duty to provide the tuition. We have some very brilliant youngsters on the platteland who fall by the way on account of the lack of tuition. I would suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that when he talks to his colleague, the Minister of Education, <span class="col_4403-4404" refersTo="page_0776"/>Arts and Science, that they do something about establishing local technical institutions for these youngsters.</p>

<p>As I have said, the whole training of our youth must be done on a sound basis. Technical training must be a combination of theoretical and practical training. They go hand in glove. The Department which should handle this is the Department of Education. This aspect was considered by the board and they did not agree to it. But one of the large employers of apprentices, namely the steel and engineering industry, recommended that the whole control of apprentices should be passed over to the Department of Education.</p>

<p>The boy who intends to become an apprentice should go through a period of pre-apprenticeship training. He should then be indentured to a trade most suited to his ability. Once he is so indentured he should continue his technical training on a part-time basis under the supervision of the Department of Education. The suggestion of pre-apprenticeship training is, of course, not a new one. You find it in the De Villiers Commission&#x2019;s report, No. 65 of 1948. It is stated at length there how we should go about it. When you re-read that report even at this late stage, 15 years after it has been produced, the facts stated the e are still relevant. It is to be regretted that we did not go forward with the recommendations in that particular report.</p>

<p>The present position where the Department of Labour controls the body of the apprentice and disciplines him and the Department of Education attempts to control and train the mind is not a satisfactory one, notwithstanding the high degree of liaison which we have between these two Departments. And the sooner the system of training apprentices is put under one Department the better. We have this position here to-day in this House, Sir, dealing with apprentices as a labour matter. The Minister of Education who should also be concerned is not here; I doubt whether we have any members of his Department here but the position is this that the most important aspect of apprenticeship training is the technical one. The matter is urgent. I do not think we can leave it to drift. I am not suggesting that we should have another commission. We have had commissions; we have had voluminous reports; we have had departmental reports on the method of training of apprentices. I think we have sufficient material. I should like to suggest to the Government that they should give very serious consideration to having apprenticeship training placed under one head and I say that the right head is the Department of Education.</p>

<speech by="#van_niekerk">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. L. H. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>The Bill we have before us to-day is the result of a thorough and searching inquiry by a committee appointed by the Apprenticeship Board in 1958. That committee consisted, under the chairmanship of the Registrar of the Apprenticeship Board, of another representative of the Department of Labour; two representatives of the Department of Education, Arts and Science; two representatives of employers&#x2019; organizations and two representatives of employees&#x2019; organizations. The inquiry took place on the instructions of the then Minister of Labour, who decided to institute it as a result of representations he had received regarding alleged shortcomings in our system of apprenticeship. That it was a comprehensive inquiry is evident from the fact that the terms of reference of the committee were so comprehensive. It is proved further by the various persons and organizations who were specifically requested to give evidence and make comments. As I say, the terms of reference were very wide and consequently it was a very comprehensive inquiry. I am emphasizing this fact because I believe we ought to have full confidence in the final result before us now, not only in the form of the Bill but also in the form of the report that has been submitted as a result of that inquiry. What still further strengthens one&#x2019;s confidence in the final result of this inquiry is the objective and scientific approach of the committee to the whole problem. The comments and all other data gathered, the points of view of the employers, as well as the employees&#x2019; organizations and of all other interested parties have been duly taken into consideration. tabulated and statistically analysed. Ultimately it was subjected to their own critical examination.</p>

<p>Having completed this task, the Apprenticeship Board proceeded to determine the tendencies. On the basis of that they drafted and clearly formulated their recommendations. That is how they dealt with every part of the terms of reference. Every aspect in regard to apprenticeship was thoroughly examined and covered by this inquiry. That is why I say one has the fullest confidence in the final result in the form of this Bill, in which the vast majority of the recommendations have been embodied or in which they could well be incorporated. Therefore we can say that this Bill is the fruit of a sound, searching and comprehensive inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Republic of South Africa is a vigorous, energetic young country standing at the present time on the threshold of great industrial development. Therefore it is necessary that our factories should be manned to the greatest possible extent by the best forces at our disposal. We have to get away from the long-cherished misconception that anything, even the crumbs falling from the tables of the provincial schools, is good enough for this purpose. Only the best will be good enough, as well as those second-bests who are imbued with the ideal to produce achievements to the best of their ability. It should be our aim to attract to the industries some of the very best men.</p>

<p>Now it will not profit us much to attract the best men unless we have a system that will contribute to and will be purposefully aimed at bringing forth their dormant potentialities. In other words, we have to have a system of apprenticeship that will determine beforehand that prospective apprentices firstly <span class="col_4405-4406" refersTo="page_0777"/>have the requisite feeling of being attracted, and secondly have the natural aptitude for the trade of their choice; next that it has the machinery in which that natural aptitude can be fully unfolded and developed.</p>

<p>If now one reads this Bill in conjunction with the report, one finds that it is this very system of apprenticeship precisely that is being envisaged here. At first glance this Bill does not contain very much substance, but read it together with this report, then only will you appreciate the real value of the amendments proposed in this Bill. We find in this report the lofty objectives of the apprenticeship system and the recommendations as to how it can be overhauled to achieve these objectives. The machinery for overhauling the system is contained in this Bill. The report deals with the &#x201C;what&#x201D; and the Bill with the &#x201C;how&#x201D;, So the two are really indivisible and complementary. Much in the existing Act that is good is retained, and here and there it is streamlined, but everything that could impede or thwart the achievement of those objectives is eliminated. In other words, what was missing has now been added; what impedes has been removed; or rather provision is made for their removal or addition. Everything in the report has of course not been reproduced in the Bill. However, we should not lose sight of the assurance we received here to-day from the hon. the Deputy Minister of Labour, that the recommendations contained in the report have been largely if not wholly adopted and endorsed by the Department. Of course, what is not specifically embodied in the Bill could be prescribed by the Minister by regulation such as, <i>inter alia,</i> the important conditions of apprenticeship. On perusal of the report, one thing is salient, and that is that the closest attention has been given to every aspect of apprenticeship from the day of registration with the Department of Labour to the day of the attainment of full artisanship, and in respect of every aspect valuable recommendations have been made and reforms have been suggested. Of course it is impossible in the time at my disposal to dilate upon all the proposed reforms; that is why I should like to dwell upon only some of the most important ones.</p>

<p>In the first place I should like to say something in regard to administration. At the outset I should like to say that I wholeheartedly agree with the recommendation of the board that the administration of the Act should remain a function of the Department of Labour. The recommendation has been properly motivated in paragraph 11 of the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Department of Labour, because of the close co-operation between it and organized as well as unorganized industry, is <i>par excellence</i> the proper Department to apply an Act regulating employer-employee relations.</block>

<p>In passing, that is my reply to those who wish to transfer the training of apprentices to the Department of Education, Mr. Speaker. It is one thing to have a good Act, but it is something quite different to see to it that it is applied properly, and administered properly. Poor administration in consequence of several factors, such as for instance insufficient trained personnel, may have the effect of shipwrecking the best Act in the world. Among the keymen for the effective application of this Act, are the secretaries of the apprenticeship committees, and that is why I, in common with the Apprenticeship Board, feel perturbed that experienced secretaries are so frequently transferred and replaced by inexperienced men who could easily, on account of their immaturity and lack of self-confidence, cause the whole matter to be a failure. That is why I should like to urge that these secretaries should never be transferred otherwise than on promotion, and that they should never be replaced otherwise than by properly trained and experienced assistants. I should like to add this plea, that those secretaries as far as possible should be people who have had training in the basic principles of scientific personnel management. As regards the administrative personnel, I think that all who take a profound interest in the affairs of our apprentices will rejoice because provision is made in the Bill for the appointment of an assistant registrar of apprentices. while the membership of the board also is increased from 11 to 13 whereby greater representation is given to the most important employers&#x2019; and employees&#x2019; organizations.</p>

<p>Secondly I should like to say a few words in regard to the material that will become available for apprenticeship in consequence of this Bill, and then I shall try thirdly to show to what extent this Bill is calculated to activate those apprentices to achieve attainments to the best of their ability, for I think that is the main object we want to achieve with this Bill.</p>

<p>The prospective apprentice who has to register himself with the Department of Labour in the first instance, will in the first place have to produce proof of his aptitude by writing an aptitude test. As regards his minimum apprenticeship educational qualifications, it will now not be Std. VI as at present, but be raised to Std. VII. The raising of the educational qualifications is motivated by the Apprenticeship Board as follows: They point out that in the old days when this Std. VI provision was fixed, the Std. VI examination still was a public examination, and therefore was of a higher standard than the present Std. VI examination which can be attained on the ground of age. But I should like to add that in practice you cannot separate education and training from each other The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) wanted to show with the aid of certain statistics he quoted, that there is no correlation between training and education. Now I should like to quote from this brochure under the heading &#x201C;Training for Industrial Employment&#x201D; issued by the Institute of Labour Management of Great Britain in regard <span class="col_4407-4408" refersTo="page_0778"/>to this matter of Education and Training&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While the process of education and training may be distinguished one from the other, in practice it is impossible to separate them. Both processes may go on at the same time and they are in fact complementary in the development of individual capacity and achievement. The skill of the employee largely depends on his training And this is important&#x2014;<br/>&#x2026; but his attitude towards the firm and his job in that firm is determined largely by the education he has received before and after entering into industry, and his attitude has an important influence upon the standard of his day in and day out performance, which is what matters.</block>

<p>Further on he says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It should be noted that for most, if not for all jobs, some degree of education is essential in order to enable employees to grasp the necessary training and apply it.</block>

<p>Employers who have trained apprentices, and with whom I discussed the matter during the 1962 recess, feel so strongly in favour of the raising of the educational qualification that they have requested that a uniform national Std. VII examination should be passed by all prospective apprentices. Mr. Speaker, this will not impose such a heavy burden upon the apprentices. In 1958 the statistics in regard to identured apprentices were as follows: Under Std. VI there were only 68; those with a Std. VI certificate numbered 2,054; Std. VII, 2,072; Std. VIII, 2,066; Std. IX and X, 485; a total of 6,745. So you see that the vast majority had better qualifications than Std. VI and less. The employers with whom I discussed the matter urge that there should be a national Std. VII uniform examination which all apprentices should pass. Now it might happen that a boy who has not attained the Std. VII certificate, perhaps through circumstances over which he had no control, yet may be a skillful man with his hands, and in the long run may become capable of being a good artisan. Provision is made for these people in this Bill, or at least in the report on which the Bill is based. If he passes the aptitude test, he is eligible for an apprenticeship contract. And in passing I should like to say that this is one of the most conspicuous features of the report in my view; The level-headedness of the recommendations. Yet I believe that preapprenticeship educational qualifications cannot be sufficiently emphasized, and the Apprenticeship Board has also had due regard to that aspect, as I shall show now. In the first place, it exempts the prospective apprentice with a higher than the minimum educational qualification, from the aptitude test; secondly, it will mean a higher initial salary for him; thirdly, it can reduce considerably the period of apprenticeship indirectly, although not directly. I shall return to this later on. I should like merely to say here now that there is the fullest degree of recognition of the pre-apprenticeship educational qualifications of prospective apprentices.</p>

<p>That is the material that will come forward, young men with a Std. VII certificate or higher, or with a lower education certificate than Std. VII, but who have at least proved their aptitude. The question that immediately arises now is to what extent the proposed system of apprenticeship is calculated to activate this material. Let us look once again at the recommendations in regard to the period of apprenticeship including rebates. The period of apprenticeship in the vast majority of trades at the present time is five years; for about 12 trades it is four years, and for about three trades it is three years. 61 of the 86 interested parties who made comments, indicated that they had no objection to the prescribed period of apprenticeship, but 56 of the 86 felt that the rebates are granted much too liberally. As regards rebates the Apprenticeship Board endorses the view that a rebate of the period of apprenticeship, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, should not be granted as at present merely on the ground of an apprentice&#x2019;s educational qualifications, for that surely is no proof of skill or ability, but they support the idea that the apprentice should earn the rebate by passing a voluntary trade test at such a time during his apprenticeship as may be determined by his educational qualifications, that is to say, before the normal date of expiration of his contract of apprenticeship. This exact point of time is laid down in a proposed schedule drawn up for the various educational qualifications by the Board. To be eligible for the voluntary trade test prior to the normal date of expiry of the contract, and apprentice must pass the full N.T.C. II or at least the trade theory N.T.C. II in respect of the trade concerned. Apprentices not having these minimum requirements or who fail the voluntary trade test, have to pass a compulsory trade test at the end of their final year. If they fail in the compulsory trade test then, their contract has to be extended for one year. I really do not think that there can be any objection to that. If in the meantime he does not pass a further voluntary test, he has to serve the remaining period of the extended period, at the end of which he will then acquire artisan status by effluxion of time. On the other hand, the contract of an apprentice who passes the voluntary test, for which he may sit on the basis of his educational qualifications, is terminated from the date on which he becomes so entitled, or if he passes it after the date upon which he became entitled to it on the last day of the test. Analysis of the proposed schedule indicates that apprentices may attain full artisan status by voluntarily submitting to the test from six to 30 months before the date of expiry in the case of a five year contract, from four to 24 months in the case of a four year contract, and from two to 18 months in the case of a three year contract. If such a generous indulgence and such a challenge do not <span class="col_4409-4410" refersTo="page_0779"/>activate our young people, then one does not know what will do so. What a tremendous inducement ought it not to be to our apprentices to improve their educational qualifications academically and technically, and what an incentive to give their keenest attention to every facet of their work in order thereby to acquire the requisite knowledge to be able to pass the voluntary trade test and to attain full artisan status a long time before the normal expiry date of their contracts? To me it is the one thing that runs through the entire report of the Apprenticeship Board like a golden thread: This attempt to establish a system in which all the basic principles of scientific personnel management are consolidated in order to activate our apprentices to rise to the very highest level of their inherent capacity. A system of apprenticeship under which apprentices acquire artisan status merely by lapse of time is an enervating system that contains no activating stimulus at all for the apprentice to constantly produce his best. The idea has been expressed, <i>inter alia,</i> by the employers with whom I discussed the matter during the recess, that artisan status should be attained only by passing a trade test. We know that the Trade Unions vigorousl objected to this because they think it could lead to abuse exploitation. The proposed system of the Apprenticeship Board is a compromise between the two systems: the one system according to which artisan status can only be earned on the basis of achievements. and the other one under which it can be attained by effluxion of time only&#x2014;thus another example of the balance of the recommendations of the Apprenticeship Board.</p>

<p>Among the other important links in this process of activation, in so far as the Department of Labour is concerned are the following: (1) The apprenticeship committees and their secretaries; (2) the logbooks to be kept by the apprentices and for which provision is made in Clause 19 of the Bill and (3) the proposed appointment of technically trained apprenticeship inspectors. Time does not permit me to go into details of these important links in the activating process. The whole system of logbooks is dealt with in paragraph 41 of the Report of the Apprenticeship Board. It can be summarized thus briefly: Logbooks have to be printed in duplicate with one page for every three months of training; the apprentice then has to indicate in the relevant column of the logbook with a symbol in which aspect he has received training; at the end of three months it is signed by the apprentice and the employer, and there is an obligation upon the employer to transmit it to the Secretary of the Apprenticeship Committee within one week.</p>

<p>The plea for the appointment of apprenticeship inspectors who have to act as liaison officers between the apprentices, the apprenticeship committees, the employers and the technical colleges, is recorded in paragraphs 42 to 46 of the report of the Apprenticeship Board, and in order to show how strongly the Apprenticeship Board feels about this matter, I should like to quote paragraph 42 in its entirety to you&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The compulsory keeping of logbooks and the despatch of quarterly reports to A.Cs. would serve no useful purpose if inspectors of apprenticeship were not appointed to keep a check on the training being received by apprentices in workshops, and for this reason, while fully aware of the small measure of success which has, for known reasons, attended previous recommendations that the State should appoint a body of inspectors to undertake this important task, the Board must once more record its conviction that the object of this investigation, namely the improvement of the apprenticeship system and the removal of the causes of complaints will be defeated unless the general call for the appointment of inspectors is heeded and given effect to. It is the Board&#x2019;s firm view that the present investigation into the apprenticeship system stemmed from lack of proper control over the training of apprentices.</block>

<p>I think all of us will say &#x201C;Selah&#x201D; to that.</p>

<p>I will content myself with pointing out that the majority of interested parties who made comments, expressed themselves in favour of the keeping of these logbooks and the appointment of such inspectors of apprenticeship. I agree that we should pay regard to the qualifications of these people, and if there are people who really ought to pass a course in industrial psychology, a course in scientific personnel management, these are the people, and I should like to appeal to the Minister that we should find picked men for this task, and that we should not hesitate to pay them a good salary, for in their hands mainly will lie the success of the objects of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Deputy Minister dealt fully with the raising of the wages of apprentices. [Quorum.] From what the hon. the Minister has said, and the examples I and others have quoted, it appears clearly that there can be no doubt of the good intentions of the Minister and his Department to establish a system of apprenticeship which is calculated not only to attract the most suitable material in the form of apprentices but also to activate that material to the highest level of exertion and energy.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to point out that this activating process cannot be brought to fruition by the Minister and his Department alone. A heavy duty rests also on the technical colleges, on the parents of apprentices, to instil idealism into their children and to inspire them, on the apprentices themselves, and on the employers in whose workshops they spend the most hours of their period of apprenticeshio. One of the things that perturbs me a little is this very question of the workshops because in these workshops there are not always the requisite equipment and machinery to have these apprentices learn their trade, hr this connection I should like to refer to the recommendation of the board that apprentices from <span class="col_4411-4412" refersTo="page_0780"/>the country districts should take an intensive practical training course of four weeks in the use of modern machinery at the trades test centre at Olifantsfontein during the annual slack period of that institution. The State may look after the travelling and other expenses during the journey and employers could look after the class and boarding fees. The Report says further that the necessary boarding house facilities are already in existence. But in this connection I would urge that this scheme should be extended to the urban apprentices also, for it frequently happens that the firm by which he is employed does not have the necessary facilities available. I agree with the recommendation that practical training by employers should be supplemented by technical colleges as the trade test and experience have taught that apprentices in many instances do not have adequate practical training. This is mainly attributed to the fact that employers, even in urban areas, do not have the necessary equipment. As regards this matter, I should like particularly to refer to the small industries. I quote from page 41 of the brochure to which I referred earlier in my speech&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A considerable proportion of the firms in this country are comparatively small. Some of them can and do provide a full craft training for their apprentices, but others are unable to do so owing to the limited range or specialized nature of their production processes. Where this is the case the problem can only be solved by some form of co-operative arrangement between firms, with or without the aid of the local education authority &#x2026; The tendency that emerges from the existing co-operative scheme is for a training workshop to be established in a district to serve the needs of a particular industry, thus providing all the advantages previously exclusive to the training workshop of a large firm, with a like, intimate relation to actual production problems and technique, which is not feasible in the workshop of a technical college. The superintending instructor of the workshop should be given access to all the firms concerned and a syllabus of practical works training should be established whereby an apprentice might serve his time in more than one works in order to ensure a sufficiently wide range of experience. An apprenticeship scheme of this kind will be controlled by a committee representative of the firms in question who would co-operate with the local Technical College to ensure co-ordination with syllabuses of technical instruction.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, what South Africa is going to do as in regard to its future industrially, is going to depend to a large extent on this attempt in regard to our system of apprenticeship and on this occasion I should like first of all to express my thanks and appreciation to the Apprenticeship Board for the comprehensive and wonderful report they drafted. It is one of the best reports I have ever read in our country in connection with labour matters and particularly this matter. In conclusion I should like also to express my thanks to the Minister and the Deputy Minister for having laid this Bill before us, which I believe will contribute largely to the industrial welfare of South Africa.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to join with the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) and other speakers who welcomed this Bill. The most important aspect of this Bill I think points to the fact that we have a shortage of manpower. It has been said that we are already scraping the bottom of the barrel, and if that is the case I think we must go to the root of the supply and find out how we can best recruit more people for industry. There is, as we all know, the feeling that the better and more intelligent youths are encouraged to go to the matriculation class and then pass on to the university and take up one of the professions. We have from time to time heard from individuals who say that the less intelligent should be diverted to trade and industry. I think one of the important methods of recruiting artisans should be to break down this so-called discrimination between the intelligent and the not so intelligent. I will not believe that the less privileged of our population is less intelligent than the more privileged. So many of our children have to leave school at Std. VI because of the economic structure that faces a particular family, the need to get in as much as possible for the family as quickly as possible. I would ask the Deputy Minister as soon as possible to institute as much propaganda as possible into the schools to show that it is just as important for a boy to become an artisan as it is for him to go further in the educational field. I would like to see in the civic classes at school the importance of the artisan shown to the children. Let them realize how important it is for the country to have people to keep the machines of industry turning. The snob attitude that exists in the schools to-day has to be broken down, and the children must be taught that it is no disgrace not to be a white-collar worker or a professional man. For us in this country particularly, where the White person has to bear the brunt of industry, trade, commerce and the professions, it is just as important for our youth to be trained as artisans as it is to go to the university. Even there we have our difficulties and shortages, but if we want the wheels of industry to turn properly in this country, which is becoming more and more industrialized, we have to recruit as many of the youth as possible. When I talk about the youth, we, who have such a small percentage of White people in this country, have to make use of our females as well as the males, and in those industries where girls can be utilized to do work which is not of a strenuous nature but does require skill and training, they should be recruited. I can mention work like in the printing industry. I feel that women should be encouraged to take up printing and lithographic work. The same applies to electrical work and to the field of radio, etc. I think the time has come to encourage the <span class="col_4413-4414" refersTo="page_0781"/>girls in our schools to take up that type of work in increasing numbers. We cannot afford to allow the ranks of industry to remain vacant while we have some potential available. I hope that the Minister will take this suggestion that I have given in regard to making propaganda in the schools to the Minister of Education and let him help in the propagation of the use and the value of the artisan to our country. It is difficult enough when development is slow in the scientific field, but with the rapid development of science to-day in industry and the changes that are taking place overnight it becomes increasingly difficult for the trained artisan to keep pace with the changes that are coming about. So I say that not only has the artisan to be trained and not only has the apprentice to be kept fully informed of these changes, but his work has to be implemented by other sources and that can only be done through tuition, by reading and encouraging apprentices to read as much as possible of the literature available in connection with their work. Some of it is very technical and will not be easily followed by the apprentice, but it is the job of the Department to make this literature available to them in a form in which it can be easily absorbed so that they can put it to good use in their work. I am one of those, like the hon. the Deputy Minister, who believe that it is absolutely essential for examinations to take place to determine the proficiency of any apprentice who wishes to become an artisan. If we are going to raise the status of the artisan, certification is essential. It is something which can be attained, and the final goal should not only be the ability to earn 100 per cent of the wages offered for that particular job, but there should also be some desire to become an expert in the job that has been undertaken. That can only be done if examinations are set for these people.</p>

<p>There are two difficulties I have in regard to examinations. For the man who depends entirely on his ability to pass examinations through his hands alone, that may be all right, but the man who has a goal before him should not only be given a practical examination but there should be facilities for him to show that he has a sound theoretical knowledge of the subject also. Facilities should be offered so that these young boys can show that they are not only proficient practically but that theoretically they can take charge of any workshop and that they have an interest in the work. Let us give those boys a chance to proceed further along the line of advancement. I know that we have just started in this Bill to pave the way for a better future for the apprentice. I know that the success of this Bill can only be determined after it has been in operation for a number of years, but I think the interim period should be utilized to work out ways and means of improving the standards that we expect from our youth.</p>

<p>I want to go further on the point raised by the hon. member for Boksburg. He mentioned that in certain trades and workshops there is not sufficient machinery present to train an apprentice properly. When the inspector comes to visit the workshop he should not only be satisfied that the apprentice is doing his work, but I think that the employer of that apprentice should be examined as well; and I am not at all satisfied that the owners of workshops are doing their job properly and that the type of work that comes out of certain workshops is the best that can be produced. I think the turnover is sometimes more important than the article produced at the end of the line. I think we must go into these matters more carefully and see that the type of work produced is in accordance not only with the apprentice&#x2019;s ability, or of the artisan&#x2019;s ability, but is in accordance with a certain standard that we want our country to keep up. We have to start right at the bottom if we want to have a country which produces good articles and the only way we can do it is to encourage the apprentice to take as much interest in his work as possible, and he can only do that if the example is given by his superiors, especially by his foreman and his boss. It is for that reason that I suggest that the inspector should take an interest in the work produced, and not only in how the apprentice does his work.</p>

<p>There is one matter I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister and on which I spoke during the last Budget debate. It comes under the training of artisans and I hope Mr. Speaker will allow me to deal with this matter now. I said that in certain trades and industries people occasionally find that for one reason or another they become unfit to continue with the type of work they have been doing. They still have many years of fruitful work in front of them. Take, e.g., a mine-worker, whom I discussed last year. I said that when the mineworker reaches the second stage of phthisis he should be taken out of the mine and taught a trade. That man will have to undergo a similar type of training that the apprentice undergoes. I hope that the Minister will realize that it is becoming terribly important for us to preserve as much of the manpower we have as possible, and for that reason I ask him now to start drawing up legislation whereby a man who is already doing one type of work will be able to transfer to another type of work and be helped to do so. I do not know how it will work. I do not know whether it is possible for an adult to absorb the work required from an apprentice quicker than an apprentice does. Can a man who has been a mineworker for a number of years put his talents to use to become a motor mechanic or an electrician quicker than a boy who has just come out of school? Is it possible for him to have the six-year apprenticeship reduced to three years because of his semi-skill in a particular type of work? I think it deserves investigation to see whether we cannot utilize the material which will become available to us because of disability in one form or another of workers, so that they can be absorbed in some other type of work which is more suitable to their state of health. <span class="col_4415-4416" refersTo="page_0782"/>I also want to suggest to the Minister that all those people who to-day have some physical deformity should be trained to do as much skilled work as possible, through rehabilitation centres, and from there they can go to the factories. I hope that the Minister will investigate this problem as well and see whether he cannot take into the factories those people who have been handicapped in some way. Too many of these people go about to-day helpless and with a feeling of hopelessness in regard to their future because they cannot be absorbed into factories to do skilled work, although so many of them have the intelligence and the will to do this type of work. But very little opportunity is given to them, and on their behalf I say that the time has come to give special recognition to them so that they can be employed usefully.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to say that nothing should be made easier for the apprentice. He should have to do his work up to the standard required from him by law. I am not one of those who say that because there happens to be a shortage of artisans, the apprentice should be allowed to qualify as easily as possible. I sincerely hope that the tests and examinations which are set for the apprentice are such that it will take only a first-class man to pass, because we have no room for second and third-class people in our country.</p>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are two things of which the Republic of South Africa can be proud. The one is the rapid industrial development that we have experienced since World War II and the other is our Apprenticeship Act, an Act that is amongst the best of its kind in the world, if not the best. But the hon. the Deputy Minister and the Minister were not satisfied with the legislation that we had on our Statute Book governing apprenticeship and they went further and appointed a committee to inquire into the shortcomings which existed in the present Act. And so we again have before us to-day what can probably be regarded as a model Bill, as one of the best, and we want to congratulate the hon. the Deputy Minister in this regard. I am pleased that we are all in agreement in this regard.</p>

<p>But if there is one thing that disturbs all of us it is the fact that we find that the incidence of failures amongst apprentices in the various industries is so high. This was again illustrated to us by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) when he pointed out the very large number of apprentices who fail to pass their final examinations. Let us investigate this matter more closely and see what the actual reason is for this. Why do we find that so many apprentices do not pass their final examinations? What is the cause of this?</p>

<p>The first thing that I want to say&#x2014;and I am very pleased in this regard&#x2014;is that the stigma of the &#x201C;trade school&#x201D;, which has always attached to a trade, is gradually falling away because of the fact that the Government is going out of its way to make better facilities available at all our technical schools. When we look at the important facilities that have been made available over the past years we are grateful for them and we hope that these facilities will assist in reducing the large number of failures. Another matter is the attitude of parents. The moment that a lad becomes an apprentice&#x2014;and we must realize that he is only a boy of 16 or 17 years of age&#x2014;the parent feels that his responsibility towards the child ceases because the child is now working for himself, and he leaves him to it. If only the parent will realize that he still has the same responsibility towards that child whom he allows to enroll as an apprentice as he has in respect of a child who attends high school, or in respect of a young person attending university, we will experience greater success. The parents ought to co-operate with the employer and the State and the school to obtain a better final product.</p>

<p>Then I feel that with the improvements for which this Bill provides we shall have a great deal of success in reducing the large number of failures. In the first place there will now be a central registration office where all apprentices will have to be registered and that office will be under the control of the Department of Labour. In other words, all apprentices will now have to be registered. Furthermore, aptitude tests will have to be taken in the future. I contend that the high failure rate that we have is due to the fact that in the past a child had to become an artisan because his father was one, whether the child was suited for it or not. The parent forced him into that calling because that was the parent&#x2019;s calling. I am pleased to see that all apprentices will have to undergo aptitude tests in the future. I have noticed that a child goes in a certain direction. The parents leave him to his own devices because they know that in the long run he will become an artisan simply because he has served his time, whether he has undergone tests or not. That is why we welcome the opportunity which is now being created to undergo aptitude tests. I want to ask that the parent should take better care to ensure that the child attends the various classes at the technical school. One feels rather sorry that after two years those classes are done away with if the child has not been successful, but we know the reason for that. The children sit in the classrooms; they take no interest in the work and merely distract the other children. The first thing that I feel will reduce the number of failures is this logbook system that is now being introduced. The hon. member for Umhlatuzana says that this system does not work so well on the Railways. I myself have a business and I employ a number of apprentices. Since we are going to introduce this logbook system and since the Minister is going to appoint inspectors&#x2014;we know that nobody likes an inspector, neither the employer nor the apprentice&#x2014;I want to say that I see this inspector as an adviser. We must not regard him as a person who wants to prosecute the apprentice or the employer. <span class="col_4417-4418" refersTo="page_0783"/>If the employer does not do his duty he must be prosecuted, but I can say to-day that the biggest shortcoming in our apprenticeship system is in the workshop. The necessary attention is not given to the apprentice there. It is not the apprentice who is so bad, but he is being used by many people to-day as a source of cheap labour and care is not taken to ensure that he receives the training that he ought to receive. But when we test this new system I want to tell the hon. the Minister that as far as I know these inspectors of the Department of Labour they are people who like to give advice The amount of co-operation between the employer and the apprentice will depend upon these inspectors. I also want to issue the warning that it is the easiest thing in the world to fill in a logbook. That is why I want to ask, as other hon. members did, that these inspectors should be people with a thorough knowledge of the trade and thorough training. It is of no avail to appoint a person with clerical experience to see whether the logbook is kept up to date, whether he can prosecute the employer or create friction between the two groups. They have to be men who can help us to reduce this large number of failures. The fourth reason why I feel that we will be able to reduce this number of failures is to be found in what the Government has done for our technical schools since 1948. We find that in 1948 there were only 81 technical schools in the Republic of South Africa and to-day there are 143. As far as the rural apprentice is concerned, the technical school has to-day been brought far closer to him in our rural towns. The position is not, as the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) said, that a boy who lives in Springbok has to come to Cape Town or that a boy living in a rural town in the Transvaal has to go to Johannesburg. There are technical schools at Pietersburg and Bethal to-day; we find these technical schools in many places to-day. We see that since 1948 the Government has spent no less less R 12,000,000 on improvements to existing technical schools and the erection of new technical schools, and all of this has resulted in our having a better type of artisan to-day. The fifth encouragement is the improvement in the wage scales. I agree with the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) that we must not lower the educational qualifications, nor should we make the wages so attractive. That is not going to supply us with better artisans. There are other things that we should do for these boys. A very great improvement is being effected in this Bill in the wages of apprentices, but is the question of wages the true reason why we do not attract a better type of person and why there are so many failures? Mr. Speaker, look what the Government is doing for our universities. As far as universities are concerned we find that since 1948 the State has contributed R71,000,000 to the cost of these universities by way of State grants. We find that the allowance per student has been increased from R102 to R284. What is the position as far as secondary schools are concerned? We find that in 1948 the State contributed R30,000,000 to their education and in 1961 R83,000,000. Has the time not come for us to have a new dispensation as far as apprentices are concerned? Has the time not come for us to reorganize our apprenticeship system? When the mines originally found it very difficult to get mineworkers they established their own schools, the G.M.T.S., where they trained young miners. We know that the mining industry has been built up into the best organized industry in our country. The mining industry established its own schools to train young men and look at the results that they have produced! But what has happened under the apprenticeship system? Here we find a 16-year-old boy. He is left to his own devices. He works during the day with a group of men. He listens to all their talk about what they did the previous evening. He wants to follow their example and yet that evening or in the afternoon he has to go to school. I think that the time has come for us to have a new set-up as far as the training of apprentices in this country is concerned. The State ought to take over the training in co-operation with industry and ought to set up training institutions where the apprentices can live together, work together and play together. Then we will train artisans in South Africa of whom we can be proud, but while we allow a lad to work in a small workshop during the day and then leave him to his own devices in the afternoon or in the evening, undisciplined, we cannot expect these people to become top quality artisans. I want to make a plea here this afternoon. South Africa has taken the lead in many spheres. South Africa can still become the workshop of Africa and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to create a new set-up for apprentices; that training institutions should be established for them on the same basis as we have our gymnasiums and police college to-day; that we should follow the same policy followed in the mining industry in connection with the training of its apprentices. Then we will train men in the mining industry and in the various facets of our industrial life of whom we can be proud. But in the meantime we are very grateful to the hon. the Minister for this legislation. We are sure that under this new set-up we will be able to overcome the problems that we have experienced in the past. If we can receive the co-operation of the parent, the child, the State and the school I am convinced that we will be able to produce better results in the years that lie ahead.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I have the temerity to take part in this debate because, as has been emphasized by the hon. members for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) and Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) this Bill is essentially a Bill on education. on the training of apprentices, and it has been apparent throughout the debate, from the speech of the hon. the Deputy Minister and the speeches of other members who have taken part in the debate, that there is not the necessary co-operation or even liaison between the <span class="col_4419-4420" refersTo="page_0784"/>Department of Labour and the Department of Education, Arts and Science. The Department of Education, Arts and Science is responsible for technical training in South Africa, and it seems, as so often happens, that we have two Departments operating here in separate spheres. I think that is most undesirable. If I may add a third Department, I think a third Department would be the Department of Defence because these young men whom we are discussing this afternoon are men who, in addition to being apprentices in their own trade, are men who are called up for service in our forces in the interest of South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir. I should like to endorse what has been said by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton). He has told us that the presentation of the Bill would have been improved if the hon. the Deputy Minister had issued a White Paper, a memorandum, or had even referred it to a Select Committee. That is my own suggestion. There is such a large measure of agreement about this Bill that I think we could have cooperated together rather better than we usually do on Select Committees. I think an opportunity was missed there because we could have produced a better Bill and fortified the hon. the Deputy Minister in the sound views which he has put forward on some of the clauses. Sir. this question of technical training in South Africa is a very old one, and one remembers the pioneer work that was done by an engineer, Professor John Orr, who established our system of technical education for these apprentices on the Witwatersrand. He was a member of the Education Commission that goes under the name of that great South African, Dr. Frans de Villiers, who was the chairman of this commission. That commission was appointed to make recommendations in regard to technical training, but they found, as we always find in discussions on education, that the scope of the subject broadened; that it was not only technical training, it became academic training; it became the whole system of training in South Africa because our systems are interwoven. Sir. that commission brought out a very interesting report. I am sorry to strike a personal note here but I was associated with the training of these apprentices on the academic side in the early days. I must confess that we failed and when I make that confession I am bound to say that, having heard what is happening to-day, having heard these examination results, I feel that we are in no better position to-day than we were then. We have not made the necessary progress. The hon. member for Salt River has given us some figures; we have had other figures from other members who have spoken and they are very disturbing because they mean that we do not seem to be getting the right type of people to train as artisans. Sir. can we get the right type? This is part of the South African dilemma. In South Africa we have a population of 15,000,000 people, and 3,000,000 Whites of that population are called upon to provide the Civil Service, the fighting forces and the skilled artisans. Throughout every walk of life we are in a privileged position. We find that we have not sufficient men to fill those posts. In a country such as Canada or Australia, many men who fail to become efficient artisans would become labourers or, to use the new term we have, operators&#x2014;men who have a certain amount of the necessary mechanical intelligence but are not sufficiently skilled to become qualified artisans. This question of the principle of apprenticeship is a very old one. Doctors were apprenticed in the early days; attorneys and accountants are apprenticed to-day. The teaching profession was built up on a system of apprenticeship. The apprentices were called pupil teachers. At the age of 15 they were recruited and started teaching from 15 to 18 before they went to a training college. During that early period they were under the supervision of an educationist, usually a headmaster, and that is rather what we are doing with artisans to-day. I sometimes think it would be a very good thing if we could revert to a system of that kind, because what are we doing in the teaching profession to-day? We are emphasizing academic training at the expense of practical training&#x2014;this problem that always crops up in the training of apprentices or of men for any profession. What is the correct balance between the academic training and the practical side? What is the correct balance between schooling, education, and the bench where the man works? How do we do that? Well, in the teaching profession to-day we say that after matriculating a man can go to a university and get a university degree, a B.A., B.Sc. or even an M.A., M.Sc.; he can spend another year obtaining a professional certificate&#x2014;four or five years&#x2019; training&#x2014;and at the end of that time he finds that he has not got the bent, the inclination, to be a schoolmaster. I do not say that his time has been wasted. He has had a valuable education, but in that system of training that we have we have not got the correct balance, the correct balance that we are striving to obtain in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Bill. It is a glaring example to-day. We even have men who go on and take doctors&#x2019; degrees before they go to the school, before they actually go to the bench, to do the thing for which they have been trained for five, six or seven years. That is what we are faced with. Now, when we come to this question of our apprentices, what do I regard as the chief essential? It is this: that however he starts as an apprentice, whatever his academic qualifications are, whether it be Std. VI or Std. VII or matriculation, the road to the top should be clearly open to him. It should be possible for him if he becomes a miner to become a mine manager; the private should have a field-marshal&#x2019;s baton in his knapsack. That is the first essential. In other words, the academic and the practical training should go together. I think we should emphasize that because it is very necessary. When we come to the question of testing, when we say that we are looking for the person&#x2019;s aptitude, his suitability, I think that aptitude tests should be regarded as supplementary but not as decisive. <span class="col_4421-4422" refersTo="page_0785"/>There are many factors that one has to consider. Many men who have not the apparent aptitude at the age of 15 or 16 may develop and have that quality later in life. Therefore any preliminary test that we give him should be regarded as supplementary. I quite agree that we do require an elementary education.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. Deputy Minister is anxious to reply and I am not going to delay this debate. The next thing is the period of apprenticeship. The proposal which the Deputy Minister has given us is a sound one, and we are grateful for that proposal. I am very sorry that we did not know in advance what his proposals were, but the proposal that, for example, in a five-year course of training the man should have an opportunity of having a trade test and a general qualification at the end of four years is a sound one. The proposal that he should go on for another year if he does not pass at the end of five years, is one which I do not think is sound. I am prepared to accept a standard time for training and a minimum time but I am not prepared to extend it; I do not think it is advisable because you are ear-marking a man as one who did not have the necessary ability at the final stage of his apprenticeship. Make it shorter than the regulation period but do not make it longer. I do not mind how much shorter you make it, how many trade tests you give him prior to the completion of the regular course, but do not give him a longer period; do not give him what is nowadays called an inferiority complex. I think that is essential and I wish to emphasize that. Sir, my next point is this, and here I find myself in good company. I believe there is an arrangement that if a young man is called up for military service, four months of that service will be regarded as leave granted to him. Sir, I want to make this appeal&#x2014;the whole of his period of military service should be granted as leave. A young man who is balloted and called up to serve his country should have that privilege, and here I find myself in good company because this is what the Commission said after having considered what could be done&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board accordingly recommends that Section 26 of the Act be amended to permit of all absences due to the undergoing of peace-time military training in terms of the Defence Act, 1957, being regarded as authorized absence.</block>

<p>I say that it should be the full period. I am not content with four months. Why should a young man who is not called up be privileged over the man who is called up? I would suggest that when a young man who is an apprenticed fitter, for example, is called up, an effort should be made to draft him, for example, to an Air Force unit, or a transport unit, where, after he has done the drill and so on in the elementary stages, after he has done his recruit training, he can go to a shop and serve the country and the army in a capacity that will assist him in his own trade. I should like to make that suggestion. I think it could be done, but whether it can be done or not, no man who goes on military training should have to sacrifice anything; he should rather receive some benefit. I go very much further in regard to university men. I say that if a young man has been to the gymnasium or if he has served his nine months&#x2019; training as a ballotee he should have priority in admission to a university. He has served his country, and he has a right to say to his country &#x201C;Now I should like you to help me rather than the man who did not go for military training&#x201D;. I am very anxious that this should be done and I hope that the Deputy Minister will consider that.</p>

<p>I should like to pay a tribute to the Deputy Minister for the manner in which he has introduced this Bill. I am sorry he did not make it possible for us to co-operate as we should have liked to co-operate, but I do feel that together we can make a good Bill out of this. We can regard it, as he said, as experimental for a period and we can work together. I think perhaps he could get a joint committee to assist him even at this stage, but I want to give him the assurance, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana has done, that we are very keen to co-operate and that we expect a good Bill and a good system of training.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>It is pleasant to hear hon. members who have spoken paying a tribute to the hon. the Deputy Minister in regard to this legislation. It is quite apparent that this Bill is meeting with a favourable reception in this House, but I have noticed that throughout the discussions there has appeared a fear as to the future. I have listened very intently to some of the speakers, not all, and it is quite clear from their statements and from Press reports that South Africa is scraping the bottom of the pot for apprentices. Sir, that is a very serious statement. It is quite unnecessary for South Africa to scrape the bottom of the pot for apprentices. The reason is that there appears to be an unfortunate refusal to draw upon the big reservoir of people who can fill these positions, who can become apprentices, who are there for the asking if they are only encouraged to become apprentices in the various trades. I refer to the Coloured people of South Africa. Sir, the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) has quoted certain figures; I do not intend to quote them again. I merely wish to draw certain inferences from his figures and to show how few Coloured people are attending the lectures offered at the technical colleges. Sir, the Minister was asked how many White and Coloured apprentices were enrolled at technical colleges during the years 1961 and 1962, and the reply was: Whites, in 1961, 28,839; Coloureds 1,027, a ratio of 22 to 1. The same ratio exists apparently in respect of the year 1962: 22,931 Whites and 1,086 Coloureds. Why should there be that disparity when the White population is just over 3,000,000 and the Coloured population about 1,500,000. In spite of that the ratio is 22 Whites to one Coloured. What is the reason for it? Why does this country not make use of the Coloured youth of South in the various trades? Why is it that the Coloured youth who is fit <span class="col_4423-4424" refersTo="page_0786"/>and competent and very keen to enter this field of employment, is not accepted as an apprentice? Because there is this unfortunate prejudice. Apparently people will not work with the Coloured boy. If you have an industry where five, six, eight or 10 apprentices are required, they all have to be Europeans for some reason or another. Coloured boys are not accepted? Why? I do believe, representing the Coloured people as I do in this House that the time has arrived for the Government to say, &#x201C;we will make use of the Coloured youth of this country to help us to overcome this problem.&#x201D; The Government should introduce legislation forcing people to accept one Coloured apprentice to every three White apprentices, and only in that way will we break down this wall of prejudice and will we be able to overcome this apparent derth in the applications for apprenticeship. Sir, the Government should set the example. There are certain Government departments where Coloured people are not accepted as apprentices. We are told that there is no colour bar in regard to this matter. Why then is it that the Coloured youth is not accepted? I do believe that the Minister must consider making it obligatory for the Coloured youth to be accepted by employers as an apprentice where more than four apprentices are employed by a particular undertaking. I know that the Deputy Minister will say that that would be interfering with the liberty of the subject. He would say, &#x201C;how can I force employers to engage people of a certain colour or a certain type?&#x201D; But the Minister must realize that the Coloured people are looking for avenues of employment, and this avenue should be opened up for them. If it is not done by voluntary acceptance then it should be done by legislation. I know that I am perhaps suggesting something here which is completely novel, completely unacceptable, but I am not afraid to put forward something that is new in our thinking in South Africa. It is high time we thought along those lines, and I do believe that the Government should set an example by accepting Coloured youths as apprentices in certain Government departments. Sir, the figures quoted by the hon. member for Salt River reveal a sad story as far as the Coloured people are concerned. It is a sad state of affairs that so few Coloured apprentices are attending technical colleges. I say it is unfortunate.</p>

<p>Sir. I merely wanted to explain to this House that the Coloured man is never thought of in this type of legislation, and that is why I have got up at this late hour to say that Coloured youths are available as apprentices but we are not making use of this wonderful reservoir of labour. I repeat and emphasize in conclusion that it is not necessary for us to scrape the bottom of the barrel because there are thousands of our people who are able to step into the breach if required. All we want is to show good faith towards the Coloured people; all we want is a sincere approach, and then we will not have the difficulties which have been explained to us this afternoon in regard to apprentices.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_labour">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF LABOUR</person>:</from>

<p>I think the biggest compliment this Bill could have been paid was the dissatisfaction expressed by the Opposition because it was not introduced at an earlier date. This Bill contains so many advantages that one would have liked to have had it introduced earlier. It was asked why this Bill was being introduced such a long time after the inquiry and it was pointed out that something like four years had elapsed since the inquiry. As I said in my introductory speech it took that Apprenticeship Board two years to sort out and to tabulate the mass of information they had obtained but that is not the only reason why the Bill is only introduced to-day. This Bill could already have been introduced last year and the reason why it was not introduced last year but only this year is the very fact that they fully considered the trade union movement in this respect. The Trade Union Council notified us of their objection to the extension of the period of apprenticeship by one year and because we felt that we wanted to give full recognition to the Trade Union Council as an important part of the trade union movement in regard to this matter, Minister Trollip decided last year to submit the Bill once again to the Apprenticeship Board so that this proposed extension by one year could be discussed. The Apprenticeship Board then met again in October last year, I think, to listen to the objections of the Trade Union Council in connection with this extension of one year. On that occasion they once again discussed the question thoroughly. It then appeared that the other members of the Apprenticeship Board which consisted of employers and the other trade union representatives adhered to their original attitude, namely that it was essential to extend the period by one year. It was only the two representatives of the Trade Union Council who were against it. That is the reason why it was not introduced last year but only this year.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we have had a very fruitful discussion. I should like to express my appreciation to the hon. members for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) and Boksburg (Mr. G. L. H. van Niekerk) and Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) for their pleas and expositions. What they said proved that they had made a very thorough study of the subject and that they had first-hand knowledge of it. I also wish to express my appreciation to hon. members on the other side of the House who were so interested in this matter. I should like to mention one hon. member in particular and that is the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton). It was clear from his speech that he had made a particularly thorough study of the report of the Apprenticeship Board and everything that goes with it. I shall briefly reply to certain aspects which he and other hon. members have raised. The hon. member wanted to know, <i>inter alia,</i> which recommendations of the Apprenticeship Board we did not accept. There are really only three recommendations which we have not accepted. The one deals with appeals under Section 30 of the old Act. <span class="col_4425-4426" refersTo="page_0787"/>That was not accepted because it was felt that in essence the Apprenticeship Board was really an advisory board intended to advise the Minister. That was the reason why we regarded it as unnecessary. The second recommendation of the Apprenticeship Board which we did not accept was the one which dealt with the quota of apprentices. As hon. members know Section 16 (2) (<i>p</i>) of the existing Act provides that the Minister, after consultation with the Apprenticeship Committee, can prescribe the maximum and minimum number of apprentices in any industry. That provision has, however, never been resorted to. It was felt in the past, as it is felt to-day, that the Apprenticeship Committees are really best able to determine what the requirements in any industry are and that it was not necessary to lay down the quota in any other way. This is, in parenthesis, also a reply to the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). I shall reply to him more specifically in a moment. We cannot lay down quotas in the Apprenticeship Act in respect of the number of apprentices whether they are White or non-White or the total number. It was decided not to do that but I shall reply to the hon. member&#x2019;s representations more specifically in a moment or two.</p>

<p>The third recommendation which we did not accept is the one which deals with annual leave. We considered it to be unnecessary to lay that down in legislation because the existing Industrial Council agreements, Wage Determinations, etc. under the Factories Act already make provision for annual leave for most apprentices. Section 16 (2) of the present Act also provides for the Minister to prescribe conditions governing apprentices&#x2019; leave. That is really unnecessary because they are already covered by existing wage conditions. We consequently felt that it was unnecessary to insert something in the Act which was not relevant.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana raised various matters. I want to start with the technical qualifications of inspectors which he pleaded for. He said that they should not merely be academicians. The hon. member for Brakpan also raised the same matter. Those people must naturally be qualified artisans who have also had academic training. They will, however, have to be mainly qualified artisans otherwise it will be impossible for them to make enquiries and to carry out useful inspection work in regard to the teaching of a trade if they lack the necessary trade background.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana also referred to the number who failed the tests, also those in the Railway service. One of the most important reasons is, of course, the fact that theory is still a requirement. Where we are now providing that the compulsory examination will only deal with practical subjects I take it that the number of failures will decrease considerably. The hon. member then referred to the Railways and said that although they kept logbooks the number of failures was still high. I agree that that is so but we trust that the number will decrease under this new system. He also said that there were artisans on the Railways who lacked the necessary academic qualifications but who nevertheless received bonuses. That is understandable, Mr. Speaker, because bonuses are paid on the strength of their manual work. The position is that there are people who are proficient with their hands but not very good in theory and that they do indeed deserve bonuses. I shall deal with the other aspects raised by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana at another stage.</p>

<p>He also said that this additional year may lead to it that the trade union movement, as he puts it, &#x201C;will be in an embarrassing position because there will be two types of artisans namely those who have passed a qualifying trade test and those who have not and that those who have passed an examination will be entitled to a higher rate of pay than the others&#x201D;. That is one of two viewpoints. In reply to that I wish to say that it is customary to-day for employers to pay the good worker more than the wage laid down in a wage determination or a wage agreement. It is customary, if a man is a proficient worker, for him to draw a higher wage. We are not aware of it that trade unions differentiate between good and slow workers when it comes to enrolling them as trade union members.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to the problems which platteland apprentices experience with their correspondence courses because they are not near technical colleges. That is true. There are not technical colleges everywhere in the country. The question that arises is this: Should one deny the boy on the platteland who wants to learn a trade the right to do so because there is not a technical college? Of course not. The alternative is for him to take a correspondence course. And those correspondence courses are not offered by every correspondence college; that course is offered by the Witwatersrand Technical College, a college which has distinguished itself by its experience in training apprentices. We feel that in circumstances where there are insufficient technical colleges available on the platteland this correspondence course offers the best solution.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) pleaded very strongly for it that we should make propaganda amongst the schoolgoing children not to despise the work of an artisan and that boys who show an aptitude for a trade should be encouraged in that direction. Wherever I appear in my capacity as Deputy Minister of Education at technical schools. I always plead with parents to allow their children to develop according to their natural talents; that they should not develop an academic complex but that it is in the interests of the child and the country for the child to receive that training which is best suited to his talents. If it appears that a boy or a girl is best suited to follow a technical direction they should be encouraged in that direction. It is not only the task of us who are attached to the Ministry of Education to do that. I think everybody, particularly you as Members of Parliament, can do a great deal <span class="col_4427-4428" refersTo="page_0788"/>in this connection. You can do a great deal to remove that misconception that if a child follows a trade it is proof of his poor intellect and his inability to follow an academic direction. I think you as Members of Parliament can do a great deal when you appear in public in your own constituencies or wherever it may be to correct public opinion about technical training by pleading its cause.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Rosettenville pleaded further that we should give these people, the mineworkers, for instance, who are no longer able to do that work, an opportunity to go in another direction. That, of course, is a matter which is very dear to one&#x2019;s heart but it is a matter which this measure can only help to remedy to a very small extent. If a mineworker, for example, is no longer able to do that work and he wants to do something else, whether he wants to become an electrician or whatever it may be, he should at least have experience in that direction. If he has the experience he can write a trade test at Olifantsfontein. In that regard this measure only assists in this respect that if a man has been trained in one direction, if he has qualified in terms of the Apprenticeship Act and he does not want to or cannot continue in that direction, he now has an opportunity of writing a test at Olifantsfontein in order to qualify in a different direction and to be recognized in it. It is not, however, the function of this measure itself to train people. I think this is a matter which should rather be raised under the Labour Vote or perhaps under the Education Vote; although Labour would be preferable.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) pleaded for the necessary liaison between the Departments of Labour and Education. In this respect I can testify as to my own experience. I have been connected With Labour and Education over the past year and that is why I can testify from my own experience that there is the closest co-operation between these two Departments particularly as far as the training of apprentices, the laying down of study conditions, etc., are concerned I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that the co-operation which Labour receives from Education in regard to the training at technical colleges is of the best. The hon. member will also notice from the report that the Department of Education, Arts and Science appeared before the Apprenticeship Board and that they gave very valuable evidence. As I have said, I can only testify from my own personal experience that there is the very closest co-operation between the two Departments to the advantage of the apprentice himself.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington also pleaded for it that we should recognize the whole nine-month period during which an apprentice does military service instead of the four months to Which I have referred. The hon. member quoted from the report of the Apprenticeship Board in support of his plea. I can only say that that was recommended before it was decided to extend the period of military service to nine months. That was recommended on the basis of the previous arrangement. The decision to extend it to four months was taken to conform with the Department of Defence. It will interest the hon. member for Kensington to know that we are indeed complying with his request that when an apprentice does military service he should do the same type of work as the trade to which he is apprenticed. That is done to the extent to which it is practically possible to do so. There is an agreement between Labour and Defence that they will try to place the apprentice in that direction in the military service in which he has been trained, so that the break of nine months in his training will not disrupt him completely.</p>

<p>I again return to the hon. member for Umhlatuzana. He raised the question of the aptitude test as well as the question of registration with the Department of Labour. He wanted to know whether it would actually mean that every apprentice would have to register with the Department of Labour and what the position would be of those who did not register and whether their employers could indeed employ them. We prefer intending apprentices to register with the Department of Labour but it is not essential for them to do so. If he does not do so and an employer himself gets an apprentice he will be allowed to do so. But in this connection I refer the hon. member to Section 79 (b) of the report of the Apprenticeship Board which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That a prospective apprentice in possession of the minimum educational qualification of Std. VII or equivalent certificate should compulsorily undergo an aptitude test and that in the event of failure an employer shall retain the right to indenture such prospective apprentice provided his continued employment after one year of apprenticeship shall be reviewed in consultation with the Apprenticeship Committee concerned and the inspector appointed for the area in which he is indentured.</block>

<p>In other words, it is not a requirement that he should be screened beforehand by the aptitude section of the Department. He can get there in a roundabout way, but after a year he has to be subjected to the revision which I have just read out.</p>

<p>In reply to the question how effective this aptitude test is I can only say that our own experience over the past years has been that it is an excellent institution. As a matter of fact it answers so well to its purpose that various Government Departments are at the moment making use of the aptitude tests of the Department of Labour. Even the Department Of Labour is making use of it with a view to placing their ballotees. The Civil Service use it: Iscor use it to determine in which direction they should train their young men. You can rest assured, Mr. Sneaker, that this aptitude test is a particularly successful undertaking and that the boys are not unnecessarily subjected to one or other sort of experiment.</p>

<p><span class="col_4429-4430" refersTo="page_0789"/>As far as the question of making Std. VII the minimum requirement is concerned I can only say that it was advocated at the time of the enquiry that the minimum qualification should be raised. As you will see from the report, Sir, the M.U.J.E. even pleaded that it should be Std. VIII. Other bodies pleaded that it should be higher. Std. VII was eventually decided upon after everybody felt that it should indeed be raised. It was stated, however, that if a boy did not have Std. VII but had Std. VI he could still become apprenticed provided he passed an aptitude test. This is contained in Clause 85 where it says that exemption from the minimum educational qualification may be granted if he passes such a test. We are not, therefore, adopting an unreasonable attitude towards these boys.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana raised another matter and that was why wages were not increased when the report was published. That is a reasonable question. One would have liked to have seen an increase at an earlier stage. It would certainly have been an important magnet to draw apprentices. In this respect I can only refer the House to a decision taken by the board in this connection. I refer to paragraph 111. I shall read the relevant portion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board further recommends that the recommendations in connection with the question of wages should not be implemented until all industries and the respective Apprenticeship Committees have been given an opportunity to consider the recommendations in this regard.</block>

<p>That is the reason why it was not introduced. The employers and the apprenticeship committees have to take the initiative in this respect. Hon. members probably saw a report which appeared in one of the newspapers recently under the heading &#x201C;Apprentices&#x2019; pay almost doubled by Rand firm&#x201D;. It said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The firm has just almost doubled the pay of its apprentices.</block>

<p>They have to take the initiative. That is the one objection which I have to the note of criticism which we have had here to-day. Hon. members opposite ask why the Government did not do so; why did the Government dawdle with this; why did it not do something else earlier. Mr. Speaker, this Bill only creates the machinery whereby action can be taken. The initiative to increase these wages in order to give effect to this recommendation still rests with the employers and these apprenticeship committees. The Department of Labour will, however, urge them to do so as far as possible but the initiative rests with them in the first place. We are only creating the machinery whereby action can be taken. The reason why the wages were not increased must, therefore, to a large extent be sought with the apprenticeship committees. We trust, however, that in future this will be thrown into a high gear and that we shall in the near future see a substantial general wage increase as far as apprentices are concerned.</p>

<p>I am coming to the end and I just want to deal with the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). He expressed concern about the fact that during this time of a shortage of manpower we were displaying such unwillingness to draw from the Coloured labour resources. With reference to that he mentioned the number of trades to which Coloureds could be apprenticed. I think it is very unreasonable to adopt the attitude that there is a deliberate reluctance to indenture Coloured apprentices. I have just receive these data in connection with Coloured apprentices in the Cape Peninsula, data which are very revealing. There are 449 Coloured apprentices in the building industry in the Cape Peninsula, As opposed to that there are 193 Whites. The hon. member for Boland used the expression &#x201C;a sad story&#x201D; a moment ago. What does the hon. member think will the Whites have to say if it is drawn to their attention that there are 449 Coloured apprentices as against 193 Whites? Take the furniture industry for instance: There are 117 Coloured apprentices in the furniture industry in the Peninsula whereas there are only four Whites.</p>

I think, however, that when you plead their cause you should retain your perspective. To plead as though the Government is bent on being unreasonable towards them does not promote their cause. On the contrary I think there are more avenues of employment for Coloureds to-day than ten years ago in this very Cape Peninsula but I do not want to enlarge on that at this stage.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by repeating the words used by the hon. member for Brakpan when he said that we were getting a new set-up as far as the training of apprentices were concerned. This Bill, Mr. Speaker, introduces that new set-up. It introduces a new set-up in regard to the training of apprentices and the provision of the manpower to keep the wheels of this country turning.

<p>Sir, I ask for the privilege of the half-hour. In the present Government the hon. the Prime Minister has no portfolio. He has no portfolio because in fact he has the responsibility for all the portfolios of all his Ministers and he is primarily responsible for the direction which Government policies are taking in South Africa at the present time, and for that reason he takes the responsibility for a situation which has been building up over the period in which his party has directed the destinies of our country and in which they have been in office, a situation which, I believe, he in his heart of hearts tried to avert by making major adaptations and major changes in the traditional policy of the Nationalist Party. But these devices failed, and as a result the hon. gentleman and his Government face, I believe, a worse position perhaps than they would have if these changes had not been made. Sir, when the Minister of Foreign Affairs has finished perhaps I can continue.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>The trouble has been that the policies of this Government have been based on fear, the exploitation of fear amongst the people of South Africa, and when the time came for adaptation and to consider changes, the hon. the Prime Minister found himself in the position that he was unable to consider changes or adaptations which did not make full concessions to those fears which he himself had helped to create amongst the people of the Republic, and the fact is that even the Bantustan policy in respect of non-European affairs is merely an attempt to escape from the realities of the situation. The situation is now building up. It has built up in such a way that there are now certain aspects which are worrying the public perhaps more than others and worrying them perhaps more than at any time in the history of the Republic, certainly in the last 20 years. I think the first of these, and for the moment perhaps the most dramatic of them, is the question of the internal security of the Republic. This is a matter which has been aggravated by the unsatisfactory nature of the statements of the hon. the Prime Minister himself in respect of the situation as it exists at the present time. The hon. gentleman asks us to believe that we are going through a period of crises in South Africa but that at the same time there is more peace and order in South Africa than in most other countries in the world. The hon. the Prime Minister cannot blame us if we interpret those statements in the light of the events which immediately succeeded his making them and decide for ourselves where the emphasis should be put. More especially, I would say. as most ordinary people regard a country in which there is peace and quiet as one which is free from recurrent crises.</p>

<p>What have we had since the hon. the Prime Minister made that statement just before the recess? We have had fresh reports of raids and arrests of so-called Poqo members; there has been another organized attack upon a police station in King William&#x2019;s Town; there has been a shooting affray between alleged Poqo members and the police at East London. <span class="col_4433-4434" refersTo="page_0791"/>We have received notice that the hon. the Minister of Justice will ask for new powers; there have been instances of other race groups than the Bantu co-operating in essentially Bantu organizations engaged in terrorism or sabotage. Both the Coloured and the Indian race groups have been involved. We have had a conviction of Coloured men for sabotage down here in the docks; we have had the arrest of Indians on the allegation of attempted sabotage.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister says &#x201C;and Whites&#x201D;. We do not yet know what the charges against them are; perhaps he has more knowledge than I have in that regard. I shall be very happy to have a statement from the hon. the Prime Minister on that subject. [Interjections.] My hon. friend is talking about Patrick Duncan. The hon. the Minister of Justice missed him. He is not here; they have not arrested him. All this is happening in the country despite that most stringent legislation first in 1950, then in 1953, then again in 1960 and then again last year, legislation which, we were told, would result in the maintenance of law and order, in the crushing of these organizations and in the Government being in a position to take action which would destroy them completely. We were promised that organizations like the A.N.C. and the P.A.C. and Poqo would be destroyed by this legislation. We now find that they are vying with each other or co-operating; I do not know which; perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister will tell us. We hear from members on the Government side that the threat of Communism has never been more serious than at the present time.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>My hon. friend says all over the world. He may be right; I doubt it. I believe that most nations in the world believe that the threat of Communism is receding. I believe that the United States of America and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have done a great deal to reduce that threat. I accept that in this country under this Government, and because of the way in which this Government has administered its policies and the way in which it has carried on, the threat is greater than it has been. Hon. members agree with me; there is no doubt about it. All this is happening in a country in which violence, death, sabotage, etc., are more prevalent than anyone could have believed ten years ago. While that is the situation our Police Force is protecting the lives and the property of the Republic in a manner which, I think, deserves the profound admiration of every single person. I think, Sir, we must realize that our Police Force is dealing with the position in growing difficulty, because more and more they are being called upon to carry out their duties in a situation which I believe is increasingly unfair to them. Because in many parts of the country they are not in the position to protect those sections of the population whose co-operation they need most. No Police Force can act efficiently without the active co-operation of those people amongst whom they have to enforce the law. I think that was demonstrated most clearly in connection with the liquor laws and I think it is being demonstrated, unfortunately, at the present time.</p>

<p>I think when one goes into the causes of the situation then there are two aspects most particularly which force themselves into your consciousness and which you have to consider; I think that those two aspects have been accentuated by the result of Government policies during the period in which this Government and its immediate predecessors, rule by the same party, have been in office. You see, Sir, for years we warned this Government that the implementation and the practical administration of the belief that the Native workers in our urban areas were only temporary visitors from their natural homelands where they were truly domiciled, might lead to trouble of one kind or another. The hon. the Prime Minister is now faced with vast complexes around our cities where hundreds of thousands of those people dwell as, can best be described, a rootless proletariat and where they lack the steadying influence of elementary privileges like home ownership and assured family life. It seems to us that the hon. the Prime Minister is trying to force people who have already become detribalized back into a tribal pattern and a tribal existence. He is trying with, I believe, ruinous results to treat permanently urbanized people as though they were still tribal peasants. Although he is trying to do that, Sir, what do we find? We find that even in an area like the Western Province, from which the hon. gentleman believes they should be removed so that the evils which I have mentioned could be eradicated, that according to a statement made over the week-end the hon. the Prime Minister is not prepared to face the full consequences of his policy. Because the full consequences of that policy must be to damage the economy of the Western Province. It cannot be otherwise. Where are the jobs for these people to go to, Sir? What is going to happen to the jobs they vacate? What unhappiness are we not going to have as a result of the implementation of that policy? There is much talk about carrying it out, Sir; there is much talk about the sacrifices but it seems that the courage is lacking to fulfil the policy.</p>

<p>The hon. gentleman is reported over the week-end&#x2014;I want to do him justice in this regard&#x2014;to have said that if they could provide 500,000 jobs for the Bantu people in industry in 50 years&#x2019; time they could look after the Whole Native population. When one examines that. Mr. Chairman, you find that that is so ridiculous that it must be a mis-report. At the same time the hon. the Prime Minister must have said something. He must have said something in respect of the industrialization of the <span class="col_4435-4436" refersTo="page_0792"/>Bantu people. Perhaps when he replies he will give us some idea of what it was he really said so that we can judge the statement at its true value. Because 500,000 jobs in 50 years means 10,000 a year. According to the report each one is going to provide work for five others and those five others, in turn, will provide work for five more. That means ten people dependent on one man engaged in industry. That is jobs for 10,000 a year. But that is not going to cope with the Native population. That is not going to cope with the natural increase in the reserves and the people he has to take off the land because they are destroying not only the soil but are unable to make a living there.</p>

<p>There is another implication of that statement. Does that mean that this policy which is being applied to the Western Province is to be applied to the rest of South Africa as well and to migratory labour in general? The trouble with all this is that once you start pushing people around, once you start breaking up families, once you start eradicating them from areas just because you believe those areas should be reserved for other kinds of labour, those people tend to fall an easy prey to agitators and to inciters. The tragedy of the whole situation as I see it at the present time is that the hon. the Prime Minister can find no answer to this apparent evil if he is to continue with his policy, because it is the product of a policy and an outlook which is fundamental to the hon. gentleman himself.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, he is faced with something else. He is faced with a second aspect which makes the situation very difficult. For years we have warned him that unless he was prepared to adopt a different attitude towards the Cape Coloured people and towards the Asiatic people we ran the risk that those two groups would make common cause with the Bantu, would make common cause with Bantu nationalism in the Republic of South Africa. We have seen signs of that already, Mr. Chairman. We have seen the first signs of that already in the sort of people who are associating themselves with these organizations engaged in sabotage and terrorism. We should have had those people on our side. Those are people, I believe, we could have had on our side; those are people, I believe, we can still have on our side if the hon. the Prime Minister is prepared to reconsider his position.</p>

<p>The expert on crime, the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), is back, Sir. He always talks before he thinks and afterwards he wants to contradict what he said before. I do not think it is necessary to pay any attention to those sort of interjections.</p>

<p>We have warned the Prime Minister for years that this was the sort of development which might take place. We see it beginning to develop now. It is not too late to ask the hon. gentleman to let us know what his policies are in respect of these people. As far as the Coloureds were concerned we had talk about a state within a state with apparently two sovereign parliaments. That idea seems to have been abandoned. Now we do not know where we are. We see restlessness even on the part of that Advisory Council on Coloured affairs to which the majority were nominated and those who were elected were all elected unopposed because of the lack of interest in the election. Even they are beginning to cause trouble to the Minister of Coloured Affairs and Community Development.</p>

<p>I think we are entitled to know from the hon. the Prime Minister what his attitude is because up to now we still have not had an answer, no indication of an improvement in the situation of those people. I have great confidence that the police will destroy Poqo as they have destroyed other organizations before it. I have no doubt they will contain the A.N.C. and its sabotage efforts. I have no doubt whatsoever that they will limit and control communist infiltration. But equally, Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt whatsoever that if present trends are allowed to continue those organizations, or organizations like them, will appear again. They will appear perhaps with more experience; they will appear again perhaps more adept. Because the tragedy is that policies unrelated to the reality tend to cause frustration. And when they are accompanied by pinpricks&#x2014;as is the present situation&#x2014; then you have developing a classical example of a seed-bed in which the agitator, the inciter and the protagonist of a communist idealogy, flourishes and in which he gets support.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I wish the hon. gentleman would go overseas and find out for himself. It would make the proceedings in this House so much more peaceful. You see, Sir, already we are getting people who are taking the line that in this confrontation of Poqo, we have on the one side Black nationalism and on the other side entrenched White nationalism facing each other and that it has nothing whatever to do with grievances or the political policies which are being followed. I think, Sir, that it is not without significance that this organization apparently has its origin and its greatest impetus in the bachelor quarters at Nyanga and Langa. It is not without significance that it murders and attacks its own people. One gets the impression that people are not inclined to embark upon a course of this kind unless activated by very strong emotions and probably very great unhappiness.</p>

<p>I think, certainly in the case of the A.N.C. with its readiness to co-operate with other racial groups, we are not facing just Black nationalism; we are facing something else. The tragedy, as far as the policies of the hon. the <span class="col_4437-4438" refersTo="page_0793"/>Prime Minister are concerned, is that they are unrelated to the present. They are policies based not on the present, because they have no solution for the present except force and it will be some time before they start yielding dividends even in the eyes of the hon. the Prime Minister. I should like to remind the hon. gentleman that Edmund Burke once said words to this effect that force is all right as long as it succeeds but if it fails once, it has failed for ever. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy is only going to start yielding dividends in 1978 when he reverses the trend of the flow from the reserves to the towns. According to him the trend will then be from the towns to the reserves. But that will only be the beginning of the reversal. It seems to me that in hitching his star to that sort of an ideal we are faced with the position that he has completely miscalculated the speed of developments on the African continent, that he does not seem to have come to grips with the situation. In so far as he has, he has not realized the importance of what has been happening. I believe there is only one answer. I believe, if he cannot change his approach, if he is not pliable enough, if he has to make adaptations, there is only one answer and that is that he must make way for people to take over who have policies which are more pliable.</p>

<p>I think there is a second dominant worry which the people of South Africa have and that is in respect of external relations. I believe people are worried and are becoming increasingly so about our isolation and our friendlessness. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has been making speeches over the week-end. He said the position was getting more difficult; that things were piling up against us and that we were being threatened; things were getting worse. I am quoting from a Press report. I hope I am not doing him an injustice. He apparently made another speech during the evening of the same day in which he seemed to indicate that he had knowledge of plans against South Africa of which the public had no knowledge. I read from the report&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C; Volgens inligting tot sy beskikking staan Suid-Afrika voor die gevaar dat die sogenaamde koue oorlog waarin ons land gewikkel is in ander en meer drastiese rigtings uitgebrei sal word,&#x201D; het die Minister van Buitelandse Sake, mnr. Eric Louw, Saterdagaand hier ges&#x00EA; op &#x2019;n huldigingsbyeenkoms.</block>

<p>I wonder whether the public has not got the right to know what the hon. the Minister is warning against. That is not the sort of statement to create confidence in South Africa; that is the sort of statement that indicates that there are further dangers and troubles ahead. He knows about them but he is not telling anybody. He is not telling anybody but we must all stand behind him because he has the answer. It is like 1948, Sir, when he knew how to bring down the cost of living. He had the blueprint in his pocket. When it appeared you know what happened, Sir. You know what a damp squib it was.</p>

<p>I want to say this to the hon. the Minister: We accept that what he says is true, that things are going to get worse. I think under the policies of this Government in the international sphere they must get worse. It cannot be otherwise. We also accept that with this Government in power we have to arm; we have to be prepared for emergencies. I think that is true. I think we accept, thirdly, that the arms and the weapons we have been buying from overseas are for external defence and not for purposes of internal security. Whoever heard of buying frigates and Mirage fighters for internal security purposes? We can produce all the weapons we need for internal security. I want to say that those misguided individuals who are threatening to apply pressure and to cut off the supply of arms to South Africa either do not know what they are talking about or are merely trying to weaken what could possibly be the strongest anti-communist base on the whole continent of Africa.</p>

<p>Under this Government we must realize that in the international sphere our position is lonely and dangerous. And it is becoming increasingly so. The hon. the Prime Minister, as we noted earlier, changed the traditional policy of his party to try to get some measure of world support. But the attempt failed absolutely. The Transkei Constitution Bill, which I cannot discuss, is merely one incident of that policy. All the dangers inherent in the policy remain even though it has failed to bring in any world dividends of any kind or of any importance. One has not to look very far to find out why there have not been any dividends. I believe there are two fundamental reasons. The first is that the change by the hon. the Prime Minister is regarded by the world as not a relaxation, not a change of direction, but an intensification of the apartheid policy of his Government. I believe, secondly, because the actions of this Government in carrying out this policy have created the suspicion that this policy has no moral basis. You see, Sir, they have shown no inclination to embark either on the economic sacrifices involved in their policy or to give their own people a fair warning of what those economic sacrifices may be just as they have failed to produce any moral basis at all for those policies, in so far as we know them, in respect of the Cape Coloured people and the Asiatic community.</p>

<p>Let us adhere to the economic sacrifices for the moment. Let us accept that the development of the reserves and of border industries in artificial circumstances, not consistent with the ordinary accepted principles for the decentralization of industry, must lead to the slowing down of the development of the rest of the economy and the slowing down in the growth of the real living standards of the whole of the population in the Republic. In all conscience, Sir, the sort of growth under <span class="col_4439-4440" refersTo="page_0794"/>this Government of the real income of the population has been poor enough. The figures I have seen seem to indicate that while they were 3.2 per cent in 1953 they were flattening out to round about 1.5 per cent in 1960, showing a jump with the last Budget&#x2014; whether that will be maintained is, of course, another matter. The rate of growth has been the slowest over the last ten years virtually since 1925.</p>

<p>How many hon. members opposite have told their people that once their policy gets under way progress and increasing the real living standards of the people are going to be even slower than at the present time? How many of them have told their people what the enormous cost is going to be of establishing border industries? [Interjections.] You hear the remarks, Sir. Of course, they have not told their people.</p>

<p>The hon. member says I must try to talk sense. Has he told his people? He lacks the courage to tell them. Yet almost every economist of repute in South Africa has said: &#x201C;If you are going to spend money on border industries and on the development of the reserves, if you are going to use capital that could be used for developing established industries in other areas, you are going to decrease the rate of growth of your economy and the real income of your population.&#x201D; Oh no, they are not going to tell their people that, Sir; they pretend that they do not believe it. How many of them have told their people that they are lagging beind in the programme they have set themselves in 1955 when they accepted the Tomlinson Report and that if they want to catch up they will have to make even bigger sacrifices than they have been making up to the present time? They hoped that in 50 years&#x2019; time from 1955 they would have an equal number of Whites and Blacks outside of the reserves. What indication has there been up to now that there is any development in that direction? How can the world regard this policy as having any moral basis at all while the progress is as slow as it is at the present time? Do you wonder that, in many cases, they doubt the sincerity of those who have set themselves the task of carrying out the policy?

<p>Professor Tomlinson recommended seven years ago that it would be necessary to find employment for 30,000 Natives a year in border industries in order to save the soil in the reserves and in order to place us in a position to rehabilitate that soil and take the necessary number of people off the land. The Government accepted that policy in principle. What has happened seven years later? Have they found work in border industries for 210,000 Natives? No, Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that in the whole of that seven-year period they have found employment in border industries for one-third of one year&#x2019;s quota. I do not believe there have been 10,000 new jobs in border industries since 1955, despite the acceptance of this policy. But the Government still pins its faith on border industries; it still believes that that can succeed. We all know that practically the whole of Natal consists of areas that are suitable for border industries, that the whole of the King William&#x2019;s Town-Queenstown complex is an area for border industries. But in spite of the incentives given and the promises made, the whole policy has failed to gather momentum. Sir, what is going to happen in that respect? The Government tells us that they are about to start a new period of vast economic expansion. R2,000,000,000 is going to be spent in the next five years on public projects alone, on things like Escom, Sasol, Iscor, like the Orange River scheme, but only R 114,000,000 under the five-year scheme for the development of the reserves. Will any one of those schemes, except the scheme to do with the reserves, contribute in any way to the unscrambling of the egg in South Africa of changing us from a multi-racial state to an apartheid state? Every single one of them will lead to more integration, greater growth of industry inside the country and greater integration in the economic field. The Tomlinson Report signed by the present Minister of Bantu Administration made it perfectly clear that half-hearted measures would make no impression; and indeed they have made no impression, particularly on the outside world. How, Sir, can this Government persuade the outside world that this policy has got a moral content when that is its record over the period in which it has accepted that policy?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Krugersdorp is interjecting. Let him get up after I sit down and tell me what is the moral content of his Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of the Indians. Let him tell us what is the moral content of his Government&#x2019;s policy in respect of the Coloured people of South Africa. Where are we? There is no moral content, and hon. members opposite know it. Therefore they cannot argue with the outside world when the outside world says that there is no moral content. You would have thought that in view of the lack of success internationally of these policies, in view of the difficulties with which the hon. the Prime Minister has been faced, he would have been prepared to reconsider the situation. Sir, there has been no indication of any change, and I do not believe that the hon. Prime Minister can change. He has frightened these people into these policies and now he cannot alter them. Now he has got to go ahead stubbornly, <span class="col_4441-4442" refersTo="page_0795"/>and all he has got to try and do is to shout out: &#x201C;What is your policy?&#x201D; because he is afraid to discuss his own. I believe the hon. gentleman is losing his grip and he is losing it no more effectively than in the field of the economic affairs of this Government and the effect of the Government&#x2019;s policies upon the economic growth of South Africa. Let me tell gentlemen opposite that those policies are affecting the economic situation. We were always told of the wonderful percentage of employment in South Africa; we were told that there were virtually no unemployed at all. Of course they did not tell us that they do not register the African unemployed, the Bantu unemployed. Now we hear from the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) and his commission that there must be nearly 500,000 unemployed Bantu in the country, and that is borne out by the chairman of the Wage Board. Sir, that is a very high percentage when regard is had to the population of the Republic. And they are faced with bottlenecks in trying to deal with that problem because of the lack of overseas risk capital and because of the lack of trained technical and skilled workers in South Africa. I believe that they have got so far behind that they cannot catch up. I believe that they are unable to catch up because they have neglected the matter for so long. I think we are entitled to ask what the hon. Prime Minister is going to do about this subject, just as we are entitled to ask what he is going to do about the agricultural position in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, we have seen a change of emphasis. Whereas in the past it was the policy of all Governments to try and keep our people on the land, we now hear of the appointment of a Cabinet committee which is going to do away with uneconomic units. Nowhere is an &#x201C;uneconomic unit&#x201D; defined. But this is a clear departure from the policies of the past. In other countries where this is done, it is part of the socio-economic development, part of a big scheme to place people in industry, to see that they have a proper income. Here the thing is running ragged already. We do not know where we are. We have seen the great hardships the farming community went through last year. We have seen the Minister prostituting the Marketing Act because instead of sticking to the old basis of price fixation, they have introduced the new element of supply and demand. In the past it was &#x201C;cost of production plus a reasonable reward for the producer&#x201D;, and we always hoped some regard for the risks of farming in South Africa. Now supply and demand is brought in as well and they cannot face up to the promises they made to the agricultural community of South Africa. I say in that regard also we must have a statement from the hon. the Prime Minister as to where he is going under his policy and what the future holds in store, what hope the farming community have of stability under a Government of this kind.</p>

<p>It seems the hon. gentleman is losing control. I think the trouble is that he has too many Ministers. I do not think they are all doing their jobs as efficiently as either he or I would like to see them do it. I think the time has come, Sir, for us to clamp down to see that there are changes in the interest of the country.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>If this speech had been made by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) we would all have said that it was an extremely irresponsible speech. Coming from the Leader of the Opposition it is not only an irresponsible speech, it is a shocking speech; it is a speech which deliberately undermines our reputation abroad, which deliberately undermines our internal security, which was calculated to give comfort to our enemies abroad and to give comfort to the people who are undermining our internal security. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to know what the moral basis of our policy is. Mr. Chairman, our policy is the only policy, apart from that of the Progressive Party and of the Liberal Party, which has a moral basis and if the world does not believe that it has a moral basis, then it is only because of the untruths and the distortions which hon. members on the other side have been broadcasting to the outside world. They are the people who, when the Transkei policy is discussed, tell the people of this country that that policy amounts to the granting of complete independence to the people in the Transkei; but then the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) goes along and tells the outside world that that policy is the greatest piece of bluff, that our intention is simply to give the Transkei something less than municipal rights. And then these are the people who talk about a moral basis! Mr. Chairman, their morality is such that they are afraid even to discuss their policy. They are afraid to answer any question in connection with their policy. What moral basis is there for the policy of the Leader of the Opposition? What moral basis is there for his whole attitude in respect of the main problems of South Africa at the moment? There is as much morality in it as there is in the attitude of a vulture. It amounts to nothing but preying on the problems of South Africa. And then he wants to know what moral basis there is for our policy! Does he deny that his policy is based on blatant colour discrimination? And the hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows just as well as I do that the only policy which the world to-day regards as morally justified is a policy which does away entirely with colour discrimination. And I say that the policy of this Government is the only policy which can possibly do away with colour discrimination in South Africa without resulting in reckless discrimination against the White man in South Africa. That is the difficulty that we have with hon. members opposite. We are faced here with an almost superhuman problem for which we must find a solution, a problem which the world refuses to understand because the world does not believe in any form of colour discrimination, but the United Party, while suggesting <span class="col_4443-4444" refersTo="page_0796"/>to the world that their policy is one which has a moral basis, proclaim in this country that their policy is one which is based on blatant colour discrimination. Sir, this country has never seen a greater exhibition of political immorality. Our trouble is inspired by members on the other side. The difficult position in which we find ourselves is being encouraged, and I say that 90 per cent of the misunderstanding that exists abroad is caused by the United Party. Of course we make mistakes; of course there are certain things with which the world does not agree and with which the word is entitled to disagree, just as there are certain things in America and England and France with which no decent Christian can agree, because we are living in an imperfect world. But I say that 90 per cent of the hatred in the world against South Africa is inspired by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), by the English-language Press, and also by the Leader of the Opposition, who represents the true state of affairs in South Africa to the outside world in the most reckless fashion. I say that in all seriousness. I recently quoted the untruths, the deliberate untruths about the position in South Africa, which the hon. member for Wynberg proclaimed to the outside world when he said that every Black man in South Africa was regarded by the present Government as an untouchable. Does he deny that he said it? And he knew when he said it that it was not the truth. When he told the outside world that every Black man was regarded as an untouchable and that Black men were being kicked out of our universities simply on the ground of their colour, he knew that that was not the truth.</p>

<p>If he does not know that that is an untruth, then it is because of sheer stupidity. Furthermore, I say that it is the friends of those people who give the world a distorted picture of conditions in South Africa. Take a newspaper like the <i>Sunday Express</i> and its comments on the film &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;. Harry Oppenheimer and their friends pretend to condemn that film, but I shall show in a moment that the Leader of the Opposition himself tells the outside world things which are just as bad as the things which are said in the film &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;. And what does the <i>Sunday Express</i> say about that film? I refer to an article by Delius&#x2014;not that one should take any notice of him, but the English-language Press regards him as a hero, as a very shrewd political observer. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The real reason it seems to me for the hysterical propaganda campaign by the Government and the S.A.B.C. against the film is not its inaccuracies but its general truth.</block>

<p>That is what their friends tell the world, that that film is the truth. He goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In general the film was a remarkably accurate reflection of both the atmosphere and the situation in South Africa.</block>

<p>I challenge any hon. member on the other side and I challenge the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if he has any courage at all, to stand up and to condemn the <i>Sunday Express!</i> And then he is the man who talks about &#x201C;moral content&#x201D;!

Here in this Parliament we have the mouthpiece of the Government&#x2019;s critics; we have representatives of a powerful English-language Press which constantly criticizes the Government. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows in his heart of hearts that there is no country in the world where more criticism of the Government is allowed than in South Africa. Now he sits there laughing and then he wants us to take him seriously when he talks about &#x201C;moral content&#x201D;. He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to stop criticism and force obedience, but it did not remove the cause of discontent and the more it oppressed the people, the more violent their reaction became.</block>

<p>He tells the world that we oppress the Black people, that they are &#x201C;oppressed people&#x201D;. I ask him whether he is not ashamed of himself. Has he nothing better to say about South Africa? But he goes further; he does not condemn Poqo; he does not condemn the murder, the manslaughter and arson in South Africa. No, he tells the world that Poqo has a just cause. He tells the world that the motive behind this murder and manslaughter is not to overthrow the White Government; he does not say that this is the work of criminals; he says that this is the work of poor oppressed people who have no other course open to them.

<p>It is tragic that the Government had to appoint the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) as the keeper of its morality. That it should come to this&#x2014;that that hon. member is the keeper of the morality of a once great party is an indication of the level to which this Government has sunk. The hon. Leader of the Opposition has charged the Government in calm and moderate terms with maladministration of South Africa, leading to a state of affairs endangering the welfare and future of every citizen of the Republic of South Africa. Instead of a reply from the Government, we find the hon. member for Vereeniging being put in to try to put up a smokescreen to hide the real facts, an attempt to draw the attention of this House and South Africa away from the serious charges made by the Leader of the Opposition. In his attempt to put up a smokescreen, in his attempt to draw attention away from the charges made by the Leader of the Opposition, we find the hon. member for Vereeniging stating that the Nationalist Party is the only party which eliminates discrimination from public life and public policy of South Africa. But that member made no attempt whatsoever to answer the challenge of the Leader of the Opposition to show the slightest moral content in the policy of the Government in relation to the Asiatic or Coloured groups of the population! It was a clear specific charge made by the Leader of the Opposition and that hon. member has the nerve to stand up and claim that their party abolishes discrimination! I want to ask the hon.

<p>That is exactly what I say. Now I am asking the hon. the Prime Minister to either repudiate the hon. member for Vereeniging or to state to South Africa that the policy of the Nationalist Party can or will eliminate discrimination based on colour in South Africa. The United Party has made no bones about its policy. We want to know what the Prime Minister&#x2019;s view is. The United Party has said that where discrimination is necessary for the sake of orderly government in South Africa or where it is necessary for the protection of backward peoples, it must be applied. We want to know if the hon. the Prime Minister will be as honest and state that he will in his policies abolish all discrimination against the non-Whites of South Africa. We are entitled to ask that either he should repudiate the hon. member for Vereeniging, or that he should substantiate that statement so that South Africa knows where it stands. Either he must say that the member for Vereeniging was talking rot and nonsense, or he must say &#x201C;We, and I as Prime Minister, state that the Nationalist Party will not discriminate on the basis of colour in the Republic of South Africa in the area where it is governed by this Government&#x201D;. It is a simple issue. Either the hon. member for Vereeniging is right, or the hon. Prime Minister must repudiate him. It is no use trying to throw the ball back and evade the attack which we are making from this side of the House on the policies of the Prime Minister and the Government which he leads. We have made charges and we demand an answer from the Government, not this sort of answer by the so-called keeper of the morals of the Nationalist Party, the keeper of their morality!</p>

<p><span class="col_4447-4448" refersTo="page_0798"/>I want to deal with one other aspect of the hon. member for Vereeniging&#x2019;s speech and that was his completely untrue statement&#x2014;and if he had a grain of intelligence he would know that it was untrue&#x2014;his untrue charge that the Leader of the Opposition and the United Party had not condemned Poqo. In speech after speech, from platform to platform, in this House and outside, the Leader of the Opposition and every member of this party have condemned Poqo and all it stands for in clear and unmistakable terms and that hon. member has the nerve to accuse this side of the House of supporting Poqo and of not condemning it. I say it is a disgrace that a member of an allegedly responsible Government should make a statement of that nature, that he should say to the 10,000,000 Bantu of South Africa that half of the White people of this country support murder, arson, attacks on Whites, and all the rest.

What did the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) say? &#x201C;South Africa&#x2019;s army is useless to the West.&#x201D; Sisulu and those people now read that that is the opinion expressed by Mr. Russell. I suppose that that sort of statement frightens them; that it discourages them from continuing with their devilish plans! No, it encourages them to continue because they now read in the <i>Argus</i> that the Leader of the Opposition has said that these are the reasons for the existence of the Poqo movement.

<p>Sir, on the farm we used to have a gramophone which carried on in the same way as the Leader of the Opposition. If he will give me a chance to do so, I shall read it out very slowly. He said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Government that ruled without the consent of the governed was for ever passing harsher legislation to close loopholes, to stop criticism and force obedience, but it did not remove the causes of the discontent, and the more it oppressed the people, the more violent their reaction became. This was the position in South Africa to-day and the reason for the growth of the Poqo movement.</block>

<p>[Interjections.] Let us analyse that statement. What is the &#x201C;harsher legislation to close loopholes&#x201D;? What does he mean by &#x201C;stopping criticism&#x201D;? The only criticism that we curb and that we do not allow in South Africa is criticism emanating from a communist.</p>

Or is the Leader of the Opposition advocating now that criticism emanating from communists should not be restricted? Is he advocating that Patrick Duncan should be allowed to say whatever he likes?

<p>It is becoming impossible to get a reasonable answer, in one voice, about any subject discussed in this House, from that side of the House. In every case we hear the two voices speaking to us, and the <span class="col_4451-4452" refersTo="page_0800"/>net result is, of course, that they say exactly nothing. I want to give one or two examples of that before I come to the subject I want to discuss. The Prime Minister was heard to say that there was peace and order in South Africa, and then he want on to say there is a crisis in South Africa, and then he went on to say further that both statements are true. In the case of a film which I do not propose to discuss because it is not relevant to my remarks, in the case of &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;, we heard and saw the Minister of Lands saying to a world audience: You can say South Africa is a democracy, and you can say South Africa is not a democracy. I heard him saying that myself. In regard to the Bantustans. we heard the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) saying they will be part of a confederation.

<p>There you have it, Sir. But when it comes to discussing the composition of the South African people, it is the hon. member for Kempton Park who says &#x201C;the Coloured people are part of the South African nation, but we do not recognize them <i>in toto</i> If I had the time at my disposal, I could draw attention to hon. members, from the Prime Minister downwards, and to the kind of double-talk we listen to in this House year in and year out. No wonder that the outside world, which perhaps has misjudged us. has done so because this Government has succeeded in confusing them completely as to what our real purpose in South Africa is. And it is still less wonder that in South Africa itself there is doubt and uncertainty and misgiving. because you cannot keep on speaking with two voices without causing doubt, and the same applies to our relations with the outside world, which is the subject I wish to discuss.</p>

<p>My hon. Leader referred to the speech the hon. the Prime Minister made in Cape Town on Friday dealing with this question of our relations with the outside world, and he is reported as having said that there was concern about South Africa&#x2019;s apparent isolation. This apparently is a quotation from his speech&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I withdraw it, and say it is good, solid double-talk. Now, if our relations with the outside world are so good that we have many friends, as the Prime Minister told us on Friday, why it is that we are told that the whole world hates us? Why is that, if not to gain some political advantage, in order to put the fear of something or other into the people of South Africa, to make them stand solidly behind the Government, until they and the Government fall into the last ditch that the Government itself has dug? This talk about the outside world hating us must be taken with a pinch of salt. It is true that we are not unduly popular in the outside world, but it is equally true that if there were another Government here with another outlook, this hatred of which the hon. member for Vereeniging complains might readily change into something else.</p>

<p>Dealing first with the question of our relations with the people of this continent, it is obvious that we in South Africa sit between the rest of the Continent of Africa on the one hand and the sea on the other, and on this continent there are some 220,000,000 people and over 30 independent states. With which of those countries has this Government made any effort to enter into friendly relations? The argument is always advanced that we dare not become friendly with them because all they want of us is a policy of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; and the undermining of the White man. But the fact of the matter is that two months ago a groups of 17 students from the University of Stellenbosch travelled some distance through this continent, and in the supplement of the <i>Burger</i> of 16 February 1963, there is a story about these students going up as far as the Congo, and this is what they say, <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Maar Uhuru of te nie, byna orals is ons baie vriendelik ontvang &#x2026; Dwarsdeur die kokende hart van hierdie nuwe w&#x00EA;relddeel het ons gereis en byna oral is ons, 17 jong blanke Suid-Afrikaners, vriendelik ontvang en goed behandel deur Swart sowel as Wit <span class="col_4453-4454" refersTo="page_0801"/>&#x2026; In die lokasie waar ons oornag het was aimai baie vriendelik en hulpvaardig.</block>

<p>I want to make the simple point that this Government has made up its mind that there must be this situation of the South African people at the foot of this continent being in isolation&#x2014;not in splendid isolation, as the hon. the Minister of Defence knows, but in isolation&#x2014;and purely in order to maintain itself in power as the result of the fear which it instils into the hearts of the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>And going beyond this continent I had occasion to ask the Prime Minister a question in regard to the friendship which he said existed between this country and the outside world, and I put the same question to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who gave me a rather evasive answer. I wanted to know whether his Department during the period 1948 to 1962 issued any invitations to Heads of State or the Prime Ministers of foreign countries to visit South Africa, and if so, how many were accepted, etc., and he said that all visits of this nature were announced in the Press at the time but in the circumstances it is not considered necessary for his Department to consult the relevant records from 1948 onwards. I want to say that any South African does not have to investigate any departmental records in order to search for evidence of that friendship between this country and other countries in terms of visits paid by Heads of State, because we know that there has been practically no contact of that kind whatsoever. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I had thought that the discussion of the Vote of the Prime Minister should afford the opportunity to both sides of the House to set their standpoints one against the other in a calm, dignified, and as far as possible, a logical manner. Unfortunately the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not initiate that sort of debate. He took the opportunity of repeating his various points of attack in a more or less stereotyped manner. I shall be compelled to reply to the various points he raised and to analyse them, instead of, to my regret, having to deal only with the important points of policy, so as to be able to contrast them.</p>

<p>Before dealing with the arguments of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, I just want to reply to one point which, in the midst of the noise made by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), was put to me as a challenge. It is something in regard to which I already adopted a very clear standpoint years ago, but it is quite clear to me that the way in which he raised it now was intended for petty political gain. He alleged that the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) had adopted the standpoint that the policy of separate development could lead to the disappearance of the strife and quarrels caused by discrimination, and could lead to the disappearance of discrimination itself. Then peculiarly enough, he stated that in so far as the United Party was concerned they stood for discrimination in various rexpects! It is clear that they say that to create the impression outside that that is a party which ought to enjoy the support of White South Africa because they want to discriminate against the Black man, but that the National Party does not deserve to be supported by White South Africa because it does not want to do that. Now I remember very clearly that the United Party right throughout its history since 1948 has posed as the strong and sincere protagonist of integration, meaning by integration the intermingling of Whites and Blacks in the Government and in the economy and even, within certain limits, in our social life. [Interjections.] Amongst other things, they want integration in the universities. Now, however, the attention of the public must be diverted from that by the statement that they stand for discrimination, as contrasted with this side of the House. It is obviously nothing but a political manoeuvre we have to deal with here. But supposing we tell the world outside that it is the policy of the United Party consciously and deliberately to apply discrimination, let us now ask ourselves what confidence the world can have in their morality when that is compared with what they said earlier? I should like to hear from the Leader of the Opposition whether he supports it if his party lays down as the basis of its policy that it is in favour of discrimination. I know he spoke about White leadership for the foreseeable future, but he has always created the impression that he accepted that there would be an increasing amount of integration between White and non-White. Now I should like to know how he reconciles that with what was said by the hon. member for Durban (Point), viz. that they stand for discrimination. [Interjections.] That is the standpoint.of the United Party. Let me now state the standpoint of the National Party.</p>

<p>A few years ago I very clearly adopted this standpoint, that in South Africa we have inherited discrimination. That discrimination is still part of the situation we have to-day. It is something which is inevitable as long as White and non-White live together in a society like ours. If, however, one&#x2019;s object really is to remove discrimination, it can only be done along the road of apartheid, because the eventual consequence of apartheid is complete separation. In the first place it will be complete separation in the political sphere, and if that separation is complete, surely there can no longer be any question of discrimination, and if there is complete political apartheid each one exercises his full political rights separately. If in the economic sphere this separation becomes complete, no points of friction will remain, and therefore that type of discrimination will also disappear. I gave the analogy of the position between nations. I said that we should take our own case, namely the position of South Africa in the international sphere. There we cannot discriminate against India or China. In the international sphere we are all separate states <span class="col_4455-4456" refersTo="page_0802"/>which have contact with each other on an equal footing. In the international sphere the non-White nations have as much right to their country as we have to ours, and therefore there is no discrimination. That is why I said&#x2014;and that is what the hon. member for Vereeniging said too&#x2014;that along the road of apartheid we find the only hope of getting away from discrimination. The more complete apartheid becomes, territorially as well, the more will discrimination vanish because one increasingly lands in a position similar to that between separate states. Therein lies morality, but there is no morality in saying, as the United Party now avers, that on the one hand they want integration whilst on the other hand they want to apply discrimination permanently. In spite of that, they want the world to think that they will oppress nobody, and that was in fact the theme of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition. The hon. member for Durban (Point) afforded us the opportunity to emphasize the basic difference between that party and this one. That party sits on as many chairs as possible, whilst this party follows a clear and straight course.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the argument of the Leader of the Opposition. He said that I tried to improve the difficult position in which South Africa finds itself <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the outside world by drastically changing our policy, but that South Africa, in spite of that, is now faced with a much more difficult state of affairs than ever before. He says that this is the result of the fact that the Government&#x2019;s policy is based on fear, and that the opportunity exists for making adaptations but that the Government is simply not able to do so. The changes I have introduced to combat this fear have not succeeded. The Bantu homeland policy was an attempt to escape from these difficulties we have <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the outside world, but it has not succeeded, according to the Leader of the Opposition. Now, it is not necessary for me to repeat all the counterarguments, because those hon. members will continue to make that type of allegation, however much we prove that they are wrong. For purposes of the record, however, I just want to repeat that the standpoint we adopt to-day in regard to the Bantu homeland policy, in respect of the Transkei and the other areas, is nothing else but part of the objectives we had right from the beginning. Various speakers from time to time have dealt with the various steps taken and have, <i>inter alia,</i> referred to a committee report of the National Party under the chairmanship of the Minister of Lands even before we came into power. Our course has been clear right throughout, and it was made clear that it would include the development of Bantu authorities into Bantu Parliaments in free Bantu homelands. That was always stated clearly, so clearly that the United Party used it continually to challenge us by saying: You say you want to do it, and if in fact you were to establish Bantu states in would be a moral action, but you do not really want to do so and never will do it.</p>

<p>Now that we have reached the stage in the development of Bantu self-government where we think that we can take a step forward, however, it is suddenly alleged that this is a drastic change of policy introduced by the present Prime Minister. If any of the political parties think that we will win the favour of the outside world by means of any amendments or adaptations, other than handing over South Africa to the Bantu, it is making a big mistake. The Nationalist Government will not be able to satisfy the Afro-Asian majority in UN, however much progress we make in the application of our policy, no matter how good our intentions are or how far it takes us along the road of Africa, i.e. that Black nations should govern themselves. They want one thing and one thing only, namely that in spite of all the injustice that might be done to the White inhabitants who have developed the country, the White Government of South Africa should be ousted and the Whites should eventually be forced to leave the country. That is the only thing that will satisfy them. We know very well that nothing which we can fairly offer them in terms of our principles will satisfy them. Nothing will pacify them. Therefore we should always act in accordance with our principles, and not try to seek outside support by abandoning our principles. Along that downhill road South Africa will then continue to slide even further. But at the same time nothing the United Party can offer in terms of its announced policy will lead to contentment or peace. If the United Party says: &#x201C;We are going to discriminate and we will ensure that the Whites remain the masters; we will allow a few Bantu (not White representatives of the Bantu, but Bantu) to sit in Parliament, as well as a few Coloureds and perhaps also a few Indians&#x201D;, although they have not actually said so yet, they should not imagine that this will pacify and satisfy everybody. I tested this proposition at the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Conference, namely when the question was put there: &#x201C;Will you not make one concession, namely to give the Coloureds the vote?&#x201D; Then I put the question: If we do that, will it put an end to all these quarrels: will it mean that South Africa&#x2019;s policy will never again be discussed at a Conference of Prime Ministers, and that you will never again interfere with the internal affairs of South Africa? To that the reply was: No. of course not, but it would be a splendid start &#x201C;and will give us hope&#x201D;. That is precisely what will happen to the United Party. Even if it were to make the greatest concessions, that would only intensify the demands of those people for more and more concessions from what they would regard as a weak and undecided Government. That is why it is so essential that South Africa should allow this Government to remain in power because, as far as we are concerned, every person in the world at least knows whether he is our friend or our foe, whether he supports us half-way, or supports us behind the scenes, or attacks us openly. Everybody knows precisely where we stand and what we are going to do, and <span class="col_4457-4458" refersTo="page_0803"/>the people of South Africa can be assured that along this way their continued existence will be assured. If we have to fight for our existence we will do so, but then at least the people will know that they have not been led by their leaders along a downhill road until we fall over the precipice and are destroyed for ever. Therefore my reply to that first charge is that I did not try to escape from a difficult position by introducing changes of policy. I admit in the first place that I, together with my party, have gone further along this already clearly demarcated road. We have taken a step further along that road, a step which we all expected that we would have to take one day. That is in the first place. In the second place, we did not do so in order to bring about a change in world opinion, because we have no illusions in regard to the ambitions of certain nations. However, I just want to add that in the minds of many people in Government positions and also influential bodies in the world the fact of our implementing the Transkei policy and the proof of the genuineness of our intention to progress step by step along the road which we always said we would follow <i>(inter alia,</i> along the road which I said in the South African Club at the time we would follow) has led to a realization of our sincerity and our honesty. Even Bantu leaders in Africa are prepared to say to-day that in so far as the British Government is concerned, nobody knows what it will do, but in so far as the South African Government is concerned they can always be sure that the Government knows where it stands. This is at least a testimonial of honesty, which is hardly a laughing matter but something to which value can be attached.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition went on to a second point. He said that the critical problem to-day is in regard to our internal safety. In that regard he accused me of inconsistency, namely that I had said on the one hand that there was a crisis and on the other hand that there was peace and order. But I repeat it.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, more peace and order than in most other countries. That puts it a little more in my favour than I myself would have put it, but I appreciate it because I want to argue objectively. I still say that is so, and I say that every man with common sense should realize it. Would you say that there was no peace and order in Britain because Canon Collins and a number of followers recently held a disorderly demonstration? Would one say that there was no peace and order because for the umpteenth time crowds in Trafalgar Square had to be subdued into orderliness by the police? Do we imagine that because in Scotland people marched in order to demonstrate against the Polaris missiles there is no peace and order in Britain? Do we say that in the United States, where various types of riots regularly take place, sometimes racial clashes of quite a serious nature, and where the police have to be called out, and where sometimes a whole division of soldiers has to go into action for a long time in a certain area, there is no peace and order? Of course nobody would be so foolish as to say that. Of course they are modern, orderly Western states, but at the same time the fact remains that from time to time one gets these disorderly incidents in those countries. What is more, can one say that Britain, and in fact the whole of Europe including Russia, or the United States, never have crises? They do not all experience the same crises with which we are faced; they have the crisis of a cold war between them. They are in fact passing through a very critical period, more serious probably and more comprehensive than ever before in the history of the world, crises of the first order, and spread right throughout the world. We are also concerned in this world crisis, but we have to face additional crises, namely the attitude adopted by UN towards us and South West Africa and in regard to our internal policy, as well as the attitude adopted by certain African states. In addition there is the derogatory manner in which all kinds of speakers, prominent figures and others, and newspapers all over the world, think that they are entitled to talk and to write in regard to our country and our policy, often with the object of deriving some advantage for their own country, in the cold war which exists in the world. That is a situation of crisis and we are involved in it and we all know it. We also know that it can lead to serious clashes unless we handle the matter wisely, and we are trying to handle it wisely. We also know that if eventually it develops into a fight for the existence of our country and our people, we shall have to fight for the survival of the White man, even though we do so with our backs to the wall. We know all that, but matters have not progressed to that stage yet. The Government is trying to avoid conflicts as far as possible. In that effort it is hampered by the actions of the Opposition, which give ammunition to the enemies of our country. Very often the most bitter attacks made on the Republic by people in the outside world consist of the type of argument evolved by people in this country who know the circumstances and who misrepresent the position and attack us merely for the sake of political gain in this country. Those are the troubles we have to face, and this position may surely be described as a crisis. But at the same time this position can be reconciled with the statement that there is peace and good order in the country. Of course I frankly admit&#x2014;I cannot do otherwise&#x2014;that recently we have had this unfortunate incident in Paarl and that there is a movement like Poqo. What, however, is the characteristic of an orderly country? It is that its police, the State, can immediately cope with developments of that nature, and the Government has dealt very successfully with these miscreants in South Africa. It is true that in these disorderly actions Whites and Indians and <span class="col_4459-4460" refersTo="page_0804"/>Coloureds were concerned as well as Bantu. That has been proved. The arrests show how efficient our police were, and that in whatever circles these inciters moved, the police held their finger on the pulse of these subversive elements and could control them. They could discover the White miscreants in whatever strata of society they moved, and they were able to arrest the Indians who tried to use dynamite. That redounds to the credit of our police and proves that peace and order are being maintained in South Africa. It shows why South Africa is still one of the most stable countries in the world, because the State is able to discover, even in advance, when these small groups seek to contravene the law.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to reproach the hon. Leader of the Opposition for something. It is that, whilst Poqo and all the other bodies which act in this way, consist only of small cells, small groups particularly of Bantu, it is not fair to intimate that the whole of the mass of the Bantu are disorderly. Surely that is not so. Because one or two Coloureds were concerned in these incidents, it is not right to say either that we could have had the Coloureds as a group on our side, but that we have lost their allegiance and their assistance against the Bantu. That emanates from the Leader of the Opposition, who so often says that they want racial peace. Here he is talking about enlisting the Coloureds and the Indians on his side against the Bantu, according to his own argument.</p>

In other words, he would have lost them, too. He would not have wanted to have on his side this small number of agitators and bomb-throwers; nor would we. We do not have them, and we do not want them. But that does not mean that for that reason the great mass of the Coloureds are against us and therefore are not on the side of Western civilization. What right has he to say that they are to-day against Western civilization; that they could have been on the side of Western civilization but are not there to-day? What right has he to say that? My contention is that the great mass of the Bantu are also in fact on the side of peace and good order despite what he said.</p>

<p>My second proposition is that the Coloureds on the whole are in fact on the side of peace and good order and of Western civilization, and are glad of all the steps the Government has taken to assist them increasingly to make progress along that road. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows very well what the policy is that we have stated for the Coloureds as a five-year or even as a ten-year policy, and he knows that we are making progress in that sphere and that the Coloureds realize and appreciate it. Of course their leaders will ask for more. Has an advisory body ever existed which has not asked for more privileges and benefits? Of course they will also ask for their development to be speeded up. Where has one ever seen people who are progressing in a certain direction and whose leaders, particularly if they have to be elected by those people, do not ask for more progress? That is always so; that is the position in every country. I say that the Coloureds stand on the side of peace and good order. The exceptional cases who agitate and do these wrongful things are the ones we would not have wanted as supporters, nor would he have wanted them. Nor would he have obtained their support through his policy, no more than we can gain their support through our policy.</p>

<p>But I also noticed that he spoke about the Indians, and I further noticed that in the statement of policy he published a little while ago there was not a single word of real interest in regard to the Indians. I wonder how, through his policy, he will gain the support of the Indians, because he said nothing positive about them. [Interjections.] Is that wrong? I frankly admit that I could only read summaries of his statement of policy during the recess. If he therefore alleges that in his statement of policy he in fact discussed plans in regard to the Indians, I leave it there. The Leader of the Opposition further said that we had promised that these organizations would be destroyed. Of course we stated that we would try to destroy these organizations one after another&#x2014;these organizations which threaten disorder&#x2014;but may I remind him that he made it very difficult for us to destroy such organizations. Just remember how we had to fight when we wanted to ban the A.N.C. We were accused of acting unjustly when we wanted to ban the A.N.C. In the end we had to arrive at a compromise that this legislation would be repeated year after year instead of banning them permanently immediately, as I still consider should have been done, and as I think will have to be done now. In regard to the P.A.C., we had the same position. We fully realize what may <span class="col_4461-4462" refersTo="page_0805"/>still be organized underground, but we will use all our powers as a well-ordered state to destroy these organizations. I know, too, and the Leader of the Opposition knows as well as I do, that in spite of that other organizations may still develop and that even new organizations may come into being which will try to commit the same sabotage. That happens in every state nowadays. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition need not pretend that it is only this Government which has to cope with such troubles. While I was Minister of Bantu Administration, for five years, the same accusations were already being made against us, and I instituted an investigation into the scope of the riots of various types, i.e. tribal fights, but also acts against White people and property and rebellion against the Government, during the last five years of the United Party r&#x00E9;gime and the first five years of the Nationalist Government regime. It then appeared that the scope of such riots, the number of persons killed, the number of injured, were greater in the last five years before 1948 than in the first five years after 1948! That is something which one sometimes forgets, but we have always had this type of disorderliness, whoever was in power. In a country like this with a large number of comparatively uncivilized, undeveloped people, some of whom are rebellious, and with political agitators, as we have already had since the 1920&#x2019;s, one must expect this sort of thing.</p>

<p>The hon. member then went further and said that the police did their work well but that one needed the assistance of the mass of the people concerned. The hon. member intimated that the police or the Government do not have this assistance. I say that we in fact do have it. I say that we have the support of the great majority of the Bantu because they are the first people affected when this sort of thing happens, because they are frightened and intimidated into joining these terrorists, against their will, and in some cases they are even murdered if they refuse to do so. Therefore they really want to be on the side of peace and good order. I think it is wrong of the Leader of the Opposition to help to sow panic by intimating that there are great dangers with which we cannot cope because we do not have the support of the mass of the people concerned. I think that is very wrong indeed because it directly plays into the hands of the communists who are at the back of all this, as we all know. It is the object of the communists to establish disorder and uncertainty. The communists do not attack a state or society openly by direct force of arms; they undermine the morale of the state and the self-confidence of the citizens. It is a psychological war. They want people to become panic stricken. Our task is to ensure that this does not happen. Instead of the Opposition helping to establish an atmosphere of confidence in the country, which it deserves to have, it plays directly into the hands of the communists by helping to spread unrest and uncertainty. I therefore unequivocally condemn it when, as happened recently in Roodepoort, Krugersdorp and Rustenburg, according to reports, people allowed themselves; to be frightened to such an extent by rumours that they started organizing themselves into separate groups with the object of protecting themselves. The police are prepared to give the public an opportunity to take part in its own protection, but under their control and with the right discipline so that the maintenance of peace and good order can be ensured in a proper way. In the course of his speech the hon. member referred to the recent incidents in King William&#x2019;s Town and East London. What really happened there? We know what happened and I do not know why the Leader of the Opposition referred with reproach to these two places. &#x0399;n King William&#x2019;s Town and East London there were certain attempted attacks during the week-end of 7 and 8 April. That was the time fixed by Leballo from Basutoland as the time when trouble should ensue everywhere. The police had their finger on the pulse of the situation to such an extent that they destroyed the cells everywhere, with the result that they were completely immobilized. Only in King William&#x2019;s Town did a number of persons gather near the police station, but the police were not caught unawares. When these people congregated near the police station, the police immediately took action. One was shot. The police immediately brought the situation under control. Most of the attackers were immediately arrested and those whom the police could not arrest then and there were arrested within a day or two. In the case of East London such a group also congregated near a wood in accordance with this so-called great plan (which was completely destroyed). The police simply arrested them there. Now is that something to be mentioned in Parliament as proof of the disorder which is supposed to&#x00B7; prevail in South Africa? In fact, here we have clear proof that the police were in control of the whole situation. I am surprised that anyone should try to exaggerate this &#x201C;danger&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I want to add that when the Leader of the Opposition goes further and intimates that there are reasons for the growth of a movement like Poqo, and finds those reasons in the fact that some of those people live in hostels?&#x2014;because he said that riots take place particularly in such places&#x2014;and says that the reason is that we do not give the Bantu property rights in the locations (not only the right to own a house but the right to own land),. then he is busy giving a justification for the growth of Poqo. Then he is trying to say that it is understandable why such an organization comes into being and grows. I think that is quite wrong because this is not an organization&#x2014;and I think the Snyman Report has already proved it in addition to what we can infer from newspaper reports&#x2014;which was born from grievances. It is simply a murderous gang which has other objectives and which is <span class="col_4463-4464" refersTo="page_0806"/>incited by leaders who are far away. It just made misuse of the fact that many people were gathered together there. What would have happened if the opposite policy had been followed in accordance with the aforementioned points? What will happen if the United Party is taken at its word and those people are all given the right to own land and houses and no restrictions are imposed on their movements and one relaxes or abolishes the identity book system, or if influx control is abolished partially or entirely? What will be the result if one eliminates that type of alleged grievance? Then still more of those dissatisfied Bantu will be able to congregate there, who can be incited to the same extent by the grievance that they canno obtain the franchise, because that is the type of thing which the leaders of the Poqo movement like Leballo teach these people to demand! That, which the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to give them either, is the demand in regard to which these troubles are incited. In spite of that, he wants to try to defend the existence or growth of an organization like Poqo. I think that is very irresponsible and deplorable.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition accused me of having said something nonsensical in a speech the other day, or else I was wrongly reported, he said, when I spoke about the 500,000 additional jobs which would have to be provided in the next 50 years in primary and particularly in secondary industries to comply with the demands of the increasing number of Bantu. I have often used this argument already, even in this House, and I thought that hon. members understood it. I will repeat my argument. Sociologists have determined in various countries, including Japan, and also in Western countries, that if a person is employed in secondary industry he is, on an average, the direct provider of the needs of five people, his wife and three children. There are some who have more children, but there are some workers, on the other hand, who are not married.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Is he included in the five?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. On an average, five people are provided for by the wages of one person; that is their direct maintenance, as a family. In other words, if 100,000 persons are employed, it means that they provide directly for 500,000 people (the man, his wife and children). If there are 500,000 workers it is therefore 2,500,000 people who will be provided for in that way. So far that is simple. After that the point is that in the areas where those people live and where they spend the money they earn&#x2014;not the place where they earn the money, but the place where they spend it&#x2014;there then develops, according to those sociologists, a large variety of tertiary activities, consisting of all the various industrial services, other services, educational facilities, church facilities, commercial facilities, arising from the machnery of local government, from the maintenance of roads, etc. etc. According to the sociologists, the jobs occupied in this way are always five times as many as are occupied in the basic activities. In other words, if there are 100,000 people directly employed in secondary industries, it means that in the tertiary activities five times as many people earn a living as the result of the continued circulation of the money and the various services that have to be rendered. It would then be 500,000, and every one of them also provides for an average family of five persons. In other words, in the tertiary activities which are built up on the earnings in primary and secondary industry, the number of workers and their dependants is multiplied by five.</p>

<p>No. The tertiary activities form the whole superstructure of this society which depends on the earnings of those who earn their money directly in the manufacturing processes. Surely that is very simple. [Interjections.] If hon. members do not believe it, let them make calculations and test it in their own society. How many of our people are engaged in secondary industries and in the primary activities, i.e. in agriculture, in the second case, and in industries on the other hand?</p>

<p>What one has to take into account is the number of men earning wages in industry on which their families live. And then one has to find out how many persons there are who earn their living in that way, and then how many are employed in all the other branches of activity, and then work out the ratio. I give the hon. member the assurance that what certain sociologists have worked out in many countries&#x2014;and he can check it&#x2014;is that there are five times as many workers in tertiary activities as there are in basic activities. I have adopted this scientific standpoint, and on that basis it means that if we can succeed during the course of the next 40 or 50 years in employing an additional 500,000 Bantu workers in secondary industry it will provide employment for four or five times as many in other occupations if they form their own communities which will require their own superstructure. Together with their dependants that will be 12,500,000 people.</p>

<p>I set out from the supposition that there are many people who already earn a living through existing jobs. I am talking about the position when there will be 500,000 additional new jobs in secondary industry. That means that 12,500,000 men, women and children will be cared for in their own community and in their own areas if these jobs are there or near by. That is my contention.</p>

<p>May I ask you something with reference to that?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Let me first conclude the argument. My contention is that where this possibility exists theoretically, it simply means that we must just succeed in having such industrial development during the next 50 years, and it will be based on the stage of industrial development we have already reached. Then I really expect no more development during the next 50 years than the development we have had during the past 50 years, when we started with no industries at all. In other words, I assume conservatively that there will be less increase in employment, relatively speaking, during the next 50 years than there has been in the previous 50 years. The hon. member may put his question now.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The Press Report stated that with the creation of 500,000 jobs during the next 50 years the Prime Minister would create a position where the total Native population would be in employment. I should just like the Prime Minister to explain to us what the difference is between the 12,500,000 and the 20,000,000 to 30,000,000 Bantu who will be there then.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The assumption is that in the year 2000 the Bantu population will number 19,500,000. I am talking more or less in terms of the position in the year 2000. We already have to support something like 9,000,000 at the present time. In other words, if an additional 12,500,000 can be taken care of by creating new avenues of employment for the breadwinners, then you will reach the position where there is full employment and where everybody will be cared for. That is my contention. I repeat that in making this analysis it is not just an estimate; it is based on inferences drawn from statistics which have been collected and broken down. I may say that on one occasion I asked Dr. van Eck whether such a calculation appeared to him to be correct. My question was: &#x201C;This is the information which has been furnished to me. Is there any factor which to your own knowledge refutes this argument?&#x201D; He informed me that as far as his knowledge went it appeared to be correct.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has also made the accusation against me that we have dawdled with the development of border industries. Surely that is not true. Let us analyse for a moment what has happened with the planning of border industries. As a Government we could have established many border industries if we had wished to do so. We all know perfectly well, however, that the policy of this country is to use and to encourage private initiative. It is only in respect of certain key industries that the Government intervenes directly. In other words, it was essential to do a certain amount of educative work so that not only the politicians would support this policy but also so as to obtain the co-operation of the entrepreneurs in private industry. Great resistance had to be overcome ten years ago when I first advanced this idea of border industries as the most likely way in which Whites could be persuaded to establish industries of their own in such a way that it could promote Bantu development in their areas&#x2014;industries which the Whites could create and build up and retain for themselves. The proposal was ridiculed by the Opposition&#x2014;and most of the industrialists are supporters of the United Party. All that opposition either had to be overcome through persuasive work or we had to face the choice of State intervention, in a socialistic way, in order to bring about the establishment of industries in border areas. We chose the course of persuasive work. I readily concede that such persuasive work is a lengthy process, as a result, amongst other things, of the continual agitation against it by the Opposition. In other words, this Opposition has proved a great stumbling-block in the way of South Africa&#x2019;s progress. The Opposition lack drive but they do have the power to apply the brake, particularly in these spheres. In the past few years, however, thanks to the efforts of certain committees appointed by the Government under the leadership of economists of repute, and also as a result of the establishment of my Economic Advisory Council, through which we have been able to bring home to the private sector an appreciation of what is really involved here, this scheme has made tremendous headway. This process of establishing industries is growing in various areas. Natal is one of the areas which is already benefiting by it and which will derive ever-increasing benefits from this very policy. I see that the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) looks askance at me; but I think the time will come when he will still thank me for the fact that Natal to-day has so many industries because of this policy of border development. Another area which will benefit greatly is undoubtedly the Eastern Province, which is also an area that is suitable for border industry development. I know that there are going to be difficulties. There are difficulties even in an area like East London, but East London has already derived great benefit from the establishment of the Lords textile factory, and it will certainly be grateful. I hope, that we did not listen to the United Party but that we went our own way. This will continue to be the position, and I have no doubt therefore that although the <span class="col_4467-4468" refersTo="page_0808"/>development of the border areas has been slow, it is now getting into its stride. It will be able to grow in such a way that if the average is taken, it will be found in the long run that the hope expressed by the Tomlinson Commission will not prove wrong. It must be remembered that a snowball starts from small beginnings and then gradually grows.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that I contended that the policy of separate development would only begin to show dividends in 1978. That is obviously a nonsensical statement. Dividends are not only reaped when the turning-point is reached in the curve as far as the growth of the Bantu population in the White areas is concerned. That is only one of the things that can be achieved through our policy. As far as the apartheid policy is concerned it is not only a question of when we are going to succeed in turning back to the reserves the influx of Bantu and in reducing the numbers of Bantu in the White area more and more. It was only in that connection that the date 1978 was mentioned. The curve of growth of the Bantu population within the White area would have risen much higher if the United Party had been in power. In other words, as far as that point is concerned dividends are already being obtained in the shape of a flattening of the curve; that curve is becoming flatter and flatter and will reach its turning-point in 1978 or sooner if we can expedite the process. That is simply the date by which it is estimated that we will reap the fruits of the policies that we are carrying out. Apart from that, it is by no means the only or the main result that can be regarded as one of the dividends of our policy. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition can take my word for it that as a result of the development of the apartheid policy and, amongst other things, as a result of this development in the Transkei, the Bantu are becoming better disposed towards the White man. Note well: I do not shrink back from anything at all; I do not retract what I have always said in connection with the Transkei and its potentialities and the implementation of our policy. And my party does not shrink back from it either because we know that that is in fact where our salvation lies. I can assure the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that the Bantu masses today are much more favourably disposed towards us than they were in the past. I say that with absolute certainty. We would have had an opportunity to bring an early end to this racial strife if we had only been left in peace. I must accept, however, that the events in the outside world and in the way in which the outside world has acted, particularly in parts of Africa, and the examples which have been set on our borders where Britain is taking whole territories out of the hands of the White man and placing them in the hands of the Black man, have had a certain amount of influence on the South African Bantu. In spite of this, however, the Bantu are becoming more favourably disposed towards the White man. I also firmly believe that if the Opposition had only been a little more responsible, if its leaders and members had not seen an opportunity of gaining votes by continually causing difficulties here for our policy, thus inspiring the Blacks to cause trouble, we would have reaped the fruits of our policy much sooner and to a much greater extent than we are doing to-day.</p>

<p>I want to deal now with another point which the Leader of the Opposition made here. He levelled a reproach against the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs by suggesting that the hon. the Minister had spoken without his book or had said something which he should not have said when he stated during the week-end and on other occasions that he had reason to believe that the position might become more difficult for us, that the scope of the cold war was expanding and that that meant trouble in the future. The Leader of the Opposition says that that is something which one ought not to say. That was the implication of his statement. I want to remind the Leader of the Opposition of the great respect which he, together with his whole party, has for Mr. Churchill. I want to remind him that one of the things for which Mr. Churchill was renowned was the realistic way in which he was prepared during the war openly to admit the hard times which lay ahead of England, but at the same time he also stated if they stood their ground and fought back with their backs to the wall, all their sacrifices and sorrows would be compensated for by victory. When the leader of Britain warns his nation and says. &#x201C;We face difficult times, but let us stand firm; let us fight with our backs to the wall and then we will achieve victory&#x201D;, then he is expressing a fine sentiment. But when Eric Louw or anybody else on our side encourages our people and at the same time warns them that difficult times lie ahead of South Africa, that pressure is being exerted from abroad, that we are being attacked by UNO. that those attacks are growing in intensity, then it is no longer a fine sentiment; then it is folly. When we tell our people to stand firm and, if necessary, to fight with their backs to the wall for their survival, then it is not a good thing. When we do it then it is not a good thing.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come to that. I am first dealing now with the basic morality of that attitude. I want everybody to understand perfectly clearly that when such warnings are issued and the Leader of the Opposition and his followers try to accuse the persons who issue those warnings of doing the wrong thing and try to belittle them, I must condemn that attitude. I think South Africa ought to be grateful for the fact that this Government is prepared to point out on the one hand what dangers lie ahead of us but is prepared on the other hand to send out a message of hope and courage. That is why I personally never hesitate to point out <span class="col_4469-4470" refersTo="page_0809"/>that there are dangers ahead of us and that those dangers may be very serious; that in a sense we are standing with our backs to the wall if we as a White race want to continue to govern South Africa and if we want to survive here. If we want to retain the prosperity that we have, instead of giving if away gradually like the United Party, then we are standing with our backs to the wall. In addition to that, however, we have faith&#x2014;I say so too&#x2014; that if the nation stands together and fights for its rights and for its survival, that we shall be. victorious because the forces which are mobilized against us neither have the morality nor the strength to be able to achieve victory in the long run.</p>

<p>I come now to the second question which the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asked in this connection. It was not even necessary for him to put that question; all he had to do was to look at what is blatantly taking place to-day. What is blatantly taking place is that UNO has now appointed a watchdog committee which is making more and more serious and acrimonious allegations, which is trying to elicit evidence, even from South Africa, even from Opposition circles, and which has gone so far as to say that it wonders whether it should not invite the United Party to come and give evidence. In other words, this is a body which has been established to interfere continually in South Africa&#x2019;s domestic policy. There are also other committees of UNO which are making vociferous attacks upon us. There is the secretary of the General Council at UNO who, although he is purely an official of a body of which we are a member and in which we also have a say, went to a meeting of that committee and arrogated the right to himself to take part in attacks on the policy of a member state in a way which in our opinion was improper. These are signs which are unmistakable. We find that at those meetings the representatives of some of the bigger states expressed the opinion that South Africa should make more concessions although they did not support us when we made a concession in receiving the Carpio Commission, a concession from which great benefits accrued to South Africa. After all, it was Mr. Yates of the United States who, amongst other things, asked for new concessions, and it was Mr. King of Great Britain who supported the U.S.A. in this request. Thus we find direct public statements which show which way the wind is blowing, and when the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs says that he has certain information then he is naturally aware of other facts over and above these perfectly clear signs that these attacks are being intensified, but these facts are sufficient to justify what he said in public. Furthermore, we have all read in the Press that Russia has stated that the time is past when ordinary steps should be taken; that the time has come when other methods will have to be used. We know that some of the African States are appealing to the bigger nations to go so far as to resort to violence against South Africa. We cannot pretend to be deaf and that we are not aware of this; why then should we be asked why this particular Minister said, &#x201C;I have reason to know?&#x201D; We all have reason to believe what the position is and that it constitutes a threat to us, but we all have reasons to believe too, if we want to pass a sound judgment, that if we stand together in South Africa and offer resistance, there is no reason why such an attack should be successful. South Africa is following a policy which offers decent opportunities for every section of the population. What has really been the desire of mankind throughout history and is still its desire? Every nation prefers to govern itself, even if it does not do it so well, rather than to be governed by the foreigner. That is our policy. We are prepared to allow every Bantu nation to govern itself but by the same token we want to govern ourselves. That is what Ghana wanted to do, and that is what every state in Africa desires to do. Nowhere do we find that it was the desire of any nation to hold the reins of government together with the foreigner; nowhere do we find that it was the desire to introduce multi-racialism. The more we stand together therefore to make the world realize that in fulfilling that fundamental political desire of the human being, in making it possible for each ethnic group to govern itself, we are following a course which is a highly moral one, the more we will succeed in avoiding trouble. If it is clear that we also stand together in the building up of our economic prosperity&#x2014;which fortunately is the case in South Africa&#x2014;then it will be realized more generally that this is a prosperous country which cannot lightly be attacked and, which, moreover, as a friend, is an asset to every powerful country, because it is the only country in Africa really that will be in a position to do something for Western civilization. If we can make the big Western nations realize of what value we are to Western civilization in the struggle against Communism and that we occupy one of the key positions, economically and geographically, if the U.S.A. and Britain will only realize that in us they have the strongest friend in Africa, it will be both to their advantage and to ours. Unlike others we do not vacillate between Communism and Western civilization. We do not try to obtain the support of the U.S.A. by ostensibly leaning over to the other side. The Republic of South Africa states its attitude quite candidly. Let the poliical paries in this country act jointly in this regard. All that we desire in return from Britain and the U.S.A. is the realization and the acceptance that we must be allowed to solve our internal problems ourselves and that we are trying to do so as Christians and that as far as our foreign relationships are concerned, they have in us a strong, a good friend who together with them can oppose Communism and help to save Western civilization. If we all stand together to bring home this realization then there is absolutely nothing that can undermine South Africa and our future.</p>

<p><span class="col_4471-4472" refersTo="page_0810"/>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that the morality of our views is not trusted. He also suggests that he does not believe that there is a moral basis for our attitude. I cannot understand how it is possible for him or any other person to believe that honestly because if there is anything which is moral it is the very thing which they find repugnant in our attitude, as I have just explained it, and that is our willingness to grant the right to every group of people to govern themselves. In our desire to do what is right, we go one step further, however. We say that we have seen what has happened in Africa and that we have learnt this lesson, that those states who wished to govern themselves and who were given the opportunity to do so only after some measure of assistance and education, succeeded in doing so after a fashion, but in those states where the metropolitan powers suddenly withdrew, they did not succeed and it led to chaos. We say that we do not want to hand over the reins of government over our fellowmen to a small clique to rule over the masses, even if to begin with those masses prefer it to a White government. We prefer to lead them step by step to the stage where they can take over the reins of government so that it will be possible for the broad masses to advance step by step. In other words, we want to ensure that they advance politically on democratic lines. Does the Western world regard it as moral to leave them to their own destinies, or, worse still, to hand over the reins of government in South Africa to Bantu who have not even proved yet that they are capable of governing themselves? Is it prepared to allow everything that the White man has built up and everything that countries like Britain and the United States have invested here and have built up here for themselves, to be lost? Is everything that such countries can get out of South Africa through harmonious international trade to be lost? Is it moral, if all this is sacrificed, to do an injustice to the White, Coloured, Indian and Bantu masses by handing over the government of the country to this small group of Bantu agitators, which is the only thing that can happen? Nobody would suggest that it is moral. I do not think that they believe that. On the other hand, is it moral to say, as the Opposition says: We are going to establish a form of government in which the White man will entrench himself for ever with the other groups dragged in as junior partners, in a way which we believe will not be permanent but which, as in other parts of Africa, may lead to the sacrifice of the White heritage? Are we to regard it as moral if a party says it will continue to discriminate, and will continue to dominate although it wants to form one nation in one fatherland with large majorities of Blacks? Or is it moral to say that one grants to the other man what one wants for oneself; that one grants him what was traditionally his area, and one grants oneself what was traditionally one&#x2019;s own area? Is it not moral to say that I grant him self-government over what his forefathers left to him, and I grant to my people self-government over what my forefathers left to us? Which of these two standpoints is the moral one? What is the moral and honest course to adopt in this regard? How is it possible that there are still people who cannot understand this?</p>

<p>Now I come to the reproach made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that we have lost our grip because we cannot say what our policy is and that we are simply asking them all the time what their policy is! If there is one thing which I am sure we have done throughout the years&#x2014;and perhaps more particularly I&#x2014;it has been to indicate in the greatest detail what our policy was. Not only did we say what we are going to do at the moment; we also said what we would do in the distant future. We did not only say what we would do in the near future, but we said how the implementation of this policy would develop. As against that, we get from the United Party (they who always ask what our policy is) dozens of different answers in regard to their colour policy&#x2014;never one definite reply; never one clear direction. When we get, as we did again recently, another so-called new statement of policy, which is only an old statement of policy in a somewhat different guise, we find that the Leader of the Opposition again remained so vague that even his own newspapers and the people who write letters in those newspapers say that they still cannot understand what he really wants. Nobody understands his policy, not even the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), although he pretends to understand it. Therefore I say to the Leader of the Opposition that for him to reproach me for having lost my grip because I have no policy, or have not expounded my policy, applies more to him and really ridicules him.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition referred to agriculture, and said that we should adopt a clear standpoint in regard to agriculture. Let me tell him this&#x2014;he can discuss the details under the Agricultural Vote&#x2014;that if ever there was a Government which consistently assisted the farmers in all their difficulties, it is this Government. Never has so much been done for the farmer from year to year and step by step as this Government has done. I should like to know what the Leader of the Opposition would have done for the farmers when they were suffering from these vagaries of nature. I am not even referring to the fact that he would have left the farmers to the mercy of a multi-racial Government which would have treated the Bantu farmer on an equal footing with the White farmer, and would have been compelled to do so, with all the trouble that would have caused for the White farmers. I say that he on his own could at least have done no more for the farmers than has been done by this Government. We have not finished dealing with this problem yet. Every time Nature creates a new situation&#x2014;I am now referring specifically to the Northern Transvaal where the recent drought has created a specific new situation&#x2014;the Government will not hesitate to ensure that <span class="col_4473-4474" refersTo="page_0811"/>the farmer will be able to remain on his farm, and if necessary begin anew. The Government will even do more than that. It will ensure that a man will not simply remain on his farm where his misery will just increase because it is not an economic unit, but it will take steps, <i>inter alia</i> the steps recently announced by the Minister of Lands, to consolidate those uneconomic farms into economic units so that the farmer can make a decent living there. The other farmers will also be given an opportunity under new irrigation schemes. In other words, we are not interested in the farmer&#x2019;s vote, but in his family and his progress. On the other hand, the United Party is more interested in the farmer&#x2019;s vote and tries to exploit their difficulties in troublous times, in the same way that in regard to that story about discrimination it was interested in White votes and not in the actual colour policy.</p>

<p>I regret that this debate had to be characterized by these attacks by the one side on the other. A positive analysis of our serious problems would have been more suitable. I want to say that if South Africa were to do what the Leader of the Opposition says it should do, namely to have a change of Government, it will be the greatest mistake it has ever made, because internal peace cannot be bought in that way and stability will not be obtained, nor will there be industrial progress. Everybody should realize that the United Party policy is the course followed in Nyasaland and in Northern Rhodesia, namely partnership, and the troubles Southern Rhodesia are now experiencing would also have been the troubles of South Africa. The United Party would not have been able to make peace with the outside world because it would have had to refuse the demands made, or else its Government would increasingly have slipped down the downhill road until South Africa eventually was no longer a White man&#x2019;s country. Therefore the appeal he made that South Africa should vote for his party and that there should be a change of government is one of the most futile appeals that could ever be made. It would be dangerous for South Africa to listen to that appeal.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has raised two questions which I do not propose to deal with. The first was his claim that it was the traditional policy of his party ultimately to develop independent Bantustans. I shall leave that to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) to deal with as he has dealt with it before.</p>

<p>The second matter which I do not propose to deal with&#x2014;quite frankly I must admit that I do not understand it&#x2014;was the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement in respect of the 500,000 jobs. All I can make of it is best expressed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Little fleas have smaller fleas upon their backs to bite&#x2019;m, And these smaller fleas have smaller fleas and so on <i>ad infinitum.</i></block>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister has seen fit to regret the turn the debate has taken. I too regret the turn the debate has taken but if he will put into the debate the sort of speeches that he did and make the sort of accusations which he did, he could have expected that this would happen. I have the report of the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 30 March of what I am supposed to have said at Pinelands. I also have the report, which I see is a summarized report,, which was read by the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). It is a pity that there were two reports and that he should have taken the worse one of the two. It is also a pity that he did not read the whole report. What I said was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;Many of the forces which have held the Nationalist Party together were beginning to disintegrate. South Africans have reached a time in their history where they should make a re-assessment,&#x201D; said Sir de Villiers Graaff when he opened the United Party f&#x00EA;te in Pinelands to-day. &#x201C;You are faced with whether you are going to support government by coercion or government by consent. Choosing the Nationalist Party meant government by coercion and creating a situation &#x2018; in which organizations like Poqo and other underground organizations will find a fertile seed-bed in which to germinate and get supported &#x2019;.&#x201D;</block>

<p>Here is what the hon. member read out&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Government that ruled without the consent of the governed was for ever passing harsher legislation to close loopholes, stop criticism and force obedience.</block>

<p>I do not believe I ever said that, but no matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; but it did not remove the causes of discontent and the more it oppressed the people, the more violent their reaction became.</block>

<p>No quotation at all; this is a summary&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This was the position in South Africa today and the reason for the growth of the Poqo movement.</block>

<p>And there the hon. gentleman stopped quoting. Why did he not read further?&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the growth of the Poqo movement among people who believed governing their lives to be harsh and unreasonable.</block>

<p>Sir, there is a vast difference between those two, because this movement I do not believe would have grown, no matter where it started and how it started, were it not for the policies of this Government and the sort of seed-beds which it has germinated for the growth not only of this movement but also for Communism in South Africa.</p>

I said secondly that there is a position in respect of the Coloureds and the Asiatics&#x2014;we warned the Government that if they wanted to retain their support, they should treat them differently from what they were doing. We have warned that there were the first signs of them making common <span class="col_4477-4478" refersTo="page_0813"/>cause with the Bantu population. I thank Providence for the fact that the vast mass of the Native population are a law-abiding population.

What other significance has it when the Leader of the Opposition says here that the Prime Minister and the Government are not taking any steps to remove the causes of sabotage and the causes of the acts of Poqo? What does he say are the causes? The causes, he says, are that this Government does not govern by consent but because this Government acts in a dictatorial manner.

I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Prime Minister, where the members now come and blame us for no longer enjoying the goodwill overseas that we enjoyed in the past, what is written overseas from here, and I am reading from the <i>Daily Mirror</i> of 12 April 1962, a newspaper that is published in Sydney, Australia&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Doomed to Life in Desert. Exiled Natives&#x2019; Horror.</block>

<p>Those are the headlines. Then it says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The little African boy Tlou Matlala was just 12 when White South African police called at his village school. The grim-faced White men bundled him from his classroom out to a waiting truck.</block>

<p>Now listen to this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Then he was whisked off&#x2014;for hundreds of miles&#x2014;into exile.</block>

<p>By Government decree little Tlou, not yet in his teens, was banished from his homeland. That happened in 1954. Now, eight years later, Tlou is still in exile. He is Case No. 6 in a horrifying document called &#x201C;The Banished People&#x201D; compiled by a Human Rights Welfare Committee of White, Brown and Black South Africans concerned with the plight of people the Government has doomed to live indefinitely in often semi-desert spots, which are South Africa&#x2019;s Siberia.</p>

<p>Then he continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It has traced 120 cases of banishment since Afrikaner Nationalism began running South Africa in 1948.</block>

<p>The Government of Dr. Verwoerd keeps tight-lipped about its method of dealing with those who have dared to stand against or criticized its &#x201C;White-man-boss&#x201D; law-making. The list of case histories sometimes has often pitifully scant information.</p>

<p>Beside some names there are such remarks as &#x201C;no further information &#x2026; may still be banished or &#x201C;disappeared from place of banishment about 1959&#x201D;.</p>

<p>He continues in this vein and then he paints a picture of how we in South Africa are sending people to Siberia in a much harsher manner than they do in Red Russia. Mr. Chairman, do you know who is the writer of this article? One Stanley Hurst. And now I wonder who Mr. Stanley Hurst is? And then I find that the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 21 October 1962 reports, with reference to the return of the immigrants to South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Why do they feel that South Africa, in spite of its complex racial problems, is the country for them and their children? Stanley Hurst, <i>Sunday Times</i> news editor, boarded a South African Airways plane yesterday.</block>

<p>To go and vilify South Africa further. Sir, when a newspaper such as the <i>Sunday Times</i> with a Stanley Hurst, writes such things about South Africa, it is a matter that concerns not only the Minister of Justice, for it is the worst form of treason against South Africa emanating here from South Africa, and that is the newspaper, the only newspaper, in which the Leader of the Opposition now publishes his new policy.</p>

<p>Yes, in the same way in which they defended Patrick Duncan. The hon. member for Green Point is here now (Maj. van der Byl). Let us read now what they are saying in Basutoland about Patrick Duncan. This now is someone in Basutoland who is writing about Patrick Duncan to his relatives here in South Africa&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And now, Patrick Duncan has arrived in the Territory as a political refugee. We have not heard yet whether he is going to be allowed to stay and we only hope that the Government types will send him back to the Republic as fast as they can.</block>

<p>Listen to what he says:</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Duncan adores our little Black brethren and his sole contacts since arriving in Basutoland have been Blacks. In February 1961, Mr. Duncan spent some weeks in Maseru; one month later we had the strikes. In September/October Mr. Duncan spent some time in Maseru; one month later we had those dreadful riots. It speaks for itself, does it not? From all accounts, Patrick Duncan is a publicity-seeking egoist and he is heartily disliked in Basutoland.</block>

<p>And then the hon. member for Green Point comes along and says that we should not regard this Angel Gabriel as a man who is sabotaging South Africa. He says we should not regard this man as virtually red. Thus they have defended Patrick Duncan and so they are defending Stanley Hurst of the <i>Sunday Times.</i> And then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says in Pinelands that the people must understand well that the Government does not rule by consent, and because it has not had permission from the Black voters and the Coloured voters, for that reason there is a Poqo movement and that is why there is sabotage.

<p>I am sorry the hon. the Prime Minister is again persisting to-day with a statement that has already been contradicted by his own Press, namely, that the idea of the Bantustan policy is the traditional policy of the National Party. We have already settled that matter in this House on a previous occasion, and in consequence of that a leader appeared in the <i>Burger</i> in which it said that if the complaint of the United Party had been that the policy of the National Party had not changed, it would have been a serious charge, but to say that the policy of the National Party has changed is a compliment to the National Party. It has changed to adapt itself to the times. I do not wish to repeat the quotations we have already made on a previous occasion, but I do think it is interesting when we look at the booklet I have here in my hand. I have here a booklet, &#x201C;Die Nasionale Party se Konstitusie&#x201D; (&#x201C; The Constitution of the National Party&#x201D;), published in the year 1960, after the hon. the Prime Minister had already assumed his high office, and on page 10 of the booklet under the heading &#x201C;Staatkundige Posisie en Toekoms&#x201D; (Constitutional Position and Future), the party states very clearly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The party bases itself on the unequivocal admission that South Africa is a sovereign independent State.</block>

<p>And then paragraph (6)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It undertakes to maintain this independence faithfully and to resist all interpretations, directions, acts or politics in conflict with it or violating it with all legitimate means, as well as to remove any anomaly hampering the fullest realization of this independence.</block>

<p>If one gives away parts of the country, and if one creates independent states, surely one is then derogating from one&#x2019;s sovereign independence. But I continue reading&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(9) The unitary basis of a united South Africa shall be maintained as laid down <span class="col_4481-4482" refersTo="page_0815"/>in the South Africa Act, and no power or right that could be exercised in conflict with that will be conferred upon any province.</li>

</ol>

<p>And if that is not enough, I read Clause 16 on page 14&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As a basic principle of the policy in respect of Natives and Coloureds &#x2026;</block>

<p>They are taken together&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; the recognition of both as a permanent part of the nation under the Christian guardianship of the European races is accepted.</block>

<p>If the first quotation has not convinced the hon. the Prime Minister as yet, I should like to ask him when Clause 16 of the Constitution of the National Party was changed after he became Prime Minister?</p>

<p>But we all know that the Prime Minister stated in this House&#x2014;I have the quotations before me&#x2014;that this policy is a policy which was not desired by the National Party. It was foisted upon the National Party by the circumstances that had developed and that had &#x201C;headed&#x201D; for us to use the words of the hon. the Prime Minister. As my hon. Leader has said, it was an attempt by the National Party to try to mitigate the criticism, the condemnation of the world outside. The hon. the Prime Minister himself admitted it when he announced it. But not one of us to-day will try to show that the change of policy has succeeded in bringing about that better situation. In that respect it was a total and complete failure. Since this policy was announced, we have lost the support of great Western powers at UN such as Great Britain, the United States and France who stood by us in the past and tried to mitigate the position in the interests of South Africa. They are no longer on our side.</p>

<p>Even Portugal could not support apartheid. And that was after the announcement of the policy, after the Prime Minister had stated that he was not keen to have this process of fragmentation, as he called it. He did not want it, but he said he had to do it because of the circumstances that were building up against South Africa. It has failed. Why then should the people of South Africa be asked to support a Government still further in regard to a policy that has failed in one of its main objectives, and which is landing our country in greater difficulties and dangers and uncertainties from day to day, a policy that forces the hon. the Minister of Justice to state in the Press that he will come along time and again for greater and greater powers? What a Government! When will the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Justice be able to say to the nation: We now have sufficient powers; we are now going to put a stop to these things. He cannot. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has put it so clearly that the causes of our country&#x2019;s difficulties must be sought in the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister relied upon theory in his apology to-day, in his attempt to justify his policy. That to me is the most tragic aspect of Government policy to-day: It denies reality; it denies the facts, and it relies completely on a theory of racial separation in all spheres which does not exist in reality, and which really cannot be achieved, certainly not during the life-time of any member sitting in this House now. Why should we try to combat an existing problem, present difficulties existing around us, with something that exists purely theoretically in the imagination of the Prime Minister and one or two members of the Cabinet? I should like to mention two examples of how this theory of the future is full of contradictions and full of new dangers. I hear the Government proposes to get rid of Alexandra Township in Johannesburg. There is something to be said for that, at that. But we also hear that the Government also proposes to build, on the site upon which Alexandra Township stands to-day, no less than eight hostels for single Natives, male and female, and every hostel will accommodate 2,500 people, single, unattached Natives.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I wish it were funny, but it is one of the most dangerous and most tragic proposals that has ever been made in South Africa. It is one of the few places in which there are conditions of misery and slum conditions prevailing that will have to be cleaned up. To go along now and destroy the family life of the people there and to expect married men and married women to leave their wives and husbands and to live in hostels in their thousands, every hostel having 2,500 little rooms, and to live there, deprived of the elementary rights of any human being, the right to a family, the right to a domestic life, the right of the husband, wife and children to be together, and to expect that that will bring about peace, is one of the most dangerous ideas there could be. What has to happen there? What are we going to do with the prostitution, what are we going to do with the illegitimate children, what are we going to do with the unnatural practices that will arise under such circumstances? To deprive tens of thousands of people of the right to which human beings are entitled, and to say that that is a policy that possibly may bring a solution to the racial problems in South Africa, is too ludicrous to be taken seriously. It is dangerous. But of what is that a symbol? <span class="col_4483-4484" refersTo="page_0816"/>It is a symbol of the unwillingness of the National Party to apply their policy consistently and to give it a moral basis, as my Leader has said. If one believes that partition is the answer, you have to carry it through. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has now made two submissions. The first is that in the constitution of the National Party we have stated that we shall defend the sovereignty of South Africa in every respect, and now that we are carrying out the Transkei policy, we are derogating from that sovereignty, he says. It is one of the most foolish arguments I have ever come across, for it would have amounted to the same thing that because Great Britain granted sovereignty to South Africa, because Great Britain has granted sovereignty to all her dominions, she has now abandoned her own sovereignty. The concept of sovereignty is not a quantitative concept; it is a qualitative concept. It is the substance of sovereignty that you are sovereign to manage your own affairs. The fact that you are granting sovereignty to another really lends force to your own sovereignty. It shows you can do so. It is not a quantitative conception, it is a qualitative conception&#x2014;the concept of the substance of sovereignty. To say that we have less sovereignty by granting self-government to the Transkei is an argument that does not hold water.</p>

<p>His second submission was that in Clause 16 of our Constitution we have said that we recognize the Coloureds and the Bantu as sections of the people of our country. That is true. We admit that, and the inhabitants of the Transkei are now a part of the people of the country, and the fact that we are granting them certain powers of government, will not make them any less a part of the people of this country. It is simply inconceivable that one can argue that way.</p>

<p>I wish to come to the third point made by him, on the hostels at Alexandra. The hon. member has stated that that township will be cleaned up and hostels will be erected for single Bantu. What right has the hon. member to assume that we shall break up families and will put women in one hostel and men in another? Where does he get that from? The married Bantu will be moved and accommodated at Diepkloof and other places. The single Bantu there who are working there at the present time, will be accommodated in those hostels. At the present time there are more than 50,000 Bantu in Alexandra, and there are all the evils he has referred to. These hostels will be as great a blessing to the Rand as Meadowlands has been. They also condemned Meadowlands in the same way they are now condemning this matter in anticipation, but this will not deter us from our duty.</p>

<p>I should like to raise another matter. I should like to focus attention on what is really happening overseas, something that must perturb each one of us. There is a process of conditioning of the public against South Africa, and not for purposes of a cold war. I cannot see it in any other light than that the people overseas, in America and Britain and elsewhere, are being conditioned against South Africa, that something more than merely a cold war should happen in South Africa. Where this conditioning is taking place, such as by that T.V. film &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;, I can come to only one conclusion and that is that those untruths have to condition the people overseas against South Africa for something more than merely a cold war. In the past we have seen such conditioning taking place in the form of propaganda, and that is what is still happening to-day, to find justification for destroying this small nation of South Africa. There are the opinions quoted by the Prime Minister, of Mr. Yates and Mr. King. We could mention many others. As recently as a few days ago certain judgments were expressed on South Africa by leading politicians overseas. This state of affairs should perturb all of us, and I am very pleased that the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs has drawn the attention of the public to the fact that we are experiencing a crisis and that we should know what we are in for, and that we should stand together. But now the tragic part of it is that the Opposition thinks that when it says things here, it is half the people of South Africa saying it, and I want to deny that. Half the S.A.P.&#x2019;s who voted for that Party are not supporters of Poqo as the Leader of the Opposition and his people in this House are. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>As that is the position overseas, I say it is such a tragic thing that the Opposition, as they have again done this afternoon, is strengthening the hands of Poqo. They should remember that it is not how they understand their words, but how Poqo and the P.A.C. understand their words. They do not understand in the sense stated by the Leader of the Opposition that &#x201C;it is understandable but we do not justify it&#x201D;. Those people regard it as justification for their conduct, and they are boasting that the attitude of the Opposition fortifies them. It is tragic that this should <span class="col_4485-4486" refersTo="page_0817"/>be so, and it is time the Leader of the Opposition should stop saying this kind of thing. It is a quarter to twelve as far as South Africa is concerned, and it is high time the Leader of the Opposition should act with a greater sense of responsibility, and that he should not us&#x00E9; expressions, as he did this afternoon, that are so ambiguous that he understands it in one sense but that Poqo understands it as justification for their conduct. If he is in earnest with his argument, is the action of the government of Basutoland against Leballo also attributable to this Government? If he is serious with his argument that our Government&#x2019;s policy is the cause of the growth of Poqo, is that also the reason why Southern Rhodesia has to take drastic measures against subversive organizations and activities?

<p>I was really surprised to hear the hon. the Prime Minister saying that the Leader of the Opposition has made himself guilty of sowing panic, and that we on this side are the people who are sowing panic. But was that speech of the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) not a splendid example of scaremongering? Did the hon. member not say that it is a quarter to twelve for us? Did we not hear over the week-end the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs, saying that the so-called cold war in which our country is involved will be extended to other more drastic directions? Is it the United Party that is sowing panic? The Minister of Finance told the voters in Worcester over the week-end they must not become panic-stricken. Is it not the hon. the Minister of Defence who told us a few years ago that we should be prepared to fight until the blood rose to the horses&#x2019; bits? Is it not the Minister of Indian Education who told us during the election in 1960 we should get a stronger Government so that we could be powerful against the Bantu of Africa who might want to attack us? Who is sowing panic all day long? We of the United Party say that if there is trouble, this Government should be silently engaged in carrying out its duty and subduing those elements. But what is happening to-day? The difficulties there are in the country, the subversive elements that are in existence&#x2014;the Government is exploiting the fear of the nation for political purposes. That is why this type of speech is being made, that it is quarter to twelve. They want to exploit the dangers facing South Africa for political purposes, and why should they then hang the Poqo tag round the neck of the United Party? It is because the Government is disappointed because the United Party is prepared to banish and to destroy that kind of organization. They are disappointed because my Leader has said that Poqo will find that the United Party is its greatest enemy. The Nationalist Party are so keen on telling the people that we are on the side of these subversive elements. But the Prime Minister also tells us that nothing will satisfy the Afro-Asians. He found that at the Commonwealth Conference, but not long afterwards he told us he was going to implement his Transkei policy, and what did we find? Even Bantu leaders are saying they know where they stand with the Government. By implication I have to assume that the Bantu leaders in South Africa, and not only here but in the rest of Africa, are satisfied with the policy of the Prime Minister.</p>

If that is the policy in respect of the Bantu, where are the territories for the Indians and the Coloureds in South Africa? How much longer must those people wait before discrimination in respect of them will disappear?

<p>The Prime Minister has said there will be equality and no discrimination between nations. Where are the 1,500,000 Coloureds going to be given the opportunity of being their own nation? We know they have an area in South Africa; but all of them are not living there. Can you have a different status for those people? In 1962 the Prime Minister told us that where foreign nations lived squeezed together in one state, it was an everlasting cancer until the whole body politic <span class="col_4487-4488" refersTo="page_0818"/>disintegrated. But in the year 2000 it will still be the same. With the 6,500,000 Bantu there will still be foreign nations in this country. So if the Prime Minister wishes to give effect to his own philosophy, he has to pursue a policy of removing all the Bantu from the White areas, and not only the 250,000 in the Western Province, but all of them in the rest of South Africa. [Interjection.] The hon. member for Ventersdorp says surely I know that is not their policy. Have I to take it then that the political philosophy of the Prime Minister, announced by him on 22 January last year, conflicts with the policy of the National Party? When one says that foreign nations living together can only lead to clashes, we must have a clash in the year 2000 when we shall still have 6,500,000 Natives in the White areas. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>First of all I should like just to reply to the statement of the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) in which he said that we have departed from our traditional policy. I do not wish to review the interim period of Advocate Strijdom and Dr. Malan, but I should like to quote some extracts from speeches of the late General Hertzog as the real founder of our policy of segregation, and I should like to test it by reference to the pronouncements and the statements of policy made by the present Prime Minister. I should like to start with what Senator Brookes wrote in his book on the policy of segregation of General Hertzog&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of segregation as expounded by those who have really studied it is the policy of partial, gradual and natural segregation, and it is segregation of the type which General Hertzog, for example, has been preaching for so many years&#x2014;for long a voice crying in the wilderness, but now able at last to initiate the long process of which the next generation will reap the benefit, to inaugurate the policy which it is to be hoped, will be associated by future historians with his name.</block>

<p>As early as 1927 General Hertzog made the following statement in the House of Assembly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Now I should like to touch upon something which has been to me. ever since the first day I concerned myself with politics, one of the most unpleasant things ever South African politicians were concerned with, and that is the dishonesty towards the Native and the Coloured person &#x2026;</block>

<p>And that is the same dishonesty the hon. member has developed here to-day, and to which the hon. the Minister has replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is nothing that has filled me with so much disgust as the dishonesty in all we do in respect of the Native. It will continue until such time as we are honest towards the Native and towards the Coloureds and tell him that we are prepared, and prove that we are prepared, to give him every possible opportunity and will also help him in every possible way to advance.</block>

<p>Underlying this was General Hertzog&#x2019;s statement of 1913, when he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Let us not take the whole Union for ourselves, but hand over a portion to the Natives. Let them develop themselves there in accordance with their own nature under the supervision of the Union Government. In the Native areas we shall as much as possible have to debar the White man from purchasing land or leasing it from the Natives. The same prohibition will also be imposed in the White man&#x2019;s areas.</block>

<p>In a subsequent statement in 1927, General Hertzog said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I desire not only that he should be his own law-giver in his own areas, but he should also handle his own administration. In White areas of course the situation will be the converse.</block>

<p>At Malmesbury in 1927, General Hertzog made a speech and he then said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Disparity in numbers, difference in national character, development and civilization, with the consequent difference in interests and needs, demand that for effective provision for the needs, and to look after their own interests diligently, each race will be dealt with as much as possible as a separate unit, enjoying separate care and possessing separate spheres of power with the requisite powers.</block>

<p>That is exactly what we are doing to-day, but I proceed. Now I should like to read what the historian, Preller, says about General Hertzog&#x2019;s policy, the basis of the policy upon which we are continuing to build to-day, and which is subject to further development. According to Preller, General Hertzog expressed the view at the National Convention already that the Cape Colony did not appreciate the dangers involved in the Native franchise, in the same way that a person playing beside a river sometimes does not see the wave that carries him away. And then Walton says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There would be constant pressure to lower the qualification standard and in the near future the Native voter would swamp the European. He could not see his way to agree to any way in that direction.</block>

<p>That is precisely what the United Party wants to-day. Then I should like to read a final quotation of what General Hertzog stated in 1921&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Native will never rest to obtain the vote. That is why segregation is the only way &#x2026;</block>

<p><span class="col_4489-4490" refersTo="page_0819"/>And not a race federation where you will introduce the Native in your authority&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Nobody can stop the Native from ultimately getting the vote. You cannot withhold political rights from a nation. Before the White man will permit himself to be squeezed out by a majority of votes, there will be trouble.</block>

<p>What guarantee has the Leader of the Opposition that in his race federation this fear of General Hertzog will not be realized, and that he who resorts to voluntary segregation will not be squeezed out by the pressure of the host of votes of the Native? Then General Hertzog says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Native must develop himself in his own area and the White man will not permit a Native to have the franchise in his area.</block>

<p>Now I ask whether there is any difference between what General Hertzog as the founder of our policy said, and what the hon. the Prime Minister is saying now? Is this Transkei development not a natural development of a natural process that was started and which must culminate in that which we aim at with the Transkei policy? Surely that is so. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout sits looking at me, but the night before last he said the exact opposite at Schweizer Reyneke. I continue reading from Brookes, and wish to conclude with this. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">General Hertzog has done South Africa a great service in compelling the electorate to face the tremendous issues of Native policy frankly and fully.</block>

<p>I want to say that South Africa will still owe the present Prime Minister a great debt of thanks in the future for having in the face of diabolical attacks from outside, which are due to misrepresentations, and which are not all interested in the Bantu vote, or in the weal and woe of the so-called urban Bantu, but an attack that is interested in the heart of the Republic, put to the world the policy of the National Party fully and frankly.

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The whole argument of the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) falls away completely on the one point which he failed to mention, namely, that while General Hertzog was in favour of it that the Bantu should be allowed to develop along their own lines to the greatest possible extent, it was fundamental to his policy that the Natives should continue to be represented in this Parliament and at one stage he was even prepared to allow the Bantu to be represented in the Senate by their own people. The followers of the hon. the Prime Minister regard him as a strong leader at the head of a strong Government. I do not intend arguing about that because I cannot really remember when we ever had a weak Prime Minister in the sense in which the present Prime Minister is referred to as a strong Prime Minister. As a matter of fact, in his biography General Smuts is described as &#x201C;Grey Steel the reputation of the present Prime Minister does not as yet extend beyond &#x201C;grey granite But what is true is this that our party political set-up and the intensity with which we differ politically is of such a nature that a Prime Minister, whoever he may be, as leader of the majority party is always in a strong position in South Africa and vested with very great powers. That by itself leads to-it that a Prime Minister, whoever he may be, is in the position where he has to carry a great deal of responsibility for whatever happens in and to the country; and my appeal to the hon. the Prime Minister is for once to use that strong position which he as Prime Minister holds to improve the relationship between the various population groups, and externally,, the relationship between South Africa and the Western countries. Or must we take it that the hon. the Prime Minister and his Government are powerless and do not know how to get South Africa out of the difficulties in which she finds herself to-day? What struck me in the speech of the hon. the Prime Minister, a speech which lasted for over an hour, was that you could summarize his entire plea in the following words: &#x201C;I am powerless; what can I do? It is the circumstances.&#x201D; I listened attentively and I waited for the hon. the-Prime Minister to make a suggestion to this House, to give hope for the future, to tell us that he could lift South Africa from the biggest morass in which we have ever landed in our whole history. Never before in our history has South Africa, both internally and externally, been in the morass in which she finds herself to-day. I hope, if I have an opportunity at a later stage, to be able to show in what a morass we are as far as our external relations are concerned but with a view to the speeches made by Government members let us study the internal position in which South Africa finds herself to-day objectively. After 15 years of apartheid and after a record programme of legislation not a single racial problem has been solved. If I am wrong let hon. members opposite get up and tell us which racial problem has been solved during these 15 years. As a matter of fact, the only thing that has happened and the only thing which the apartheid policy has done has been to create new problems for us internally and externally and to disturb the relationships between the various racial groups. There has been a considerable increase in the bitterness and hostility between the various racial groups. What kind of peace have we got in South Africa to-day? There is talk about peace but what kind of peace is it? Home guards are formed all over the country and people are called upon to learn how to arm themselves. Everywhere people have to resort to their own devices to ensure their <span class="col_4491-4492" refersTo="page_0820"/>safety and people everywhere are forming shooting clubs and pistol clubs. These things are discouraged in other countries because in other countries the State sees to the security and safety of the public. But here women are encouraged to form pistol and shooting clubs because the Government is in fact powerless to create a climate in South Africa which will ensure that the public feel safe. A year or two ago it was even suggested at a congress of the National Party in the Free State that all the school-going children of South Africa over the age of 12 should be trained how to handle firearms.</p>

<p>The Memel branch suggested that in September 1961. I understand that the suggestion was not accepted but what we do know is this that at a girls&#x2019; school in Port Elizabeth the girls are indeed being trained in the use of firearms. Even the wives of Cabinet Ministers have so little faith in the ability of their husband to ensure the safety of the public that they take part in the activities of shooting clubs. What is worse is this: Every time a leading member on that side makes a speech he tells the country&#x2014;not this side&#x2014;that we can expect the position to worsen. The hon. the Minister of Defence is the person who talks about &#x201C;fighting till the horses are up to their bits in blood&#x201D;. He is building up an army which will be even stronger than the one we had during the war. The hon. the Minister of Transport recently made a speech at De Wildt and what did he say? He said: &#x201C;We must prepare ourselves for armed attacks&#x201D;. It is members on that side who are talking about war; they are the people who are creating uncertainty. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is already talking as if we are fighting in the last ditches in South Africa. It is not difficult to realize what the effect of this type of speech must be on the world outside. Sir, can you think of a sadder comment on the position in which we find ourselves than that a form of Mau-Mau is now beginning to rear its head in South Africa and that it is growing while we know that the majority of the Native want peace? The tragedy is this: The greater the powers which the Government take and the more they curtail the processes of democracy, the more serious does the position become and the more serious is it going to get according to the leaders on that side. The fact of the matter is simply this that more and more people have in recent years lost respect for the law for the simple reason that they no longer regard the law in the hands of the Government as being just. That is why you find that the hon. the Minister of Justice held a meeting at Kroonstad where he said: &#x201C;The prison population has increased considerably during the past year and at the moment 67,000 people are retained in prisons every day in South Africa.&#x201D; Mr. Victor Verster, the Comissioner of Prisons said in a speech: &#x201C;Crime in South Africa is much worse than anything in Europe&#x201D;. In a country like Holland with 12,500,000 people 2,000 people are in prison every day; in Belgium with 15,000,000 people 3,000 people are in prison daily; in South Africa 6,000 Whites and a total of 67,000 people are in prison every day. The position in respect of the Natives is absolutely disturbing. According to figures given in this House, 3,500,000 Natives were convicted between 1951 and 1960 for contraventions of the pass laws alone. No wonder that we have the position which we do have to-day. According to the Chief of Police at Pietermaritzburg 101 persons out of every 1,000 persons in South Africa are prosecuted by the police for one or other reason. What else can you expect if you have laws in this country which create crimes, crimes which are not regarded as such in any other country in the world?</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister will, of course, blame everybody else but the Government and himself, but as long ago as 8 November 1960 the hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration made a statement to the country in which he said that he was going to appoint a committee to review all the laws and regulations in respect of the Bantu. These were his words: &#x201C;This is being done with a view to eliminating all irritating measures&#x201D;. I admit that their policy contains irritating measures but something worse follows. He said further: &#x201C;The elimination of all measures which cause unnecessary hardship to the Bantu&#x201D;. &#x201C;Hardship&#x201D; is a strong word; it means suffering.

They are better than in Southern Rhodesia, better than in Northern Rhodesia and better than in Nyasaland and Algeria. There many worse things happen than have taken place here, but all this hon. member can do is to foul his own nest. What surprises me is that race relations are in fact as good as they are in this country, and have remained so in spite of the mischiefmaking of hon. members opposite among the various races in spite of their incitement (opstokery) of the Bantu and the Coloured and the Indian against the White man.

<p>No. I did not say that. I want to come back to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the accusation he made against me when he alleged that I had mis-quoted him and had not read out the whole report of his speech. What I quoted from his speech was evidently reported in the early edition of that day&#x2019;s <i>Argus.</i> He has now handed me the later edition of the <i>Argus.</i> I did not read that; I cannot abide two editions of the same newspaper on the same day. But what is peculiar is that there is nothing in this second, lengthy report which is in conflict with what I said. But I found one interesting sentence in this long report, namely this: &#x201C;Government by coercion will put South Africa on the coalition course&#x201D;, precisely the same words used by Patrick Duncan in the film &#x201C;Sabotage in South Africa&#x201D;. I want the Leader of the Opposition to understand quite clearly what I am accusing him of. I am not accusing him and the United Party of siding with Poqo. I am not accusing them of justifying the actions of Poqo; I am in fact accusing them of something much more serious, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should now tell me if I say something which is not correct or which is not in accordance with what he said in Pinelands. In Pinelands he said that Poqo is growing because they have grievances. Is that true or not? In other words. Poqo&#x2019;s struggle is one for the removal of grievances; it is a struggle against oppression. What the United Party is therefore doing is to find moral justification for the existence of Poqo. They now give Poqo a moral basis for its existence. They tell the world that Poqo is in fact a freedom movement; that Poqo is in fact a movement to save the poor oppressed Bantu, who is being governed without his consent, from a Government which is oppressing him. They therefore give a moral basis for the whole Poqo movement. That is what I accuse them of, and that is the most serious accusation I can make against them, because the fact is that Poqo is not based on grievances. It does not grow from grievances. There is no moral justification for its existence. It is nothing but a murderous organization which kills people and which will do the most terrible things, not to remove grievances, not to have single quarters abolished, not to obtain property rights in the White area, but to get rid of the White Government in South Africa&#x2014;not only of this Government but of the possibility of having any White Government in South Africa. That is my charge against the Leader of the Opposition and against the United Party. Instead of telling the public what the hard facts of the matter are, viz. that Poqo is a political movement which does not mind committing murder and sabotage in order to chase the White man out of South Africa, they seek moral justification for the existence of Poqo. That is my quarrel with them, because those are the facts, as I shall prove in a moment. But they tell the world that Poqo is not a revolutionary organization which exists for one purpose only, namely to conquer the White man in South Africa. They tell the world that Poqo is a movement which has come into existence among the Bantu because they are being oppressed; that is the moral justification for its existence, and the members of Poqo are in fact not criminals but freedom fighters.</p>

<p>But let us look at the grievances mentioned by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) at a meeting, and which he repeated again to-day, namely that one of the reasons for the existence of Poqo is the matter of single quarters and that Poqo has its origin in the single quarters at Langa; in other words that the actions of Poqo are based on a well-founded grievance. Surely the hon. member for Yeoville knows South Africa better than that. There are 400,000 Bantu from the whole of Africa in single quarters in the compounds of the gold mines. The whole of the gold mining industry is based on single quarters for Bantu where they live for six to 18 months or longer, if they wish. Why did Poqo not originate there? Why is there no trouble there? Why are the Bantu in the compounds of the mines the most peaceful section of the whole of the Black population of South Africa? The United Party surely knows what the reason is. The simple reason is that the gold mines exercise strict control over their Bantu. They do not allow a single Bantu agitator in those single quarters.</p>

<p>And they are primitive tribal Natives.</p>

<speech by="#coetzee">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">B. COETZEE</person>:</from>

<p>What difference does that make? Is the growth of Poqo in the Transkei not based on primitive tribal Natives also? It only proves that this movement did not originate from grievances. No, this movement only grows where agitators are allowed. My quarrel with the United Party is that they say that these people are not agitators, that they are not communists, and they are not the people who want to upset the White Government by violence; no, it is a movement which arises from justified grievances. Their standpoint is this: Remove all those grievances and Poqo will disappear. What grievances do they want to remove? They do not want to have single quarters; they want to grant them property rights in the White areas; they want to give them representation in this House. But, Sir, Rhodesia has already done all those things and much more. In Rhodesia they do <span class="col_4495-4496" refersTo="page_0822"/>not have single quarters. They are given 15 Black representatives in the Southern Rhodesian Parliament. All social discrimination has been removed. They can enter White cafes and hotels and swim in the White swimming-baths. In Rhodesia they go infinitely further than the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to go. Has that put a stop to violence in Southern Rhodesia? Was the Southern Rhodesian Parliament not compelled recently to pass an Act making compulsory the imposition of the death penalty for the throwing of petrol bombs? Cannot the United Party see how wrong they are? That is why we say that by their attitude they lend strength to this organization, because they do not want to realize precisely what the object of this organization is, what is behind it, and that it has nothing at all to do with grievances. This is a struggle, as we have seen it in the rest of Africa, with just one exclusive object, and that struggle will not stop as long as we allow the agitators to do what they like. That struggle is to chase the White man out of the whole of Africa, out of Northern and Southern Rhodesia and out of the Republic of South Africa. It has nothing to do with grievances. My charge against the United Party is that they refuse to admit that that is the position. No, according to them it is a freedom struggle by the Bantu against the oppression of this Verwoerd Government; that is what is so shocking, whilst the whole history of Africa proves that it is not so. In Southern and Northern Rhodesia they obtained everything they demanded, but the violence against the Whites did not decrease in the least. I now want hon. members opposite to reply to this charge. As long as they tell the world that this violence is based on serious grievances, for so long do they fail to realize what the real problem is, and they therefore should not blame us if we say that they give moral support to those people and try to find a moral basis for this murderous organization.

<p>The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) goes on like an old gramophone record to try to create the impression that we on this side of the House are on the side of those people. Does the hon. member not understand what the position is in regard to an organization like Poqo? The millions of Bantu in South Africa surely are not all members of Poqo. We know that and admit it. According to the information available to us, it is an organization with a membership in South Africa of approximately 20,000, but what happens is this: You have an organization like this in a place like Mbekweni in Paarl or in Nyanga or in Langa, and those people are intimidating the peaceloving Bantu and exploiting all kinds of grievances even amongst the orderly Bantu in order to recruit members for Poqo. That is the position and that is all that the Leader of the Opposition tells the Government. It is an illegal organization and nobody approves of it, but if one wants to prevent such an organization from growing in South Africa, one must avoid the circumstances in which it can grow. How the hon. member for Vereeniging can say that we on this side are paving the way for that organization I simply cannot understand. I put this question to the hon. member for Vereeniging: It has been put to that side of the House before: Do they not think they are playing with fire if they create the impression amongst those people that a large number of the Whites in this country are in favour of the objects of Poqo? I now want to put this question to the hon. member for Vereeniging: If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asks the Prime Minister to remove the seedbed in which an organization like that can grow and the hon. member tries to create the impression that the greater majority of the White voters of South Africa are in favour of such an organization, who is doing more harm, the Leader of the Opposition or the hon. member for Vereeniging?</p>

<p>I want to revert to the matter I was dealing with when I spoke last, when I was pointing out to the hon. the Prime Minister that if he wants to abide by the philosophy underlying the policy he gave us in 1962, he will not only have to remove the Bantu from the Western Province but from all the White areas of South Africa, whereupon the hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) said: &#x201C;Surely you know that that is not the policy.&#x201D; But did we not have statements from prominent members opposite that the Bantu should in the course of time not only disappear here, and did the hon. member for Moorreesburg not tell us that the spirit prevailing in the south should also prevail in the north; in other words, that the Whites should increasingly do without the Bantu in the economic sphere? The hon. the Minister of Bantu Administration told us in 1959 already that the Bantu in our cities constitute a danger to the White man. Well, if in 1959 already the Bantu constituted a danger to us, and in view of the fact that to-day there are thousands more of them and that their numbers will still increase by thousands, is that danger not going to increase, and will we not reach the position where the Prime Minister will have to implement that philosophy of his? But what do we now learn from the Prime Minister? During the week-end he told the Afrikaanse Sakekamer in Cape Town that the Government would not allow what had been built up in the Western Cape to be ruined by the implementation of the policy of removing the Bantu in that area. The hon. the Prime Minister did not say that he would suspend that policy. He merely said that the removal of the Bantu from this area would not lead to economic stagnation. In other words, we can expect those Bantu to be replaced by somebody else. By whom? It is suggested that they will be replaced by Coloureds, but are there enough Coloureds in the Western Cape? It is suggested that the Bantu will be replaced by the 300,000 Coloureds in the Eastern Province on the other side of the Eiselen line. Is it possible to bring them to the Western Province? Who is going to take the place of those people on the eastern side of the Eiselen line? What is going to happen to a place like Port Elizabeth where approximately 60,000 Coloureds take part in our economic life? If the Government removes them from there and induces them to come to the Western Province, who will take their place in our industries? Surely not the Bantu who are being removed from here to the Eastern Province, because it is not the policy of this Government to take them from one urban area to another urban area. Those people will have to make a living in the border areas, in the industries on the borders of the reserves, or otherwise in the reserves themselves.</p>

<speech by="#greyling">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, whilst listening to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition to-day, I gathered the following from his speech, namely that he linked Poqo with the National Party as the result of the following: Firstly, the frustration amongst the urban Bantu. He accused the Government of breaking up families; the reckless removal of people; discriminatory measures and a whole series of pinpricks in our administration in respect of the Bantu. Secondly he said that the National Party was powerless to handle the position, and he based that on the unsuccessful raids and the amount of legislation we have to pass in this House from time to time in regard to the combating of subversive activities. He finds further justification in the fact that the increasing number of attacks and the sabotage and the isolated instances of terrorism are the result of it, and that we cannot handle the position. He further says that the Bantu and the Coloureds and the Indians are now starting to take part in this wave of sabotage. Then he says further that our policy is immoral and that hitherto we have received no dividends on our policy.</p>

<p>I think we must furnish the Leader of the Opposition with a reply in this regard. I want to start by making this first statement. The Leader of the Opposition again intimated to-day that he finds himself helpless in a maelstrom of indecision. He seeks for three things. Firstly he seeks a sound conservatism in his own policy, and this pressure within his own ranks is becoming increasingly stronger, just as it is becoming stronger right throughout the world and particularly in the Western world. That is why the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), in his search for a sound conservatism within their own ranks, made the statement that their party was based on discrimination. That is just one expression of their desire to find a sound conservatism within their own party, to comply with that steadily increasing pressure.</p>

<p>Then the Leader of the Opposition is looking for a second thing. He is seeking an anti-thesis against the Liberal Party, that false liberalism which is now linked up with a series of front organizations in South Africa and elsewhere in Africa. He also seeks a third thing. He is looking for localized measures to combat Poqo, this combination of liberalism and the so-called front organizations of which Poqo is one. He seeks these localized measures in concessions; he lays the blame on the hostels and on the rights which are denied to the urban Bantu. Sir, where the Leader of the Opposition is seeking for measures of salvation and for conservatism, for an antithesis, where he is seeking for localized measures to help him out of his trouble, I want to say this to the Leader of the Opposition; He will not find it in his race federation. Because we are not combatting Poqo as a South African Bantu movement or a movement amongst the Blacks; Poqo is not localized; Poqo is a front organization <span class="col_4499-4500" refersTo="page_0824"/>which adopts the same methods by which Communism throughout the world fights, particularly in Africa. When we fight Poqo we are in fact fighting an extension of Pan-Africanism which in Africa co-operates with Communism in so far as their methods are concerned, and which, just like the communists, have organized themselves in action fronts, the so-called front organizations of which Poqo is one. They are similar in their methods, although I do not want to allege that Communism and Pan-Africanism have the same objectives. I want to give a splendid example of how Communism and Pan-Africanism, of which Poqo is an outflow, run together for a certain distance. On the eve of the attack launched by Holden Roberto in Angola, a man who was trained in Moscow and financed by Moscow and who used the same slogans as the communists, he directed this appeal to the Blacks in Angola, He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Long live U.P.A&#x2026;.</block>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; Long live Khrushchev. Long live Angola. Prepare your arms. We have no fear. We are about to open fire. Russia will provide weapons. Lumumba will help us.</block>

<p>Russia, Communism. Now I say this, Mr. Chairman. In regard to communist methods, Pan-Africanism, of which Poqo forms part, and Communism are one and the same thing. I am not saying that Moscow looks at Africa with the intention that Africa should look after itself. I think Moscow looks at Africa with the intention that Africa should look to Moscow. But in essence Pan-Africanism is not nationalistic. Pan-Africanism, of which Poqo forms a part, is in essence imperialistic, but Pan-Africanism fights behind the cloak and makes use of the support of the so-called solidarity committee meetings which frequently, after every session, sends a message to the so-called freedom movements in Africa. They also make use of victimization, of violence and of terrorism. They fight under the cloak and in the form of political organizations or action fronts. That is what Poqo is in essence. Now the Leader of the Opposition tells us: You are the cause of Poqo; South Africa is a seedbed for Poqo. He says that on the basis of the fact that we have created certain grievances on the part of the Black man. He says that is the reason why Poqo is there. I want to tell the Leader of the Opposition that his view in regard to Poqo is quite wrong. No localized remedies will put a stop to any front organization or action front here. His search for a moral basis for a policy within the framework of a race federation is of no use. His search for a sound conservatism on the basis of his race federation will be equally useless. It will in fact&#x2014;and I want to emphasize it&#x2014;give an opening to this Black imperialism to comply with the battle-cry of Lumumba to kill the Whites. His race federation will facilitate that. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>No, the difference between the hon. member and myself is that he selects from a book such as this one by Pieter Lessing that which suits him and we remain objective in our judgment of the book and of the South African situation.</p>

<p>The point is that the hon. the Prime Minister must realize that his policies are assisting subversive organizations to ferment difficulty and trouble in South Africa. It is a fact, as I mentioned before to-day, that the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policies are policies for the future and not for to-day. In so far as it is <span class="col_4501-4502" refersTo="page_0825"/>a policy for the future the Government is not prepared to call upon the people to make real sacrifices to-day in order to achieve the policy in the future and that is aggravating the position for South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>No he does not. He speaks to the Afrikaanse Sakekamer here in the Western Province and he tells them not to worry. He wants to remove the Natives from the Western Province but he will not do so at the expense of the economy of the Western Province. The simple fact is that he cannot; there is not enough labour available. He cannot remove the Black labour from the Western Province except at the expense of the economy of this area. For that reason the Prime Minister shows that he lacks the courage to call upon the people to make those sacrifices to-day which are required to implement his policy for to-morrow.</p>

<p>The hostels to be built at Alexandra Township to house 20,000 single Natives is another monument to the lack of courage on the part of the Prime Minister and his Government. The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr.Fronean)&#x2014;I am sorry he is not here&#x2014;told us to-day that those hostels would be exclusively for unmarried Natives. I say with due respect that I do not believe that. The hon. member for Heilbron might believe it I do not doubt his integrity, but I am convinced that he is wrong. If I remember statements by and the attitude of the Government correctly, the purposes of those hostels is to bring migrant workers to the Witwatersrand to cater for the needs of the northern suburbs of Johannesburg. And in those hostels will live married men&#x2014;I am not sure whether married women will not live there&#x2014;who will not be allowed to bring their wives and their children with them when they come to work. The way to test what the hon. member for Heilbron has said is this: Will the Government undertake, through the Peri Urban Areas Board, that every man and woman in those single quarters who gets married will have the right to apply for a proper home in which they can produce and rear a family? If they do not give that undertaking then the hon. member for Heilbron was obviously under a misapprehension about the policy of his own Government. Our trouble is this, Sir: When we discuss the policies of the Prime Minister and the hon. member for Heilbron intervenes and makes a statement like that he confuses the issue. I shall be most glad if the Prime Minister or the Minister of Bantu Administration will get up and confirm that only unmarried men will be allowed to live in those hostels and that married women will be properly catered for in homes where they can bring up a family.</p>

<p>But that is a red herring which confuses the arguments which the Prime Minister should hear in the interests of our country. He should heed these arguments. Those hostels to be erected will stand there as eight vast monuments to the lack of courage on the part of the Government, the Government which wants apartheid and territorial separation, which wants separate political institutions and states, but which at the same time wants to use Native labour for the enrichment of the Republic of South Africa.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>After that speech, Mr. Chairman, I think I am entitled to another ten minutes. Of course they are not forced to come here, they are not forced to come here by any <i>vis major</i> on the part of the Government; they are forced to come here because they have to eat and live and their wives and children have to live. What is more we encourage them by our policies to come here. Why was the poll tax introduced in South Africa? Cecil Rhodes introduced it in the last century, to use his own words &#x201C;as a gentle stimulus to the Black people to come out of the reserves and to come and work in the White man&#x2019;s economy&#x201D;. Because unless they needed cash it was not necessary for them to come out; they could live in their cattle economy. But when you have to pay taxes in cash you have to work to find that cash. This Government does exactly the same. Is this Government prepared to encourage the Black people not to come and work here? Why does the Government not start in the Western Province? Why does the hon. the Prime Minister give assurances that he will not do that if it means dispensing with the labour of those people in this province? The hon. member for Vereeniging can argue as he likes but the simple fact remains that this Government&#x2019;s policy is one of words and promises for the future but lacking the necessary action because it has not got the courage to face the consequences of that policy.</p>

<p>Look at the sort of argument the Prime Minister now adduces in order to persuade the people that his policy has some practical meaning. He told the people to whom he spoke over the week-end that in 50 years&#x2019; time 500,000 jobs will have been created along the borders of the reserves and that that will mean that 12,500,000 will be able to live. What an astonishing statement, Sir. I can understand that each man employed in industry can support four others. I can understand with some difficulty that each one of those four will support another five in tertiary activities but it becomes almost impossible to understand that having accounted for tertiary activities to keep people in secondary activities served with the necessary services that those tertiary activities are now going to create another 10,000,000 &#x201C;fourth degree&#x201D; jobs. I can raise this function to the power of two and to the power of three but when I raise it to the power of four where does it end? If people engaged in tertiary activities can each create work for another five people engaged in fourth degree activities then the Prime Minister may as well <span class="col_4503-4504" refersTo="page_0826"/>say that those last five engaged in the fourth degree activities must create jobs for another five in a fifth set of activities. Where does it end? [Time limit.]</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just resumed his seat tried to show that the subversive elements in South Africa can be combated if we investigate the causes for their existence. His argument amounts to this, as his colleagues also repeatedly said, that the subversive elements in this country are the result of Government policy. Will he deny that? No, he cannot deny it. I give it as my opinion, Sir, that the greatest stimulus for subversive elements is their being depicted as heroes in the newspapers of the country. The easiest way of making heroes of them is when their names and the names of their subversive organizations and of their leaders are continuously used across the floor of this House. It is my opinion that these subversive elements are quite certain that excuses will consistently be made for them in this House. That is what we deplore. We ask the Opposition to be careful in their choice of words in this House. The words of the Opposition echo not only in every part of South Africa, but in every part of the Continent of Africa. Most of those subversive elements depend on the fact that they have strong protagonists in this House. That is their greatest encouragement. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) again made him-self guilty of that because he very subtly let them understand that their existence was justified as the result of Government policy. The Opposition ought to do their duty and say that they unreservedly condemn those subversive elements and organizations, but not a single member of the Opposition has got up here to say anything about Poqo without ascribing their existence to the policy of the Government.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says it is not true. I call you, Sir, and the whole of the Committee as witnesses. That was the crux of his attack to-night. I have the right to make that appeal to hon. members, because they think that as an Opposition they have the right, in spite of everything, to do anything and to think that they are justified in doing so because of the fact that they are the Opposition. There is such a thing as a responsible Opposition, but that is still absent in this House, even in these serious times.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville says that the Government lacks the courage to appeal to the people of South Africa to make the necessary sacrifices to implement the policy of the Government. I do not think that 10 per cent of the people in the country will agree with him when he says that this Government lacks courage. I think that if this Government has one attribute, it is that it has the courage not only to announce its policy but to implement it in one piece of legislation after another in spite of all opposition.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to Alexandra. I do not know why he did not wait until legislation was introduced to deal with that subject before voicing his criticism. I do not know why he raised the matter now. I do not know why the hon. member now voices all kinds of criticism which is irrelevant. He said we should provide for the families of migratory workers. That is an old bone of contention, which dates back to the days when General Smuts was Minister of Native Affairs. Allow me to say that General Hertzog&#x2019;s criticism of that suggestion, which has now again been made by the hon. member for Yeoville, was so devastating that General Smuts was forced at that time to withdraw it. What would South Africa have looked like if that policy, which the hon. member for Yeoville is again suggesting here to-night, had been implemented in 1923? What would the Witwatersrand have looked like?</p>

<p>The hon. member for Yeoville knows very well that it is their policy to implement integration in the fullest sense of the word. That is why they want to allow the maximum number of Bantu to enter the White areas. That is why they, when the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) was still Minister of Native Affairs, allowed the Bantu of the Eastern Cape to enter the Western Province without imposing any control. To-day we pluck the bitter fruit of that policy. Do you know what one result of it is, Sir? To the regret of everybody in this country, we now have a brand new bastard generation in this country as the result of that policy. If the policy of the Leader of the Opposition is to be implemented, namely that we must integrate the Coloureds of South Africa with the Whites, I foresee great difficulties for him. Because to-day we have a type of Coloured who differs only a hair&#x2019;s breadth from the Bantu. He is much nearer to the Bantu than to the White man. And that is the type of person who must be integrated with the Whites in terms of their race federation policy. Time does not allow me to discuss the policy of the Leader of the Opposition, but I just want to say one thing. I have always regarded the Leader of the Opposition as a brave man, but it seems to me that he has less courage than I thought he had. When the opportunity offered itself for him to discuss that policy of his, which he had announced to the world with great publicity, namely during the second reading of the Transkei Bill &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, he had it, but he did not want to put it before us. But the previous year the hon. member for Yeoville announced that same policy. But the Leader of the Opposition waited until the opportunity was passed and then he went to the Press and published it in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> <span class="col_4505-4506" refersTo="page_0827"/>In spite of that he criticizes the Government&#x2019;s policy in regard to the Transkei to-day under this Vote, knowing full well that there is no opportunity for us to discuss his policy as contrasted with the Transkei policy of the Government. Therefore I say that the Leader of the Opposition is not as brave as I thought he was. One almost feels inclined to move under this Vote that the salary of the Leader of the Opposition should be reduced, something which they generally move when a Minister&#x2019;s Vote is under discussion.

<p>I shall not follow the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg). If the hon. member suggests that my hon. leader lacks courage because an article on race federation was published in the <i>Sunday Times</i> a week or two ago and that we cannot therefore discuss it, he shows abysmal ignorance of the Rules of Parliament. There are many other opportunities where these matters can be raised. He can raise it now or he can raise it under the Appropriation Debates which still have to come. The hon.

And to think that such a suggestion could come from an old soldier like the hon. member for Krugersdorp!</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was expressing my surprise at the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement over the week-end that 500,000 jobs in border industries, could support 12,500,000 Natives. I made the point that the Prime Minister expected us to accept a peculiar geometrical progression, the answer to which is infinity. I can understand that people occupied in secondary occupations can create tertiary occupations but to suggest that people in tertiary occupations will create further occupations opens the door to the inescapable conclusion that it can go on to infinity. The Prime Minister said that each worker will support four other workers which gives you five.</p>

<p>I am arguing because I want the Prime Minister to know what he must answer. I want to be fair to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister said that 500,000 workers in industry would support 12,500,000 people. I then got up and said that the Native population will be between 20,000,000 and 30,000,000 in 50 years&#x2019; time. The Prime Minister did not challenge that. All he said was that it would be 19,500,000 at the end of the century. We then agreed that the end of the century would only be 37 years hence and not 50 years hence. I did not misunderstand the Prime Minister. I may be stating his calculations incorrectly but the answer to the sum is 12,500,000 workers.</p>

The hon. the Prime Minister can argue as long as he likes in trying to tell us that the 12,500,000 people can have a living because 500,000 people are employed in industry. He cannot get away from that, and I say it is preposterous&#x2014;common sense tells you that it is preposterous. But what is more significant to me, and that is why I am willing to leave this for a further explanation, was the interchange between him and myself when he had to admit that even 12,500,000 would not mean support for the total population in 50 years&#x2019; time, and that even in 35 years&#x2019; time there will be 7,000,000 more than these 500,000 can support according to his calculations in 50 years&#x2019; time.</p>

That is how the newspapers reported him. I am dealing with the newspaper report and I am asking for an explanation. Let us get this cleared up once and for all. Neither the hon. Prime Minister or I want to argue on a misunderstanding. Perhaps he can clarify this: In 35 years time, according to the Tomlinson Commission&#x2019;s Report, which the Prime Minister has accepted, our total Native population will be 20,000,000 or 19,500,000 (I think that is the actual figure), and in 50 years time, it will be more, probably double of that, roughly about 30,000,000.</p>

I want to ask him specifically: Does that mean that no more Native labour will be required in the industry existing on the Witwatersrand, in Cape Town, in Port Elizabeth, in Kimberley, because the border industries will cater for the whole Native population? I am not being stupid, I am seeking information. The hon. the Prime Minister tells us about 500,000 jobs in the border industries. In all the time that our industries have been developing, we have only created jobs for 250,000 Natives. He wants to double that achievement in the border industries alone.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I shall not deal with this point alone, but also with a few other points that have been raised.</p>

<p>Let me first of all put this very plainly: I estimate that at the end of the century&#x2014;-and this is not only my estimate, but the general scientific estimate&#x2014;our Native population will number approximately 19,500,000. That Native population will then consist not only of the new ones that are added, the increased total; one has to have regard to the number of people presently residing and living here. Of the present group, at least 4,000,000 are already making a living in the Native areas. Therefore when reference is made to the existence of a total number of 19,500,000 at the end of the century, those that are already taken care of must of course be deducted; thus at least the 4,000,000 have to be deducted, if that number will still be the same then, who largely make their livelihood in the Bantu areas as agriculturists. That already reduces the remaining number to 15,500,000. Apart from those, however, there is a large number of other persons who have work in the rural areas and in the present urban areas. The assumption on which we have been working is that there will be a constant decrease in this number of Natives after, as we have said, the apex of the graph shall have been reached in 1978. Hon. members know the whole argument. In other words, towards the end of the century there will still be Natives working in the rural areas, and there will still be Natives working in certain urban areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>What is the estimate?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Say approximately 3,000,000. In other words, then there will be left those 12,500,000 that I have to take into account. That is the first point. There are 12,500,000, which is an increase, in respect of whom the question has to be put as to where additional employment will be found to take care of them.</p>

<p>Let us now consider for a moment how any community is organized. In the present community in which we live, Whites and Coloureds and Natives all together, there are only a certain number of people who are earning money in the ordinary creative occupations, that is to say, in primary and secondary industry. It is a limited number. All the rest work in the tertiary occupations. Now if one reviews the position in South Africa, it is true that the Bantu do not now have their own large <span class="col_4509-4510" refersTo="page_0829"/>tertiary group depending on the income of its group alone, because they constitute a part of our community. However&#x2014;and my assumption is based upon this&#x2014;should there be established within the Bantu areas their own Bantu community, in such a way that the specific group I now refer to put their earnings back into that community, then those earnings will be the basis upon which that entire community will be built.</p>

<p>Let us see what is happening to-day in our own community, and this applies to every community, whether in Japan, in England, or in Germany. There is the number of persons who are engaged in occupational activities created by the circulation of money as a result of what is earned by the comparatively small percentage of people in the primary industries, five times as many. Taking this as my starting-point I argued&#x2014;and as I have said, this is not only my argument, it is the normal sociological reasoning. If there are 100,000 people employed in primary occupations, then I assume that they may be partly employed in the border areas, but some of them may by that time also possess their own independent large industries within the Bantu area, and therefore Bantu may be employed in those also. (That is why I have said that I was not referring to 500,000 workers in the border areas, but to 500,000 employed in the new industries that are to be developed both in the border areas and within the Native areas. For that reason I said the hon. member did not understand me correctly.)</p>

<p>If now there are 100,000 persons thus earning money in secondary industries, they are at least looking after their families. The families of some will consist of ten or twelve children: some will be unmarried. It is usually estimated that on an average every earner supports a family of five. If, therefore, 100,000 are employed in such industries, then there are 500,000 people directly being supported in this way.</p>

<p>Now those people go and reside in their Bantu area, say in a Bantu township. What happens then? Those children go to school and those schools have teachers; those schools must also have books, those schools must also have cleaners, those schools even have to be built, and bricks have to be made for the buildings. The people reside in a township where streets have to be constructed. They have a municipality with officials; churches are built, and there are ministers. I am now trying to explain in the most elementary manner how a community is organized. I think the hon. member will now understand sufficiently clearly what I meant: It is not a case of one person depending upon the other in the sense suggested by him, or, in the refined language of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, one small flea living on a larger flea. It is purely a case of a whole community&#x2019;s many-sided structure being built up by the circulation of money derived from primary and secondary industries in its only truly creative form. Everything else rests upon that, and is developed through the continuous circulation of money. That is how it comes about that so many more people and so many more professions&#x2014;doctors and advocates and postmasters and railway officials and the service industries etc. as well&#x2014;everything in a community is built upon the earnings in certain creative industries. Surely that is elementary.</p>

<p>If people now choose to make ridiculous interjections, I simply refuse to continue the argument, for then we are dealing with children. My exposition states the economic basis upon which the argument is built. As I have said, this is not an attempt by me to develop a political argument; here we are concerned merely with a normal reasoning of how a community is constituted and works. If 500,000 workers in the secondary industries each on an average look after four others, then it means that the number of persons who are directly dependent upon such industries in this manner (husband, wife and children) totals 2,500,000. But that superstructure created by the circulation of money is in fact going to arise there where it is spent and that is the advantage that will be derived from the border industries: that it will contribute to the development of the Bantu areas in which their employees will be living. It is the greatest development that will then be set afoot, for it will be different there from what it is here where they constitute the substratum of our White tertiary industries also. Here we give them a number of White officials; we give them a portion of the White doctors; we give them the post office officials; we give them the traders, township managers etc. In other words, here we are as White people deriving benefit from what we are building on their earnings, but under the system of border industries it will be just the other way about. Everything will then go to their community, and in this manner it will then come about that in the Bantu area ultimately five times more people will be looked after indirectly than are looked after directly. Is it clear now what I mean?</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Suppose you have 500,000 workers in the big industries&#x2014;some may be in mines or other money-creating industries. On an average, each one of the 500,000 has a wife and three children, and their families together then come to five times 500,000. Surely that is clear, is it not? Thus direct provision for five times 500,000, therefore 2,500,000. But all the tertiary industries are based upon them, and the estimates of sociologists is that the full tertiary group, that is to say, the earners plus the husband, wife and children, amount to five times as much again, thus 12,500,000.</p>

<p>Of course it is a distortion when one says that the one man directly earns the food and the clothes and the education fees etc. of 125 people, for this of course is not what he can earn directly in this manner. But the true position is that in a community it is a fact that through the circulation of money which comes into circulation over and over again through the various activities of the whole community, a very large number of people derive benefit from the labour of a limited group of people in the original money making or goods producing industries. In this manner the great community is built up. That is so in fact. Now the Opposition may call it ridiculous if they wish, but it is not ridiculous because it is a fact. I hope that this at least is clear.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet, I should like to reply to a few arguments used by the hon. member. He tried to pour ridicule upon our statement that we have had the same point of view right from the beginning as to what the development of our policy would be, namely that which we are engaged upon at the moment e.g. in the Transkei. He tried to refute it by quoting certain clauses from the programme of principles of the National Party. He tried to base his strongest argument upon a particular clause in the programme of principles dealing with how we claim guardianship over the Bantu. I do not have the clause before me now, so I am not quoting it word for word. But what does he think is the meaning of the term &#x201C;guardianship&#x201D;? Does he think it means that those who are in the care of a guardian by implication cannot develop further? Does he think that we are using that expression &#x201C;guardianship&#x201D;, and not &#x201C;perpetual domination&#x201D; without any object in mind? Does he not appreciate that &#x201C;guardianship&#x201D; includes by implication the meaning of the gradually developing independence of those who are under guardianship? Surely that is self-evident. But I have here before me the report to which I referred this afternoon when I did not have it before me, namely the Report of the Commission on the Colour Question of the Herenigde Nasionale Party dated 1947, the one signed by the members of that commission, namely Mr. P. O. Sauer, M.P. (Chairman), Prof. Dr. G. B. A. Gerdener, Dr. E. G. Jansen, M.P., Mr. J. J. Serfontein. M.P., and Mr. M. D. C. de W. Nel, M.P. That was a Commission the National Party had in 1947. The report of this Commission was then adopted under the leadership of Dr. Malan and before we came into power, and in this report there is an exposition of native policy as it is now being further developed. It includes the following <i>inter alia</i>&#x2014;there are many propositions contained in it&#x2014;but under Point G in regard to native policy, it reads as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) The native must be anchored firmly in what is nationally his own and peculiar to his own national character. He must be taught gradually to appreciate his culture and national institutions and to develop them. He will only be capable of gradually being guided to adapt him-self, where necessary, to the Western civilization. All immoral and other elements harmful to his nation in his culture and national institutions must be eliminated;</li>

<li>(b) the natives must be guided to build up a separate national structure of their own within which they can develop in every respect with full opportunities for every individual and every opportunity to realize their national ideals and aspirations in their own areas.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now I come to the third of these propositions&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(c) The policy will aim at gathering together as far as possible the main ethnic groups and sub-groups in their own respective areas, where everyone can ultimately build up its own central system of government, and where they can be guided towards developing as separate national units.</li>

</ol>

<p>If words have any meaning, what else does this mean than exactly what we are now doing in the Transkei? This has been quoted by the hon. Whip in Parliament on a previous occasion, yet hon. members opposite persist in pretending that there is no proof for my contention that we are giving effect to the aim of our old policy, and that not a single member of the public, even those who voted for us in 1948 to put us in power for the first time, could have been misled, for this was put to them as the policy.</p>

<p>Here is still another clause which it may be interesting to quote. The others I have read out are clear enough, but here the native reserves are being dealt with, and it reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Native reserves must become the fatherland of the Native. They must be the cradle of his nationhood and the acre upon which his patriotism and his national pride can grow and be developed. It must be a spiritual home for every Native. It must be the seat of his system of government; it must be the main seat of his churches; his most important educational institutions must be situated there. In short, it must be made the nursery of his personal and national ideals and aspirations.</block>

<p>Oh yes, and it was quoted time and again. Hon. members are now trying to hide behind a new smokescreen by saying that it was not known. What I am proving is that I am accused (let us keep to the argument now) of coming forward with a completely new change of policy, and here I am proving that &#x201C;separate national units&#x201D; was proclaimed clearly as the policy in 1947, in a document in which I had no share at all, and which was adopted by the then Leader, Dr. Malan, and was also adopted by the next Leader, Adv. Strijdom, and which was also accepted by me as a member of the party. There should not be attempts to come forward with other excuses now again. Here we have the proof of the uniformity of our policy, and better proof can hardly be produced.</p>

<p>There is another point I should just like to mention. The hon. member for Yeoville now says that the Transkei policy would have caused us the loss of overseas support, or in any event that after the announcement we lost further overseas support. I say in the first place that it is not a correct statement to say that we have lost overseas support in consequence of the announcement of this policy.</p>

<p>In spite of it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Nor in spite of it either. I contend that the process which is going on is a clear one; it is there for every-body to see if he simply looks at Africa. I want to repeat to some extent what I said this afternoon, but in a different form. I want to ask hon. members to bear in mind that the attacks of the Afro-Asian nations in UNO are directed not only against South Africa with her policy of separate development but also against Portugal with her policy of equality in her territories, Angola and Mozambique, a policy under which Portugal says that the Bantu and the Portuguese are all Portuguese subjects with equal rights. Portugal wants to permit intermarriage; she wants to bring about equality in all other respects between Black and White. But what is the attitude that has been adopted by UNO and by the Afro-Asian States towards Portugal and her territories? Are they satisfied with all this? Are they satisfied with Black and White unity? No. Then there is also the other example of the Rhodesias with their policy of partnership, the implementation of which Britain demanded in those territories. Does that policy of partnership, starting with a junior partnership and going on to equal partnership, together with the announcement of Whitehead that he visualizes that within 15 years Southern Rhodesia will even have a Black Government, bring about co-operation? Has it satisfied UNO? Has it satisfied the Afro-Asian nations? Again the answer is &#x201C;No&#x201D;. Here we have three possibilities therefore: (a) Absolute equality, with the White man staying on as part and parcel of a multi-racial State (this has found no favour; it has received no support); (b) partnership, with the Black man and the White man as partners, even with the prospect that eventually the Blacks, with their superiority of numbers, will rule (this has received no support); (c) separation, as in the Republic, and the building up of separate nations. The first two, after all, involve greater concessions; they go further on the road of intergration than the race federation policy which the United Party propagates to-day. In the Portuguese territories and in the Federation territories it is not said that there will be everlasting White rule or White rule for the foreseeable future, as the United Party says! No, in Southern Rhodesia it is even visualized that the Government will be Black within 15 years. If that is so, how can the charge be made against us that our policy of apartheid alienates our friends, the implication being that their policy of race federation has found favour with these people? A policy which goes much further, namely the policy of absolute equality, is not even succeeding in other territories. There is only one demand which is made by our critics; that demand is as clear as a pikestaff and that is that the Black man alone must govern. Everybody who is White must be pushed out with the greatest possible speed. Is that not the only thing that will satisfy UNO? How then can the hon. member allege, and try to bring the country under the impression, that it is the fault of this Government, perhaps even the fault of the Transkei policy, that we are getting no support from at least that section of United Nations States? As far as South Africa is concerned the attitude which is adopted by her opponents and by those who support South Africa&#x2019;s opponents in order to serve their own interests is an impossible one. To suggest that the policy of the United Party will receive their support is to mislead the public.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is clear that the hon. member for Yeoville also wants to take part in the attempt on the part of the Opposition to exonerate themselves from the charge which is made by this side that they are responsible for the fact that the idea is gaining ground in the minds of the rebellious elements that they have the support of the United Party and that the way in which the United Party argues must inevitably encourage these rebellious elements to revolt. The hon. Leader of the Opposition personally objected here this afternoon, because he wants to distinguish between the use of the word &#x201C;understandable&#x201D; and the word &#x201C;justifiable&#x201D;. He says that &#x201C;understandable&#x201D; reasons have been given by his Party for these disturbances but that that does not necessarily justify the actions of these people. He says that in suggesting that this is a sort of justification which must have an inflammatory effect upon <span class="col_4515-4516" refersTo="page_0832"/>them we are misinterpreting their attitude. Sir, as intellectuals we can play with words; we can draw fine distinctions between the meaning of &#x201C;understandable&#x201D; reasons and &#x201C;justifiable&#x201D; reasons. But what is the point? The point is what the effect is on the mind of the Bantu. How are those people going to interpret the argument of the United Party? Sir, how do you think the Bantu is going to interpret it if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition comes here and says, &#x201C;Yes, this Poqo movement, these other agitator organizations are all very bad things and we condemn them but one must realize that they owe their origin to the fact that what this Government did here was wrong and what it did there was wrong.&#x201D; Will the Bantu say, &#x201C;The United Party condemns me, but for certain reasons it does understand my actions,&#x201D; or is he going to say, &#x201C;No, I see that the Whites are on my side?&#x201D; Of course that is how the Native is going to argue, and that is the danger of the United Party&#x2019;s political attacks. It is not a question of scoring debating points by the use of certain words; the question is what the effect is of the United Party&#x2019;s statements and those of its Press. The danger lies in the inflammatory effect of the words of the United Party and of its Press on the mind of the Bantu.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<p>Let us understand each other perfectly clearly. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition advances as one excuse, as an &#x201C;understandable&#x201D; reason which the Bantu regard as a &#x201C;justifiable&#x201D; reason, the fact that the Bantu do not have the right to own land in the White area and that they should be given that right. I cannot say here that I propose to remove that alleged reason for dissatisfaction which has allegedly given rise to Poqo by giving them the right to own land in locations, because I believe that that would be wrong. I believe that if anything it would give them the right to say that they now have a share in the ownership of what I call the White man&#x2019;s land and that they are therefore entitled to the vote, to a much greater extent than even the Leader of the Opposition is prepared to give them under his federation policy. I cannot concede it to them therefore. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition does wish to concede it. Nor can I say that the Bantu will be allowed to flock into the cities in unlimited numbers, or that women will be allowed to flock into the cities to join their husbands, or that new workers will be allowed to flock into the cities, because I believe that that would be extremely harmful to South Africa, both as far as the Whites are concerned and as far as the other Bantu are concerned. I believe that in some places this would result in the formation of a redundant labour pool as a result of which the Bantu who are there at present would suffer. I cannot remove such an alleged grievance because I think that in point of fact it should not be a grievance. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, however, builds it up into a grievance.</p>

<p>The question is not whether you can remove these grievances or not. The question is a very simple one. I have said that I condemn this organization. If the hon. the Prime Minister is also of that opinion and says that he accepts that I condemn this organization, then it resolves the matter.</p>

<p>I accept that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition says that an organization such as Poqo is entirely wrong, but then I go on to say that I most strongly condemn the fact that the Leader of the Opposition is not prepared to leave it at that but that he sees fit, for political purposes, in order to attack this side, to level the accusation against this side that the Government is preparing a seed-bed in which this type of organization is able to grow. I say that those instigators of unrest and their defenders here and overseas, however piously he may try to interpret and twist those words, will accept and interpret them as a justification for these deeds. That part of my reproach I cannot wipe out. Only the Leader of the Opposition can do so by refraining from saying these things.</p>

<p>But I want to point out to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition that he is not the only guilty party. His lieutenant, the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J M. Steyn), is just as bad. I have before me an article of his which appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 19 April 1963, an article of which he is probably proud.</p>

<p>What else is it but saying that the Government is taking certain powers to deal with illegal opposition organized by people who have been deprived of all opportunity to have their grievances remedied in a legitimate manner, and who will interpret it other than that this is a defence of their actions? What else is it but strong support for Poqo? But apart from that I say that it is an absolutely unfair statement to make.

<p>What chance did three Representatives in this Parliament have to change Government policy? They had no chance at all, and hon. members know it. Now the United Party wants to shelter behind that in order to make this accusation. If the Leader of the Opposition tries to pose as the supporter of this standpoint which was stated by the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn), I say that I am ashamed of his attitude in supporting such a defence of unlawful organizations. [Interjections.] One need not argue about it further.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Yeoville got up to speak later, he alleged that we had a policy for the future but none for the present. He tried to prove that by saying that I recently adopted the attitude&#x2014;and he knows as well as I do that this was not the first time but that I had often said so before&#x2014;that the removal of the Bantu from the Western Province would take place as a process, and that two things would have to be complied with. The one is that there should first be opportunities for employment elsewhere for these people, because one is not morally justified&#x2014;and it would not be wise to do so&#x2014;in removing the Bantu here and sending them to the Bantu areas without creating opportunities for employment for them there. I have always said that this would be done. Secondly, I have always said that there need not be disruption, because if the process is tackled intelligently, the economic development of the Western Province will not be hampered. It is a normal course of action and it does not mean that this policy cannot be implemented soon, because we are continuously busy with the gradual implementation of our policy. By quoting this one example, the hon. member was implying that we have a policy for the future only, just as his leader did this afternoon when he said that our policy would not be implemented before 1978, when we always said the apex of the influx curve would be reached. Now the hon. member says that because we say that there is a gradual process of removal in which there will be no disruption, we are doing nothing now but will do something only later! The application of a policy like this is a lengthy process, and we have been saying that ever since 1948. We are busy gradually, step by step, implementing the policy of apartheid. That is what we did in the Transkei, also in the political sphere, and that is what we are doing in regard to the Coloureds.</p>

However, I repeat that that is not true. But let us look at their policy. I have in my hand something I did not have this afternoon, namely the policy of the United Party as published in the <i>Sunday Times,</i> and what does this statement say? The United Party leaders say they are going to apply their policy in three phases. In other words, it is not a policy for to-day only, but also for the future&#x2014;phases generally follow on each other. The first phase is simply that the United Party is just going to do those things which it might as well do while it is still in opposition, viz. to review the number of Acts and to decide which of them it will retain and which of them it will repeal.

<block name="quote">&#x2026; so that the White man&#x2019;s influence will be supported by numbers and his fesar of being swamped reduced.</block>

<p>All that is in the first phase. What will they then have done in regard to the colour problem in that phase? But still they dare to tell me that our policy is one for the future and not one for to-day! Then it continues with the second phase. That is in regard to how it wants to make the Natives, the Coloureds and the Indians members of this Parliament in various ways, in addition to all kinds of other integration measures. I must say frankly that I have tried to find this third phase but could not do so. Is there a third phase? [Interjection.] What is it?</p>

<p>I am sending over this report so that hon. members opposite may point out to me where this third phase is. In the meantime I will refer to Alexandra in a few words, because the hon. member for Yeoville mentioned it. In regard to Alexandra it is quite clear that we are dealing there with a large, over-inhabited area. At one time it was estimated that there were more than 110,000 people in that area, and as Minister of Native Affairs it was my task at the time to improve that position. I could get no co-operation from the City Council of Johannesburg, which was really the city which got its labour from Alexandra. We therefore had to adopt a different course and the Central Government assumed a responsibility which should really have been shouldered by the City Council. One could rather have considered removing the whole of Alexandra from that White area, but we did not do so, for several reasons. We thought, <i>inter alia,</i> that it could be a residential area from which the Northern Areas of Johannesburg could get their labour. Consequently we tried to reduce the number of people there to 30,000. That led to the removal of quite a few families to the southern location areas. From there some married people went to work in the Northern Areas, because many of them had done so previously. It was then discovered that there was a large number of single Bantu, people who were either married but did not have their wives in Johannesburg, or who were unmarried, and for whom accommodation had to be found. Under those circumstances it is very clear that accommodation could be established in hostels in Alexandra for those employed in the Northern areas. In the meantime there will, however, still be families not living in the hostels. That <span class="col_4521-4522" refersTo="page_0835"/>was as far as my plans went, and I take it that is still the position. Members of families living in the southern locations could also go to work there. Therefore the whole accusation about which the hon. member for Yeoville made such a fuss is meaningless. I think I have now allowed enough time to pass to give the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a chance to find his third phase in that newspaper. I hope the beginning of that third phase is marked.</p>

<p>It is not clear where this third phase is, but the Leader of the Opposition says that I must accept it that the third phase starts where he says: &#x201C;I have mentioned some of the signposts which the United Party will plot on the road of orderly advance towards race federation. There will be others required by the needs of dynamic policy to meet ever-changing human relations&#x201D;.

Now I want to point out that I am continually being accused of not giving the finest details. I am always expected to submit one blueprint after another. In actual fact I continually give the most detailed explanation of our policy, and the implementation of my policy is actually seen in detail, but those hon. members begin to discuss their third phase, after not having said much in regard to the second phase, by saying that they will tell us as little as possible in regard to the future. And that is what they did in fact. The rest of the article just consists of generalities.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>So we get to the crux of the whole difference in policy. These pious words about a race federation are just by the way. The crucial matter in regard to which the public of South Africa will always have to decide is whether they want what the United Party stands for, a Parliament consisting of Whites and of Bantu, first represented by Whites and gradually by Bantu, and with representation granted also to the Bantu areas as well as to the Bantu in the White areas, but how precisely that is to be done we do not know. However, there will first be representation by White representatives and then by Blacks, first by eight and then, after a referendum, by more. How these changes will take place, and whether they will take place, or whether the aims of Black nationalism will all of it, all hangs in the air, but Parliament will be mixed. There will be representation of the Bantu and of the Coloureds and of the Indians by themselves. The consequences of such a Parliament is that there must also be that kind of Government. And the result of such a Government is that there must also be such a Public Service and such a Defence Force. The consequences of that in turn will be that the pressure of the majority of the people in the country for the universal franchise&#x2014;one man, one vote&#x2014;will have to come. And history has shown what that will mean. It will be similar to what has happened in the rest of Africa. Whether we call this policy a federation or a race federation, it means nothing else but that one face emerges clearly: That is how the United Party wants to govern South Africa and that is how the Government of the country will develop under its regime.</p>

<p>As against that, we have as our very clear policy that we do not want a multi-racial Government; that we want to retain a White Central Parliament, and that we are prepared to pay the price for it. namely that the areas which historically have become Bantu areas, even though we Whites have governed them during the past 80 years or more, may again <span class="col_4523-4524" refersTo="page_0836"/>become Bantu areas. They should not, as in the Congo, be freed suddenly, but gradually, step by step, so that an experienced Bantu democracy may develop, which will then be our neighbour. We prefer to ensure the existence of a White Parliament, even though it means that eventually we will have Bantu neighbouring States. We also prefer to have orderly Bantu neighbours, and therefore we will regulate that process of development. In the case of the Coloureds and the Indians, we have clearly stated how, by means of their own country-wide control boards, they will be given the opportunity to look after their own interests. Those are the two directions. Now the hon. members of the Opposition may criticize us, and they may find fault with it. They may try to seek defects in our policy, but that is irrelevant. The important point is that the people must decide between those two directions and there should no longer be any doubt in this regard.</p>

<p>No. They will be given an Indian Council, just like the Coloureds. The Indians in South Africa can regard themselves as being very fortunate because we want to follow this course, because it is and remains a fact that they are a foreign element in our society.

<p>We have accepted the Indians in the same way that we accept the Coloureds, as citizens of South Africa in connection with whom, according to the principles of apartheid, we should ensure that they have political rights amongst their own people.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with what the hon. member for Yeoville has said, that this Government has a lot to say but has very little courage. I cast that accusation back in their faces and say that we have always had the courage of our convictions, whatever pressure has been brought to bear upon us, both internally and externally, to state our standpoint clearly and unequivocally and to implement it. In spite of all the attacks and all the misleading and all the misrepresentations there have been, we have had the courage to stick to our standpoint. But how much courage does the Opposition have in regard to their policy? They have announced one policy after the other. Is it courageous to announce one policy one day and then, if there is no support for it, to announce another policy a few weeks later? We have already ridiculed the three-point policy, the ten-point policy, and the six-point policy and the Graaff Senate Plan, and now we have to ridicule the vague race federation plan. This exposition of the race federation plan is in fact the most significant proof of a lack of courage one can ever have in a party. What does this article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> written by the Leader of the Opposition say? There are five principles on which the United Party will build, and what are those principles? Firstly, all races must have a share in the civilization which has been built up here, by co-operating under White leadership. What is the object of that? It is simply to catch the votes of the White electorate. Those hon. members said some time ago that they stood for full integration in the political and economical spheres, but they have now discovered that that is not what their supporters wanted. The result is that they have come along with a few generalities to sugar-coat the pill of partnership and integration before they come to the second phase in which they want to give representation to all non-Whites in this Parliament. That shows a lack of courage. After having first tried to sugar-coat the pill by means of such generalities, they sprinkle some more sugar over their first phase. They want the White people really to infer that the Bantu still have to wait a long time for representation, while they sit and think and &#x201C;examine and review&#x201D; all the discriminatory laws, while they evolve machinery for consultation, and during all that time the people may be satisfied that they will really do nothing in regard to the Native problem. That is their second coating of the pill. Only then comes the phase where they give representation to the Bantu, and they have so little courage that they try to minimize it by saying that they will give only eight representations to the Bantu. In spite of what happened in Kenya and in Rhodesia, they want the White voters to believe that the Bantu will remain satisfied with that; in addition, it will still be White representatives. In order to give the pill still another coating of sugar, they say that thereafter they will first have a referendum in which the White, the Coloured and the Indian voters together will be able to say whether they want to allow the Bantu more representation. Everybody knows, however, that this is only a way of inducing the voters of South Africa to swallow this pill of a multi-racial Government, whilst everybody also knows that this process will not be so lengthy. The lessons taught by Africa are too clear and too serious. We know what happened in Kenya and in <span class="col_4525-4526" refersTo="page_0837"/>Rhodesia. Everybody knows that when one starts slipping down this road of integration, the pressure from the Afro-Asians will become too strong. Everybody knows that the Bantu in this country is more likely to revolt against such a meagre partnership than against the self-government we propose granting them. But they will then have leaders inside this Parliament who will demand greater representation, and by the Bantu themselves, and South Africa will then be compelled to accede to that demand. Apart from that, it will not be the White voters who will decide this matter in a referendum, if there is the opportunity to hold a referendum; it will have to be the Whites, the Indians and the Coloureds together because they will all immediately have a share in the Government of the country in the second phase. In other words, the Opposition has revealed a great lack of courage by jumping about in this manner, and then they still dare to accuse us. Therefore I repeat what I said this afternoon: South Africa will have to realize what a deadly danger the United Party represents to its survival. If it realizes that, the United Party will never come into power.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, a long time ago the hon. the Prime Minister dealt with the question of what I called geometrical progression, the question of creating jobs by employing 500,000 people in industry. Before I come back to that, I want to say that this intervention by the hon. the Prime Minister has been most useful. What was very interesting is that the Prime Minister continued in his allegation that he was still carrying out the traditional policy of the Nationalist Party. I think we have come to the stage now that we must agree to differ. The Prime Minister apparently believes that he is still carrying out the policy of the Nationalist Party, but we and the <i>Burger</i> differ from him, and in this case I am inclined to believe the <i>Burger.</i> Here I want to issue a challenge to the Prime Minister. He quoted the Sauer Report of 1947 to justify his policy, but the Sauer Report is part of the policy of the Nationalist Party which the Prime Minister has torn up, just as he removed all Native representation from Parliament before establishing the Bantustans.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Well, then it was constructive resignation. [Laughter.] But do not let us quibble about it. He joined issue with the Prime Minister on that.</p>

<p>Why did the hon. the Prime Minister not tell us that this very Sauer Report which was to be the blue-print of apartheid and which was quoted by him as an authority said that while they might take away the representatives in this House they would be given seven representatives in the Senate? Is the Senate not part of the Parliament of South Africa? In fact the position is that the authorities quoted by the Prime Minister to show that his party&#x2019;s policies were unchanged prove in fact how the Prime Minister has trod the policies of the Nationalist Party under foot. What interested me very much was the Prime Minister&#x2019;s attempt to discredit the article of my Leader in the <i>Sunday Times.</i> He took us amiss for saying that we would institute reforms with the approval specifically of the people of South Africa. He considers that to be a weakness because he himself assumes the right to change the policies of the Nationalist Party himself without reference to its congresses or its caucus. I am proud and grateful to think that the Leader of the Opposition is not a leader like that. I am proud to think that he is willing to derive his authority specifically from the electorate of South Africa for his reforms. That of course is the important difference between the hon. the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition: the one is a democrat and the other is by instinct a dictator.</p>

<p>I should now like to return to this question of the 500,000 workers. I am grateful to the Prime Minister for having made this clear. The report was so sketchy and the explanation of the Prime Minister this afternoon was so confused that we too got confused, but now the position is clear. The Prime Minister&#x2019;s argument is that the 500,000 workers will support 12,500,000 members of the Native population: They will support tertiary activities, new jobs will be necessary to maintain them and their families, and ultimately 12,500,000 people will live as a result of their employment in industry. If that is so, then I do not understand why it is not the position in South Africa to-day. After all in South Africa to-day you have 623,000 people in industry, another 709,000 employed in mining, without even mentioning the hundreds of thousands employed in agriculture. If the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s argument is correct and even if we have no agriculture in South Africa we should be supporting a population in South Africa of 33,300,000. I think there is something wrong in the Prime Minister&#x2019;s calculations. I hope, Sir, he will consider the matter again and discuss it again with Dr. van Eck. We will in that way get some light in due course. This argument of the Prime Minister, however, is facile, over-optimistic and may mislead him as well as the people of South Africa.</p>

<p>But I will not spend much more time on this because I am much more interested in the other admissions made by the Prime Minister that at the time of the turn of the century, perhaps in 50 years&#x2019; time&#x2014;the number of years he used when he spoke to the Sakekamer&#x2014;there will still be millions of people who will not be supported by the Bantustans but who, as to-day, will still be working in our factories, in <span class="col_4527-4528" refersTo="page_0838"/>our mines and on our farms. They will be part of the economy of the White Republic of South Africa.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister suggests that our policy is also one of the future. He read from the article of my Leader in the <i>Sunday Times</i> about three phases but he carefully omitted to read the very sentence where we state the fact that these phases will run contemporaneously or, to use the words the Leader of the Opposition used, they will overlap. Why did the Prime Minister not read that sentence? My Leader in his article stated that these three phases would be overlapping. While we will be investigating legislation, there will be reforms and even the third phase, i.e. race federation, will not be delayed while phases number one and two are being carried out. We will start implementing our policy forthwith while the Prime Minister and his party have been implementing apartheid now for 15 years with what results? According to the census of 1960 during the ten years from 1950 to 1960 another 1,000,000 Natives came to work in the White man&#x2019;s enterprises. It is not therefore a question of their postponing their policy but in fact of their going backwards. Such a policy is the most futile that one can imagine&#x2014;a policy which aims at the one thing and then deliberately produces the opposite! That does not make sense, and that is the policy which aims at making South Africa less dependent on Native labour and at causing a return flow of Natives out of the Republic into the reserves. In practice, however, 1,000,000 Natives during the period 1950-60 went the opposite direction against their policy. How dare the Prime Minister, who is responsible for a policy with such contradictory results, criticize the United Party by saying that our policy is a policy for the future? And even then he does not read properly what he is criticizing! He left out a most important sentence about the overlapping of phases. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I was saying, Mr. Chairman, that we were rightly coming to the third phase of the policy of the United Party, namely the grave of the White man. That is the third phase of the policy of that party. If the first and second phases have been put into effect the third phase must necessarily follow. And now the hon. member for Yeoville wants to juggle with words. With a great flow of words he tries to make us believe that the &#x201C;overlapping&#x201D; of the three phases of their policy will be the salvation of both the Black man and the White man in South Africa. But throughout the world around him it is totally different. That is why we on this side of the Housg ask ourselves this question: Can the hon. member for Yeoville not understand it then? Can he not see it and can he not understand it? That &#x201C;overlapping&#x201D; has not succeeded anywhere else. The hon. the Prime Minister has given examples of that throughout the world. Even the United Nations applied it in Israel. That was the only policy which could prevent them from killing each other there. Then we still have Rhodesia, Kenya, the Congo, as a matter of fact the whole world. But now they say that they will be able to apply it in South Africa. I should like to know a few things from them and I want to ask them this very politely.</p>

<p>They say that the first thing they are going to do is that they will do justice to the Coloureds who have been removed from the Common Roll. I take it that the same will apply in respect of the Indian population of South Africa. Only after that do we come to the Bantu people and to the race federation. As we see it it must lead to only one thing and that is the destruction of all White authority in South Africa just as all White authority is disappearing in the Federation to our north.</p>

<p>I am not quite sure whether I understood the hon. member for Yeoville correctly this evening. When he referred to the Native hostels in Johannesburg he pleaded&#x2014;I hope I understood him correctly&#x2014;for it that the wives and children of the men who worked there should be brought from the reserves and allowed to live there. Was that his idea?</p>

<p>I wish the hon. member for Transkeian Territories would wait a minute; I shall deal with him in a moment. I say that if the suggestion of the hon. member for Yeoville were carried out the White areas will immediately disappear. I think it is senseless to suggest that there will then be order in South Africa. I simply cannot understand how people can argue like that. As an ex-school master I want to work out a few arithmetical sums for the hon. member for Yeoville. When I look at the hon. member it seems that he has somewhat neglected his arithmetic in the distant past. There are 23 Native villages on my farm. According to the census figures there are 210 Natives in those 23 villages. These 23 villages produce 23 workers. There are 11 big boys which makes a total of 34 together with the 23 Native workers. There is a Native doctor, one does cartage work, and there is one who does the ploughing for the others. Of the 210 souls, therefore, there are 23 from those villages who work together with three in secondary industry. That is what the hon. the Prime Minister has tried to make the hon. member for Yeoville understand. If you have people who work it automatically creates other work. That is the argument which has been used the whole evening but which the hon. member for Yeoville simply cannot understand.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet, however, there is one question which I should like to put to the hon. the Prime Minister. I regard this as one of the most important questions as far as we in the Republic of South Africa are concerned. This question deals with those people who slip across our borders to the Protectorates and who apparently take part in underground activities and who organize against South Africa from there. And that is happening ex a friendly area! Areas which are practically completely dependent on the Republic of South Africa for their entire existence. I wish to refer to Basutoland in particular. People like Patrick Duncan and a few Native leaders have recently fled there and have stated publicly that they will carry on with the threat against South Africa from there. Not only do I regard that as an unfriendly act but as an extremely hostile one. No matter how thorny this question may be I should very much like to know whether a protectorate like Basutoland can be allowed to continue with these activities. Is this escape route through Basutoland going to be allowed to remain? I regard it of the utmost importance that we know what the position is in this respect. I do not think the Opposition will find any fault with it when I say that these Protectorates are economically dependent on South Africa. We simply cannot allow things to continue to happen there as is the case in Angola where forces are openly being trained in the Congo next door for the destruction of Angola. As I see the position the Portuguese will be unable to defend themselves unless they can bomb Elisabethville and a few other big cities of the Congo. That is what these States will be asking for if they continue to carry on as they are. I also think that the time has arrived for England to take note of the actions of these Protectorates. She should take serious note of it. Can we in the Republic allow these undermining activities to continue along our borders, activities which may lead to our own destruction? If ever we have been faced with a serious situation, I think we are to-day faced with such a situation in all its naked earnestness. If the hon. the Prime Minister can throw any light on the subject we and the people outside will be very grateful.</p>

<p>I think we have just listened to a very irresponsible speech by the hon. member who just sat down, because he ought to know that negotiations are proceeding between the Republic and the British Government in respect of future relations with the Protectorates. Since the hon. member is a member of the Government he ought to know that negotiations are proceeding between our Government and the British Government in respect of future relations with the Protectorates. But since the hon. gentleman has raised this matter and has pointed to the very dangers I should like to ask him whether he does not believe that they also are going to increase sevenfold when the seven Bantustans get their independence? It is not going to happen just in respect of Basutoland or Bechuanaland; it is going to happen with every single independent Bantustan created by this Government, just as it has happened in Morocco and in Algiers. There the people went across the border and obtained asylum on the other side. Since, however, the hon. member has raised this matter I think we have the right to say to the hon. the Prime Minister that in dealing with this matter he must always bear in mind that he is perhaps setting a pattern for what the relationship will be not only with Basutoland and the other Protectorates but with seven Bantustans in the future. These Bantustans will be just as keen about their independence as Basutoland, Swaziland and Bechuanaland will be about theirs in due course.</p>

<p>I have said before that this Government will not be able to control the tempo of development of these Bantustans nor will they be able to control the form of that development.</p>

<p>I have said, Sir, that in relation to this matter the hon. the Prime Minister must always bear in mind that he will be setting a pattern for future relations. I think, Sir, that the time has perhaps come, now that the matter has been raised, for him to indicate to us what he hopes to achieve in these negotiations. Most sovereign States in the world are inclined to give political asylum to political refugees, political fugitives, but it seems, Sir, that there must be a difference between giving asylum to a political fugitive and giving protection to an individual who carries on activities hostile to a friendly State under the protection of the State concerned. The position has, of course, altered as a result of our ceasing to be a member of the Commonwealth. The whole situation has changed in that I am not sure that the old Acts which applied continue to apply and I am not sure in what respect they apply. I do not propose to go into the legal questions now; the hon. the Prime Minister and his Department will know what I mean. It does seem to me, however, that the time has come for us to make it very clear that we believe a distinction exists between granting asylum to a political refugee and giving someone protection who is making use of that protection in order to promote hostile activities against a friendly State.</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAF</person>:</from>

<p>I will be grateful to have the views of the hon. the Prime Minister on this subject.</p>

<p>Before widening this debate to cover matters of that kind I should like to return to certain of the questions which was put to the hon. the Prime Minister at the beginning of this debate and long before we got involved in all this nonsense of the United Party being allied to Poqo and long before it tried to draw red herrings across the trail by talking about race federation. I should like to bring the hon. the Prime Minister straight back to the questions which I put to him at the beginning of this debate and to which we have had no reply. I ask the hon. the Prime Minister what it was he proposed to do to try and promote more friendly relations with the outside world. All we got from the hon. gentleman, Sir, was that he shrugged his shoulders and asked what he could do seeing that all the Afro-Asian bloc wanted was one man one vote. All the hon. gentleman had to say to us was that even if we made certain concessions it would not mean that the pressures on us would cease. But surely, Sir, that is elementary. We all know that. But what we want to know now from the hon. the Prime Minister is what, if anything, he can do to keep the great Western powers on our side, those powers who are anti-communist and whose assistance would protect us from the activities of the extremists in the Afro-Asian bloc. One wants to know whether he has had conversation with those powers and also whether any suggestions have been made to him in this regard. Is he prepared to consider their views in these matters and has he any proposals which he believes can result in a more friendly attitude between them and us and which could give our friends a case they could defend in our interests when we are attacked by Afro-Asian s and other extremist blocs. It is no answer to say that the extremists want this and that because we all know that. Moreover we are not prepared to make those concessions. That is common cause on both sides of this House. Surely, Sir, this must be a matter which has been the subject of discussion and surely the hon. the Prime Minister can give us some indications whether there could be a change of attitude, a better atmosphere and that as a result of discussions there might be a better understanding of our situation.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Prime Minister not to be too rigid or inflexible in conducting talks of that kind. He should appreciate, Sir, that it is only by give and take that we are going to get the Western powers on our side at a vitally important time of our history.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, that was one point which was worrying me. Or, do we have to take it from the Prime Minister that he sees no hope for the future in promoting better relations and that he concedes that his Minister of Information cannot achieve anything?

<p>I concede that I have put this matter more fully now than I did before. I also should like to put to him another important point which runs into a third, namely the question I raised with the hon. the Prime Minister of the bottlenecks which were developing in our economy, I believe as a result of his policies and in a <span class="col_4533-4534" refersTo="page_0841"/>sense as the result of his neglect in the past. I refer to the bottlenecks caused by the shortage of tactically trained and skilled personnel and the shortage of risk capital in South Africa as a result of the lack of confidence amongst our people. I also pointed out that in the past when these matters were raised one was met with the statement that we had full employment in South Africa and that we were making rapid strides. But the figures now show that the progress which we have made when it is judged by the growth in real income of the population has been very slow indeed. It compares unfavourably with other young countries of the world and it is even below that of some of the longer-established countries who are far more industrialized that we are. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>I did not think that I would talk on economic matters under the Vote of the Prime Minister but the hon. the Leader of the Opposition made certain statements and allegations this afternoon which I cannot allow to pass without comment. I am sorry that he made certain allegations this afternoon with a view to belittling the economy of South Africa and to insinuate things which are not true. We are living in one of the most modern and most progressive countries. The Leader of the Opposition, however, ignored that completely and he made no mention of that. Why did he not refer to the progress which has been made in South Africa during the past 12 months? There is a great deal of money in circulation in South Africa to-day and that can only be the position if there is prosperity in the country. According to Reserve Bank statistics there were R259,000,000 worth of bank notes in circulation on 14 December last year, which is R27,000,000 more than in the corresponding period of 1961. The hon. Leader of the Opposition conveniently remained silent on this fact. When we look at our industries in South Africa we find that during the first half of 1962 the total production of our factories was approximately 4.2 per cent higher than that for the same period in 1961. If we compare the second term of 1962 with the second half of 1961 we find that the increase in the physical volume of manufactured goods was even very much higher, namely 6.4 per cent. When we take the textile industry we find that the production during the first six months of 1962 was 15.7 per cent higher than in the same period in 1961.</p>

<p>The manufacturers of machinery and transport equipment show an increase of something like 11 per cent. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not say a word about any of these increases. When we look at Sasol and its &#x201C;petrol from coal installation&#x201D;, we find that the chemical industry there is expanding so rapidly that factories to the value of R 12,000,000 are being erected. Let us look at Iscor. For the year ending 30 June 1962 Iscor&#x2019;s production was 313,000 tons more than in the previous year. As against that the total sales exceeded those for the same period by R 11,000,000. The Leader of the Opposition, however, conveniently closed his eyes to these things. When we look at the position of our external trade we find that the total value of goods exported during the first 11 months of 1962, excluding re-exports, was approximately R32,000,000 more than in the corresponding period in 1961. And all this in spite of boycotts and agitations against South Africa.</p>

<p>What has happened in the transportation field in South Africa? The revenue of the South African Railways was R21,500,000 more for the period April to October 1962 than for the corresponding period of 1961. And that after it was announced last year that self-government was to be given to the Transkei. According to the Opposition that announcement would have been catastrophic to South Africa but in spite of that all these increases took place. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is as silent as the grave on this. During April and December 1962 9,012,874 more passengers were conveyed than during the corresponding period in 1961. If there had not been prosperity, had the people not had the money and had there not been an upsurge in South Africa&#x2019;s economy, it would not have been possible to have conveyed so many more people.</p>

<p>When we look at the unemployment figure we find that at the end of November 1962 there were only 21,941 unemployed Whites, Coloureds and Asiatics. This number represents only 1.5 per cent of our labour corps. What is the position in this connection overseas? In Canada the position was that in September 1962 369,000 or 5.6 per cent of their total labour corps was unemployed. In the U.S.A., during October 1962 3,300,000 or 5.5 per cent of the labour corps was unemployed. Furthermore we find that in America they have 814,000 unemployed ten-year-olds, that means 15.6 per cent of the total ten-year-olds. I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition will still maintain that we are worse off in this respect than America. When we take the commercial world we find that according to the monthly index sales figures for garages, traders sold as much as 40 per cent more new and second-hand motor-cars than during the previous year. Surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition cannot say that 40 per cent is very bad.</p>

<p>In South Africa our national debt amounts to only R157 <i>per capita.</i> In the U.S.A. it is R964 <i>per capita.</i> If South Africa were in such a bad position and if the country were in such a precarious position, why is it that immigrants are flocking to the country?</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot supply the information. The system of tax debits was discontinued in 1953 when the recording of tax payments was transferred from the district offices to the Bantu Reference Bureau. To extract the information now required would entail the handling of some 4,000,000 tax cards. The labour involved is not justified.</p>

<li>(1) No; the report of the Secretary for Water Affairs on the Orange River Development Project was prepared on my instructions as a result of a resolution of the House of Assembly dated 17 March 1961. The preparation of the report was however preceded by thorough consultation and deliberation between the Government Departments concerned and the proposals were considered and adopted by the Cabinet before being incorporated in the report. The report <span class="col_4541-4542" refersTo="page_0845"/>was eventually discussed fully in Parliament and accepted in both Houses.</li>

<li>(2) No.</li>

<li>(3) No, it is not customary to refer budget proposals of the various Government Departments for the construction of capital works to the Economic Advisory Council before provision is made in the annual budgets for the necessary funds. Such proposals are preceded by interdepartmental consultation and thereafter by consideration in the Cabinet. In the case of my Department a White Paper report on the proposed works is then tabled in Parliament.</li>

No new principle has been introduced and the circular letter merely sets out for the benefit of local authorities and its officials the full and clear policy in terms of which Bantu have always been encouraged, and where necessary assisted, to establish their business concerns in Bantu areas where their interests are safeguarded. This coincides with the practice to protect the commercial interests of other racial groups in their respective areas.<br/>In spite of the fact that urban Bantu residential areas are within White areas it has always been the policy to permit Bantu to trade within such areas in order to provide essential services and commodities to the residents thereof. Non-Bantu are not permitted to trade within such areas.<br/>Where, however, it is possible for the Bantu to obtain their requirements without undue inconvenience from traders in a White area there is obviously no need to permit any further Bantu-owned business undertakings within urban Bantu residential areas.</li>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister told us yesterday that it was impossible for a multi-racial society to decide on their future together. In other words, he told us that it was impossible for different races to share in the government, different races such as we have here in South Africa. On the other <span class="col_4547-4548" refersTo="page_0848"/>hand the hon. the Prime Minister also rejects racial discrimination. He says each race must have an opportunity to govern himself. If these two principles which the Prime Minister believes in are to be reconciled one cannot have a multi-racial society at all. What is the position in South Africa? When this Government came into power we had a multi-racial society. After 15 years we are still a multiracial society. So how can the Prime Minister possibly state that these are his political beliefs and how can he reconcile them as long as we remain a multi-racial society? Surely the only context in which the policy of apartheid will make sense will be a policy in which we undo our multi-racialism; in which we reverse the processes of the past 300 years; a policy under which we give each of the four racial groups their own homeland where they can govern themselves and run their own economies. This policy of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s makes no sense; it is a completely impractical policy and we might just as well stop pretending that we have a policy to solve our problems in this country.</p>

<p>As far as the Coloureds and the Asians are concerned, surely the prerequisite for a policy of apartheid is that each group must have his own homeland. We have not even got an indication of the homelands of the Coloureds and the Asians. How can we go on pretending that we have a constructive policy as far as they are concerned? They are two racial groups who, by the end of the century, will out-number the Whites. Let us leave the Coloureds and the Asians there and come back to the problem of the Bantu.</p>

<p>The hon. the Prime Minister told us yesterday how he thought the bulk of the Bantu could be removed from the White Republic back to their homelands. The Prime Minister told us that it was intended to create 500,000 jobs in industry on the border of the reserves. The Prime Minister did not tell us how he intended to create those jobs but let us assume for a moment that it will be done; that 500,000 industrial jobs will be created within the next 50 years. The Prime Minister then told us that those 500,000 workers would be able to support directly and indirectly 12,500,000 Bantu. As far as I could follow the Prime Minister he argued along these lines: He said that he had read somewhere in a publication by a Japanese sociologist &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I did not say a Japanese sociologist; I said it was also applicable to Japan.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#cronje">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CRONJE</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry; I misunderstood the Prime Minister. Let us see how it applies to South Africa. The Prime Minister said that he had seen in a publication by some sociologist that if you had one worker in primary industry&#x2014;and this also applied to Japan&#x2014;he supported a family of five including himself and that that family of five gave rise to service requirements which in turn provided employment to a further five workers with their families. With this snowballing effect, the net result is that one worker in secondary industry directly and indirectly supports 25 people. I hope I understood the Prime Minister correctly as far as that is concerned. The Prime Minister did not give us the authority on whom he relied, except that he said he had read it in a Japanese publication. We have what is called occupational censuses in this country. We had an occupational census in 1951 and we had another one in 1960. Unfortunately the full results of the 1960 one are not available in the parliamentary library so I had to turn to the 1951 census. I find that in 1951 we had a total population of about 12,750,000 people in the Union, as it was then called. Our total number of workers at that time was about 4,500,000. That is a ratio of about three to one. So it would appear that one worker in South Africa supports three people including himself. We find that of those 4,500,000 workers 2,750,000 were employed in primary and secondary occupations such as agriculture, fishing, forestry, secondary industry, construction, mining and so forth. The number of workers in the tertiary occupations amounted to about 1,800,000. If we take our own statistics, and not what sociologists in other countries write, we have the position that our census figures show that one productive worker and his family require the services not of five tertiary workers but one two-thirds of a tertiary worker. The ratio is not five to one but only one to two-thirds. That is the situation in South Africa.</p>

<p>Of this total population of 12,500,000, 2,750,000 were employed in primary and secondary industry. Here again the ratio is not 25 to 1 but approximately five to one. So at least as far as the facts in South Africa are concerned, one productive worker supports, directly and indirectly, five other people including himself instead of 25. If we use these ratios, which, as I say, I got from the occupational census and not from sociological writings from other countries, we find, if we assume&#x2014;and that is already a big assumption&#x2014;that the Prime Minister will succeed in creating those 500,000 jobs over the next 50 years, that those 500,000 workers wil be able to support, directly and indirectly, a total Native population of only 2,500,000 and not 12,500,000. And according to all the forecasts of population growth in this country the Native population, 50 years hence, will be over 30,000,000. So those 500,000 jobs will provide a means of livelihood to only 2,500,000 out of a total of 30,000,000.</p>

<p>I would ask the Prime Minister whether he does not now realize that, even if he succeeds in creating all these jobs, his policy as it relates to the Bantu is just as impractical as it relates to the Indians and the Coloureds; that it is equally impossible of being carried out. The Prime Minister suggested, as far as I could understand him, that we on this side of the House should have more of the faith which Winston Churchill showed in the dark days of 1940, that we should not be so much <span class="col_4549-4550" refersTo="page_0849"/>concerned about the practicalities of what can be done and what cannot be done. He said we must show faith. I am pleased that hon. member says that is correct, but I should like to suggest that Winston Churchill did not only win the war because of his indomitable courage and his unshakeable courage but he also won the war because his policies in persecuting the war were based on realities, the realities that if England could hold out long enough the whole world would sooner or later turn against Nazi Germany. I suggest that a better analogy would be Herr Hitler himself. He had the same indomitable courage and the same unshakeable faith which Winston Churchill had but look what happened to him. Why did it happen? It happened because he followed an unreal policy in thinking that Germany could dominate the world on the basis of exclusive racialistic policies. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>It is really tiring to listen to the attacks of the Opposition hour after hour. The argument they raise has been used by them <i>ad nauseam</i> from the commencement of the Session. It was raised in the discussion on the motion of no-confidence; it was repeated during the discussion on the language question, and during the discussion of the Transkei constitution. The Opposition consistently refuses to deal with the crux of the question. They refuse to examine and analyse the substance of the origin of these subversive organizations. They do not do it because they are afraid that if they were to analyse the problem, and then have to attack the Government with the actual finding, they will hopelessly fail in the conflict. The Opposition refuse to come to the reality of the problem. They scratch around in the superficial mud. I should like to refer to the attack of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition on the hon. the Prime Minister. He says that it is the Prime Minister and the Government who have created by their policy the fertile bed for the emergence and growth of the subversive organizations such as the A.N.C., P.A.C. and Poqo. Then the Opposition goes further and says: &#x201C;We can easily undo it. Just let us take over the government, then the desert will be converted into fertile grazing land; then the position will be like after a fine soft rain that soothes the feelings of the farmers in the drought-stricken areas; then the feelings of the subversive leaders and the outside world will be soothed.&#x201D; But surely that is not true. They know it is not true. That makes it so difficult for me to follow their reasoning. They refuse to admit that their statement that our policy is the cause of the rise of subversive organizations is hopelessly wrong. These subversive organizations have their roots much deeper in a greater and mightier organization that has been in existence for centuries in the minds of the Afro-Asiatic peoples of Africa and Asia to liberate themselves from the White man. These organizations are only very thin branches of that mighty tree that has its roots deep within the lives and in the hearts of our own Bantu as well as the Afro-Asiatic peoples of the world. They want to shake off the yoke of the White man for ever and ever. That is the basic cause. The basic cause is not apartheid.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman in the early &#x2019;forties when I was a missionary in Pretoria, I often attended the soap box speeches of the I.C.U., the A.N.C. and the Kotani supporters in the afternoons after my hours of duty. I remember well what one of those inciters had to say at a great gathering in Marabastad. He was referring to the attacks of the police at Vereeniging and said: &#x201C;Look, the police are carrying pistols and revolvers and they have put many of our comrades six feet under the ground. You, my comrades, do not have pistols and revolvers, but you will be taught and we shall see to it that you will know, on the great day of liberation, how to put the police under six feet of earth also.&#x201D; Now I ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition: Was there a National Party in power at that time which with its policy created the fertile seedbed for the rise of those ideas that at that time resulted in the same incitement to murder and homicide? If we come to the truth and to reality, surely we cannot argue so stupidly as to say that this Government has created the seedbed. Who created the fertile seedbed for similar organizations in the Congo and in Kenya when the Mau Mau was in its prime? The Mau Mau committed much crueller crimes than Poqo have committed so far or can hope to perpetrate in the future. Was there a National Government with an apartheid policy that created a fertile bed? To hear such charges over and over again from a responsible Leader of the Opposition makes one fed-up. It is only a smokescreen that is being thrown up. But a smokescreen is thrown up in time of war for various reasons. It is done to hide one for an attack on one&#x2019;s enemy, but it is also thrown up to enable your men to retreat. This smokescreen is a symbol for the future when the public will, during an election, cause this Opposition to disappear in a haze.</p>

<p>The second argument used here is that if the nation were to put the Opposition in power there will be peace in this country. The Opposition says: &#x201C;If we come into power and we apply our policy of race federation (it really is a policy of racial discrimination) there will be a feeling of contentment among the leaders of the subversive organizations: then Luthuli will smile in a friendly manner, he will perhaps be liberated; then Sobukwe and his accessories will return; they will be friendly and be disposed to state that they are completely satisfied with the eight White representatives that will represent the masses of 11,000,000 and more in this Government; then U Thant and other representatives of the UNO countries will come and pay us a goodwill visit, for the U.P. is in power with a wonderful policy, and are giving satisfactory representation and making promises; this country will then be a wonder country; they will come to this country with palm branches symbolizing peace.&#x201D; What pure nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="col_4551-4552" refersTo="page_0850"/>Mr. Chairman, when one analyses the arguments of the Opposition one finds that all of them are hollow and unfounded. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) enlisted the aid of Pieter Lessing yesterday. He says Lessing says we must remove the causes for the existence of subversive organizations, and then they will not be able to continue. But surely these are not organizations that have arisen for economic reasons. They are not organizations that complain about poor housing, inadequate school and hospital facilities, etc. The leaders of these organizations have a different motive. Their motive is a completely plain political one. They want to wipe the White man from the face of Africa. [Time limit]</p>

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, may I avail myself of the second half-hour? I am sure the hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) will forgive me if I do not immediately follow his line of argument. I promise him I shall come back to him in due course.</p>

<p>I feel that we have been making progress with the hon. the Prime Minister in this debate. We have made progress because it is quite clear that in respect of internal security the solution which he offers is police action, greater administrative power, more police action and the advice to the Opposition not to criticize the Government for fear that it may be misunderstood by other people. It is a dictatorial approach. Sir, an approach that has been so evident in the speeches by hon. members opposite. We must not even refer to it if the warnings which we have given in the past have been proved to be correct.</p>

<p>In the field of external security the hon. the Prime Minister has offered us no remedy for the improvement of the present situation. Of course, he has the difficulty that he can offer no remedy because he has failed entirely to establish a moral basis for his treatment of the Cape Coloured people and for his treatment of the Asiatic people, whom, he seems to imply, are very lucky indeed to be allowed to remain in South Africa despite the use he has made of them over the years. He can offer no solution because he cannot get the world to understand the fiction which he believes in respect of the urban Bantu.</p>

<p>There are two other matters which one should raise in connection with external security. The one in respect of Basutoland was raised last night. Perhaps the hon. the Prime Minister will deal with that in due course. There is another one that should be raised and that is the question of our relation-ships with the disintegrating Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. That Federation was in a sense in the past a buffer state. It secured our northern boundaries and our relationships with it were of a very friendly kind. It seems clear that that Federation is disintegrating and the question we have to ask is what the future relationship is going to be. I wonder whether the hon. the Prime Minister is able to tell us whether any approaches have been made, what his plans are and what he believes the future relationships should be with the individual states of that Federation?</p>

<p>There is something else, Sir. Our only railway link with those northern territories at the moment is through a Protectorate which may in due course obtain its independence. Does the hon. the Prime Minister feel that that means of communication will be safe under those circumstances? Has he considered any alternative? What has the Government in view for proper means of communication with those territories in future? I think we all would like to know whether this Government has considered the possibility of defence arrangements with one or other of those states and what it feels the right relationship should be.</p>

<p>There is another point and that is this: The Federation was, without any doubt, one of our best customers in respect of the export of industrial goods from South Africa. We exported to them R97,300,000 worth of goods in 1961 as opposed to a total of R130,600,000 worth of all kinds of goods to the whole of the African continent. We remember, Sir, that before Federation we had a customs union with Northern Rhodesia and a customs agreement with Southern Rhodesia. When Federation came into being there was delay about coming to any agreement because the Minister at the time wanted to know what the economic policy of the Federation was going to be, and as a result there was no customs union, there was no agreement comparable to what we had had in the past, and we finished up with a number of agreements with the Federal Government. What is going to happen if that Government disintegrates? Has that matter been considered? What are the views of the Government in respect of that matter? What steps are being taken to protect the interests of our industrialists in what up to now has been one of our best markets for the export of industrial goods on the African Continent?</p>

<p>There is another matter concerned with external policy and that has to do with South West Africa. I do not propose to raise this issue at this stage for reasons that may be well understandable. There is, however, one matter of shall I say a domestic nature which may improve the image of South Africa&#x2019;s administration of that territory and that is the question of the appointment of a new Adminisstrator to South West Africa. One knows of course that it is within the Government&#x2019;s gift. One remembers that when Dr. Malan as Prime Minister arranged for the closer relationship between South West Africa and the then Union of South Africa, he saw the members of both the Nationalist Party in South West Africa and the United South West African Party and he indicated to them that it was his desire as soon as possible to see as Administrator of South West Africa someone who was of South West origin. So strong was his conviction that he incorporated into the South West African Affairs Amendment Act of 1949 a sub-section in Section 3 of the Act&#x2014;</p>

<p><span class="col_4553-4554" refersTo="page_0851"/>In the appointment of the Administrator of the Territory, the Governor-General shall as far as practical give preference to persons who reside or have resided in the Territory and have special knowledge of the circumstances prevailing therein.</p>

<p>Of course one cannot read the mind of the hon. Prime Minister or of the Government on this issue, but I think it is fair at this stage to ask whether in view of the possible difficulties which are developing, the Government intends to give due consideration to that sub-section of the South West African Affairs Amendment Act for which they were responsible, with the support of the Opposition. I think we should like to know that.</p>

<p>There are certain other questions we want to put to the hon. the Prime Minister, one concerning the economic situation and the effect of the policies of the Government on the economic situation of South Africa. I raised that matter yesterday, but was not able to complete what I wanted to say last night. The point I was coming to was: In view of the now accepted number of unemployed amongst the Bantu population and the acceptance of the fact that we appear to be offering employment for only 42,000 of the 75,000 Bantu becoming available for employment each year, what the policies of the Government are in respect of that situation. I will not labour that point. I think I made that point last night. But I would like to come back to the agricultural position and say that under this Government we have seen a departure from the principles of the Marketing Act. We have seen, so far as we interpret it, a departure from the generally accepted principle of all Governments to try and keep as large a percentage of our population as possible on the land, as large a percentage as could reasonably be expected because of the recognized stabilizing influences of rural employment and rural background. What have we seen so far? We have seen steps taken by this Government which in a sense endanger the future of large sections of that industry because the stability ensured under the Marketing Act has been departed from. We have had statements from both Ministers responsible for the agricultural industry indicating that they stand for the clearing up of small economic units, supported by the hon. the Prime Minister yesterday, and the rehousing of them or the transferring of them to units which are economic, in other words, the consolidation of uneconomic units. Sir. if you consolidate uneconomic units, just as if you consolidate uneconomic farms, somebody gets left out. Who is it going to be. Sir? The hon. member for Cradock or me? Which of us are going to have to move to the town?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I agree that that is a possibility. Has the Government ever told us that that is going to be available for unsuccessful sheep-farmers, unsuccessful foresters who know nothing about that sort of farming? Has the Government ever suggested that it will be available for retired politicians? We would like to know what the policy of the Government is, because irrigation-farming is a specialized form of farming, a type of farming which needs a great deal of training and a great deal of energy and on the whole is not suitable for people who have failed in other forms of farming. And there is something else: Our population is growing, and the Orange River scheme is not going to be available overnight. It is going to take many years before we can settle even our surplus agricultural population at the present time, on that scheme, let alone the natural increase of the farming community in South Africa. As it is we have a feeling that there is a complete slackness amongst members of this Government in looking for new markets for our agricultural products, our surplus products. I have here a publication called <i>Austral News.</i> This is the journal of the Australian Trade Commission. There it tells you how Australia is exporting dairy products and dairy skills to Japan, how it is exporting Australian citrus to Manilla, how the West Indies are buying Friesland cattle from Australia, and so we go on: &#x201C;Food for the world from Australia&#x201D;, telling about the sales of meat and fish, prawns and crayfish (comparing with our South African rock lobster) in the markets of the world. What are we doing to compete? They speak here of markets that most of our people have never heard of. What are we doing to compete with these people? The interesting thing is that they are able to compete with us despite the fact that they use White labour, far more expensive than the labour which we have available on our farms. Is it that we cannot compete? It is that our farmers are so incompetent that they cannot compete in those markets? Or is it that our Government has done nothing to open up those markets for the South African agricultural community? I could go on, but I would like a reply from the hon. the Prime Minister on this issue, as I would like a reply from him again on the arithmetic of his border industries.</p>

<p>I must be very frank, Sir, I do not understand it yet and I believe that that is one of the fundamental difficulties in dealing with the differences between the hon. Prime Minister and ourselves when it comes to non-European policy. You see, Mr. Chairman, the hon. the Prime Minister is trying very hard to discredit the alternative policies which we are offering to <span class="col_4555-4556" refersTo="page_0852"/>South Africa. Sometimes he cannot read them and sometimes when he reads them, he does not understand them, and sometimes he tries to make comparisons between the other states in Africa and the Republic of South Africa which cannot hold water when you look into the facts. And here we had the hon. member for Marico (Mr. Grobler) falling into the same trap. The hon. gentleman has been telling us of his difficulties with the I.C.U. in 1940, I believe. I wonder if he realizes that the A.N.C. was founded in South Africa in 1912 and if he knows that it has been in existence ever since then. Has he ever taken the trouble to go to the Library and read its history? It is a banned book, but he can get it out.</p>

<p>Because it is a different organization in Rhodesia, as he ought to know, under different leadership and following different principles. I believe the hon. member could argue with me about the policies of the various churches, but until he has read the history, I think he should not argue with me about this matter. He is trying to tell us that we suggest that if we came into power, things would change. Of course they would. They could not change just overnight, because when you have created increasing bad feeling over the years, you reach the top of a graph.</p>

<p>It is like the Prime Minister&#x2019;s graph and before you can reverse the process it takes a little time. He suggested that when we would come into power U Thant might visit South Africa on the basis of friendship. U Thant has not visited South Africa, but the last Secretary-General of the UNO did. So what is so surprising about that? Let us get away from that nonsense.

Here we have the greatest chance of any state on the African Continent of maintaining Western civilized standards and maintaining one integral state as opposed to the divisions which are being proposed by the hon.

No other state has ever had this opportunity and it is being thrown away by the &#x201C;vreesbevangenheid&#x201D; (there is no English word for that) of members on that side of the House because they have not got the courage or the confidence or the belief that they can maintain their position or Western standards in such a favourable relationship under any other scheme except complete separation which will dismember our country and ruin our economy. The hon. the Prime Minister, because he was so upset by our proposals apparently, not only had difficulty in reading them&#x2014;in fact he started talking about them before he had read them through, or he would not have made the mistakes he did make.</p>

<p>I believe that the policy which we offer has certain advantages over that which the Prime Minister offers. The first thing is that we stand for responsible citizenship for everybody in South Africa, and we want each person to have a responsibility to the members of his own group in respect of those matters which most intimately concern them. We are not so arrogant as to stand up like the Prime Minister and his party and say that they can dictate the most intimate affairs of every single race group and every person in South Africa. We believe that it would lead to greater harmony if they were allowed to decide those things for themselves, and we believe, therefore, that every man should have rights within his own community and that those rights should be secure from invasion and interference by the other groups.

<p>I believe that the best of the thinking of apartheid is incorporated in the race federation scheme. The only grain of real intelligence in it, the only good ideas in it, are incororated in this scheme. But our difficulties lie here that where the hon. the Prime Minister speaks of consultation between the various groups we have a very shrewd idea of what that consultation is. It is like consultation with the Coloured Council, over half of whom are nominated by the Government, and the other half were elected unopposed because there was so little interest taken in the election. It is like consultation with the Indians who have not even got a council yet. It is like consultation with so many of the Bantu Authorities, the majority of whom according to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own publication &#x201C;Bantu Affairs&#x201D; were nominated and therefore need have no regard to the views of the people whom they are ruling. That was published in <i>Bantu Affairs</i> in respect of the authorities established by the hon. the Prime Minister, and therefore they would not be worried by changes in public opinion, and they can go ahead with Government policy. That is the sort of consultation the Government wants. We do not stand for that sort of consultation. We stand for consultation with representatives of the mass of the people, and we would like to see them elected by the people so that we know they represent their point of view.</p>

<p>No, but the hon. Prime Minister must not be in a hurry again. He does not know where the third phase begins because he has not read the article yet. But there is another advantage that our scheme has over that of the Prime Minister: We keep South Africa as one integral whole. We do not divide it up and dismember it and hand it over to different groups who can combine and can combine with groups outside and destroy the very basis of Western civilization in South Africa, and probably destroy the White race itself if the Prime Minister remains in command of things. But we go further. The schemes we offer are fair to all, because the individual of whatever race will find advancement for himself in the administration of the affairs of his own group.</p>

<p>It has one other advantage. It offers an immediate solution for our most pressing problems. You could start to-morrow releasing racial tensions; you could give people a say not only in advising but in the administration of their own groups. You could give them a sense of belonging and to place them in a position where they know that they are part of the Republic of South Africa; they would want to fight for it and defend it and they would not want to attack it with assistance <span class="col_4559-4560" refersTo="page_0854"/>from outside. We do not have to wait till 1978 or some other miracle date before you reverse the process and start reaping dividends. You reap them now and you can see the effects the moment you put that policy into operation. It gives you an immediate release from racial tension because once you have people participating administratively in the machinery of the government of their own group, they develop a sense of responsibility and they understand what it all entails.</p>

<p>We differ so much from the hon. Prime Minister in that respect. He is prepared to give them a sense of participation in the reserves, but not in the urban areas. And he is not prepared to give the Indians a sense of participation or the Coloured people. The Bantu in the reserves should have a sense of participation according to the Prime Minister. There he recognizes how important it is. There they should carry some responsibility and having some sense of belonging, but in the urban areas, what is the Bantu given? A suggestion that he can help in governing a homeland somewhere else which he probably does not know, has no say in. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>I am anxious to come to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has said, but before doing so I should like to deal briefly with another matter. I should like to call attention to a report that appeared in the <i>Sunday Times</i> this week-end of the findings of the Press Board in connection with complaints made against the <i>Sunday Times</i> by the Chief Secretary of the National Party of the Transvaal. I should like to state the facts very briefly. On the basis of the evidence submitted to it, the Press Board found that the report published by the <i>Sunday Times</i> on what was supposed to have happened at a meeting of the Head Council of the National Party of the Transvaal was untrue. That is one finding But thereafter three findings were given, and two of those really amount to the <i>Sunday Times</i> being excused. It has found that the <i>Sunday Times</i> published the report completely in good faith, because it is supposed to have received it from three National Party members of the House of Assembly from the Transvaal, and that the <i>Sunday Times</i> averred that it usually had obtained reliable information from these people, and therefore had reason to publish the report in that form. This is the result of the findings: that the <i>Sunday Times,</i> which disseminated a false and untrue report, is really presented to the world in a very tactful manner as a newspaper that has made a mistake, but made a mistake because it was misled by three members of the Transvaal Head Council of the National Party. Among the documents submitted to the Press Board, there were 40 affidavits by National Party members of the House of Assembly who are members of the Head Council, and who had attended the meeting, and who stated under oath that they did not furnish the information to the <i>Sunday Times.</i> Unfortunately the 41st member could not be found, and that is why his statement did not appear, but the circumstances will become known in due course.</p>

<p>This matter now having been laid before the Press Board, there was on the one hand the statement of the <i>Sunday Times</i> that it had obtained these data from three members of the House of Assembly who are members of the National Party. On the other hand there was the denial of that statement by the Chief Secretary of the National Party in that he had obtained affidavits from the people who could probably have furnished that information, and submitted those. Those were the two sides to the matter, and the Press Board found that the evidence of the <i>Sunday Times</i> that that information had been furnished to the newspaper by three National Party members of the House of Assembly was true, for the finding reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The <i>Sunday Times</i> was informed by three Nationalist Members of Parliament, separately and independently, that such directive was given.</block>

<p>Now just this: If that was the Board&#x2019;s finding, then it is a terribly strange finding in the light of the evidence to which reference is made in the judgment; a very strange kind of finding. I want to put it very clearly: The <i>Sunday Times</i> says it obtained the information from three sources that had usually been reliable sources of information to it. Now on one occasion those three alleged reliable sources of information, and the three of them individually and separately from one another, decide not only to lie to the <i>Sunday Times</i> but they decide. separately and individually, to tell the <i>Sunday Times</i> the same lie. In the light of that, one certainly would like to know what kind of evidence there was before the Press Board to enable it to convert such a complete impossibility. I do not call it an improbability even, into a probability that was then elevated to a finding. I do not wish to dilate upon that, but I should like to submit that if that is the full information upon which the finding was based, as it appears in this report of the Press Board, then I should like to put this to the Prime Minister: What value should we attach to this judgment of that Board, and to the Press Board as such? I leave it at that.</p>

<p>Yes. The Board is a body established and whose constitution was drafted by the Newspaper Press Union, and the members thereof are appointed by the Newspaper Press Union, and if the hon. member does not know that, it surprises me.</p>

<p>I should like to refer to what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition had to say. He referred to the disintegration of the Federation. It really surprised me that he did not attribute that also to this Government, as so many of those who think as he does do. Many of them have said so already, have they not? That is the whole strategy of the United Party. We are living in a dangerous world. Yesterday they asked why things have changed and become so dangerous for South Africa, but what about America? Was there a communist base 90 miles from America a few years ago? What about France and Britain? We are living in dangerous times, and now the tactics of the United Party are to present these dangers as dangers resulting from the policy of this Government, and then to excuse themselves on that basis from fighting with the Government against those dangers. And then it is not sufficient to refrain from combating these dangers together with us. No, they turn it round and it becomes a reason for them to hamper this Government in its fight against those dangers. The Leader of the Opposition said yesterday that they are not the champions of Poqo, but what have they been doing all these years? They have suggested one thing, and they suggested it again to-day, that if this Government would go, those people would be satisfied and according to Poqo and their kindred spirits it can be done in one way only. In 1960, during the debate on the banning of the P.A.C., the Leader of the Opposition used these words. He said: &#x201C;Iam afraid that if this Government remains in power, irrespective of any powers we may give it, there may be yet another repetition of these incidents.&#x201D;</p>

<p>That is exactly what they are suggesting to these subversive organizations, that the United Party want this Government to be got rid of, and those organizations also desire that, and therefore they have to co-operate. The attitude of the United Party is to give co-operation to those movements to bring about the downfall of this Government. No other interpretation of the attitude of the United Party is possible. The last time I spoke I referred to the attitude of the United Party and the English newspapers in South Africa in 1961 when the communists organized a <i>coup d&#x2019;&#x00E9;tat,</i> and then the hon. member for Yeoville said that the United Party had issued a statement against it, and he said it is untrue that the English Press had participated, but now I challenge him: Bring me the statement issued by the United Party disapproving of Mandela&#x2019;s communist organization, supported by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell).

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have listened to this debate with interest, and as far as I can make out all that has now become absolutely clear is that it is admitted on both sides of the House that South Africa is heading for trouble, and when we on this side expected the Prime Minister to give us some message of hope, to tell us how he and his Government are going to get South Africa out of these difficulties, we saw one attack after the other challenging our policies. Sir, we are not in power; the Prime Minister and his party are in power and they must get us out of the difficulties in which they have landed us. When I got up to speak I heard a remark that now the level of the debate would drop. Let me say that I was surprised that the level of the debate dropped right from the outset to such an extent that when the Leader of the Opposition got up and criticized the Government and suggested that there may be Natives with legitimate grievances, the Prime Minister by implication and other members frankly stated that we were aiding and abetting Poqo because we say that the Bantu also have grievances. I want to ask the Prime Minister this: In 1960 when we had this march on the Houses of Parliament and people were worried about the future of South Africa, a group of very responsible organizations started to work. They were not members of this party alone. It was the Chamber of Commerce, the Handelsinstituut, the Chamber of Mines and various other organizations. They submitted a memorandum to the Prime Minister, and what did they say? They said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are of the view that while agitators and other enemies of the State have fomented unrest, their actions have been aided by the existence of genuine grievances, and among these we would include grievances under the headings of (1) the pass laws; (2) influx control regulations; (3) the liquor laws as applicable to the Bantu population; and (4) the curfew regulations.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I will read the names of the people who signed it. There were Mr. J. G. van der Merwe. President of the Handels-instituut, <span class="col_4563-4564" refersTo="page_0856"/>and Mr. A. J. Visser, the Vice-Chairman, the Economic Affairs Committee of Assacom, for whom Mr. Berry and Mr. Bradlow signed, as well as Mr. Lulofs and Mr. Atkinson, and the representatives of the Steel and Engineering Industries Federation of South Africa and the Chamber of Mines. What did these people suggest? And they said this must be done immediately to relieve the tension that existed. If it was true that tension could be relieved by doing away with those irritants at that time, then the same thing is true to-day. I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he has ever even considered the suggestions submitted to him by very responsible people, some of them Government supporters. In their memorandum they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We examined the subject of the exemption pass previously issued to a Bantu who had been in continuous employment with the same employer for a number of years, and we believe that the issue of these passes had created a loyal middle-class type of Bantu. Exemption passes were abolished under the Native Abolition of Passes and Co-ordination of Documents Act, and the holders thereof issued with reference books&#x2026;. We are firmly of the opinion that the reinstatement of the privileges held by a Bantu with an exemption prior to the introduction of the reference books would contribute considerably to relieving the present tension, and we believe that exemption certificates should be issued more liberally. Such certificates should confer upon the holders complete exemption from all pass laws and influx control regulations.</block>

<p>Were these people aiding and abetting Poqo? Was Mr. van der Merwe aiding Poqo? They went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We suggest that the present holders of the green-covered reference books referred to above should automatically be granted exemption&#x2026;. We also suggest that the Government favourably consider the extension of exemption privileges for males and females to self-employed Bantu, to Bantu of the professional class and to those who have special educational and/or property qualifications.</block>

<p>They made ten recommendations. I do not want to labour it, because the Prime Minister must remember this important document. Does he treat recommendations by so important a group of bodies so lightly that only three years later, when the same suggestions are made, he accuses the persons who make these suggestions of aiding and abetting Poqo? This is a tragic state of affairs. I believe that the police have been doing an excellent job in curbing the activities of Poqo, but now that there is a certain amount of safety, for the moment, the hand of friendship which has been extended continuously from this side of the House when South Africa was in danger is just swept away and they say, &#x201C;We will go it alone.&#x201D; Let the Prime Minister have no illusions about this.</p>

<p>He is heading for bigger trouble than we have had in the past. I am sorry to say so, but that is the position. He himself and the Minister of Foreign Affairs warn South Africa every time they speak of the dangers ahead, and we do not want to add to his difficulties, but I think it is only right and fair that we should expect from the Prime Minister that sense of responsibility that when genuine offers of help are made and advice is offered to him, he should accept it in the same good spirit. I hope that when in future we meet these difficulties there will be a sense of responsibility among the back-benchers of the Nationalist Party, and I hope that the Prime Minister will have the courage to get up and to put those back-benchers in their place when they insult my Leader as he was insulted yesterday afternoon by calling him a Poqo.</p>

When the Prime Minister calls upon the people of South Africa to unite, he must understand that we on this side have a right, and a duty, to bring to the notice of the Government the genuine and legitimate grievances set out in this document, and we shall continue to do so and we shall not allow ourselves to be stampeded into a position where we will just be silent &#x201C;agterryers.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) has taken advantage of one of these rare opportunities to refrain from using extravagant language. We do not say that the Opposition cannot criticize the Government because of specific measures, but what we do object to is their general criticism that it is the fact that the National Party governs the country that is responsible for this opposition on the part of the non-Whites. The well-meaning words of the hon. member for Sea Point were most effectively contradicted by the interjections of the hon. member for Yeoville and others in reply to the hon. member for Innesdale, in which they confirmed that Poqo would grow as long as the National Party Government remained in power. But I leave it at that because they stand condemned out of their own mouths.</p>

<p>Before I really deal with the race federation plan of the Leader of the Opposition, I want to refer just briefly to a question which has been raised previously: Why has this crisis arisen internally and externally? The Leader of the Opposition persists in suggesting that it is primarily due to the actions of this Government. May I remind him that the number of independent African states has increased in the past decade from three to 33. There we <span class="col_4565-4566" refersTo="page_0857"/>have 30 additional reasons for certain international attitudes. Thirty new states have been created, all of which are potential enemies. May I remind him that in October 1956 America intervened in the Suez crisis and humiliated the two leading Western powers before the United Arab Republic and thus provided an incentive for the whole of the Pan-Africanist movement to become aggressive internationally. And may I remind him that at about the same time, with the occupation of Cuba, the communists issued a statement of policy which affects South Africa just as much as the U.S.A. is affected by Cuba. In April 1962 Khrushsev made a statement in which he said the following, according to the <i>Star</i> of 25 April&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are against aggressive wars, but we recognize the lawfulness and even necessity of national liberation wars.</block>

<p>And this is what he said about &#x201C;national liberation wars&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A national liberation war is waged when a nation which is oppressed by the Colonia-lists takes up arms to achieve liberation.</block>

<p>A year ago one of the major powers of the world stated that they would support war action in South Africa. In the light of these incontrovertible facts I say that it not only passes one&#x2019;s comprehension that the Opposition should seek to lay the blame for our present serious problem at the door of the Government but that it borders on unpatriotic conduct.</p>

<p>But I want to deal with the race federation plan of the Leader of the Opposition as he has again propounded it here. He says that there will be three phases &#x201C;which will in practice overlap&#x201D;. I want to put it to the Leader of the Opposition that what he means there is that Phase No. 2, which involves giving the non-Whites representation in this House, will definitely overlap the first phase which involves the undermining of the whole legal structure of the separate co-existence of White and Black in this country. When they come to revise the pass laws and the Suppression of Communism Act they will not hesitate to put the Coloureds back on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, to bring eight Bantu representatives to this House and to give Senators to the Coloureds in the northern provinces. I agree that the various phases of their plan will overlap, because their ardent desire is to go and fetch allies from behind the colour line to strengthen their depleted ranks in this House. When the hon. member says that the purpose of his federation plan is to protect the one group from an invasion of its rights by other groups, that is the meaning of his federation plan, but all that he says specifically in this regard in connection with his conception of federation is that &#x201C;inter-race relations&#x201D; will be a subject for the federal parliament. In other words, the federal parliament consisting of representatives of the Indians, the urbanized Bantu, the rural Bantu and the White man will have to safeguard the interests of the various groups, and what guarantee is that? Any invasion of rights will in fact be initiated by the federal parliament, but the hon. member advances that as the aim of his federation plan. The Leader of the Opposition states that his statement of policy sets out the details of his race federation. May I ask him for a few details? On what basis are the various races going to be represented in his federal parliament? Will the geographical element also be introduced; will the reserves also be represented as geographical units? On what basis will the franchise be exercised, and on what basis will the delimitation of constituencies take place? Will it still be on the basis of the number of White voters? No, now he sits there laughing. He tried to safeguard himself in advance against questions of this kind so that he would not become bogged down in detail. The essence of this plan is its details, and in the absence of details there is simply no plan.</p>

<p>I want to make this charge: This federation plan consists of two phases which, as he says, will overlap, and these two phases consist firstly of repealing the laws which regulate the pattern of the separate co-existence of the races in the country. Those laws will be gone into and altered in an unspecified way, and, secondly, the non-Whites will be given representation in this House in a specified way. That is as far as the plan goes. The rest is just a vague picture, because if the hon. the Leader of the Opposition wants to escape this charge of vagueness he will have to tell us how the provincial system fits in with his idea of separate group government for the various racial groups. Are they going to throw overboard the provincial system? How are the country&#x2019;s finances going to be divided between these various groups? Is every group, irrespective of where it lives geographically, going to to tax itself and have a little Treasury of its own? What is going to be the position with regard to the Public Service? Will there be duplication; will there be four Public Services? The fact that they refuse to face these questions proves that they are not in earnest in putting forward their solution. No person would submit to the nation and seek to implement such a far-reaching constitutional plan without giving the details of that plan. That is why I say that this plan nut forward by the Leader of the Opposition is nothing more than his old traditional plan, which amounts to this that the United Party wishes to share the parliamentary control of South Africa with the non-Whites in a way which is specified in this plan of theirs, because they believe that by dividing the control in that way they will get sufficient allies to put this side of the House in permanent bondage. That is their sole aim with this plan.</p>

<p>As far as the policy of this Government is concerned and the problems that we have to cope with, there is not a single member on the Government side who underestimates the <span class="col_4567-4568" refersTo="page_0858"/>situation in which we find ourselves to-day and which is characterized by the fact that international hostility takes shape through local rebelliousness and local opposition. What in the normal course of world history could only have led to an international war is converted, according to the modern recipe, into internal rebelliousness. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>It comes strange from a member of the Government to talk of detail in regard to the United Party&#x2019;s racial policy, a member who belongs to a party which does not know whether he will have a commonwealth or a confederation, a member of a party which stands for the creation of seven separate states and yet is not prepared to tell South Africa what the boundaries of those states are, a party which is prepared to carve up the country in which we live and which has been built up over 300 years, to cut it up into separate states without having a clue as to what the boundaries of those states will be. I want to say publicly that when I asked the Minister of Bantu Administration for permission to photograph the Bantu areas of Natal, he said that the information would be misleading because there was no map in existence showing the exact boundaries of the Bantu areas in Natal, and that they therefore advised me to wait because the information which their records could give me would tend to be confusing and misleading. In other words, this Government, which is about to create a separate Zulu state, is not able to allow one of the Members of Parliament to see and to photograph the boundaries of the state they are going to create. But that member talks about details and vagueness, the same member who talks about a confederation when he does not know whether his party stands for a confederation or a commonwealth, a member whose Minister does not know what parts of South Africa will become separate states, and whose Prime Minister talks blithely of 500,000 jobs in border industries.

This is not &#x201C;Sap-propaganda&#x201D;; this is the Minister of Information, who states that it will cost R12,000,000 to place 900 Bantu in employment in border areas. That is R13,000 per worker, of R6,000,000,000 to put these 500,000 into employment. And this is the party which talks about detail and knowing where it goes. This is the party which issued a pamphlet when the U.P. published a Bantustan map saying, &#x201C;Die V.P. dink hy het ons uitoorl&#x00EA;.&#x201D; And that member talks of detail!

<p>It moves forward along the road of ordered advance. But I am glad that the hon. member over there interjected &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D;. I would have expected the member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) to take a word out of a speech and present it to this House out of context, but not the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister took the word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; and deliberately left out the words which were tied to it, i.e. &#x201C;where it is necessary for orderly government and the protection of backward people&#x201D;. He left out those words deliberately when he used the word &#x201C;discrimination&#x201D; and tried to build a case on it. I say again that where discrimination is necessary for orderly government and the protection of backward people, a responsible government should be prepared to face the necessity of discrimination for maintaining a civilized government. This Prime Minister and this Government are to have no discrimination. I want to place that on record. That must apply then to the Coloured and the Asiatic. Either they stand as a party of discrimination in Coloured and Asiatic policy or there is no discrimination. But the United Party policy is perfectly clear. The United Party bases its policy upon four principles. It moves forward from the immediate position to its ultimate goal of a race federation, and only persons who are either unable or unwilling to face the realities of South African life, are not able to follow that policy. There is another group of people who may not understand it, a group of people whose object in life is to try so to confuse simple facts and simple issues so that they can mislead other people into not understanding our policy. We in the United Party have a policy which offers a solution which can work because it is based upon the facts of South African life; it is based upon the realities of events and facts as they exist, not as we would like them to be. We do not look to some Utopian future and say, &#x201C;that is what we would like South Africa to be like&#x201D;; we say. &#x201C;this is how South Africa is, a country with different race groups living within the boundaries of one common state&#x201D;, and it is therefore our task for the future of this country to create a pattern in which those different race groups can live together in harmony. It is no use our saying, as the Nationalist Government want to do, that these people are going to live in separate states when in fact they live amongst them. It is no use saying as the Liberal and Progressive Parties wish to do that these people are going to be civilized and therefore we do not need any discrimination or differentiation. You have to face the facts of the existence of different race groups within the borders of one state, and no matter what boundaries you are going to draw, no matter <span class="col_4569-4570" refersTo="page_0859"/>what states you are going to create, you are left with the cold, hard facts of the existence of different races living in the same area. Even if you create your Bantu states you are left with your Coloured and Asiatic population living amongst the White people of South Africa&#x2014;a fact to which you cannot close your eyes and from which you cannot escape; and therefore the United Party policy is based upon that fact as it exists Sir, if you face that fact, then two things make our policy practicable as opposed to any other policy in South Africa. The first is the ratio of population which my Leader gave to this House a few minutes ago; I will not repeat it. The second is that in South Africa and in no other African state the majority of the Bantu people are directly concerned in the economy of the White man, dependent upon the wages which the White man pays and the direction which his skills give him.

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) has now come along with the wisdom that he and his party no longer stand for discrimination. It is only discrimination when they wish to uplift the underdeveloped sections. If they want to eliminate discrimination and if, as he says, they want to find a solution for the problem of the four races living together, and if they seek that solution in the direction of one multi-racial nation &#x2026;</p>

<p>No, the hon. member over there must give me an opportunity now to make my speech. Not he but his party seeks the solution in one multi-racial nation, according to statements made repeatedly by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;one multi-racial nation. I should like to see what happens to that single multi-racial nation, that solution of theirs, in which it is proposed to dissolve these four elements. Which element is going to rise to the surface, which element is going to sink to the bottom and which element is going to disappear in that process? That is precisely what it amounts to. Sir. that brings me to their misrepresentation of the policy of the Government and of the Prime Minister. The hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) has advanced the same argument on previous occasions that we have now departed from the policy of the National Party as it was adumbrated in the days of Dr. Malan because we have allegedly accepted total territorial apartheid as our policy while Dr. Malan allegedly stated in this House in 1950 that that policy was impracticable. that it was not the policy of the National Party. I want to repeat here to-day that that is not the policy of the National Party and I want to repeat what I said on a previous occasion, and that is that under the policy of the National Party it will always still be possible for future generations to introduce total territorial apartheid if the opportunity presents itself and if the circumstances justify it. That is still the position to-day. But hon. members over there do not understand the meaning of the term &#x201C;total territorial apartheid&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. member does not like us to discuss their policy, or their lack of policy, in respect of the Indians. Hon. members opposite say that as far as Indian representation is concerned they are going to consult the Indian leaders with regard to their political representation in this country and in this House. What does that statement mean? They know as well as anybody who has a certain amount of knowledge of the political history of this country what the attitude of the Indians is. In 1946 they also gave the Indians representation in this House through four Whites, and what was the result? The Indians cast that concession, that proposed franchise, back into their teeth with contempt. They simply did not want it, and that is why the United Party Government never promulgated the Act. and thanks to the National Party that Act simply lapsed. Sir, what do the Indians want? On 24 July 1961, 134 Indian <span class="col_4571-4572" refersTo="page_0860"/>political, educational, religious and ratepayers&#x2019; organizations held a conference in Natal, and there they adopted the following resolution&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of the United Party and of the Progressive Party with regard to the franchise for non-Whites was entirely rejected yesterday by the Indian Conference on the municipal franchise. A resolution demanding &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; was unanimously passed.</block>

<p>Hon. members opposite now want to consult the Indian leaders, and, note well, they are not going to consult the Indian leaders who are in favour of separate development, because according to them those people are the &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; of the National Party. They will only consult the extremists amongst the Coloured groups. Let me put this to them: What is their reaction going to be if those leaders of the Indian community whom they wish to consult say, &#x201C;We demand &#x2018;one man one vote&#x2019; because you are giving it to the Coloureds; you are going to place the Coloureds on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll: under your race federation policy you are going to give the Coloureds the right to be represented by Coloureds in this House; we as Indians are not underdeveloped; we have an ancient culture behind us; we are a developed nation; why should we be treated worse than the Coloureds?&#x201D; The United Party want to implement this policy of theirs in order to win back friends abroad whom we have allegedly lost. They are not willing to tackle this question of the Indian franchise because they are afraid of the hon. members for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) and Durban (Point) If they were to apply this policy in respect of the Indians, according to the direction in which they are now moving, then those hon. members would walk out of their party and come and sit on this side. I can only say that they would be welcome. The hon. member for South Coast would be welcome because I know that in his heart of hearts he does not approve either of this mixed society, this multiracial nation that they propose to establish.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also adopts the attitude that the growth of Poqo and of these other subversive organizations is due to the Government&#x2019;s policy. Is he not aware of the fact that the reason for the growth and for the origin of these organizations is something entirely different? Does he not know that the reasons are precisely the same as those which apply in other countries of Africa where there are Whites? Is the Opposition not aware of the fact that these organizations in South Africa are beginning to realize that they have little time left and that if they want to achieve their purpose they have to act very quickly, because as the National Party&#x2019;s policy of separate development is implemented more and more in this country, there are more and more people, not only amongst the Whites and amongst United Party members, but also amongst the Bantu and the Coloureds and the Indians, who accept the National Party&#x2019;s policy of separate development as the best for everybody in this country, and as one which is in their own interest too?

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I can only deduce from the last speaker&#x2019;s speech that not only will all the Bantu but also in time all Coloured and Indians be removed from the White area of South Africa. It seems to me that he is announcing some form of subtractive theory by which the removal of one man will bring about a decrease in employment of five others as well. But, Sir, I want to refer to what the hon. the Prime Minister said yesterday, after consultation with a sociologist whom he said was not Japanese. He gave us two lectures on his version of the multiplier theory in Bantustan, through which he said one worker in primary and secondary industry would put to work five others in tertiary industry. I can understand why the hon. gentleman did not refer to a Japanese expert because the latest figures that I have here in regard to Japan indicate that for every three workers in productive industry there is only one service worker put to work. In other words, according to the figures which I am prepared to hand to the hon. the Prime Minister, the ratio in Japan under this multiplier theory is at the rate of one to one-third and not, as the hon. gentleman suggested, 1 to 5. I am sure that after making his researches into this multiplier theory, the hon. the Prime Minister will be pleased to know that inquiries have also been going on elsewhere. I hate to bring Professor Northcote Parkinson into the debate, but I think I should tell the House that that gentleman has been making investigations of his own and according to the report he has found an expert in bureaucracy. The report goes on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A German scientist has worked it out that an administrative body of a thousand people generates enough work within itself to keep itself fully occupied without any outside stimulus. In fact, it is so busy looking after itself that it cannot do anything else.</block>

<p>The writer then says that he does not quite know how this scientist arrived at the figure of 1,000, just as we do not know how the hon. the Prime Minister arrives at his figure of 100,000. The report then goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But he gives 1,000 as the critical figure at which the chain reaction takes over. At that point the department becomes self-actuating, like a nuclear pile and all you have to do is to watch through a peephole and see the individual atoms inside passing memos to one another and writing reports on one another&#x2019;s work.</block>

<p>It seems to me that if the hon. Prime Minister extends his investigations and gets this expert to give him advice, he will find that merely by bolstering up a civil service in Bantustans, he will be able to produce enough work without any trouble and without going in for any development of border industries.</p>

<p><span class="col_4573-4574" refersTo="page_0861"/>Sir, having listened to speeches from this side of the House, I am reminded of the words of Andr&#x00E9; Gide who said: &#x201C;Everything has been said already, but because no one listens we must always begin again.&#x201D; It is with that observation in mind that I enter into the debate under this Vote. Although everything has already been said as to the destiny of South Africa under the r&#x00E9;gime of this Government nevertheless for the reason which Gide gives it is necessary to dwell once again on some of the dangers inherent in the Government&#x2019;s racial ideology. The Prime Minister is reported to have said only last week that he has received a good many messages of goodwill for his Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy from individuals in all parts of South Africa. One accepts that without any further substantiation, but I ask myself as I ask this House is that really good enough? You see, having looked at the South African scene from abroad, as I did some eight months ago, I say quite emphatically to the hon. the Prime Minister and to this House that commendations of that kind are just not good enough, whatever purpose they may be intended to serve. The hon. gentleman will know perfectly well that praise comes lightly to those who are in power. What South Africa needs most at present is not personal goodwill, however comforting that may be in the present state of tension in internal affairs and also in external affairs. What South Africa wants to-day is goodwill from amongst the comity of nations such as South Africa could count upon only 15 years ago. Fifteen years ago goodwill was shown from the comity of nations, but under this Government that goodwill has been dissipated, and Government spokesmen now talk about a cold war and about how the cold war is going to become intensified. The hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs gives a desperate cry of &#x201C;unite the Whites, regardless&#x201D;. Regardless of what? I say regardless of the fact that this Government is presenting this country with a policy which is a myth and not a reality and that the Government itself and its supporters are living in a fool&#x2019;s paradise. My hon. friend, the member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) made the point exceedingly well just now. But I also say that while that cry of &#x201C;unite the Whites, regardless&#x201D; is being made, the world will recognize the cry for what it really is. It will be seen as an open invitation to the rest of the community to unite itself against the Whites. I hope the hon. the Prime Minister will dissipate that suggestion as being in the mind of the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he gives this cry of &#x201C;unite the Whites&#x201D;. Sir, it is futile for the hon. the Prime Minister to seek reasons outside South Africa as to why there has been this deterioration in our international relations over the past 15 years. Admittedly one accepts that the difficulties elsewhere in Africa, in Angola and in the Rhodesias, may accentuate the problem here, but the fact is that the origin of the problem is a local one. And the origin of the problem in South Africa, of course, is the actions of this Government under this Prime Minister which have now finally created for South Africa two critical situations (a) explosive race relations internally and (b) frightening isolation externally. In the months that lie ahead there is the added dangers that these two critical situations may become inter-related in some way or other, probably through UNO or probably through the International Court of Justice. Sir, the <i>London Observer</i> has posed this question to its readers: What happens when the major Western nations find themselves isolated over the South African question at UNO? This paper, having regard to the 67 to 16 vote at UNO on the question of sanctions in November 1962, with 23 abstentions and four absentees suggested an answer in these terms &#x2026; [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to deal briefly with the arguments of the hon. member for Point (Mr. Raw), and I want to say that in regard to colour and race relations we are to-day practically standing on quite a new planet. A change has come about right throughout the world in regard to colour and race relations and we must take note of it; we must react to it, and any political party worth its salt must take note of it. I just briefly want to sketch the position on the Continent of Africa, of which we form part. In 1939 there were only three independent states on the Continent of Africa, two of which were self-governing, viz. Ethiopia and Egypt, which had a non-White Government, and South Africa, in the south, with a White Government. Just during the last few years&#x2014;I think since 1960&#x2014;more than two dozen of these states have become independent. In addition we have the fact that we are dealing here not only with the liberation of political colonies. This process went much deeper. We are faced also with a change of attitude in regard to the dignity of other races. Let me put it this way: We cannot assume that the White man will remain the master simply because he has a white skin. That old master and servant relationship is a thing of the past; it can no longer be accepted automatically, and every political party to-day must take cognizance of this because it is in this pattern that all political thinking is done to-day. I want to allege that the reaction and the reply of the United Party to this proposition is completely sterile. I want to prove it by means of two statements only.</p>

<p>To me there are two propositions which are true in this regard, the first being that the desire for freedom is basic to the Bantu. The Bantu would have had this desire for freedom even if he had had a white skin. It is the same desire one saw on the part of the Jew who did not want to be subordinate to the Egyptian, or the Hollander who did not want to be subordinate to the Frenchman, or the Frenchman to the Englishman. This is a basic urge one finds on the part of the Black man and we must bear it in mind. At the present time the United Party says that it will be able in this pattern, within the borders of the same fatherland, to entrench the position of the Whites, who are in the minority, <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> a large Black majority in terms of a paper formula.</p>

<p><span class="col_4575-4576" refersTo="page_0862"/>That is simply unrealistic; it cannot be done. How can 3,000,000 people in the long run continue to govern 12,000,0000 Black people? For this situation the Government, in my opinion, has the only correct solution, the only arguable answer, namely the creation of a separate freedom for the Black man on the one hand to fulfil this basic urge he has, and on the other hand a separate freedom for the White man. In my opinion that is the only alternative, but in that pattern the United Party propagates a policy in this country of an undivided South Africa. And what is the result of it? The result is that in the minds of the Black politicians in this country the impression is created that they can bargain. It creates the idea in the mind of the Black man that he must not seek his freedom in his own traditional homeland where he can give expression to it, but that he should strive to attain his ideals within the borders of the homeland of the White man and that he should aim at governing the whole country. If one sets out from the standpoint that the freedom of the White man cannot be taken away from him without bloodshed, then I say that this is a dangerous and unrealistic policy.</p>

<p>I want to state a second proposition, which I think in our whole political argument to-day is axiomatic. One cannot get away from the fact that in the long run a White minority Government cannot continue to govern a large Black majority. That is something we cannot get past. The United Party sees an opportunity, in terms of the formula they propagate in South Africa, which is a false formula, to escape from this dilemma. I say that this formula is not worth the paper it is written on. Therefore, with reference to the remarks of the hon. member for Point, I want to say that the pattern for the future of South Africa, as seen by the United Party, is really sterile because it cannot cope with our difficulties. The only alternative for escaping from this dilemma is, as I have indicated, the policy of the National Party. This policy aims at a separate freedom for the White man on the one hand and a separate freedom for the Black man on the other. In the long run we cannot control this basic urge of the Black man within the White man&#x2019;s country. We just cannot do it. In 1917 already General Smuts said in a speech he made at Oxford: &#x201C;You cannot put a barrier to the development of a nation.&#x201D; That is so. We cannot for a moment think that we can continue in this country along the old pattern. We are living in different times. We must meet the demands of the present time. We are living at a time when the United Party and the Nationalists can no longer fight each other in the same way that they did in the past. We are living in different times and we must meet the difficulties by means of new and progressive thinking.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) for the calm manner in which he has approached this subject. It is quite true that South Africa was a Union. The history of South Africa is a story of how through &#x201C;storm en drang&#x201D; the people of this country achieved Union in one South African country. We now have this new policy according to which we are going through the shadow of the Valley of Death to destroy what we have built up. We joined four colonies into one Union and decided to build on that. As the hon. member for Moorreesburg has said they were thinking ahead in 1917. We are now embarking upon the Bantustan policy and no one can see the end of it. That is the story of South Africa. The hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s policy is to break down that which has been built up by earlier generations.</p>

<p>I wish to raise with the Prime Minister a subject which I introduced by way of a private member&#x2019;s motion last session. My motion read that in the opinion of this House Cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers should not hold directorships of public or private companies excepting when those companies are philanthropic companies or small family companies for the administration of family estates or assets belonging to some family trust. That was not the first time that this subject had been broached in Parliament. It was broached at an earlier stage by the Minister of Finance when he was in Opposition. He raised the matter with the Prime Minister of those days, General Smuts, and he chose an occasion similar to this occasion that I am choosing to-day. He chose the occasion of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote. When the hon. the Minister of Finance raised the subject at that time General Smuts said that he agreed with him that the time had come for a change in policy. That was the stage they had reached in those days. The whole question of directorships held by Cabinet Ministers and Deputy Ministers was raised pertinently two years ago by that committee which sat to discuss the emoluments of Members of Parliament and Cabinet Ministers. Hon. members will remember the report of those Three Wise Men under the chairmanship of Hon. Justice Ogilvie Thompson. In that report they made certain recommendations which were received, I think, readily, even eagerly, by members of this House. There was one paragraph which relates to the Prime Minister himself because it is he who decides policy in this country. I want to quote this paragraph; it is paragraph 46&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is stated that a Cabinet Minister is even busier during the recess than he is during the session. However that may be, it is clear that being a Cabinet Minister is in a literal sense a full-time occupation which should be remunerated with due regard to that fact. In this connection we would point out that the traditional exception to the general rule prohibiting Cabinet Ministers from serving on the directorates of companies made in favour of directorships on the boards of mutual insurance companies and of newspaper companies would not appear to rest upon any secure logical foundation and that there moreover appears to be a tendency to <span class="col_4577-4578" refersTo="page_0863"/>enlarge the scope of the exception. We are of the opinion that this whole question merits revision and that in any event it would be a salutory practice if the rule in question were always strictly interpreted.</block>

<p>That was the question which confronted the hon. the Prime Minister. I have no doubt that he has ruminated on it and I think the time has arrived on this occasion for him to state what his policy is.</p>

<p>When I raised the matter last year the hon. the Minister of Justice took part in the debate and I assume that he spoke on behalf of the Prime Minister himself. The Minister of Justice on that occasion seemed to think that there was a veiled attack on the Prime Minister and members of the Cabinet. That was not the case. There was no intention to impugn the honour of any Minister. It was a question of what system the Prime Minister was prepared to accept. I think the only contribution the Minister of Justice made to that debate was to give us a misquotation from Alexander Pope. He seemed to think that we were afraid to attack. There was no intention of attacking. What we were doing was to try to obtain a statement of policy on this very important question because this is a question which every democratic country in the world has considered over many years. There is an old convention in South Africa that a Cabinet Minister can become a director of a newspaper company or a mutual insurance company, as is stated in this report. That might have been true 40 or 50 years ago, even 30 years ago, but the whole situation has changed. To-day newspaper companies have become great publishing companies and our mutual insurance companies have become large investment companies, either directly or through their subsidiaries. Reference was made to one subsidiary company in the discussion last year, a subsidiary of a mutual insurance company, which had a capital framework of over R100,000,000. That is big money; that is the big class.</p>

<p>We come to the case of the publishing companies and I want to refer to a publishing company of which the hon. the Prime Minister is the chairman and certain members of the Cabinet are directors. I want to quote from Volkshandel which I think is a reliable source. They have this to say in writing about &#x201C;Afrikaanse persreus Die grootste Afrikaanse persmaatskappy in die land, met &#x2019;n omset van tussen R9,000,000 en R 10,000,000 per jaar, het werklikheid geword 26 jaar na die stigting van die <i>Vaderland,</i> &#x2019;n dagblad, en 15 jaar na <i>Dagbreek</i> se eerste Sondag-uitgawe.</p>

<p>They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Die Afrikaans Pers (1962) is die eienaars van die grootste Afrikaanse dagblad en Sondag-blad, die grootste werklikse tydskrif en die grootste Afrikaanse vroue-blad. Die Afrikaanse boekhandel sal die grootste Afrikaanse onderneming van sy soort in die land wees.</block>

<p>I am going to give the names of the directors. As I have said the hon. the Prime Minister is chairman, three Ministers of the Cabinet and the Administrator of the Transvaal, who is the Administrator of a province which is the biggest buyer of school books in South Africa, are directors. [Interjections.] I am dealing with a very serious subject. The point I want to make is this: Has the time not arrived for the hon. the Prime Minister to say to the country that where a Cabinet Minister is a director of one of these publishing companies, there is a possibility&#x2014;I do not say it always exists&#x2014; of a conflict of interests; a conflict between his interests as a member of the Cabinet and his duty to the shareholders of the company of which he is a director.

<p>I hope the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) will forgive me if I do not follow him. I want to react to what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) said this afternoon. The hon. member said that the ratio according to which a person maintains his dependants in Japan is three to one and that this is in direct conflict with what the hon. the Prime Minister said. The hon. member knows as well as we do that there are many other relevant factors in connection with this matter. In South Africa we have the highest savings in the world: it is 30 per cent of our national income. Has he ascertained what the savings in Japan are? Has he ascertained how many Japanese work and how many do not? As the result of the larger number of workers there are greater savings. Because that is the position in Natal, he cannot generalize and say that the statement of the Prime Minister is wrong. It is quite wrong to do so. In America the savings are 14.7 per cent and in Britain 14.8 per cent. If he studies the statistics of those countries he will see that there is quite a different state of affairs there.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one other point before I come back to the Leader of the Opposition, namely this argument in regard to the border industries. The United Party is continually saying that the Government does not want to allow White capital to develop the Bantu <span class="col_4579-4580" refersTo="page_0864"/>homelands.

It makes no difference whether that factory is inside the Bantu homeland or next to it. The Opposition knows that they do not have an argument. The hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) is himself very interested in the border industries, but when he goes overseas he says he agrees that border industries are a good thing, but for political purposes he opposes it. I want the hon. member to deny that he did so. Does he deny it? Because there are people who would like to know what your reply will be.</p>

<p>I want to come back to the Leader of the Opposition. On 4 June 1959 he made a speech in Pretoria. According to the <i>Transvaler,</i> he said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;The United Party rejects equality and if the party wants it, it will have to elect another leader.&#x201D; Sir de Villiers Graaff, Leader of the United Party, stated to-night amidst applause. He was speaking on the occasion of a United Party carnival held in the City Hall.</block>

<p>I now allege that the United Party has accepted equality together with their race federation. I want to ask the Leader of the Opposition whether he will keep his word and resign as leader of that party. He said last night that the Prime Minister should resign. Now I want to ask him whether he will resign, or must we accept that he is not being consistent? I hope the Leader of the Opposition will react to this and tell us whether he is going to resign or not. Those were his words and I expect him to act honourably and to resign. The race federation policy definitely amounts to equality. Here I have one of the first pamphlets issued by the hon. member for Yeoville on 3 December 1961. The photograph appearing here is not that of General Smuts but of Mr. Marais Steyn. I should like to quote the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This will require that the ultimate power for the foreseeable future will remain in the hands of the White group, not because they are White but because they are in fact, as a group, the vehicle of our civilization and the guardians of the Western standards.</block>

<p>Here he says very clearly that it will be only for the foreseeable future, and we know they cannot see very far into the future. They agree that the Whites should be ousted by the non-Whites. They have already told us what laws they will repeal, like the Immorality Act. The hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) did her utmost to try to get the Immorality Act repealed. To think that a South African woman, and a mother, wants to do that! I would have thought that she should have protected the women of South Africa. The United Party supported it. They have already told us that they would repeal the Group Areas Act and job reservation, etc. They want to repeal all those Acts. Is that not equality? They want mixed universities, and if that is not equality I should like to know what it is. Therefore I say I hope the Leader of the Opposition will tell us what his standpoint is now and whether he will resign.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>It is a very common practice on that side of the House of making their own assumptions and stating them as though they were facts and calling this side of the House to book for facts which do not really exist. I may say that the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais) did try to put up a reasoned case for what he believed. I want to suggest to the new and inexperienced member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) that he will be well advised to learn a lesson from his colleague and to try to discuss a serious matter seriously in this House if he wishes to make any valuable contribution to a debate.</p>

<p>It so often happens that when we have a debate in this House in which the hon. the Prime Minister takes a leading part that he whisks us all away into his particular land of make-believe and he creates an aura which makes it rather difficult to discuss matters of practical economic importance because, when you do, you have the feeling all the time that while this suicidal racial policy of the Government is still in operation, it is almost futile to discuss the future development of the country.</p>

<p>There is one point I would like to take up with the hon. the Prime Minister and that is the question of the Orange River scheme. I raised the matter in the Budget debate but in his reply the hon. the Minister of Finance made no reference to it. The hon. the Minister of Water Affairs was present during the debate but he did not react or come into the debate at all. I notice that, in reply to a question on <span class="col_4581-4582" refersTo="page_0865"/>this subject this afternoon, he made the remark that the report from the Department had been fully discussed in this House. But he is wrong; I do not think it has been fully discussed in this House. I do not see how it could have been fully discussed as nobody has really had the time to study it thoroughly and to come to any conclusions last session. I want to suggest to the hon. the Prime Minister that we are dealing here with a major question of national policy and for once it is a matter of national importance which is non-contentious. There is no difference of opinion in this House as to the desirability of embarking upon this scheme to develop the Orange River. The implementation of that policy is, of course, the responsibility ultimately of the Prime Minister himself.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the hon. members as a whole have done much more than pay lip service to the idea of developing this Orange River scheme. When you come to think of it, what we are proposing to do is to create a new economy in a large and important part of the Republic. It is not just a question of building a dam. It is a scheme which is going to involve agriculture, industry, transport, perhaps mining, town-planning, health services and so on and so forth. In other words, what is really envisaged, as I see it, is the creation of a new little world with all its facets and aspects of human activity. The only information we have on the subject is the report which was laid on the Table last year. A further study of the report makes it perfectly clear that, whilst the report is an admirable one as far as it goes, the conception of the whole thing is quite clearly not a departmental matter. The report which, as the hon. the Prime Minister knows, talks about a tentative expenditure of R300,000,000&#x2014;and when the Government talks about &#x201C;tentative&#x201D; we know what that means. It says that the supervision and the construction work would be in the hands of the Department of Water Affairs under whose energetic inspiration it is going to take 30 years to develop this scheme. The first question I want to ask the Prime Minister is why 30 years? If it is to be a good scheme to benefit the country surely it is not necessary to say at the outset that, with an expenditure of R300,000,000, it is going to take 30 years to complete the scheme. The report also says that on completion of the scheme the control and the maintenance will be in the hands of the Department of Water Affairs. I want to put it to the hon. the Prime Minister that the whole conception is far too big for any Government Department to hope to tackle properly. It seems to me that we are in danger of embarking on a big scheme in a small way. We on this side of the House believe that if we want to approach this scheme properly, if we want to make sure that it is developed on the broadest possible lines and with the greatest speed and efficiency, we should create a separate authority, an authority directed by the best brains in the world, wherever they may be. There are other schemes in the world which have been successfully introduced. Surely their experience can be useful to us. The separate authority should be the executive body for developing the whole scheme. I have no doubt that this new authority will be appointed by the Government; but that a separate authority should be appointed to take charge of the scheme, I have not the slightest doubt about that.</p>

<p>The question of parliamentary control has been raised. This side of the House frequently talks about the necessity of parliamentary control. Where we are suggesting the creation of a separate authority like this, will it be subject to parliamentary control? I am quite sure that if we put our heads together it will not be difficult to devise a way whereby that authority would be in proper contact with Parliament so that Parliament will have a proper opportunity to study its Budget proposals and of receiving reports from it as to how the work is progressing. I do not envisage the possibility of adverse criticism. But after all if Parliament is going to vote R4,000,000 or R5,000,000 or R6,000,000 next year for this scheme, it is quite essential that there should be a link-up between Parliament and this authority. I hope the hon. the Prime Minister will be able to indicate to the Committee that he has given serious consideration to this matter and that he agrees with us in principle that there must be a proper basis of administration if this great scheme is going to be brought to fruition successfully and is not to be subject to intolerable delays which it certainly will be if it is left to be run by one Government Department.</p>

<speech by="#grobler">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GROBLER</person>:</from>

<p>Before I reply to the statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition when he tried to refute my argument, I wish to refer to the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore), a former teacher of mine, who expressed the feat that the present Government was destroying everything which was built up over 300 years, was destroying everything which was achieved in 1910 by the bringing together of the four provinces. I want to tell the hon. member that he need not worry, that we are trying to do the opposite. Bearing in mind the fate of the White man in Africa, we are forced, with our eyes open, to adopt an inevitable attitude. Having seriously studied the racial position and the race relations in our country we want to try to retain something of what our fore-fathers had built up over the years for the White man in Southern Africa and in our fatherland. We want to act according to the demands made by the circumstances prevailing in the era in which we are living. We want to judge the position as it is at the moment and not as the politicians of former years saw it.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also told me to read a little more about the origin of the A.N.C. and the activities of Kadali and Kotani. He alleges that in the days when they were active that organization was <span class="col_4583-4584" refersTo="page_0866"/>much less dangerous than it is to-day; that they really never constituted a threat but now that the National Party is in power it has developed into a dangerous organization. I suggest to the hon. member that that is a wrong approach; that it is wrong to argue that way because the actions and the origin of the subversive organizations which have blossomed forth and which have blossomed forth to an increasing extent in recent years, coincide with what is happening in the whole of Africa. There has been a change in the attitude of the Whites in the Western World towards the colour question which surprises me. There has been an intensification of the aspirations of Bantu nationalism in Africa. The fact that it manifests itself more strongly in our country coincides with that, and coincides incidentally with the period when we are in power. It has nothing to do with the fact that <i>we</i> are governing at the moment. If the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party had been in power there would have been similar action.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also alleges that the A.N.C. in the Federation, in the Rhodesias and generally beyond our borders is of a totally different character, has a completely different norm, that its objectives and aspirations are totally different from those in South Africa. I want to put it to him that that too is a completely wrong approach and that the expressions of opinion and statements of many Bantu leaders, of many leaders of nationalist organizations outside, are practically literally word for word the same as those inside our borders. If a Banda in Rhodesia says in a statement that if the God of the White man does not help them to free themselves of the White man he shall appeal to the spirits of the forefathers of the Bantu and that if he does not live to see the Black man free he will fight the White man from Hell and we compare these and other statements with those of Leballo, those of Sobukwe and other leaders of subversive organizations in our country, we find that they are noticeably similar. Their object and aspirations are the same.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition further alleged that the fact that I had said that they alleged that when they came into power there would be a particularly friendly relationship between the leaders of the subversive organizations and the leaders of the Blacks in general and their Government as well as a friendly relationship with the Afro-Asiatic bloc and the Western countries had led me to ask whether those countries would then pay friendly visits here. He says there will be nothing wrong with that because we invited Hammerskjoeld to come here and what will be wrong with it if they invited U Thant. I wish to say that Hammerskjoeld did not come here as a result of a change in the attitude towards South Africa on the part of UNO, but he came here in order to investigate the position and to see how we applied our colour policy and we cherished the hope that he would perhaps have made a favourable report to South Africa at the other end in respect of the real state of affairs as far as our policy towards the non-Whites was concerned.</p>

<p>I now come to the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) who said that the reasons why there were subversive organizations should be removed. I could not dispose of that matter in my previous speech. The hon. member maintains that if the causes are removed such subversive organizations will not flourish and that we will not have any trouble with them. I then said that if they were economic reasons like the reasons which you get in connection with trade unions and employees&#x2019; organizations who complain about salary scales, housing or other social circumstances with which they are dissatisfied, it was possible to remove the causes and to give satisfaction but that where you were dealing with a political organization, like Poqo, like the A.N.C. and others who have a purely political objective, inspired by a desire to dominate, to be master in Africa of the Black man over the White man, it was no use talking about removing the causes because it would be fatal to the White man to remove the real causes. I am sometimes curious to know whether the Opposition is perhaps in liaison and consults with those leaders. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said a moment ago that they were strongly in favour of consultation. I wonder whether they have already been assured by those leaders that they will be satisfied with the race federation plan of the Opposition. If they do consult I should like to know with whom they have consulted. Is it Luthuli or Sebukwe or is there another category of Bantu leaders with whom they have a liaison to-day and who have given them the assurance that if the Opposition came into power and their system of government was applied, the Bantu would be satisfied. Have they been assured that there will then no longer be any racial friction, that there will be racial peace and that, as far as the future is concerned, there will no longer be any clashes? They must tell us whether they are in liaison with such leaders and who they are or how they have otherwise received those assurances.</p>

<p>I do not intend to go back to the Poqo and the other illegal movements. I want to deal with something else under the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Vote, because the Prime Minister as the main architect of the Bantustan policy is the man who must take the full responsibility for the carrying out of this policy. Sir, the difficulty we are faced with here is, and in fact in the whole of Africa, is how to find a way of living together in a multiracial state. The hon. the Prime Minister has adopted the policy of the other colonial powers in Africa by trying to wipe out the problem altogether. They do not try and solve it. They dispose of it by disposing of colonies. Britain, France and Belgium, I submit, have done exactly the same as this Prime Minister <span class="col_4585-4586" refersTo="page_0867"/>is doing now, with this difference that he has not got the colonies to dispose of, but he creates the colonies and then he gets rid of them, and he hopes that by creating colonies, or homelands for the Africans, enticing them back into those territories, that by doing what Britain has done and France has done, by giving independence, he will rid himself of the Bantu problem, the African problem. Now, Sir, the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration has told us before that we handled the position out here much more efficiently than did Britain and the other colonial powers, and that we did it by consultation in a very short period; he pointed out that Britain had consulted for years and had still not come to a final conclusion. but he was proud of the fact that in less than a year his Government had consulted the Bantu in the Transkei and had come to an agreement I want to point out to the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration and to the Prime Minister that why Britain has had to consult for years in Rhodesia and Kenya is because she was trying to get agreement between the White people and the Africans, and they have not succeeded yet in Rhodesia and that is why there is no solution.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>In favour of Britain must be said that the British Government did consult with the White people and it did try and get the Africans and the White people to agree. But what has happened in South Africa? The White people are not consulted at all on the establishment of the separate Bantustans and granting them independence, and I want to tell the hon. Minister of the Interior that when the Prime Minister was asked why he had not consulted the White people, his reply to me in this House was that it was not his duty to consult with the White people in the Transkei, but if the Bantu Recess Committee chose to consult the White people in the Transkei they could do so. The British Government certainly has not done that to the White people in Kenya or in Rhodesia. It has consulted them at all times. Sir, this policy of handing over territories in an endeavour to rid yourself of a problem, which has been adopted by the colonial powers and which I say has not been adopted by the Prime Minister, has its dangers, as everybody will admit. But I submit that the British Government and the French Government and the Belgian Government were in a much better position to hand over independence to these states than is our Government. After all those governments were thousands of miles away from the boundaries of these independent Black states which they were establishing, whereas under the policy of this Prime Minister we in South Africa are going to have these independent Black states forming our boundaries. Secondly, the British Government and the Belgian Government were not faced with this problem that the majority of the people living in their countries would in fact be citizens of foreign independent states, and that is a prospect which faces us here in South Africa. They were not faced with the problem that not only now but for ever, so far as we can see, the majority of the population in their countries would be citizens of these foreign states. The hon. the Prime Minister in East London resented the accusation that he was doing a Kenya on South Africa. He denied it and said that the people in Kenya, the Whites in Kenya, were despondent because their properties had depreciated in value, and they did not know whether the British Government would carry out its promise of compensation. Now if they did get a promise of compensation&#x2014;I take it from the remarks of the hon. the Prime Minister that there must have been some promise&#x2014;they at any rate had a promise, whereas the Whites in South Africa who are going to be affected by this policy, not only in the Transkei but everywhere, have had no promise at all. The hon. the Prime Minister appointed a commission to go into the position of the White people in the Transkei and they had to report to him. We tried to stop the passage of a Bill through this House in regard to the Transkei in an endeavour to get that report because we felt it would only be right that the members of this House should know what that commission recommended. After all what was the object of appointing that commission if we are not to hear its recommendations? I say that the Prime Minister and this Nationalist Government and every member of the Nationalist Party must take responsibility for this. They have betrayed the interests of the White people living in these reserved areas It is no good the hon. Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration telling the White people that they will look after them. How will they look after them? The only reply they have had to their request from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Bantu Administration is, in a letter to the Liaison Committee that those Whites living in the reserves will be foreigners in that country, and like all foreigners living in a country they would have to abide by the laws of that country. Do hon. members and their constituents realize that this Government which stands for the protection of the interests of the White man, which discriminates on the ground of colour at every possible turn, is putting White people living in the Transkei under a Black Government?</p>

<p>That hon. member does not know what is in the Bill.

Not only is this Government betraying White people living in the reserves but it is also betraying all the moderate Africans living in the reserves, and it is betraying the moderate Africans living outside the reserves who are now going to fall <span class="col_4587-4588" refersTo="page_0868"/>under the provisions of the Transkeian Bill, and they are doing exactly what Welensky has accused the British Government of doing in Rhodesia. They have great joy in quoting what Welensky said about the British Government, but I say that everything that Welensky said about the British Government, the White people will say about this Government. I am certain the hon. the Prime Minister will get up now again and will say that the Whites in the Transkei will not have to worry, that he will look after them. We do not want him just to make promises of looking after them. I want him to realize this, as well as that grinning Minister of Information, that the property of the Whites in the Transkei has already depreciated, and I say again that we do not want to be looked after at the end, we want to be looked after now. We demand, the White people demand that this Government tells the country now what it is going to do for the White people living in the Transkei and those in the other reserves who are going to be affected by the Bantustan policy.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I intend to deal in succession with various points raised by hon. members which are more or less factual points; I do not want to follow the last hon. member in his strong exhibition of feeling, which I can partially understand, but which I know is also partially simulated. May I say that as far as the Transkei is concerned, it is not true to say that we are creating colonies in order to get rid of them. What can be said in truth is that long ago these areas were fully and solely controlled by the Bantu. If in the cause of morality as the world of to-day sees it, on which hon. members opposite are always basing their case, it has come to pass that people require that nations should be allowed to rule the countries which are theirs by right of inheritance, then we who always persisted in keeping these areas as Bantu areas must follow that moral outlook with regard to those areas if we wish to find ourselves in accord with this world-wide tendency, and to that extent that is possible.</p>

<p>In this particular case we are dealing with an area which during our period of history was always Bantu-occupied, which was settled by the Bantu, which in the course of time was ruled by the Bantu, which was placed under European rule in the course of only the last 100 to 150 years, in which the White Governments from stage to stage gave certain systems of self-control, and which, as far as this Government is concerned, has from the outset been declared to be an area in which self-government will lead to a State of their own, if and when they are capable of ruling it wisely. Nobody was under any illusion. No White people within that area could be under any illusion. Since this Government came into power, and in spite of the opposition of those supporting the other side, including very many of these White people in the Transkei who are still persisting to-day in the same political attack upon this Government and its policy that they made at that stage, we have done what we said right along would be our policy. In this we differ from what Great Britain has done. In the particular case of Kenya, that was mentioned here, new settlers were led to believe that the policy which was followed by the British Government when they were induced to settle would be continued.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to deal with all the matters that have been raised before sitting down and my time is limited. This matter has been dealt with over and over again in public and in this House and I am only repeating briefly that we are following the policy there which we said from the beginning would be our policy.</p>

<p>It was said that the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration stated that Britain had to consult for years over the granting of a constitution to various areas, whereas we came to an agreement in a short time, and the point was that the reason was that we did not consult with the White people. But surely that is not true. These White people are part of our electorate. They are represented in Parliament. They are represented by the very gentleman who made the attack, and the way in which the views of the White people in that area could be taken into consideration, and the way in which their attitude could be put before the Government, including their grievances and their worries, has been followed by the hon. gentleman himself time and time again. Representations were already made directly to me when I was Minister of Native Affairs. We know what their problems are. It is not correct when the hon. member says that there has been no consultation or that we had no knowledge of the problems of those people. Their position is very clear to us, But what the hon. gentleman wants us to do is not to follow the policy in which we believe, but to always do their policy, namely a policy dictated by the United Party of which a great number of them are members. That simply cannot happen. The difference between us and hon. members opposite is perfectly clear. It was also said that it was to Britain&#x2019;s credit that her Government did consult the White people and that that caused all the time-lag. But there is <span class="col_4589-4590" refersTo="page_0869"/>a great difference in the situation between these two countries. It must not be forgotten that we are retaining all the White people as our citizens and electorate, whether in the White portions of the Transkei, like Umtata and the various White spots, or the traders within the Bantu area. We are retaining all of them as citizens and as part of the electorate of this Parliament of the Republic of South Africa. So there is a very great difference. They continue to be under the protection of this Government and to have a say, through whomever they vote for, in this Parliament. They have the fullest opportunity to continue to put their difficulties before this Parliament as these might develop from time to time.</p>

<p>No, I began to say they are part of a minority party whose policy if it became the government, would bring the whole of South Africa under black rule ultimately. The situation is now that a certain number of people object who have businessundertakings within a clearly delineated Black area, occupied mainly by Black people, and who found their business prospects good enough to remain there and who throughout all the years in which they knew what the policy of this side was, continued to remain there, and successfully operated there, and who, as far as we can see, can still serve those people very much in the same way as they always did, for a long time to come. Those people now object to coming partially under Black rule, although they remain part of this electorate, and although certain assurances have been given, of which the hon. gentlemen is very well aware. They want to dictate to us to what we should do in that area, even if that should endanger the whole White population of South Africa and bring all of us under ultimate Black rule under the policy of the United Party. If we have to choose, let us consider the following. If these worries are so terrible for these people, if it is such a disaster for them to be under Black rule to a very limited extent as far as they are concerned while retaining full participation in the Government of the White man&#x2019;s country, very closely adjacent to them, and where their whole future can be rebuilt if need be, if that is so very terrible, how much more terrible would it be for them to find the whole of South Africa under Black rule? Therefore I say that no injustice is done to these people. They remain under very much the same type of circumstances which they chose, or under which, by inheritance of their businesses they have been living all these years. They are not in very parlous circumstances now. but if they had their way by voting for the United Party to bring the whole of South Africa under the policy which the Opposition dares to indulge in, then I say that I could not do for them what I can do now. We have in any case to consider first and foremost the feelings and the prosperity of the future of the large White population which lives in White South Africa. That is precisely what we are doing.</p>

<p>It was also said that in Kenya and elsewhere there was a promise of compensation by Great Britian which, if not fulfilled, was at least a promise. I do not believe in making promises and not fulfilling them. Any promise that I make I seek to fulfil. In this particular case we are having the real problems investigated by a committee which has not as yet presented a report. I am not in possession of any report. When that report is received, I have no doubt that it will be made public. That report does not affect the present Transkeian Constitution. The Transkeian Constitution is consistent with the announced policy throughout the years of this Government. The report on the other hand has to deal with any results flowing from the application of that policy and as such stands outside the deliberation in this Parliament on the constitutional issue but it is something which will be seriously taken into consideration when deciding what is the just thing to do for those who may be affected by a development which is in the interest of the country as a whole. More than that I need not say.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>My time is too limited, and unfortunately I cannot give way. I must try and deal with the other points as well. I repeat that therefore I do not look upon what we are doing as a betrayal of the white people in the Transkei. What we are doing is done in the interest of all the White people of South Africa, including the White people in the Transkei, whom I would not leave in the lurch, but who would be accepted by the whole country and who, when they can no longer as a result of policy make a livelihood in that territory, must be the burden of the country as a whole. But this fact should not be accepted as an opportunity for a dodge by people whose businesses might be going bunkrupt of their own accord&#x2014;if there are such&#x2014;misuse cannot be made of announcement. That is why this committee has to go into the matter very carefully. We cannot abuse the money paid by the taxpayers but at the same time those who really suffer should have their burden alleviated by the rest of the taxpayers of South Africa whose interests are also involved.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) asked me about the Orange River Scheme and I agree with him that this scheme is much more than the construction of dams or the creation of an electricity supply. It is a very great undertaking which will recreate in the course of the next few years much of the southern portion of the Republic. It is something which must affect the whole life of the country, socially, industrially and agriculturally. <span class="col_4591-4592" refersTo="page_0870"/>It may put South Africa on the map in many ways. It may lead to the increase of our White population, and so it must have effects far beyond those resulting from the mere building of dams. While agreeing with him to that extent, I cannot agree that the Department of Water Affairs, with all the experience it has gained in the building of the best of our irrigation dams, is not capable of being the supreme supervisory authority over the construction work as far as the dam-building and canal-building are concerned. Consequently the Department of Water Affairs, which may and will make use of consulting engineers of both South Africa and international standing, should remain in control of the construction. In connection with the supply of electricity throughout the whole of the southern portion of the Republic at least, we have in Escom an organization of such experience and with so many links already in existence which can be utilized, that there is no doubt whatever as to the extent to which use can be made of the organization. But when we look at the further effects of the whole scheme and think in terms of all that has to be done to make the scheme successful, it is clear that already during the building period we have to add to the usefulness of these two big and experienced South African organizations, and the Government will do so, but not through the creation of a separate authority. The creation of a separate authority means handing over one of the biggest undertakings, which will involve the Government and the country in great decisions and financial expenditure. The scheme cannot be handed over to a separate authority not responsible to the public. Far less can it be handed over to a separate authority which would be partially an international authority, as was suggested by the hon. member for Constantia, through the inclusion of foreigners. It is however quite clear to me that the Government as a whole must take responsibility and that its various departments will have to be properly utilized and coordinated. We can create, under the control of the Government, an interdepartmental deal with much more than the mere construction of the dam. Therefore it is the intention of the Government to take fully into consideration the bigger issues involved, but at the same time not to set aside the valuable services of the Department of Water Affairs, which is the Department mainly involved at present since we are still mostly concerned in preparing for the construction stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) raised the point as to what the policy of the Government is with regard to Ministers remaining, as has always been customary, directors of mutual insurance organizations and certain Press organizations. I believe that we can retain that custom and it is the policy of the Government to allow it to continue. In spite of the recommendations of the committee mentioned. It is not so much a matter of income or directors&#x2019; fees, nor of much time being involved. What is of importance is that through the mutual organizations members of the public, including Ministers, can serve other people well. In so far as the Press organizations are concerned, we who have built up those organizations through which it was possible to defeat the United Party Government of the past and to show the people of South Africa what the correct policy is as far as we could see it, will certainly not relinquish the degree of control which we have over the Press which we built up ourselves.</p>

<p>What about trading concerns?</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member knows that this does not mean that we are in any way corrupt. No such accusations have ever been made, and the hon. member also clearly said that he did not make that accusation. But should any form of corruption take place, I would set my face against it as strongly as anyone opposite. Generally, however, directors do not interfere in the daily running of these various organizations. As far as <i>Dagbreek</i> is concerned, I am chairman of the holding and controlling company, but I am not a member of the directorates running the various companies themselves. In that sense, therefore, it is possible for me to have a say and in fact with others a controlling voice in the policy, but that is the extent to which I can exercise control and I intend retaining it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) raised a point with which I wish to deal briefly. He said that as the result of our policies we have both internal difficulties and external problems. I have already dealt with that, but I wish to add this. What will happen under any alternative set of conditions? Here again I must repeat what I myself have said so often, and also other hon. members on this side. What is the test for what will happen if the alternative policy is put into operation? Can one rightly suggest that, if the United Party&#x2019;s federation policy were implemented, with the insistence on the White man retaining supremacy&#x2014;because the word &#x201C;leadership&#x201D; really means supremacy, and supremacy is only another word for &#x201C;baasskap&#x201D; so what they seek is to retain White supremacy although they have all kinds of dodges by which they describe how they believe they can retain White supremacy&#x2014;the reactions of Luthuli or Tambo or Sebukwe would be less antagonistic once that main objective is clearly understood? Whether the hon. members can succeed in attaining their objective, whether they will not be defeated in their object, is arguable. Personally, I am quite convinced that once they have slipped so far as to establish a multi-racial Government, they will lose control wholly. However, in the course of the process of trying to force them out of that position of supremacy which they seek to retain, these Bantu leaders will create much more internal difficulty than now. A United Party government will not be able to control or guide political developments as we do to-day where the Government is clearly giving the Bantu people their rights in their own areas and is clearly <span class="col_4593-4594" refersTo="page_0871"/>delineating the line between their rights and ours. Where we are not a minority seeking majority rights, but insist on being the rulers in areas which are ours, the position is unequivocal. The same is true where they are the rulers in the areas where they must enjoy their rights. It is clear that under this policy, whatever troubles there may be, those troubles must be less than they would be in terms of the policy of the United Party, where a minority wishes to rule a country which it says belongs to all alike.</p>

<p>To what extent can anyone honestly believe that the external troubles will be less when it becomes clearly understood that the policy of the United Party is one accepting a multi-racial Government but claiming all future supremacy rights for the Whites and granting only a very limited degree of the White representation to the Bantu? Will the outside world or the Afro-Asian nations accept that various Bantu communities can be formed, even self-governing communities, both in the White areas and in the Black areas, without them having direct Black representation in Parliament? Even if it is only intended to be the case during a phase (whether it is an overlapping phase or not) how can anyone believe that the world will be satisfied with that? Can we imagine the Afro-Asians saying: &#x201C;This is at least something. After all, it is very nice for the Bantu to have eight White representatives in a Central Parliament to represent the 10 million Bantu and we are glad the White men retain control, very kind White men who will repeal certain repressive laws although they retain others&#x201D;? Can one imagine for a single moment UNO, and therefore also those friendly Western nations who follow the lead of the non-White nations accepting such a policy as satisfactory to their demands. Our external troubles will sooner increase then, because there will be a less clear objective. They will expect such a multi-racial government to give way just a little more continuously. and if such a Cabinet were to resist it would all the more lose its support since no sacrifice of principle is then at stake. It will be said: But you have granted the principle of multi-racialism, how can you refuse the increasing demands of these partners? That will especially be so if their definition of civilized people, or of whom should get the vote, were to be different from that of the public of South Africa consulted at a referendum. Therefore it is quite clear to me that the internal and external difficulties will not be decreased if such a change to a race federation government were to be made. Testing it by this alternative shows that the country is right in retaining this Government.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) asked whether I took any notice of a certain report drawn up by a number of industrialists after Sharpeville. I have told this House before, after it happened, that even while I was in hospital for well-known reasons I met these gentlemen and discussed their report with them. I think the Chairman was Dr. Busschau. We went through the report, and I showed them how certain of their arguments were wrong, being based on wrong information. The hon. member specially mentioned the exemption pass. Now, the exemption pass of the past was not a full exemption from all regulations or permits controlling the Bantu; it was an exemption from all but four matters. When we introduced the reference book, what we did in fact do was to replace the extensive pass control by control only over these four matters. In other words, the reference book actually was a universal exemption pass for the Bantu. (Laughter.) That is a fact which anyone can check. I have stated it here before and it has never yet been denied after proper analysis. But I did agree on two points. The one was that there were problems arising from the liqour control measures, and the other was that the police force had in the course of time made too much use of the reference book system in connection with their search for criminals. Consequently I said&#x2014;and it has been done&#x2014;that both with regard to the liquor measures and the way in which, to my mind, the reference book system had been used wrongly, great changes would have to be introduced. They have been introduced, and we have succeeded in thereby creating much satisfaction amongst the Bantu. In other words, I did not ignore this report. That was however something quite different from the form of justification which was given in this debate to something far worse than a sudden, unorganized uprising resulting from certain grievances, whether justified or not. We are now dealing with a group of murderers organized for political purposes to attack people, and when one seeks to justify that type of action one is on different ground altogether.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Innesdale (Mr. J. A. Marais has asked me a question in connection with the finding of the Press Board. I want to state perfectly clearly that I myself have come across no newspaper which has published so many blatant untruths in its news columns from time to time with regard to matters in which I have been involved and of which I have first-hand knowledge therefore, as the <i>Sunday Times.</i> The <i>Sunday Times</i> has frequently published front-page reports, <i>inter alia</i> in the past year, about matters allegedly dealt with by me at ordinary meetings, such as the caucus of this Party in Parliament, or at meetings of the Executive Committee of the National Party in the Transvaal, reports which were entirely untrue either because I had not said at all what I was alleged to have stated or because in one case I was not even present at the meeting. Nevertheless there was a &#x201C;full report&#x201D; about everything that I had allegedly said! That is why I say that the <i>Sunday Times</i> is not a paper which I think the public of South Africa can read with any confidence that they are not perhaps reading something which the <i>Sunday Times</i> itself concocted in some way or other, instead of a genuine news report. I must say candidly that I do not believe either that it spoke the truth in this particular case when it claimed that it had received information from three National Party members of Parliament, <span class="col_4595-4596" refersTo="page_0872"/>independently of one another, about something which had not happened at all. I do not believe for a single moment that that is true. It is so impossible. I do not know what happened at the meeting of the Press Board and what induced them to arrive at their finding. I should very much like to see the minutes of the meeting of the Press Board, and I hope that they will be available because this hearing can be regarded as equivalent to the proceedings in a public court. I hope therefore that it will be possible to make its minutes available. In other words, I should like to see whether it is stated in those minutes that the <i>Sunday Times</i> revealed the names of the three persons who allegedly gave it this information; I should also very much like to know whether the Press Board called those three persons as witnesses to make sure that the <i>Sunday Times</i> was speaking the truth. Because I personally am convinced that if the Press Board did not do this and merely had the word of the <i>Sunday Times</i> for it, a paper which had published a blatant untruth in a particular case of which the Press Board knew, then the Press Board was not entitled to come to this conclusion and to announce that the allegation of the <i>Sunday Times</i> was true that there were three tell-tales among its National Party M.P.s who had given it this information. In the absence of further proof, the Press Board was in no position to say to the public that the <i>Sunday Times</i> had published an erroneous report but that the Press Board found it understandable because the poor <i>Sunday Times</i> had been misinformed by disloyal, untruthful tell-tales who have carried views to the opposing Party. I say that the Press Board was only entitled to make this finding if it had evidence as to who these three people were and had satisfied itself that they had in fact done this. But if the Press Board did not have this information, I say that it was not entitled to make this finding, and in that event I condemn that finding. What does the Press Board go on to say in that finding? It suggests that there must have been three National Party members of Parliament who were both tell-tales and liars. Everybody is under suspicion now although of the 41 who were present, 40 declared on oath that they had done no such thing. The forty-first was the hon. member for Lichtenburg (Mr. M. C. van Niekerk) who could not be reached when the members were approached to give evidence and who was therefore not able to make a sworn affidavit but who himself came forward later on to say that he was prepared to make a similar sworn affidavit at any time because he had made no such statement and wished to testify that the report was untrue. In other words, all 41 who were present have testified on oath that the report was not true. If it is insinuated that there are others apart from those who were present who made this untrue statement to the <i>Sunday Times</i> on hearsay, then I want to say that all the other members of the Transvaal are also prepared to declare on oath that that is not the position. In one portion of the latest report about the finding of the Press Board the <i>Sunday Times</i> spoke about &#x201C;Parliamentarians&#x201D;, which also includes Senators, but in its heading it referred to M.P.s, so the accusation was directed against members of the House of Assembly only. My contention is that the <i>Sunday Times,</i> which published this untrue report about something which did not happen at all. has now been placed in the position by the finding of the Press Board that it has to lay the blame for its guilt in deliberately misleading the public on three unnamed persons although in doing so it impliedly makes a scandalous accusation against an entire section of this Parliament. I cannot express my disapproval of that conduct strongly enough and I hope that when I get the minutes of the Press Board I will find that the Press Board did try to acquaint itself with the facts by examining the alleged sources. I shall be bitterly disappointed if I find that it did not take the trouble to obtain confirmation and nevertheless allowed this charge to stand against so many honourable persons. Confidence in the Press Board will then be shocked so seriously that I doubt whether anyone will consider it worthwhile in the future to submit a case to it again.</p>

<p>The Leader of the Opposition asked me certain questions, to which I wish to reply. The one was put last night and Basutoland was mentioned specially to-day, but last night it was put in a broader form. I was asked what we hope to attain through our negotiations with the High Commission Territories, and whether I make, as he did, a distinction between the granting of asylum to political refugees and the granting of asylum to people who clearly seek to organize revolution from those areas. I do not wish to go into too great detail in regard to these negotiations. I believe that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will within a reasonably short time be able to make an announcement as to how far these negotiations have proceeded in regard to the documents which will be needed for people entering Basutoland or Swaziland or Bechuanaland and the Republic. I also believe that the negotiations with regard to certain other matters have not developed far enough, e.g. in connection with customs facilities, to allow us to go into any great detail to-day. Therefore I will leave this to be dealt with under the Votes of the Ministers concerned. But I will say this, speaking for the Government, that I think it will be very bad for South Africa and the United Kingdom and the Territories should the distinction on which the Leader of the Opposition laid so much stress not be recognized by the British Government, or in the event of a Basutoland Government coming into being, by such a Government. There is in fact a very clear difference between ordinary political refugees who seek asylum elsewhere and who, as is customary throughout the world, are granted asylum, usually on the condition that they immediately cease their activities and do not embarrass the Government which grants them asvlum, and others who do not cease their activities. If political refugees can enter so closely adjacent an area as the High Commission Territories, which to a great extent <span class="col_4597-4598" refersTo="page_0873"/>depend on the economy of South Africa for their very existence, and need easy entry but, though disturbers of the peace and order in the Republic are allowed to continue political activities from there, or still worse, if they are allowed to organize revolution against the security of this State upon which those Territories depend to such an extent, it must necessarily worsen relations between this Republic and that country or its guardian as long as Britain still remains in charge. Therefore I sincerely hope that this will not be the case. At present I do not want to talk about countermeasures, because I can scarcely envisage a friendly country adopting such an antagonistic attitude. Therefore I would rather not develop this theme further.</p>

<p>I was also asked in regard to South West Africa about the appointment of an Administrator. The Government has not yet discussed in any way the appointment of an Administrator and I do not think it would be correct of me in any way to indicate either the principles on which such an Administrator is to be appointed, or to make any suggestion as to where he should come from, from the Republic or from South West itself. It is a matter which we will go into very carefully. The main test will be what will be in the interests of both the Republic and South West Africa, taking into consideration the present situation internationally as well as the relations between these two territories.</p>

<p>The Act is well-known to us, but as the hon. gentleman opposite knows, Dr. Malan in making his appointments took the Act into consideration but nevertheless decided as he did. So did a subsequent Prime Minister. Therefore while naturally also taking this Act into consideration I shall have to look at all angles of the problem and cannot be led by the Act alone.</p>

<p>I was also asked to make clear our position with regard to the Federation. It was said that the Federation of Central Africa used to be a buffer state. That, of course, is quite true. It is quite true too that we cannot view all the developments there with equanimity. Naturally the disintegration of the Federation is causing us very deep distress, just as it is causing deep distress to the people concerned in those territories. However, I should prefer not to comment on what is happening to the extent of discussing Britain&#x2019;s policy. That is the domestic concern of the Federation itself. I have followed the principle throughout to retain the best relations between the Republic of South Africa and the Federation in spite of the fact that the policy of the Federation was one of partnership. It was closely akin to the policy of the United Party, a policy which I foresaw from the beginning would develop in this unhappy direction.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I am most surprised at this retreat. After all, continually when our policy was attacked hon. members opposite pointed northwards, and from time to time we had to emphasize that we did not believe that such multi-racial government or partnership could succeed, but that we did not want to interfere in their domestic affairs and therefore did not wish to debate the matter at any great length. I made no bones in private conversations about my belief as to what was going to happen, but the attitude adopted by the Government towards the Government of the Federation was that what happened there was their business, and that just as we did not want others to interfere in our domestic affairs, we would not interfere with the domestic affairs of the Central African Federation. We wished to be on the best possible terms of neighbourliness, whatever our divergent policies. Throughout these years therefore, in spite of these great differences of policy, to which in fact they referred more specifically in public than we did, we maintained that attitude. Even when they were attacked and accused of following our policy and strongly denied that they were doing so, we never made any similar remarks in retaliation. I always sought to avoid comment on what I regarded as their business and their business alone in order to be able to retain their friendship.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Does the hon. the Prime Minister recall the statement he made at the time of the election in Southern Rhodesia about a possible closer relationship being out of the question if they followed a certain policy?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from><span class="col_4599-4600" refersTo="page_0874"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, naturally. That was no criticism of their internal policy. The question was deliberately put to me whether Southern Rhodesia or any part of the Federation, but more particularly Southern Rhodesia, could become a sixth or a fifth province of the Republic of South Africa. I had no reply to that and I said that it could not; that I did not want to interfere in their policies, since that was their own business, but that it was best to state clearly that unification could not become practical politics. Since Southern Rhodesia was a multiracial state it would in such an event have to become a multi-racial province, and in a multi-racial province representation in the Central Parliament would have to be given and the electorate have to be taken over as it is. It would be a multi-racial representation and electorate in direct contrast with the policy of this country. For that reason Southern Rhodesia could not become part of the Republic. But what I did add was that when consultative relationships developed between the Republic of South Africa and any other state, whether Black or mixed or White, in Southern Africa, then naturally we would be only too pleased to be able to co-operate with Southern Rhodesia as well, but it would be for her to decide. I repeat that to-day. If in the future Southern Rhodesia should become an independent state whether governed by a multi-racial Government as now or for that matter by a White or a Black Government, then co-operation as between sovereign independent states would be welcomed whether in some form of organized economic inter-dependence according to the example of the Eu opean Common Market or whether for common political interests taking the Commonwealth as an example Whatever the consultative set-up might be, for economic or political purposes, it could not consist of any arrangement having a Central Government. That was out of the question according to our policy. On such a consultative basis between independent equals we would not only be prepared to retain existing links of friendship but we would eagerly seek further mutual advantages of such co-operation. I could say the same as far as the other portions of the Federation are concerned; I could even say the same with regard to any of the High Commission Territories when they become independent. It will depend upon them. If they desire good, friendly relations as between neighbours, we will always be available.</p>

<p>The question was raised whether trouble to maintain communications might arise because of the fact that there is a railroad to the Federation passing through one of the High Commission Territories. I do not wish to anticipate that we will experience trouble with that particular High Commission Territory&#x2014;I sincerely hope not. Indeed I hope that there will not be trouble even if there should be a Black Government there. I sometimes wonder whether perhaps our troubles are not greater while Britain remains the guardian, because by taking into consideration her international interests, she may perhaps act differently from the course that would be followed by a local government which has only to take its more restricted interests into consideration. A Black government in, say, Basutoland, however much its members might disagree with our policies, might in its own peoples&#x2019; interests and in the interests of the economic relationships which it wishes to retain with South Africa, find it very valuable to forget about the other differences and say: &#x201C;That is their own business.&#x201D; It might try to create harmonious relationships in the economic interests of its population, whereas Great Britain would not have to think in terms of the interests of Basutoland alone but would in handling Basutoland affairs consider the effect on her relations with all the Afro-Asian States on her position at UNO and on her contacts with the United States of America. Therefore I sometimes wonder whether the metropolitan states&#x2019; wider interests may not make it more difficult rather than less difficult to create harmonious relations between neighbour states or communities in Southern Africa who escape the fact that they cannot help each other. As far as the railway link is concerned, I hope therefore that that will not become one of our mutual problems, but should difficulties arise then it will be less our problem than one that Southern Rhodesia would have to solve. If Southern Rhodesia seeks further railway links with South Africa, then that would be something that we would surely consider favourably. We would consider the question of assisting her in creating such links. But this is not for us to decide because we have railway lines up to our boundaries and what happens beyond those boundaries is not primarily our business but theirs. All I can say is therefore that from our side there would be great sympathy in giving aid if such aid were sought.</p>

<p>What about the question of extra markets for our industrial products?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I said a moment ago that as far as industrial relationships were concerned, we would be very pleased, knowing that there is economic interdependence between us and that we have common interests, to retain those interests whether the Government is Black or White and whether Northern Rhodesia or Southern Rhodesia is concerned. But retaining economic co-operation is mainly in their hands rather than in ours. I do not believe that. I should enlarge upon that matter much further.</p>

<p>*The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has again referred to our economic policy and our agricultural policy but I think he will have ample time to discuss the agricultural policy under the Vote of the Ministers of Agriculture. At this stage I just want to repeat what I said yesterday, namely, that we are giving very serious attention, that we have given it continually, <span class="col_4601-4602" refersTo="page_0875"/>and given it in the correct way, I think, to proper agricultural development in South Africa.</p>

<p>I rather want to deal with the other problems which he raised yesterady. He alledged, <i>inter alia,</i> that there was a bottle neck in our economic development. I want to draw the attention of the House to that because it is important that the House should know that since 1948 I have made the question of the economic development of South Africa the subject matter of a special report which I asked my economic adviser to submit to me. On the strength of a proper study he had to submit to me an objective exposition as to what development had taken place and to what extent the development was being influenced by Government policy. My object was not to get a report which only painted the bright side of the picture. As is expected from scientists. I want to get a precise and accurate exposition. The report which I received some time ago and which is approximately 64 pages long contains the most definite indications of prosperity and development over this period of years that you can get. If ever I have been in possession of anything which has given me the confidence to adopt an optimistic attitude as against the pessimistic attitude of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, if ever I have been convinced that over the past 14 to 15 years we have experienced remarkable development and that the future economic prospects are rosy unless the world experiences some catastrophe or other, it is this very report. I am convinced that we have every reason to be optimistic that this growth will be maintained. This is what the report says, for example&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The great prosperity experienced over the past 14 years, the internal and economic stability of South Africa, as well as the inherent ability of the country&#x2019;s economy to overcome temporary set-backs, is evidence of the success of the steps taken by the Government to create a climate which is conducive to economic development.</block>

<p>I do not think time will permit me to read everything that is stated here and which strongly suppports the opinion which I myself also hold.</p>

I think the figures contained therein are already somewhat out of date. I myself was sorry that I did not think of it earlier to make the report generally available in one or other publication. I may perhaps go so far as to ask whether the report can be brought completely up to date and how it can be made available for the beneficial use of everybody. I shall go into that. In view of the arguments which have been submitted to me, I wish to make a few points. According to the report, one type of data which constitute a test as to whether the development in South Africa is good, is the gross internal production figure in South Africa during the period 1948 to 1961, a figure which has risen by R2,010,000,000 to R5,703,000,000, an increase of 185 per cent. But when the gross internal production is calculated in terms of constant or real prices it provides one with an even more reliable yardstick to judge the progress, because in that case it takes into account the changes which have in the meantime taken place as far as prices are concerned; if 1953 is taken as the basic year it appeared that the gross internal production has increased from R2,748,000,000 in 1948 to R5,138,000,000 in 1961; in other words, there has been a rise of 86 per cent and that represents an annual rise of 5 per cent. That is one of the important indications of the growth of our economy. It says here that the first phase lasted from 1948 to 1954 with a high growth rate of practically 6 per cent per annum in the gross internal production, at constant prices. The report says that subsequently from 1954 to 1956 there was a decline and the reasons are given. The report goes on to say what the difficulties were, what the reasons was, and how those difficulties were overcome. Then they show how. during the second phase which lasted from 1957 to 1961, the growth rate of our gross internal production, again at constant prices, in comparison with 1948, declined to 4.3 per cent per annum and the economic adviser gives the reasons for that. Ultimately he comes to the conclusion that if all the reasons for the development and even for the drop in the percentages are taken into account, it is not surprising that both the private sector and the public sector have already announced that they intend embarking on large capital developmental works and that the indications are that South Africa has already entered a new era of great economic upsurge: and that the discussions at the most recent sitting of the Economic Advisory Council were conducted in a spirit of optimism about the prospects of an increase in the tempo of our future economic development. In other words, in contrast to the somewhat pessimistic attitude adopted by the Leader of the Opposition because of his figures, the Economic Advisory Council is optimistic. I now take the figures to which I think the Leader of the Opposition referred, namely the increase in the <i>per capita</i> income in South Africa in comparison with those of other countries. I think this position has already been explained before by the heads of the Department of Economic Affairs, but here it is: The averaee increase, expressed in percentages, <i>per capita</i> between 1948 and 1960 was 2.7 in South Africa; 1.5 in the U.S.A.: 2.0 in Canada; 2.5 in the United Kingdom; 3.5 in Holland; 5.0 in Italy: 6.0 in West Germany; and 8.5 in Japan. I think the hon. the Leader of the Opposition concluded from these figures that we were relatively behind. at least as far as certain countries. namely Holland. Italy, West Germany and Japan, were concerned. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition, however, lost sight of two important factors. The one is that the few countries where there has been such large expansion are <span class="col_4603-4604" refersTo="page_0876"/>countries which have been so destroyed by the war that they practically had to start from scratch. Their position was, therefore, very bad in 1948 and their re-development need not necessarily have reached a relatively higher mark than those of other big countries in the world. Because countries like Italy, West Germany and Japan had to develop from devastated to prosperous states, backed by capital from the U.S.A., their percentage growth is as high as it is in comparison with those other countries who started from an existing high level. We can take the case of the U.S.A. Hon. members will see that where the growth figure for South Africa, which is one of the four comparable countries in the sense that they were not destroyed by the war, is 2.7, it is 1.5 in the case of the U.S.A., 2.0 in the case of Canada and 2.5 in the case of the United Kingdom. In other words, the growth figure for South Africa is the highest. But when you make a comparison with those countries you must also have regard to the growth in population during this period and you must also have regard to the type of population. In the case of the U.S.A. the population growth was 1.7 against 2.4 in South Africa. In other words, the growth in the population in the U.S.A. was smaller. Therefore, when the national income is allotted <i>per capita</i> to fewer people more relatively, until you get to the countries where the population growth is higher, you still find that the U.S.A. has the low figure of 1.5 That fact makes a comparison with her population growth even less impressive. In the case of Canada which had a greater population growth of 2.6 in comparison with our 2.4. the <i>per capita</i> income amounts to 2.0. But in the case of the United Kingdom with a very low population growth of 0.5 the income amounts to only 2.5 Had her population growth been higher the percentage would inevitably have dropped. Her figure of 2.5 is, therefore, not as significant as that of South Africa. In other words, the population growth is very important in determining the economic development as indicated by the <i>per capita</i> allocation of the national income. Take South Africa: Another factor comes into play and that is that the population growth of 2.4 is to a very large extent the result of an increase in the number of lower income groups, i.e. the Bantu and the Coloureds and the Indians. The result is that the growth in the national income which is achieved by the industrial sector, a growth mainly due to the achievements of the White section of the population, must be divided among the entire population in order to determine the <i>per capita</i> increase, including those who contributed little to it. That shows even more how remarkable the economic growth has been in South Africa, in comparison also with other countries.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also asked whether we were doing anything in connection with the expansion of our export industry. Time does not permit me to enlarge upon that but I have also given this question my personal attention. I have pleaded for this in public and I have also pleaded that we should expand our industries so that we can produce substitutes for imports. I may also add that my section, under the economic adviser, is compiling what is called an economic budget, a budget which is nothing else than an advance estimate of the economic activities in the country and which will better enable us to spot the gaps and to determine where the tempo of development is insufficient. The result is, therefore, than I can give him the assurance that in the field of research and deliberate planning, in the field of incentives to industrial development by the Economic Advisory Board and in the field of encouraging initiative on the part of those people who are constructively active in the industrial sphere by embarking on new undertakings, every possible guidance and assistance is given. In many respects, therefore, we have every reason to face the future with great confidence.</p>

<p>I just want to give a final figure in this connection and that is to show that one of the main tests to determine whether the country&#x2019;s economy is flourishing and developing, is the contribution of industry to the national income, once again calculated at constant prices. In this case 1958-9 was taken as the basic year. We find that the contribution by industry had increased from R641.5 million in 1949-50 to R1,095,6 million in 1960-1, approximately 70 per cent, or at an average rate of 6 per cent per annum.</p>

<p>Every possible sign that there is indicates that there is undoubtedly growth. The Government takes the initiative to encourage that growth even further. It not only encourages it in the form of words but in the form of well-known deeds as well. I cannot, therefore, subscribe to the pessimism of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I want to conclude with this and I take it that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition will understand that I cannot again deal with the old arguments which he has repeated in regard to the colour question.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Before I proceed to discuss the amendments before the House further, I want to give the hon. the Minister an opportunity of putting right the statement that he made in reply to the hon. members for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) and Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). The statement which he made in reply to those hon. members was a great shock and disappointment to the Coloured people. They are greatly disappointed because it is contrary, I am told, to the assurances which were given to the Coloured people when the whole question of the transfer of Coloured education was discussed with them. My information is that the basic principle of the transfer of Coloured education was never discussed in so far as they were told that it was the Government&#x2019;s policy that the transfer of Coloured education would take place. So they said that if that was so they would like to have certain assurances from the hon. the Minister and from the Department. One of those assurances which they asked for was that there would be no change in the syllabuses as they existed to-day. I am told that those assurances were given to the Coloured people. The Minister has now made a statement completely denying that.</p>

<p>Before I proceed I want to give the hon. the Minister an opportunity of rectifying his statement and re-assuring the Coloured people that what he promised them earlier will in fact take place, and that there is no cause for concern.</p>

<p>I shall resume my seat and wait for a reply from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. M. VAN NIEKERK</person>:</from>

<p>When this debate adjourned the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) had just spoken. The hon. member for Malmesbury hinted that there would be a difference between the syllabus and the education which would be given to the Coloureds. In other words their education would not be on the same plain as that of the Whites. By way of an interjection, after the hon. member for Malmesbury had said that the Coloureds were not on the same level <span class="col_4607-4608" refersTo="page_0878"/>as the Whites, the hon. the Minister said to me: &#x201C;You know that is so.&#x201D; We are not going to argue this evening whether the level of the Coloureds is the same as that of the Whites. What we must discuss is the desirability to get the Coloureds on to the same level as the Whites and what the Government has indicated it wanted to do for the Coloureds in all its promises.</p>

<p>Here I have a publication &#x201C;The Coloured People of South Africa&#x201D;. The most wonderful promises are made here to the Coloureds. They talk about education and reference is made to all the education that they must receive and all the new services which they have to receive. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured community&#x2019;s requirements regarding education: Special requirements will have to be met, <i>inter alia,</i> by the erection of a technical high school and an industrial school which will provide technical training and one or more agricultural gymnasiums for the training of farm workers.</block>

<p>This entire publication holds out the promise to the Coloureds that they will be uplifted and it is desirable that they be uplifted to the same level as that of the White people. That is the reason why this side of the Committee have the amendment of the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) on the Order Paper. We ask in that amendment that the syllabuses should be left in the hands of the provinces. It does not avail the Minister to say that we are advocating divided control. It is divided control when they want to give the Coloureds a different syllabus from that which they want to give to the White people. When the syllabuses were in the hands of the provinces in the past the Coloureds in the Cape Province wrote the same examinations as those which the White child wrote. In Natal that was the position even more so. We did not only have compulsory education in Natal since 1943, when education was made compulsory in the case of the White child, but it was compulsory free education with exactly the same syllabus.</p>

<p>I am pleading for it that what is being done for the White child should also be done for the Coloured child. I am pleading for it that the Coloured child should be uplifted so that he will attain the same level as the White child. It is not necessary for me to give my reasons to the hon. member but I shall nevertheless do so. The Coloureds constitute the one section in our country which is the closest to the Whites. We as Whites need friends and for that reason we should uplift them so that they can stand by our side. In view of the fact that the hon. the Minister does not want to reply to the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) I think it is very clear that this beautiful publication is just so much sham and that we were under the wrong impression that no distinction would be made. The Minister has so far been hedging when he said that there would not be any difference. The hon. member for Malmesbury has, however, let the cat out of the bag as did the hon. member with his interjection. They suggested that a sort of inferior education would be given to the Coloured.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think the hon. the Minister should have any difficulty in accepting this amendment. It may not be possible to maintain the same syllabus; you cannot often maintain it from school to school. It depends on the organization of the school&#x2014; whether there is one teacher or two teachers, whether it is a city school or a farm school and so on. But when it comes to maintaining the same standard surely we mean that the Std. VI in a Coloured school will be of the same standard as the Std. VI in a White school. That has been the position up to now. When it comes to university level, surely the entrance examination to the Cape Western University College is the same as the entrance examination to the University of Cape Town or Stellenbosch or any other university. In other words, the same standard is assumed to-day. When the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) says in his amendment that the same standard will be maintained I cannot see what the difficulty is.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is a great pity that this debate has created a measure of suspicion and distrust in respect of this clause. I want to appeal to hon. members to be very careful what they say. A large section of the Coloured community is still immature. What is said here for purely political purposes has an affect on the immature minds of people. I shall prove that to hon. members in a moment. There have already been reactions to my refusal to accept this amendment on the part of certain so-called Coloured leaders who want to create the impression that I intend doing an injustice to the Coloureds by refusing this amendment. When this Bill was last discussed I said that it would be an impractical step because it would be more to the disadvantage of the Coloureds. I gave an example. Let me give a further example. Of <span class="col_4609-4610" refersTo="page_0879"/>the plus minus 900 high school teachers in the Cape Province approximately 250 to 290 have degrees. Numbers of Coloured students go to a training college after Std. VIII where they take a two-year course for their primary teacher&#x2019;s diploma. If I were to accept this principle it would mean that I shall not be able to allow those people to remain. I am supported by people who hold different views on Coloured education from hon. members opposite. I have received a document from Safta during the past few days. Safta is a federal organization of Coloured teachers&#x2019; organizations some of which are not recognized bodies. They, however, maintain that they represent a number of Coloured teachers. Safta is in principle against the transfer of Coloured education to the Department. The chairman is the Rev. Joost and the secretary is Dr. van der Ross. Safta informs me in this document that they are in principle opposed to the transfer but in spite of that they are prepared, as far as purely educational matters are concerned, to co-operate as closely as possible with me and the Department in order to try to get the best possible education for the Coloured child. I want to read from this document&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There has recently been a great deal said about the possible future standard of Coloured education. Presumably the same views will be held in respect of Indian education. Safta regards it as a matter of regret that a matter which is so largely a professional and academic one should have been exposed to so much discussion and publicity at the political level.</block>

<p>That is precisely what I am warning against. [Interjections.] I tried to introduce this Bill objectively. I tried to deal objectively with every clause, but those people who are always chasing votes were the ones who tried to contaminate everything. I want to quote further what Safta says. The reason why this situation has developed, Mr. Chairman, is because there is a struggle between the United Party and the Progressive Party as to who will represent the Coloureds in future. They are now bidding against one another.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) is the last person who should make such personal remarks in this House. The hon. member will regret it if he continues to be personal. I know of his activities amongst the Coloured people, and I shall bring them to light if he continues to be personal. We shall then see who is the friend of the Coloureds. I now wish to read further to the hon. Committee what Safta says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Safta is prepared also to concede that it may be unrealistic to expect that the Minister will embody in the Bill a provision to the effect that equivalent standards will be maintained. It accepts that the non-inclusion of such a clause does not necessarily mean that lower standards will be implemented. Still there are other ways and means whereby the maintenance of high standards may be affected.</block>

<p>That is what Safta says. In other words, they agree that it is impractical for me to accept it now. And they are people who are in principle opposed to the transfer of Coloured education. This Dr. van der Ross who is always being thrown at us is the secretary of Safta. He signed this document. That is why I say that I am sorry that I cannot accede to these pleas. They can only have one effect and that is to imprint wrong impressions on the immature minds of a large section of the Coloured population. Let us at least be careful. if we are serious when we say that we want to preserve race relations, how we handle this sort of thing.</p>

<p>What are the facts? The facts are that provision is made in this Bill that in respect of the foreseeable future, inasmuch as the Department of Education laid down the courses, it will continue to do so. It is further provided that inasmuch as the provinces did so they will continue to do so. All I told the Coloured people last year by way of a statement was that we would not provide them with inferior education. The education which they receive to-day. however, is not equivalent to that of the Whites, even between the provinces it is not equivalent. The object is to improve it and we shall continue to strive for that. It must of necessity improve to the extent to which Coloured teachers receive better training; it must improve to the extent to which school facilities are created and to the extent to which other factors influence the Coloured community. The present standards will at least be maintained and they should gradually be improved. If I were to accept these amendments &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman. I want to say this that any fears or suspicions that have been created in the minds of Coloured educationists about this clause have been created by no one else but the hon. the Minister himself. I think it is necessary for me to remind this Committee that the hon. the Prime Minister himself initiated the idea of the transfer of Coloured education from the Provincial Administration to the Coloured Affairs Department. He was at pains to explain to the Union Council of Coloured Affairs that there would be no diminution at all in the standard of education that the Coloured children of this province would receive. He made that manifestly clear in a statement which I referred to in my second-reading speech. That assurance was repeated by the hon. the Minister time and again outside of this House namely that it was the intention of the Government to maintain the same standards of education as far as the Coloured children were concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, you will appreciate that this clause is one of the most important clauses of this Bill. This clause gives the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs the right to determine at his sole discretion the courses for the education or for the training of persons at trade schools, schools of industry, reform schools, State-aided schools and to conduct examinations. It vests almost autocratic powers in the hands of the hon. the Minister to determine the standard of education which these Coloured children are to receive from now on when the control of Coloured education is transferred from the Provincial Administrations to the Coloured Affairs Department.</p>

<p>It is necessary to remind this Committee again that no Coloured organization has asked for this transfer. The suggested transfer emanates from the Government. They have initiated this idea. The Prime Minister has indicated that there would not be any diminution in the standard of Coloured education as a result of this transfer. What are we asking the hon. the Minister to do? We are asking the hon. the Minister in terms of my amendment to put it on record that in exercising the powers which we are conferring upon him under this clause he will maintain the standard of education obtaining in the case of White children in the Cape Province.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make is this. I was merely replying to the Minister&#x2019;s intervention in this debate. I want to say this that the hon. the Minister was not prepared to accept the amendment of the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) because he said that went too far. He said that he was not able to adhere to the regulations governing syllabuses for the training of White persons because in each province &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I want to say this in conclusion that if the hon. the Minister intends to give effect to the promise which he and the Prime Minister made to the Coloured people there is no valid reason why he cannot accept this amendment and put it on record. Despite the assertions made by the hon. the Minister I wish to have this amendment on record for <span class="col_4613-4614" refersTo="page_0881"/>the purposes of protecting the standard of education to be given to the Coloured people of this province.</p>

<p>I should like to, Sir, but when I am told to go to hospital I suppose I have to react to it. A lot of people should be in hospital with a small ailment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, what I want to say is this: The attitude of the Government towards the educational or the cultural level of the Coloured people is expressed in a Government publication called &#x201C;The Coloured People of South Africa&#x201D; in one simple sentence. Under the heading &#x201C;Cultural Development&#x201D; we find this: &#x201C;The culture of the Coloured people is largely Western.&#x201D; I did not say that; although I subscribe to it. This is an official publication of the Government of the Republic of South Africa about the Coloured people. For the information of the Minister of Coloured Affairs I say that the Government goes out of its way here to say that the culture of the Coloured people is largely Western.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Minister himself in introducing the second reading of the Bill had some fair words to say to the Coloured people about their education. In the light of what he has just cited about what an organization called Safta has said, I think it is reasonable to remind him of what he himself has said, which has a greater bearing on the matter than something which Safta, whoever they may be, have said to him. He said so, among other things, according to a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of Friday 22 February &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to quibble over it, Sir. What he said was, in effect, that since the earliest days of the Cape, the education of the Coloured people was parallel with that of the White people. Whether I read a Press report or whether the Minister reads his own Hansard, that was what he said. One must ask him, as a &#x201C;Minister of Education&#x201D;, what is the meaning of &#x201C;parallel&#x201D;? Because he went on to say that it was the purpose to continue the policy of parallel education. I ask the hon. the Minister again&#x2014;and I hope he will reply to me&#x2014;what is the meaning of &#x201C;parallel&#x201D;? Unless he says that &#x201C;parallel&#x201D; does not mean that the two systems of education shall be on the same plane and shall not in any way deviate from each other, then he will be giving me a new explanation of the meaning of the word &#x201C;parallel&#x201D; to which I shall be very pleased to react.</p>

<p>The argument has also been advanced that the Coloured people should not expect to be given the same education as the White people of South Africa; that it is not good for them, on the basis that they are not intellectually capable of absorbing that quality of education given to the White people.</p>

<p>Does that not reinforce the argument which the Government itself uses&#x2014;I accept that it approaches this matter with some seriousness&#x2014;when the Government says that the culture of the Coloured people is largely Western? Then, what is the meaning of &#x201C;Western culture&#x201D;? What is the meaning or &#x201C;parallel education&#x201D;? What is the meaning of &#x201C;equal&#x201D; intellectual capacity in regard to education, except that they must receive the same standard and quality of education as the White people? What can the hon. Minister say in reply to that argument? That it is not so, or that it is, and he is making political capital out of the issue. There are only two alternatives. And finally, in this regard the hon. Minister has referred to the reaction of Safta. I want to refer him to the reaction of the Council for Coloured Affairs, who have a certain interest in this matter, and the hon. Minister has cited them from time to time as people who should be favourably regarded as far as their standing in the affairs of the Coloured people are concerned. I have a report here, not a report of a Parliamentary debate, a report in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 20 April and in that article a member of the Council&#x2019;s Education Committee, Mr. Arendse, is reported to have said &#x201C;that all his fears and those of the Coloured teachers had been proved justified by the Minister&#x2019;s stand&#x201D;. The stand he is taking to-night, Sir. I am not going to read it all, but he went on to say &#x201C;I feel that the Council has been led up the garden path; it would never have agreed to the transfer &#x2026;&#x201D; in other words, if it had known what was going to happen in regard to this Clause 21, for instance. He continued &#x201C;I think we are now seeing the Minister in his true colours&#x201D;. Sir, this is not a light allegation to make. These people also have a certain regard for propriety; they also realize that they are in a position where the Government can do certain things for them, and can do certain things against them, and therefore this statement made by a member of the Education Committee of this council must be regarded as having some weight. For the reasons that I have advanced the Minister cannot surely blindly refuse every single amendment on the Order Paper. He must in all seriousness, instead of making allegations of political capital being important into this debate by this side of the House, tell us of a good reason, not a specious reason, why, when he alleges that it is the intention to ensure &#x201C;parallel education&#x201D; for the Coloureds, as he did in his second-reading speech&#x2014;parallel to that of the Whites&#x2014;why he will not, then, accept the amendments which have been proposed to this clause.</p>

<speech by="#moore">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>I should like the hon. Minister to give us some clarification on the interpretation of this clause. I am not going to refer to the matter of the &#x201C;Secretary&#x201D;. I have said at an earlier stage that this should be &#x201C;the Director&#x201D;, but I am not going to discuss that now. But this is the point I should like to discuss with the hon. Minister: We provide in this clause for two investigations. Two, not one, and the two things provided for are the inspection of certain schools (that is one) and the other is &#x201C;inquiries in connection with matters relating to such schools&#x201D;. Now I think the two things should be kept completely separate. I am going to ignore the question of inquiry for the time being and in dealing with the inspection, see how this clause can be applied to an inspection. We say in sub-section (2) (a)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person who inspects any school&#x2026; if he has reason to believe that any person is able to give evidence or to produce any document or other article which will be relevant to any inspection &#x2026;</block>

<p>What documents will he require when an officer goes along to conduct an inspection? And then in (b) powers are given to administer an oath or affirmation to any person present at such inspection. When will he be required to administer an oath when as an inspector he visits a school? That is meant for an inquiry, not for an inspection. And then we come to sub-section (3). There it is envisaged&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The law relating to witnesses and evidence which applies in connection with criminal cases in a magistrate&#x2019;s court shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply &#x2026;</block>

<p>But you don&#x2019;t have a law as applied in a criminal court applicable to an inspection of a school. That is all meant for an inquiry into some irregularity under Clauses 16 or 17. Finally, in sub-clause (3), will the person present at an inspection be legally represented? I understand he will not be, but I cannot see what the whole thing has to do with a school inspection. It is relevant to an inquiry into a complaint about the conduct of a teacher or something in regard to the property itself, but I do not think that this has anything at all to do with the inspection of a school. I am not going to move an amendment, but I think it might be advisable for the hon. the Minister to discuss this with his law advisers. Perhaps at a later stage in Another Place he might be able to give us two clauses, or to delete the inspection altogether, because a school inspection cannot possibly be carried out in this way, by swearing people in.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to get some information. Clause 22 (2) provides that a person who holds an inquiry in terms of sub-section (1) can do certain things and subclause (4) provides that any person who prevents any other person from appearing in accordance with a subpoena issued in terms of paragraph (a) of sub-section (2) at the time and place in question, or from producing any document shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding fifty rand. Sub-section (3) provides that the law relating to witnesses and evidence which applies in connection with criminal cases in a magistrate&#x2019;s court shall <i>mutatis mutandis</i> apply in this case. Will the same procedure be followed here? I cannot see how a person who gives evidence can be found guilty of a crime by an ordinary individual. I shall be pleased if the Minister will explain this.</p>

<p>I shall certainly consider the suggestion of the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) and discuss it thoroughly once again, and if it is possible to set it out in a more broken-down form I shall consider it. But I shall have to consult the law advisers. I understand that the reason why all these provisions are contained in this one clause is because we are dealing here not only with the provisions of certain Ordinances but it must be remembered that we are now accepting certain obligations under certain provisions of the Vocational Education and Special Schools Act. But I shall discuss the matter with the law advisers to see Whether these provisions cannot be framed in a better way. The one inquiry of course deals with malpractices and the other with the normal inspection of the school. I shall see what I can do to have these provisions set out more clearly.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) asked me whether the same procedure will apply to sub-section (4) as in the case of sub-section (3). I take it that that will be so, but I do not want to give any assurance to that effect until I have consulted the law advisers. If these provisions are not clear enough we shall consider framing them in a different way.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I regard the amendment which stands in my name as probably the most important one before this House <span class="col_4623-4624" refersTo="page_0886"/>Rightly or wrongly the Coloured people have definitely come under the impression that immediately after this Bill is passed compulsory education will immediately be introduced, as in Natal. Although I am only too well aware of the practical difficulties which confront the Minister, I think the Minister should, to a certain extent in any case, comply with the wishes of our Coloured people. For a considerable time there have been sufficient facilities and enough schools in the big cities, particularly in Cape Town, Paarl, Worcester and other places, for education to be made compulsory. That is why I am sorry that the Minister is not already making provision for compulsory education in certain areas. He may perhaps be afraid of the financial implications, because if he introduces compulsory education, education must, of course, be free. I feel, therefore, that this Clause is not clear enough and that it will cause dissatisfaction or that it will not remove the dissatisfaction which exists. I think the Coloureds will be satisfied if the Minister lays down a time limit, even if it is five or ten years. In that case they will know that although they are not getting it to-day it will indeed be introduced in due course. That is why my amendment is worded the way it appears here and for record purposes I should like to read it. With your permission, Mr. Chairman, I wish to add something to this amendment which I hope the Minister will accept. It is a practical amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add the following proviso at the end of sub-section (1):<br/>Provided that such regular attendance shall be compulsory for every such Coloured person resident within the boundaries of a municipality, or resident in the district and within three miles of the nearest State school, by a date not later than 1st January, 1970.</block>

<p>You have to make provision for those people who live just outside the municipal boundaries, Sir, so that they can also attend that school and although as a child I had to walk six miles to school in the mornings and six miles back, I think it is reasonable to ask that the distance to the nearest school should be three miles. This is a reasonable amendment. It does not detract from anything the Minister already had in his Clause. He still has a time limit, and a fairly lengthy one, within which he has, in certain circumstances, to introduce compulsory education in the big cities, in municipal areas and within three miles of a school for all Coloured children living within that radius. It is a practical suggestion and something definite, but I am convinced&#x2014;I do not know what the Coloured Representatives think about this; I have not discussed this with them&#x2014;that this is something which will satisfy our Coloured people because many of the Coloured leaders who have come to discuss this matter with me, think we shall not carry out the promises we have made to them, or as they understood them, namely, that compulsory education will be introduced in their case just as it has been introduced in the case of the Whites, but a promise as embodied in my amendment will satisfy them.</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>*Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) and say that I will not move in its entirety the amendment standing in my name on page 368. The reason why I am going to move only part of that amendment is because as it stands my amendment to Clause 23 was really contingent on an amendment which I wanted to move to Clause 3. But because this would have involved increased expenditure I was unable to move that amendment. Therefore it is obviously foolish for me to move this amendment which depended entirely on the availability of enough money. So I am not moving the amendment as it stands and I support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow, but I want to move that part of the amendment which reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 37, to omit &#x201C;fails, without lawful reason&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;without reasonable cause and after a written warning by the Department fails to omit all the words after &#x201C;exceeding&#x201D; in line 39 to the end of the Clause and to substitute &#x201C;ten rand and on conviction of a second subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding forty rand&#x201D;, And to reduce the penalty. This is the remainder of my amendment on page 368. This would bring the provision in line with the existing Cape Education Ordinance for White persons, and I think it is only fair that if and when the Minister does introduce compulsory education for Coloured children, the same exemptions should apply where children fail to attend school. In other words, it should not simply be that if they do not provide what the Minister calls &#x201C;a lawful reason&#x201D;. I suggest it should be &#x201C;without reasonable cause and after written warning by the Department Thereafter prosecutions could ensue.</block>

<p>I also suggest that the penalties are far too high, particularly as this applies to a section of the community which is ill able to afford the heavy fines provided for as the clause stands now. I hope the Minister will accept that part of the amendment. It does not alter any principle, but brings it into line with the Cape Education Ordinance. I hope he will also accept the amendment of the hon. member for Hillbrow, for one good reason. If there is anything that the hon. the Minister could do to reassure and to give extreme pleasure to the Coloureds, it would be to implement a power which in fact the provinces have had for at least twenty years. For at least twenty years it has been within the power of the provinces to make compulsory attendance at school for Coloured children obligatory, but it has not ever been imposed to my knowledge, and I <span class="col_4625-4626" refersTo="page_0887"/>think it is something the Coloureds want badly. I hope that where there are already areas where there are sufficient schools and the facilities are available, the Minister will give us an earnest of his sincerity that he will ultimately introduce compulsory education for Coloured children by telling us th&#x00E0;t he intends immediately, in certain districts anyway, to implement compulsory education. If he wants this Bill to be accepted, as he put it, as a great step forward for the Coloured people, he should at least take this small step forward by assuring us that he intends as soon as possible to make education compulsory for Coloured children, and telling us that he will at least introduce it immediately in those districts where these facilities exist.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) said he did not know what the sentiments of the Coloureds&#x2019; Representatives were in regard to his amendment. I want to say immediately that we agree with and wholeheartedly support his amendment. In that connection I think it is necessary for me to tell the Minister that a representative delegation of teachers met the Coloureds&#x2019; Representatives in this House and put forward certain suggestions in regard to the proposed transfer of Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs. Dealing with this particular clause, the following appears in the memorandum they presented to us. They said that compulsory education should now be introduced in all areas where this is possible and that provision should be made to make this system the order within a minimum period. That is wholly in line with the amendment moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow. This is a very important clause. It has the effect of vesting in the Minister the power to make Coloured education compulsory, but it gives the Minister a blank cheque in that regard, because the clause says it is only when the Minister is satisfied that sufficient and suitable school accommodation is available that he may by notice declare that regular attendance shall be compulsory for every Coloured person belonging to a particular age group and resident in a particular area. In other words, the Minister will have the discretionary power to determine (a) whether there is sufficient accommodation, (b) whether there is suitable accommodation, and (c) whether it will apply to Coloured persons of a particular age group, and (d) the residential qualifications of the Coloured persons affected. The amendment of the hon. member for Hillbrow at least gives this safeguard that it ensures that within a limited time this compulsory education will be given effect to. I think it is essential that there should be a limitation of time. I am sure the Minister will agree that it is not unreasonable to ask him to accept some limitation of time. If the Minister feels that the period suggested by the hon. member for Hillbrow is not sufficient, he can suggest a further period. But I feel that we should get a statement from the Minister that wherever possible this compulsory system of education will be introduced without any delay whatever, and that thereafter provision will be made to make introduction of this compulsory system applicable within a minimum period. I urge upon the Minister to accept the amendment because I think it will relieve a great deal of apprehension existing at present in the minds of the Coloureds.</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;exceeding&#x201D; in line 39 to the end of the clause and to substitute &#x201C;ten rand or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one month on conviction of a first offence or to a fine not exceeding forty rand or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding two months on conviction of a second or subsequent offence I think that that is quite fair.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the amendment of the hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) is concerned, the position is perfectly clear. I do not think that anyone in this House will object or have the courage to object to the principle and the desirability of compulsory education. That is why I have consistently adopted the attitude that this is an ideal that we will strive to achieve. But the introduction of compulsory legislation in the Cape, for example, where the greatest measure of goodwill has existed over the years on the part of the province in respect of the Coloured people, is not a question which depends entirely upon goodwill. The practical implication of compulsory education depends upon the availability of school buildings and, secondly, the availability of well-trained teachers. I am not an educationist myself but I have never been able to understand why people have placed so much emphasis upon the availability of school buildings while the availability of well-trained teachers has hardly ever been mentioned. After all, it is essential for the effective application of compulsory education that there should be an adequate number of suitable teachers available. In the second place, a great deal depends upon the amount of money available. What will now happen in practice? Once Coloured education has been taken over we will have the situation that we have in Natal, where compulsory education has already been introduced and I think I can accept that that position will have to continue. We have given an undertaking that we will not deprive the Coloureds of any rights and that is why we will have to continue with compulsory education there. There is no compulsory education in the Transvaal and the Free State. The principle of compulsory education <span class="col_4627-4628" refersTo="page_0888"/>was adopted many years ago in the Cape and has been applied in a few school board districts. There too we will have to continue with the position as it is. But if I were to say publicly this evening in the full realization of the responsibility of my position&#x2014;and bind the Government, moreover by legislation&#x2014;that we will make education compulsory throughout the four provinces by 1970, I would be going too far. The danger is this. Supposing we embody it in legislation and something happens to make it impossible for us to carry out this undertaking and we have to introduce legislation at a later stage to the effect that it is no longer possible to make education compulsory throughout the country by 1970, will we not then be doing far greater harm to the goodwill and to the confidence that the Coloureds have in us? Is it not better for me to reply in the spirit of S.A.F.T.A.? I quoted just now from the document that S.A.F.T.A. submitted to me a few days ago. I am not using S.A.F.T.A. as a cloak to cover my actions. S.A.F.T.A. know precisely what I think of their attitude and that I differ from them in principle, but in the third paragraph of this document which is dated the 20th of April of this year they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Compulsory education: Realizing the advantages of compulsory education, S.A.F.T.A. is naturally desirous that it be introduced on as wide a basis as possible and as soon as possible. At the same time S.A.F.T.A. is aware of and appreciates the difficulties in the way of the implementation of such a measure. Where these difficulties make it palpably impossible for the Minister to include an insurance of compulsion in the Bill at this stage, S.A.F.T.A. wishes to point out that what is required is that there be conveyed to the public that the measure will be pursued in its practical implications with all possible speed. The unfortunate position now prevailing is that the impression has been created in a wide circle that this will not or may not be done.</block>

<p>I want to make use of this opportunity to say that that is a wrong impression because I believe that if the Coloured people are to be uplifted culturally and otherwise and if they are to be an asset to the country, then their salvation lies in this direction amongst others. I do not think that anyone with a reasonable sense of responsibility and a sense of what is in the interest of South Africa will deny that. But I think that I would be acting stupidly if I were to bind myself to a specific date this evening.</p>

<p>In the second place I would be acting stupidly if I did not take into account that there is a great backlog as far as school buildings are concerned. Hon. members are aware of the great burden which is imposed on the State to make school buildings available. I think that there is one way to make the Coloured people feel aggrieved and that is to give them the type of school building that will destroy the spirit of their children. I do not say that we must build palaces for them but we must build practical schools for them. We have to take capital expenditure and the carrying capacity of the country into account in this regard. But what is more important, we must bear in mind the extent to which teachers are available. A little earlier on I pointed out the position of the standard of training of numbers of these Coloured teachers. There may be sufficient teachers available for primary education but I cannot say that all of them have the qualifications that will be necessary to comply with the requirements once compulsory education is introduced. I do not say this to insult the teachers in any way. That is why I am sorry that no matter how much I would like to make this promise, for the sake of good relationships amongst other things, I cannot do so. Does the hon. member imagine that if I were able to assure the Coloured people in regard to some matter about which they were most concerned, I would not do so? That would greatly facilitate my task. But it would be the height of irresponsibility for me to promise things which I knew in my heart of hearts I would have to subject to these three tests. I am unable to say that it is possible to make education compulsory by 1970 because at a later stage I might have to introduce legislation to delete a provision of this nature. For these reasons I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.</p>

<speech by="#basson">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. D. DU P. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I hope that the Minister will not regard the representations of this side as a reflection upon him personally. I do not doubt his good intentions and his goodwill, but I do not think that the clause as it stands is satisfactory because it is not positive enough. We are constantly told that there is a shortage of school accommodation for Whites and a shortage of teachers, and yet that does not affect the position as far as compulsory education for Whites is concerned. I do not suppose that the Minister will always occupy that position; there may be a change of Ministers, and in that event a section such as this might be responsible for an indefinite delay in introducing compulsory education. Moreover, it is my impression that unless we have compulsory education, we will never discover how great the leeway is in respect of school accommodation and in respect of the shortage of teachers. It is only when we have compulsory education and when we know what has to be provided that we shall find out what the shortcomings are and then hasten to meet those shortcomings. I am afraid there is no positive indication that the Government proposes to introduce compulsory education. Let us view the matter in this light: Things are going wrong in this country to-day and I believe that it is our duty, in our own interests, to take every possible step with the greatest possible expedition to raise the standards of Western civilization in South Africa. The spirit with which we should like the Minister to be imbued is not simply one of recognizing the difficulties. Difficulties can be overcome; they can also be overcome in respect of the question <span class="col_4629-4630" refersTo="page_0889"/>of adequate funds. We are spending scarcely one-third on education to-day that the Communist countries are spending. If we have to do so, we curtail expenditure on some other service, but the time has come when expenditure on education in South Africa should not be curtailed by a single cent because we should see to it that every person in South Africa enjoys the high standards of Western civilization. It should be treated as a priority. The spirit with which I should like the hon. the Minister to be imbued is not a spirit of recognizing difficulties, but a spirit of &#x201C;it <i>must</i> be done&#x201D;, and &#x201C;it <i>must</i> be done as soon as possible&#x201D;. This amendment asks that 1970 should be set as the target for the achievement of this ideal. Personally I feel that that period is too long. It ought to be five years. But if the date is fixed at 1970, it gives the Minister seven years to introduce this. If he finds at the end of six years that there are very good reasons why he cannot put it into effect, then the right thing to do is to come to Parliament so that Parliament can decide whether his reasons are adequate. I do not think that the public or the Coloureds would be so unreasonable as not to support him if he is able to show by 1969 that there are good reasons why he cannot put it into effect. There is nothing that will prevent him then from coming to Parliament and asking Parliament to extend the time by another year or longer. We will then at least have achieved this that in the meantime the Department will have been forced to tackle this matter and there will be a feeling of &#x201C;it <i>must</i> be done&#x201D;. I am sorry but as the clause stands here it is altogether too negative. Furthermore, I feel that the Minister&#x2019;s excuse that he cannot come back to Parliament at the end of seven years, is not a good argument. I therefore fully suport the amendment of the hon. member for Hillbrow.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>I am in full agreement with the hon. the Minister that there is only one thing to do. I am thinking primarily of the Cape. One will have to link up compulsory education with the State school. But I will come back to this matter later on. Firstly I want to mention two more good reasons why it is impossible to bind the hon. the Minister to a particular date, whether it be 1970 or 1980. The comparison that has been drawn between Coloured education and White education does not hold water. It must be remembered that in the case of White children, all of them are at school. All that one has to do is to make provision for the annual increase in that number of children. As against that, there is a tremendous backlog as far as the Coloured child is concerned. For example, we do not know what their numbers are. The Commission on Coloured Education found, for example, that there were at least 35,000 Coloured children who were not yet at school. Provision will therefore have to be made for them. Then we must also remember that when we estimate the number of White children at school we can assume that we will have those children at school between the ages of seven and 16 years. In the case of the Coloured child, however, the position is such that he leaves school at any stage after sub B. He only stays at school for a few years and then he leaves. If compulsory education is introduced it will mean that there will be a very large number of children who will have to be kept at school. Provision will then have to be made. Provision will also have to be made for buildings and for teachers.</p>

<p>There is another matter that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The Commission to which I have just referred also found that compulsory education had to be linked up with State schools and not with State-aided schools as is provided for in this clause. A State-aided school is a church school. We went into the matter and we found that we could make an arrangement amongst the various denominations to make provision for religious education&#x2014;we call these schools amalgamated schools. But there are a few religious societies which have a number of schools under their control and which refuse to have anything to do with this matter. I simply cannot see how the hon. the Minister can compel any parent to send his child to a school that has been specifically built for the education of children belonging to some other religious society. We have to be extremely careful here. If the hon. the Minister can take over these schools on a large scale, at least in the municipal areas, then it may still prove successful. It may also prove successful if he has the power to take over those schools and to make State schools of them. But I simply cannot see how one can compel a parent to send his child to a school which is not controlled by his own church. I want to bring this aspect of the matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>With further reference to what the hon. member who has just sat down, has said and also to what the Minister has said, I should like to deal with one aspect of this clause. The following is stated in the clause: &#x201C;If the Minister is satisfied that sufficient and suitable school accommodation is available &#x2026;&#x201D;. I understood the hon. the Minister to say that in the case of Natal the chances were that the school accommodation there would be adequate and that there would be no practical difficulties in connection with compulsory school attendance. But this is a clause, Sir, which if it becomes law, can demand of the parent that his child attend the school which in the opinion of the Minister, is suitable and sufficient. The point I should like to make quite crisply in this connection is that I hope the Minister will bear in mind that in the major portion of the debate which has taken place so far on this measure there was the tendency for us to focus our attention on the Coloured child in the Cape. That is perhaps natural. Reference has also been made to the Coloured child in other provinces. I want to say to the Minister that merely the provision of classrooms and teachers in a suitable building is not necessarily providing suitable accommodation in the sense that it will be viewed by the parents and the children of a certain class. This has been a problem with us <span class="col_4631-4632" refersTo="page_0890"/>in Natal and. to meet this problem we have recognized human relationships by administrative means. In this way we have been able to cope with the problem quite satisfactorily. I can, however, recall one or two instances where difficulties were encountered because of the racial descent of the people concerned. In so far as the Coloured people of Natal is involved in this matter, we have to remember that the so-called Cape Coloured except in one small corner of the Province do not as a group exist in Natal at all. The Coloured people of Natal come from two other quite different racial stocks than that from which the Cape Coloured people come. On the one hand there is Euro-African stock and on the other Euro-Asians. Between these there is a mutual hostility, a mutual hostility which we have to bear in mind when dealing with this very question, namely suitable school accommodation. It has been found quite unsuitable to have a school where a survey of the child population in the district has shown that there are so many Coloured children&#x2014;that means Coloured children in terms of the definition set out in this Bill. Under this Bill it is perfectly clear that those children fall under &#x201C;any other group&#x201D;. There is not only mutual hostility but there is extreme mutual hostility.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STANDER</person>:</from>

<p>Do you segregate them in the schools?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. Administratively, we keep them apart as far as is possible. There is a natural tendency on the part of the people coming from a Euro-Asian stock to live in a certain part of the Province&#x2014;in the main the sugar belt. These are the people who so often are called Mauritians. They have a different home language&#x2014;their original home language was French. They are not Protestants by religion and they are people very often of a very high culture. Now, there is a mutual hostility between them and those of Euro-African descent. This latter group in the main comes from other parts of the Province.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, we have a respect for these differences administratively. We have a respect for these human differences, we have accepted it and we have tried administratively to deal with the matter. So far as I know the Coloured people of Natal has not yet accepted the principles of this Bill. It is therefore a matter of, whether they like it or not, Parliament passing the legislation and that they must accept it and make the best of it.</p>

<p>In view of the fact that under this clause compulsion can be applied, I should like to appeal to the Minister that his Department should see to it that as far as possible recognition is given to racial differences. We have for instance never had any difficulty in getting White teachers to teach in Coloured schools, but we have had great difficulty in getting Coloured teachers to go from one Coloured school to the other. The only instance of real unpleasantness which came to my notice has actually arisen on this ground. I do appeal to the Minister therefore that he should not deal with this on the basis of vacant seats in a Coloured school and that that will be regarded as suitable accommodation for them. I am afraid that will lead to difficulties.</p>

<p>Yes, in Natal. As the hon. member is aware we have had discussions with him on the other matters already, quite fruitful discussions, and I suggest therefore that we have a further discussion on this also.</p>

<p>*As far as the hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) is concerned, I want to say that I can understand his problem. I want to say immediately that the interdenominational committee discussed this matter with me some time ago, after which a statement was issued. In any case, on that occasion I gave the religious organization concerned the assurance that I would compel no child to attend a school that was controlled by a religious society different to that to which that child&#x2019;s parents belonged. In spite of the dangers in this regard the clause makes it possible for one to compel a community belonging exclusively to one religious society&#x2014;this is possible and I can imagine that there are communities of this nature&#x2014;to accept compulsory legislation when one introduces that compulsory education. I am giving full consideration to what the hon. member said and I can also give him the assurance that the principle of compelling people to attend schools controlled by churches other than those to which they themselves belong will never be accepted.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am pleased that the Minister has agreed that in principle we should strive for compulsory education. His reasons, however, for not bringing in compulsory education at this stage are to me quite insufficient. He says we would firstly have to have sufficient school accommodation, sufficient teachers and sufficient finances. If we are going to wait for all these to be sufficient we will never ever have compulsory education. I would rather that a child be taught under a tree in the open air in summertime than to see him go without education. I would be far happier to see that. The problem is that classrooms have always been in short supply. That is the case especially in the primary schools. Here there has always been overcrowding in class-rooms. Sometimes there were 40 to 50 children in a classroom normally offering accommodation <span class="col_4633-4634" refersTo="page_0891"/>for 20-25 only. But that has not stopped the White child from going to school. I think the same thing is necessary in respect of the Coloured child. If there are too many Coloured children to go into the classrooms some of them would have to be taught outside the classrooms. To me, children would like it especially in the summertime, to be taught on benches outside the classroom than inside the classroom. So in that way we can always get over the accommodation difficulty.</p>

<p>But what then about the wintertime?</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>It must be remembered that winter in South Africa lasts for only a short while. It is not like in Britain where winter lasts some times for many months. If we have to have tents we can erect them. In fact there are one hundred and one ways of getting over the difficulty of accommodation. Marquees can be erected. This type of accommodation is quite suitable. People who went through the difficulties which we had after the war, of accommodating children in classrooms know that we used marquees and prefabricated buildings which were taken from army depots.</p>

<p>We will never be able to find enough money for education. It is necessary that we make a start. Now the amendment moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow gives us a seven year period. Surely we can start during that period? But if we are going to go on and wait as the hon. Minister would like us to do until we have sufficient money, accommodation, etc., we will never get started. The whole structure which the Minister erected this afternoon shows that we will never have enough qualified teachers. He does not want to bring in education for teachers on a par with Whites. Why not? He says that there are many teachers to-day who are teaching but who are not fully qualified. They have only passed Std. VIII. But surely those teachers can teach primary school children. There is no reason why they shouldn&#x2019;t do that. If the Minister is going to insist on the best qualifications, how would he ever manage to get started? The whole structure of the education of the Coloured people is going to break down. In fact it is breaking down to-night. And that for the reason that the Minister does not start with laying a solid foundation for the future.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I should like to treat the matter seriously while the hon. member for Standerton treats it as a joke. He has had his education although he has not made the best use of it. But that does not mean that we must prevent others from having education. It is amazing what good would come of it if the Minister is prepared to-day to say that during the next seven years he is going to plan to have sufficient accommodation available and to get sufficient teachers. If he really wants to do it there is no reason why he cannot. We do not want him to do it tomorrow but we only ask of him to do it in seven years. If he is sincere in his wishes and sincere in what he has said then surely he can make provision for it in this Bill. Thereby he can satisfy us as well as satisfy the Coloured people. And not only that, Sir, but he will satisfy the people of his own side. But now we are leaving this matter in the air and I know what will come of it in seven years&#x2019; time. After seven years we will be just as badly off as we are this evening.</p>

<speech by="#steenkamp">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STEENKAMP</person>:</from>

<p>I accept wholeheartedly that the Minister is willing to do his best for those people whom he has under his control. I accept the goodwill of the Minister in this connection. I do not doubt it but I accept that he is willing to do whatever he can. As a matter of fact, I accept that he will do it. There is one point on which he will, however, agree with me, namely that no matter how willing he may be, no matter how willing he says he is in this House, it is not included in this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister gave certain reason why he could not do it. He said, for example, that he did not have sufficient trained teachers to make education compulsory. But I am giving him a period of seven years within which to train these teachers. It can be done. There are enough matriculation students at school to-day, particularly in the Coloured schools here in Cape Town where there are already 300,000 Coloured children at school, to enable him to have enough trained teachers within seven years to introduce compulsory education in the municipal areas. I want to assist the Minister in this respect. This is not a case of making political capital out of a situation. What political advantage can I gain from this? All I want to do is to assist him to satisfy his own people and to calm their feelings.</p>

<p>The Minister also said that he did not have enough school buildings. He said he would consider compulsory education when he had enough proper schools. When I was in Australia a year or so ago I was struck by the way the children of the so-called New Australians were being catered for. Within a period of ten years over a million of them had entered Australia: Hollanders, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Scotsmen, Germans, Austrians, etc. I was struck by the way they had looked after these people not only in respect of housing but in respect of the children as well. Let me tell you, Sir, that if the will is there it can be done. In this regard I want to call the hon. Minister&#x2019;s own Government as witness. When they established the university college for non-Whites they found the necessary money although thousands and thousands of pounds were required for it. They did not, however, let the question of money stand in their way. They carried on and erected the buildings. As far as the Coloureds are concerned I suggest Rhodes&#x2019; motto to the Minister: &#x201C;Do not wait till you have the money but build and then you will get the money&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_4635-4636" refersTo="page_0892"/>My amendment places no obligation on the Minister. It is only a qualifying amendment. It does not expect him to introduce compulsory education in distant places or in the Kalahari or wherever our Coloured people find themselves. We will not expect him to have introduced compulsory education by 1970 in small platteland schools. The amendment limits the introduction of compulsory education to municipal areas. If I can do anything further to assist the Minister I shall insert &#x201C;urban municipalities&#x201D; in my amendment. Surely he will have the facilities there in seven years&#x2019; time. If he has not succeeded ip seven years&#x2019; time he will have the greatest dissatisfaction among the Coloured people.</p>

<p>I repeat that what the Minister is planning here is not positive enough. It is not definite enough. It hangs in the air and we are making this suggestion in the interests of himself and his Department. That is all I want to say. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will once again reconsider what he has said this evening and accept this amendment; if not here then in any case in the Other Place.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hillbrow (Dr. Steenkamp) said that if the hon. the Minister was not able to implement compulsory education within a period of seven years, these people would have the right to be dissatisfied. That hon. member likes to make people believe that he is a historian, but here I want to refresh his memory somewhat as far as the history of this matter is concerned. In 1947 when the United Party was in power they introduced an ordinance in the Cape Province making provision for compulsory education for Coloured people. The United Party remained in power in the Provincial Council in the Cape for eight years after this date, that is to say, until 1954. I would like hon. members on the other side to rise and tell this House honestly what the United Party achieved during that period of eight years in regard to compulsory education. They want to compel the hon. the Minister by means of this Bill to make provision for compulsory education for Coloured children throughout the Republic within a period of seven years.</p>

<p>You are reading my amendment incorrectly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member qualified his statement by saying that it would only be confined to certain municipalities. But that is not what is requested in the amendment. The hon. member for Hillbrow qualified his remarks just now when he said that he would have no objection if it was confined simply to certain large urban municipalities. But let me come back to the question that I put to hon. members opposite in regard to the ordinance of 1946. I want to tell the House what the results were of the efforts which the United Party made in this connection during that period of eight years as far as I can remember, during that period from 1946 to 1954, only two rural school boards introduced compulsory legislation. If I remember correctly, the one school board was the school board of Cradock. Not one single United Party school board introduced compulsory education.</p>

<p>The discussion on this matter this evening has been quite objective up to the present but I do not want us to lose sight of the facts. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. P. Basson) was a member of the United Party, a very important member, during the period to which I refer. Indeed, he was an organizer of that party. It does not help to try to avoid historical facts. I repeat: The United Party was not able to achieve anything in the Cape in regard to compulsory education during that period. There were a few reasons for this. They did not have the funds available or else they were not prepared to introduce compulsory education, but if that was the case then it was purely and simply deceit as far as the Coloureds were concerned. I do not want to make this accusation this evening but hon. members opposite must accept one fact and that is that this side of the House has carried out all the promises that it made, including those made to the non-Whites in this country. I do not want to read out quotations to prove this unless it becomes necesary to do so. As it happens, I have here a pamphlet which was drawn up in 1948 by the late Dr. Malan in connection with Coloured education. When I consider the policy set out in this pamphlet in regard to this matter, I feel that we on this side need not be ashamed because we have done everything predicted in this pamphlet. We have carried out all our promises.</p>

<p>We are the guardians of the non-Whites, including the Coloured people. The time has now come for the United Party to give this side of the House an opportunity to do what it has promised to do. This will be in the interests of South Africa, of the White people and also of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>No, I came there later. At any rate I should like to know from the hon. member whether he does not think that it was wrong of the United Party not to have done anything. In fact he did try to show that it was wrong of the United Party not to have done anything during those eight years. But now when we propose to set a date, he opposes it. And vet he argued in favour of the amendment which was moved by the hon. member for Hillbrow. Only he does not realize it. In <span class="col_4637-4638" refersTo="page_0893"/>an endeavour to justify the Minister he is actually supporting the amendment of the hon. member for Hillbrow.</p>

<p>Now I should like to draw the attention of the hon. member to the fact that there was a commission, the Botha Commission, which in 1956 reported to the Nationalist Government where it was stated that compulsory education for the Coloureds should be started. Well, we are already in 1963&#x2014;years later&#x2014;and yet the Government has done nothing. This proves the danger of legislation without fixing a date. We must stipulate a date; if we do not, we shall never make a start. I admit that the hon. the Minister has a very difficult task to overcome even in regard to school accommodation required for the present pupils and if he is going to postpone the introduction of compulsory education for the Coloureds until he has enough schools, neither he nor I nor any of our grandchildren will see compulsory education introduced. I say therefore that there is nothing wrong to have a specified date.</p>
