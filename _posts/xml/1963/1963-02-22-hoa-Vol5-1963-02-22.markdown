<question by="#henwood" to="#minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development">

<num>*I.</num>

<from>Capt. HENWOOD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development:</p>

<block name="quote">Whether any steps are taken by his Department to prevent, squatters from congregating in or infiltrating into local authority areas where there is no influx control and which adjoin local authority areas in which influx control is applied; and, if so, what steps.</block>

</question>

<answer by="#deputy_minister_of_bantu_administration_and_development" to="#henwood">

<from>The DEPUTY MINISTER OF BANTU ADMINISTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT:</from>

<block name="quote">The provisions of Section 10 of the Natives (Urban Areas) Consolidation Act, 1945 (Act No. 25 of 1945), which relate to influx control, apply to the areas of all local authorities as defined in the Act. In addition, a form of influx control is exercised under Section 23 of the above Act (i.e. registration of service contracts) and/or the labour bureau system, in most urban areas. In those smaller local authority areas where, because of shortage of staff, etc., the Department of Bantu Administration and Development has reason to believe that influx control measures are not satisfactory, its staff of inspectors keep a watchful eye on the position and, where necessary, give assistance to the local authorities.</block>

<heading>Application of Concentrated Mining Technique</heading>

<question by="#weiss" to="#minister_of_mines">

<num>*XI.</num>

<from>Mrs. WEISS</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Mines:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a report in the <i>Cape Times</i> of 9 February 1963, in which a new mining technique is described as concentrated mining; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement on the nature of this new technique and its effect upon the life of existing gold mines.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_mines" to="#weiss">

<from>The MINISTER OF MINES:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) The technique known as concentrated mining may be generally described as&#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(a) the concentration of stopping operations (i.e. the actual breaking of ground for the mill) in fewer stopes;</li>

<li>(b) the attainment, with the same face length, of a higher rate of face advance and increased tonnage output per stope in order to maintain the tonnage hoisted;</li>

<li><span class="col_1771-1772" refersTo="page_0900"/>(c) the replacement of timber Supports by steel supports which are easier to transport and place in position and which can be reclaimed for further use after controlled caving of the forked-out area; and</li>

<li>(d)the speedy clearing of broken or by new techniques in mechanical scraping.</li>

</ol></li>

</ol>

<p>The main advantages claimed for concentrated mining are&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(i) improved ventilation and ground control resulting in improved working conditions and reduction in accidents;</li>

<li>(ii) economies in supervising personnel, in labour complements and in loading and haulage facilities</li>

<li>(iii) greater utilization of, hence lower investment -in, services, machinery and equipment; and</li>

<li>(iv) facilitation of mining at greater depths.</li>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his Department has advertised overseas for (a) engineers, (b) other professional staff and (c) technicians; if so, (i) for how many and (ii) for what purpose; and</li>

<li>(2) whether present members of the staff will be promoted in order to retain their seniority over such newly recruited staff; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_water_affairs" to="#mitchell">

<from>The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) Yes.

<ol>

<li>(i) No number was mentioned in the advertisement.</li>

<li>(ii) For the purpose of filling 11 existing vacant posts and a limited number of additional posts requested by the Department of Water Affairs for the 1963-4 financial year in connection with its commitments in regard to the development of water resources and the control of municipal and industrial effluents in accordance with the requirements of the Water Act. 1956.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(b) No.</li>

<li>(c) No.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) No. because it is unnecessary to promote present members of the permanent staff in order to maintain their seniority in relation to newly appointed staff from overseas.

<p><span class="col_1777-1778" refersTo="page_0903"/>Newly recruited engineering staff will be appointed in a temporary capacity on contract for a period of three years. After satisfactory completion of the contract period they can be appointed on contract for a further three-year period, if they so wish. As engineers under contract they will be carried against permanent posts on the fixed establishment, but they will not be appointed in such posts. Until such time as they become naturalized and are taken up in permanent posts, they will not come into competition with existing permanent staff as regards seniority.</p>

<p>Before appointment on contract their academic qualifications will be checked and their post-graduate experience evaluated by the Public Service Commission in consultation with the Department. Depending on the result of such evaluation they will be allocated, on appointment, to the appropriate Grade III, Grade II or Grade I engineers rank. Their commencing salary notch on the scale applicable to the grade in question will also be determined by their postgraduate experience. Because of their possible later permanent appointment on the fixed establishment of the Department. they will be placed, for future seniority purposes, at the base of the group of present incumbents within the grade to which their post-graduate experience qualifies them. Consequently, the seniority of no member of the fixed establishment wilt be detrimentally affected.</p>

<p>The seniority of staff members occupying a lower rank than the one in which the newly recruited candidate is carried after appointment can also not be detrimentally affected. In terms of the Public Service Commission&#x2019;s scheme of continuous progression, as applied to Grade III, Grade II and Grade I engineers, such staff members progress automatically to the succeeding grade or grades after they have completed the prescribed qualifying periods in their existing grade, subject to their passing an efficiency test.</p>

<p>The afore-mentioned procedure has been in force in the Department for a considerable time and has proved itself to be equitable and has throughout been favourably accepted by the staff of the Department.</p>

<p>It is not expected that any engineer recruited overseas will qualify for appointment in a post with higher grading than that of Engineer Grade I. but, should this nevertheless happen, every such case will be treated on its merits at a high level consultation with the Public Service Commission, and with due cognizance taken of all the circumstances.</p></li>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_justice" to="#hopewell">

<from>The MINISTER OF JUSTICE:</from>

<p>The Cape Civil Service Pension Fund and the Transvaal Administrative and Clerical Service Pension Fund were amalgamated in 1936 in terms of Section 46 of the Government Service Pensions Act, 1936, to form one fund called the &#x201C;joint pre-Union fund&#x201D;, Since 1936 no separate records have been maintained in respect of the former Cape Civil Service Pension Fund. The following information is, however, furnished in regard to the joint pre-Union fund:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) An amount of R3,409.571 stood to the credit of the joint pre-Union fund as at 31 March 1962.</li>

<li>(2) The income accruing to that fund and the expenditure in respect of benefits were as follows: &#x2014;

<ol>

<li>(i) Financial year 1959-60: Income R183.273: Expenditure R644.342:</li>

<from>The MINISTER OF WATER AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>Yes, subject to the following remarks:</p>

<p>The volume of the construction and relative activities of the Department of Water Affairs vary from time to time, depending on the voting of funds by Parliament, national circumstances, economical conditions, etc. The staff of the construction division of the Department are mainly temporary employees, as is also customary practice in the building industry.</p>

Section 3 (2) of the Water Act. 1956, specifically provides for the appointment of certain temporary employees in the Department of Water Affairs for the purpose of the investigation or construction of specific projects or schemes on the site of such investigational or constructional activities.</p>

<p>The section concerned reads as follows:</p>

<p>(2) The Minister or, if authorized thereto by him. the Secretary or any other <span class="col_1789-1790" refersTo="page_0909"/>officer of the department may from time to time appoint such temporary engineers, surveyors, clerks or other employees as may be necessary to enable the functions of the department to be exercised: Provided that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) appointments made in terms of this sub-section shall be limited to duties performed at the site where the Department is engaged in actual constructional or investigational work or which bear a direct relationship to specific projects or schemes under construction or under investigation;</li>

<li>(b) the scales of the salaries, allowances, leave privileges and other conditions of employment applicable in relation to any employees so appointed shall be as laid down by the Minister from time to time after consultation with the Public Service Commission.</li>

</ol>

<p>Posts on the permanent establishment of the Department are created, abolished or maintained on the recommendation of the Public Service Commission, in terms of Section 6 of the Public Service Act, No.</p>

<p>54 of 1957. after consultation between the Public Service Commission on the one hand and the Department and the Treasury on the other hand.</p>

<p>Incumbents of temporary posts in the construction division, or other division engaged in similar activities, are free to apply, after a period of satisfactory service, for a transfer to other divisions of the Department where permanent officials are employed and for appointment in vacant posts on he permanent establishments of such divisions. The Minister of Water Affairs and his Department are always prepared to consider on merits, applications of daily paid members of the staff of the Department for appointment in vacant posts on the permanent establishment, after a period of satisfactory service, provided they comply with the requirements of the Public Service Act.</p>

<li>(2) All wage determinations published since 1959 provide for higher wages for most categories of employees. Wages are prescribed for classes of employees without distinction on the basis of race or colour and in most determinations a wage differentiation on an area basis is applied. This is particularly the case where a determination applies to both urban and rural areas. Only minimum wages are laid down and in order to determine to what extent employees have benefited by the higher wages prescribed it will be necessary to ascertain the wages received by each individual employee before and after the date on which the determination <span class="col_1793-1794" refersTo="page_0911"/>applicable to him came into operation, This would be a major task and I regret that it is not possible to furnish the desired information.</li>

<heading>MINIMUM WAGES</heading>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House requests the Government to institute a system of minimum wages applicable to all workers with due regard to regional differences in the cost of living and to the value of wages paid in kind, with a view to&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) ensuring that all workers are paid a living wage;</li>

<li>(b) increasing the internal market; and</li>

<li>(c) combating malnutrition.</li>

</ol>

<p>This motion emphasizes a national minimum real wage. I say that it emphasizes the word &#x201C;real&#x201D; because, Sir, it envisages variations of minimum wage rates according to regional differences in living costs, and also takes into consideration wages paid in kind. But subject to these variations, and providing that allowances are accurately determined and fairly applied, the motion recommends a uniform and comprehensive national minimum wage, less than which no employer should be allowed to pay to an. able-bodied adult worker.</p>

<p>I want to stress at the outset that this does not mean of course that it is contemplated that the fixation of national minimum wages in individual industries or occupations should preclude collective bargaining. On the contrary, as has been expressed before, it is the policy of my party to extend the benefits of collective bargaining to the categories of labour to which at present this is denied. I do not also intend to imply by this motion that the restrictions which reduce productivity of African labour and also their wages, should not be withdrawn. Again, it is the pronounced policy of my party that restrictions on mobility, restrictions such as job reservation, which tend to restrict the earning capacity of the Africans should, of course, be withdrawn. The general objective in the motion itself is to ensure the payment of a living wage, to extend the internal market and to combat malnutrition. Now. to some extent, Sir, both the extension of a living wage to all workers and the combating of malnutrition are one and the same thing but, of course, not entirely. As I propose to show, hundreds of thousands of unskilled workers are at present earning starvation wages, and simply to enforce a living wage on which the worker can at least support himself and his family is the primary objective, but the enforcement of a mere subsistence standard can hardly be really called a living wage; a living wage involves a higher standard; it involves a standard which includes more than simply a poverty datum line; it involves more than supplying simply the bare necessities of life; it at least implies also some of the ordinary amenities of life in addition to bare subsistence living. In other words, the sort of standard which I propose would be one <span class="col_1797-1798" refersTo="page_0913"/>which would raise man above what I call a &#x201C;mieliepap&#x201D; standard, which would enable them to buy the products of agriculture, of the canning industry, of the furniture factories, of the shoe factories, of the sugar industry. And thereby my second objective would be achieved, which is, namely, the expansion of the internal market in South Africa, which is something I believe that even the hon. member for Cradock would probably appreciate and support. I contend that the extension of the internal market would in itself stimulate the national economy as a whole and thereby of course benefit classes beyond those of the actual persons receiving the higher wages which I am advocating to-day., Before going on to a detailed examination of the proposition, I should perhaps mention something about the sort of machinery which would be necessary before this could be implemented. I envisage some sort of semi-judicial tribunal, some type of judicial tribunal, with wide powers of investigation and of inquiry, and with jurisdiction which would embrace the entire labour field. I envisage that it would be necessary to set up some such form of machinery. The Wage Board does, of course, conduct inquiries, but I believe it is completely overburdened with Work, and it would be impossible to load existing machinery with further work, and therefore I propose that special machinery would have to be set up in order to conduct the initial investigation which obviously must precede such a step. One needs a thorough and comprehensive inquiry into the whole field of wages in kind and of cost of living in the different regions. It is not difficult to find precedents of such machinery. They exist in other countries, particularly Australia and New Zealand, which countries, I might mention, are similar to ours in that the greater percentage of their export trade lies in primary products.</p>

<p>The support for this motion in brief is as follows: Firstly, the vast majority of workers in South Africa live in desperate poverty, and the low wages are, of course, the main reason for this poverty, and in turn this poverty has led to malnutrition and disease on a large scale in this country. Now I am not saying that there are no White workers who suffer from poverty and who have got malnutrition. I do not say that only African workers suffer the twin diseases of poverty and malnutrition. But since the vast bulk of our working force, and particularly our unskilled labour force, is made up of Africans and not White workers generally, it is obviously to those workers that I am directing the major attention in this particular debate. Secondly, I contend that such poverty is unnecessary in so far as South Africa possesses economic resources which, if properly used and properly organized, should immediately alleviate and should certainly ultimately eliminate such poverty and such disease. Thirdly, I propose that minimum wages are an essential part of this alleviation, the alleviation of existing conditions, and finally I say that the entire well-being and prosperity of the whole country and an expansion of the national economy of the country as a whole would accompany such measures. I want to elaborate on each one of these propositions.</p>

<p>Firstly I think that the evidence as far as the first proposition is concerned, is overwhelming. All of us have seen poverty-datum surveys which have been conducted over the last few years by highly reputable and authoritative bodies which reveal that there is a wide gap between the pay of the unskilled workers in this country and the minimum that is required to maintain the worker and his family in reasonable health and decency. In 1951, the well-known survey of the Institute of Race Relations revealed that at that time &#x00A3;24 3s. 3d. per month (R48.32) was required as a minimum per month for a family of five living in the urban areas. In Pretoria in 1961, a similar survey was carried out by the University of South Africa for the Bureau of Market Research and that disclosed a corresponding figure of R43 per month as the minimum essential amount needed to provide a family of five in that area with the ordinary decencies of life.</p>

<p>In fact I would call them the " subsistence decencies of life&#x201D;, not the additional amenities which, as I say, would raise man above the so-called &#x201C;mieliepap&#x201D; standard. Now, according to Professor Steenkamp in his article in the <i>South African Journal of Economics</i> for June 1962, the average monthly earnings of Africans in private manufacturing and construction were about R26 per month in 1959 and about R3l a month in 1961. Now I must mention that Professor Steenkamp's figures include not only the unskilled workers, but also semi-skilled workers. So one can readily imagine that the real position as far as unskilled workers is concerned would be even worse than these averages tend to indicate. But these figures in any case, I must point out, are representative only of the better paid unskilled workers. Professor Hobart Houghton conducted a survey of the Cape border region, which was published last year, and his survey revealed that less than &#x00A3;6 or R12 is the average monthly income of an African family of five in King William&#x2019;s Town, and it disclosed further that in East London only 10 per cent of the African workers there, earned more than R30 a month. Now there is not very much data available in regard to. farm wages <i>per se,</i> but it is generally known that they vary widely in the different localities, and it is also known that the remuneration is largely in kind, and a very small proportion of that remuneration is in cash.</p>

<p>A survey was conducted a couple of years ago by Margaret Roberts also on behalf of the Institute of Race Relations in the Albany and Bathurst districts, and she arrived at an average figure in cash and kind, that is including allowances for free living quarters, casual gifts, medical attention, etc., of &#x00A3;8 18s. per month for a family of roughly <span class="col_1799-1800" refersTo="page_0914"/>between six and seven. A comparatively small proportion of this figure was paid in cash.</p>

<p>Mine wages of course fall in a special category since they are based on the needs of migratory workers who in themselves are adequately fed and they are also housed by the mines. But of course mine wages are far top low, because they are based on the fallacious assumption that the Reserves are able to supply a proper subsistence for the families of those migratory workers. I must also add that mine wages are based not only on conditions in South Africa but on the economic conditions in adjoining territories which, as we know, supply more than 50 per cent of the labour requirements of the mines, and this too has had a tendency to keep down the average wages on the mines. Despite rises over the last few years and certain schemes which are now being considered, schemes to increase wages and productivity, mine wages too are lamentably low.</p>

<p>The consequences to the families of all these workers and indeed the workers themselves, other than the cases where the workers themselves at least are adequately fed, the consequences in deprivation and disease, of low earnings and the tremendous gap between what is required for mere poverty-datum standards of living and the wages that are paid are exactly what one would expect them to be. Last October, Dr. Mitchell, who is the M.O.H. of the Gape Divisional Council, warned the annual conference of the Institute of Public Health in East London of the mounting incidence of diseases such as kwashiorkor, gastro-enteritis, pellagra, tuberculosis, etc., which are all either due to, or are in fact malnutrition diseases themselves, or are aggravated by malnutrition, and he warned too that the mortality rate due to them has now assumed the proportions of a national crisis. At a recent hospital survey in the Cape, 54 per cent of the non-White children were severely under-weight per age and as many as 17 per cent were at a level than can be accepted as indicative of gross starvation. These are the words of Dr. Hansen, who is the associate Professor of Child Health at Cape Town University. In his address to the same conference&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The total mortality rate for all causes on the age group one to four shows that Bantu children are dying at 25 times and Coloured children at 15 times the rate of White children.</block>

<block name="quote">There is a close association of protein calorie deficiency with overall mortality rates.</block>

<p>Sir, none of these figures come from any other but the most authoritative medical sources, not only that but they have also been published in State documents, one of which I am now going to quote.</p>

<p>How do these figures compare with those from the rest of Africa?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>There we have this argument again. I do not consider South Africa an under-developed country, unlike the hon. gentleman; I consider South Africa a modern industrial state, and therefore 1 do not expect the incidence of malnutrition in South Africa to be the same as malnutrition in the rest of Africa, although I might tell the hon. member there that in some cases it is even worse than the malnutrition figures elsewhere in Africa. Now in Cape Town, according to the M.O.H., 100 times as many non-White as White children die per year of gastro-enteritis, and it is a known medical fact that mortality in gastroenteritis is closely related to malnutrition. In the eight major urban areas alone some 10,000 non-White infants die annually of gastroenteritis. Last year the Minister of Health informed me in this House in response to a question that the annual morbidity rate of tuberculosis amongst African children under five is 9,469. The corresponding figure for White children is 161. The general infant mortality rates of African children are simply appalling, varying from over 200 per 1,000 in the cities to 300 to 400 in some of the rural areas. The corresponding figure for White children is 27, which, to our credit, is one of the lowest in the world, whilst the African figure is one of the highest recorded figures in the world. Now kwashiorkor is considered medically as being the index of the general state of malnutrition in a community. According to the C.S.I.R. Report, No. 190 on Nutritional Deficiency, kwashiorkor was found in 5 per cent of the Bantu children treated by doctors who assisted in the study. The hon. the Minister himself told us last year that it was estimated that 22,000 children in Cape Town and vicinity alone had kwashiorkor; nearly 3,000 cases have been notified since the Minister&#x2014;something to his credit&#x2014;last year declared kwashiorkor a notifiable disease. Already more than 3,000 cases have been notified, and as the C.S.I.R. report itself said, it can be assumed that the actual incidence of the disease is much higher than is suggested by the figures reported. Indeed, some epidemiologists actually suggest that plus/minus 20 per cent of cases in fact are ever reported. Now kwashiorkor is considered by medical men as an index of the general state of nutrition in a country. It is also medically considered only as a disease which occurs in undeveloped countries. Medical men do not find kwashiorkor in the normally developed countries, and, as I said before, I am one of those who would like to consider South Africa as a modern industrial country and not as an undeveloped African territory, and therefore it is quite immaterial whether or not &#x2014;and in fact in some cases it is not the case&#x2014; South Africa&#x2019;s figures compare favourably with those of other African territories.</p>

<p>I know that there is a slick answer which is given to all this by Government spokesmen, and even unfortunately on occasions by the Minister of Health. This slick answer is that malnutrition has nothing whatever to do with poverty or low earnings, but is due to the culture of the Africans who do not appreciate the value of milk and among whom the men customarily eat before the women and children. <span class="col_1801-1802" refersTo="page_0915"/>leaving nothing for the latter. That was the answer given by the hon. the Minister of Health to the Institute of Public Health last October, and I sincerely hope that neither he nor other members of this House will have the effrontery to repeat it.</p>

<p>Do you deny it?</p>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Of course. Anyone who knows anything about the customs of the Africans will know what an important part milk played in their diet, especially sour milk. Anyone who knows anything about the customs of the Africans when they were able to hunt will know the importance of meat in their diet. It is not the normal diet of Africans to live on maize and mealie-meal. That was imposed on them by the restrictions cf land, by their poverty and their inability to earn productive wages and to buy protective foods. This is not a normal feature of the natural African diet, and everyone who takes the trouble to look at our history will observe the fallacy of the absurd statement that it is due to ignorance only that the Africans suffer from malnutrition. I do not deny that there is much room for education about food values, but to put ignorance of food values down as the primary cause for the appalling rate of malnutrition in this country is self-deception of the worst sort. The obvious and most glaring cause of it is poverty and low wages. It was disclosed in Durban recently that 60 per cent of African workers whose cases were investigated had no breakfast at all and that a large number of African schoolchildren in Durban and other areas where similar investigations were carried out had nothing whatever to eat until supper-time. Is it an old African custom, I wonder, for Africans to starve themselves and their children to this extent? Of course it is not.</p>

<p>The Minister of Health and other hon. members like the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) the other day waxed indignant about the campaign which was waged to its very great credit by the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> last year against the level of malnutrition and starvation in this country. I think there is another Private Member&#x2019;s Motion on this subject on the Order Paper. I am hoping that the hon. member will think about withdrawing his motion from the Order Paper in the face of the facts and figures I am quoting to-day. But the Minister of Health said of that campaign that it created the impression that the Blacks were suffering through the inaction of the Whites and the articles provided ammunition for our opponents at UN. I suppose the obvious conclusion to draw from that is that we must suppress the facts and let people continue to starve and suffer from malnutrition, and in that way we will not give ammunition to our opponents at UN. But does it not occur to hon. members that if we did something about this problem and improved the whole position in regard to malnutrition, that that would destroy the ammunition of our opponents? It may very well be that the poverty and the malnutrition suffered by the vast mass of workers may not be due to the inaction of the White people generally, but it is certainly the responsibility of any modern Government to see that its people are properly housed, fed and clothed, according to the available national resources. As I mentioned before, this is not an undeveloped country. We have resources, and in view of our resources, malnutrition in this country is nothing but a national scandal.</p>

<p>This brings me to my second proposition, and that is to prove that the country has the resources immediately anyway to alleviate and ultimately to eliminate poverty and low wages. I do not think it is necessary for me to discourse at large about the natural resources of South Africa. All of us know about our fabulous gold and other mineral deposits. We know that there are pastoral activities which can be carried on with a great deal of profit. I simply mention it again to make the point that the existing conditions of poverty and malnutrition cannot be explained by the lack of natural resources and the inherent poverty of this country as they can be explained in other territories in Africa and in India, where there is also a considerable amount of malnutrition. The natural poverty of those countries can be counted responsible to a large extent for the malnutrition there, but that is not so in South Africa. Our natural resources should be sufficient to ensure an adequate standard of living for all our people. There is plenty of evidence to show that wages and the existing purchasing power are inadequate to ensure the consumption of even current production. It is notorious that in this country, side by side with semi-starvation and even outright starvation at certain times and places, surpluses continue to accumulate of essential foodstuffs so desperately needed by the poor. It is common cause, too, that we are exporting many of the protective foods at a loss. It was reported three years ago that 370,000 gallons of so-called surplus skimmed milk were destroyed in 12 months on the Rand alone. Medical opinion is to the effect that half a pint of skimmed milk a day will suffice to maintain a child in health, and this would therefore be more than enough to wipe out the whole annual death toll of gastroenteritis in our cities and to put an end to kwashiorkor. At the end of April last year 17,000,000 lbs. of butter was stored, 4,700,000 lbs. of which was destined for export at a loss of 15 cents per lb. Stocks of factory cheese stood at 9,000,000 lbs., and that was to be disposed of at a loss of 10 cents per lb. Mutton, eggs and ground-nuts are also exported at a price below the domestic price, according to the figures given to us by the Minister of Agriculture. Not only is the public being called upon to bear the loss, but in addition we have to bear the cost of treating malnutrition and malnourished children in hospitals, children who should never have been ill had their parents&#x2019; income been sufficient to buy protective foods. Dr. Hansen of the Department of Child Health at the University of Cape Town estimated that the cost of hospitalization of a malnourished child is R10 a day, enough to supply adequate protein for <span class="col_1803-1804" refersTo="page_0916"/>that child for a whole year. I must give the hon. the Minister credit for one other thing. It is so seldom that I can do so that I do it with great pleasure when I can, and that is that possibly because he realized, having visited the Red Cross Hospital in Cape Town, the dreadful cases of malnutrition and kwashiorkor that are occurring in this town, he has recently started a pilot scheme whereby R20,000 a year has been set apart to supply powdered milk to children. I hope that this will be a permanent feature and very vastly extended, but it is something that this country has at least started pre-nursery school feeding for young children, and I hope it is a tendency which the Government will encourage in future.</p>

<p>Now, turning to my next proposition, the essential need for properly regulated minimum wages, the first point I must make is to point to the extreme mal distribution of the national income in South Africa. In other industrial countries the difference between skilled and unskilled wages is about 30 per cent, but in this country it varies between 400 per cent and 500 per cent. As long ago as 1925 the Economic and Wages Commission pointed out that one of the great drawbacks to South Africa&#x2019;s development was this wide disparity between unskilled and skilled wage rates; and I want to point out that this disparity is increasing and not decreasing. Mr. Katzen of the University of Cape Town, in an article in the <i>South African Journal of Economics</i> in 1961, pointed out that after the war in the years between 1945 and 1959 African real wages, mostly unskilled of course, hardly rose at all in the manufacturing industry, despite a 74 per cent increase in the real national income of South Africa. White wages, on the other hand, which are mostly skilled, rose by 40 per cent. Professor Steenkamp, the Chairman of the Wage Board, in that same issue criticized some of Mr. Katzen&#x2019;s findings, but did not in any way dissent from the general thesis that African real wages rose very little in the years in question and that the gap between skilled and unskilled wages tended to increase. I want to say at this juncture that although for 14 years, between 1945 and 1959, the wages of unskilled workers remained practically static, over the last three years some attempts have been made by the Wage Board to increase unskilled wages. In reply to a question I asked, I ascertained that something like 54 wage determinations in the unskilled trades have been made by the Wage Board and Industrial Council agreements. But this must not be construed in any way as implying that I am satisfied with the basic minimum wages which have now been laid down. In fact, thinking employers know perfectly well that an increase in the internal market will redound to their benefit. But I am very dissatisfied with the basic minimum wages laid down, even by these new Wage Board determinations, or by conciliation agreements. Indeed, it was the very knowledge of these more recent determinations that made me stress the need for a living wage, the knowledge that they were still so pitifully low, despite the changes made in the last three years. The Minister of Labour mentioned in his address in the Other Place that a R22,000,000 increase had been paid by employers to their African workers between 1959 and 1962, but I must point out that this amount still does not bring the minimum wage up to anything like a living wage, especially&#x2014;and this is all-important&#x2014; when we remember that the cost-of-living allowances were pegged in March 1953, when the retail price index stood at 188.9, and by September 1958 the retail index had risen by</p>

<p>36.4 points, or 19.27 per cent. Since that time we have been using a new yardstick, the Consumer Price Index, but there has been a further increase of 6 per cent, so that the cost of living has risen by about 25 per cent since 1953 and wages have certainly not kept pace with that. In fact, the latest determinations presented by the Wage Board show that these wages are still hopelessly short of the poverty-datum line. The weekly minimum wage of unskilled workers&#x2014;I am taking a few examples at random&#x2014; in heavy industries such as stone-crushing, ceramics and allied industries ranges from a miserable R5.50 per week to R7.90. Industrial Council agreements are not much better. For the textile manufacturing it is R6.88 a week, to the furniture industry where it is R7.50, and all these figures include cost of living. How a family can come out on these miserable wages, taking the whole R22,000,000 increase which the Minister of Labour boasted about the other day into account, is beyond me. It is true that Professor Steenkamp, in his article, referred to an annual increase of 2.4 per cent and calls this eminently satisfactory, but I disagree profoundly. Firstly, I want to point out that this does not even keep pace with the average annual increase in prices, and secondly I think that Professor Steenkamp might have had a case for calling this rise eminently satisfactory if the increase had been based on anything approximating a living wage originally, but when they started from so far below par, a</p>

<p>2.4 per cent raise is negligible, and indeed I want to point out that the disparity between wages and their buying power is continuing to increase. It certainly has not been sufficient to arrest the widening of the gap between skilled and unskilled wage rates. The point I am trying to make is that if in the categories of work where statutory wage regulations have been imposed the rise has been so low, can one imagine what it must be like in occupations where there have been no increases due to legislation and there are no determinations? It is extremely unlikely that in such occupations there have been rises anything like in keening with the general rise in the cost of living. This means that the real wages of workers have been falling and continue to fall, despite the big increase that took place in our real national income in the post-war years. I would say that Professor Steenkamp really supplies unwittingly one of the best arguments for the introduction of statutory minimum wages, because he points out that in the whole period between 1935 and 1961 such increases in real wages for unskilled workers as have taken place were due almost <span class="col_1805-1806" refersTo="page_0917"/>entirely to Government action, to wage determinations, cost-of-living regulations, etc. Surely this strengthens the argument for a minimum statutory wage.</p>

<p>At this juncture I want to deal with the rather silly argument which is often advanced by hon. members opposite when the question of low wages is discussed. A particularly vehement exponent of this argument is the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee), who unfortunately is not here now. His cry, and that of other hon. members, is: Let the employers raise wages; what stops them? I will tell the hon. member what stops them. It shows very clearly that they do not have the slightest understanding of the basic mechanism of a competitive market. No single employer of labour is going to cost himself out of the market unless he knows that his competitors will raise their wages as well. In any case, economic history has proved over and over again that the profit-motive rather than philanthropy is the guiding principle in business. It is precisely for this reason that the State has taken action in other countries and that workers&#x2019; movements such as trade unions have developed there. I see the hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) smiling, surely in approval, since he knows the history of labour movements in this country. I want to point out that the gold-mining industry is in a slightly different category. I am not excluding the low wages they pay, but they are in a different category, for the simple reason that that industry does not have to worry about competition in selling its end product. But the gold mining industry has other problems, largely due to State action taken by all Governments in South Africa since 1911. The gold-mining industry has to cope with the implementation of stringent job reservation on the mines, which makes flexibility in organizing its labour force very difficult. It also has to cope with a strong White trade union movement which has resisted any reclassification of jobs on the mines as long as possible. All these factors make for inflexibility in the wage and labour structure on the gold mines. I want to repeat, however, that I believe those wages are in any case too low, because they are based on the fallacy that the reserves are supporting the families and they are based on the living standards of countries beyond our borders where economic standards are even lower and which supply over 50 per cent of our labour, and they are also based on the monopsonistic practice of fixing the maximum average wage above which no mine will pay its workers. So I am not holding any brief for the payment of low wages on the mines, although they have additional problems over and above those of other industries.</p>

<p>I must now deal with what I conceive to be the main objection to my proposal, and that is of course the classical argument that wages are essentially determined by the supply of workers and the demand for their services; in other words, that there is ordinary market competition between employers and that the bargaining between them and the workers in the end fixes the wage which is roughly equal to the market value of labour, and that any attempt to fix a higher minimum wage will result either in unemployment or in an inflationary spiral, which would nullify the effect of any rise in wages. I must say at once that the argument about free competition automatically fixing the wage level has been used all over the world and nowhere has it prevailed. The general trend in an industrial society is to fix a minimum wage for different occupations either by statutory action or as the result of collective bargaining. This indicates that the old supply and demand theory of labour has largely been abandoned in practice. The validity of this argument depends on certain economic conditions, which in fact are nowhere to be found. This perfect competitive world does not exist. It depends on a labour market where there are large number of buyers (the employers of labour), and numbers of sellers (the workers or the sellers of labour), with a perfect knowledge on both sides of all the relevant economic opportunities, and it depends on the mobility of labour both geographically and occupationally, and none of this of course corresponds to conditions even in the real world, let alone South Africa, where of course conditions are completely hamstrung: by all sorts of restrictions. Here the non-White worker is discriminated against as compared with the White worker, both in the field of education and in the field of training. The African is in a particularly bad position. The effect of the laws applying to him is to destroy his bargaining power and to place him entirely at the mercy of his White employer. His mobility is impeded by pass laws and influx control, thus preventing him from selling his labour in the best market, which one would think is one of the most basic individual freedoms. And in industrial areas, even if the man has the right to be here, very often permission for him to remain in employment in the urban areas is made conditional on his remaining in the service of a particular employer, which places the employer in a position of absolute power over that man, who may not ask for higher wages and may not seek to sell his labour to an employer who would be prepared to pay him higher wages. We know that the African&#x2019;s occupational mobility is impeded not only by these discriminations, but also by statutory prohibitions such as the Mines and Works Act and job reservation, where it is implemented in the secondary industrial field, and incidentally indirectly through the Industrial Conciliation Act itself, because of the reason that an African cannot join a trade union, very often closed shop agreements and lack of training mean that he cannot become a skilled worker. Thus his whole capacity to improve his wage earning status is inhibited, and this not only diminishes his value in this age of technological changes but results also in his actually being a drag on increased productivity. I could mention other restrictions such as the Urban Areas Act and the Group Areas Act, all of <span class="col_1807-1808" refersTo="page_0918"/>which make the African entirely dependent on the White man for his economic activities. Therefore it is not surprising, especially when such people are also denied all the normal benefits of collective bargaining, their earnings should tend to fall instead of rising.</p>

<p>I mentioned right at the outset that it is the policy of my party to remove all such restrictions, to strengthen as far as possible the collective bargaining power of the general body of workers and to extend education and technical training to Africans. All this would help enormously, but experience has shown that such measures would not in themselves be adequate to ensure social and economic justice or national prosperity. National minimum wages, I might point out, are imposed in the U.S.A., where there are no restrictions on mobility of labour or the productivity of labour.</p>

<p>Now I want to deal with the argument that an increase in money wages must inevitably be offset by increased costs or would result in unemployment. The whole basis of this argument rests on the assumption that the productivity of labour will remain constant and that the internal market will not expand. Neither local conditions nor experience elsewhere show that these assumptions are necessarily valid. Taking labour productivity first, I think it has been recognized ever since the days of Adam Smith that to pay labour less than is necessary to maintain just minimum standards of health and strength will adversely affect the worker&#x2019;s productivity and efficiency. An increase in wages, therefore, just up to the poverty-datum line would necessarily result in higher productivity of labour generally. I want to quote two modern Adam Smiths. The first is Dr. W. J. de Villiers, the Consulting Engineer of the Anglo American Corporation, in an article in <i>Optima</i> in December 1962. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Increased all-round productivity and considerably higher wages for Natives are urgent prerequisites for the South African healthy growth of the South African economy in the future. To argue that higher Native productivity should come first, or to make the one a condition of the other, is beside the point.</block>

<p>Mr. Hugo, the General Manager of Railways, said in October 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Before we take out the whip for higher productivity, we must ensure that these people have at least a living wage. In this decision I have tried to give a living wage before I say, &#x201C;Now, Jim, I want you to work harder.&#x201D;</block>

<p>As is borne out by the experience of other industrial countries, furthermore, an increase in wages applies the necessary pressure to management&#x2014;and this is very important in South Africa, where we use labour most wastefully&#x2014;an increase in wages applies the necessary pressure to management to reorganize in the interests of efficiency, to eliminate waste and, in some occupations, to mechanize. It is high time that we discarded this cheap labour fallacy in South Africa. It results in a high labour turnover and the most wasteful use of our most valuable natural resources. And of course one must also remember the effect of competition. In a competitive market the tendency will be for employers to try to employ their labour far more efficiently, and as the result any increased cost should be offset by increased efficiency.</p>

<p>As to the home market, it is obvious that the initial effect of a general wage increase for the lower-paid workers must be to expand buying power and hence the demand for the products of industry and agriculture. The whole idea is to raise people to the standard where they can consume the goods produced and so create a higher internal market. President Kennedy said in an address only the other day, " Consumer spending is the key to boom conditions&#x201D;, and I am quite sure that what applies to America applies equally in South Africa. The whole economy is being restricted to-day by the fact that we have such a small internal market due to the low consumer power of the great proportion of the inhabitants of this country. Last year the President of the South African Agricultural Union, Mr. de Villiers, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There would be little left over from our annual food production if the country&#x2019;s needs were freely satisfied. An important factor for farmers in the coming year will be the ability of non-Whites to buy what we are growing.</block>

<p>The same, of course, applies to the products of industry and commerce, as has been pointed out over and over again by people such as Mr. Graham of the Midlands Chamber of Commerce and by the Bantu Wages and Productivity Association. It is quite obvious too, I hope, that an expanding home market, which would reduce unit costs of production because the economies of large-scale production could be taken advantage of by our producers, would place our export industries in a very much better competitive position in the outside world. If the human and material resources of the community are all fully employed, then of course the economy will prove incapable of responding to the demand and prices will simply rise; in other words, inflation will occur, but if there is&#x2014;and there certainly is in South Africa&#x2014;surplus industrial and agricultural capacity, unemployed or under-employed labour and unused material resources&#x2014;and I am sure that nobody would say that we have fully developed all the resources of this country or fully used all our labour or other resources&#x2014;the effect will be an expansion of production and a lowering of costs in the ultimate, which must offset the increased money costs involved immediately in higher wages. I agree, of course, that the basic thing is to create more jobs; and to create more jobs we need further investment in this country. What we need is a political climate which would encourage greater investment in this country, and I would suggest <span class="col_1809-1810" refersTo="page_0919"/>that the sort of thing that the Government is doing in the labour field is discouraging further investments. I refer to the threat of job reservation hanging over the heads of industrialists; I refer to this ridiculous Eiselen line which is going to throw all the Africans out of the Western Province. Certainly these are not conducive to improving the investment climate in South Africa. I refer to all the racial policies which are at the moment acting as a deterrent on overseas investors from investing in this country. But, Sir, the resources are there; they are unused, they are untapped, and we are simply waiting for a favourable climate of investment to be able to expand and make use of all this productive capacity which is not being used at the present stage. I must emphasize once more that the economy has ample surplus capacity and unused resources to support a general wage increase, and here too the Government can play a part by taking up any slack, by adjusting its own credit policies and adjusting its tax relief and its public works programme accordingly. There is no reason why this should not be done by the Government. It may very well be proved&#x2014;I will admit this at the outset&#x2014;I think it is high time this was said in South Africa&#x2014;it may very well be true that some uneconomic enterprises will go under. I personally see no value whatsoever in keeping alive uneconomic enterprises at the expense of the workers. It is far better to divert our productive resources into economic activities that can afford to pay adequate living wages to our workers. Far too long have we been going in for this policy of keeping marginal farmers on the land. Why should marginal farmers be kept on the land? They simply put up the cost of production throughout the country as a whole. Such people should be engaged in other activities. Why keep marginal or sub-marginal industries alive? Let those resources be diverted into proper economic activities in South Africa, and they should certainly not be kept alive at the expense of workers being paid inadequate wages which result in malnutrition and poverty and, of course, all the grievances which malnutrition and poverty bring in their wake. I say again that an essential remedy in the existing social and economic position in South Africa is the institution of a minimum living wage. That all this has to be accomplished obviously by changes in our labour policy and our economic policy generally, goes without saying, I think. It means that we must stop trying to keep millions of Africans locked up in uneconomic agricultural activity in the reserves; it means that we must stop keeping White marginal farmers or Black marginal farmers on the land; it means that we should remove al the restrictions on productivity that are at present imposed on non-White workers. Sir. the whole idea underlying job reservation and the industrial colour bar is based on the fallacy that if more Black men are employed in semi-skilled and skilled jobs it means that White workers must lose their jobs. The whole history of our industrial expansion and development in this country has moved quite the contrary. The more non-Whites are used in semi-skilled and better paid activities, the more White employment there will be at even higher levels in South Africa. The fallacious proposition only holds good in a static economy. South Africa, fortunately, does not have a static economy. It has a dynamic economy and therefore there is no reason for White workers to fear that they would lose their jobs or that their wages would be depressed&#x2014;and nobody is suggesting that they should be depressed&#x2014; if the wages of semi-skilled and unskilled workers are in fact raised.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say finally that I believe that all the changes that I have mentioned are long overdue. They have been recommended over and over again by every impartial commission that has sat in this country, and it is high time they were adopted, so that all the inhabitants of South Africa can have a share in developing and enjoying all the great potentialities that have been bestowed on this country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I repeat that the wages paid in this industry are scandalously low. These people cannot live on the minimum wage laid down. They had a weapon which they used once or twice, and that was to go on strike for better conditions, but then the Government passed a law declaring their work essential work, which prevents these people from striking for better wages. They are dependent therefore upon the farming community by whom they are engaged for the wages they receive. I say that if we approach the question of wages, particularly in this industry, which is a barometer, if we require one at all, in regard to the subject so ably introduced by the hon. member we will find, if we rid ourselves of this racial approach and racial prejudice in connection with these matters, that we will advance very much faster, to the betterment of the people for whom we are pleading now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton mentioned the position in America. I want to tell the House that a few days ago I attended a luncheon where an address was submitted by a professor from one of the universities of California, and whilst he did not refer directly to these particular questions, he did deal with the question of mass production in America, and one of the conclusions to which he came was that it is no use producing if the people who assist in the production are not able to purchase the goods produced, and I venture to suggest that the wages paid to the Coloured people particularly in the Cape Province, make it impossible for more than 90 per cent of them to purchase the very goods which they helped to produce. If they get a wage which will enable them to buy these goods it will stimulate our internal market and we would derive great benefit.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to deal with one or two questions only, and I want to refer to a conclusion which was come to by a commission, which did not deal directly with this question of wages but which dealt with family allowances. It did, however, make reference to the question of wages. I just want to quote paragraph 69 on page 22. It is headed, &#x201C;Causes of inadequate care and upbringing &#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Evidence was given regarding the role insufficient means played in causing inadequate care and upbringing of children. Reference was made to the low pay received by the father and the inadequacy of his income measured against the increased cost of living. Personal evidence was taken from a number of parents who found it difficult with the means at their disposal to provide their families with necessities. It appears that need makes itself felt in various ways. In one social group there may be a lack of daily means of subsistence; in other cases educational facilities may be lacking.</block>

<p>In this report of the Commission on Family Allowances (1961) they dealt with the difficulty experienced by people because of the low wages received by them. On the question of malnutrition I think we should quote and re-quote&#x2014;because it was quoted last year&#x2014;paragraph 316&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Probably a large proportion of the children in South Africa are malnourished because of the inadequate supply of protective and protein foods&#x2014;milk and its derivatives, eggs, fruit, vegetables and meat.</block>

<p>It goes on to show that these people suffer from malnutrition because of the poor financial position of the parents who are unable to supply the children with their requirements. Sir, notice was given in this House a few days ago by the Minister of Housing of his intention to amend the Slums Act. I venture to suggest that if people in the past had been paid a wage commensurate with their needs and requirements, a decent minimum wage, there would be a minimum of slums not only in Cape Town but throughout South Africa because it is a fact that many poor people are dependent on the goodwill of certain people for their income; they have to be housed, not one family but probably three or four families in one house, so that they can make ends meet.</p>

<p>I have said that we should approach this matter on a non-party political basis; I have said the hon. member for Houghton has dealt so adequately on this question that I do not have to speak at length. I have great pleasure in seconding this motion.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Although we on this side of the House welcome the opportunity of discussing this question, it is a pity that the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) used this opportunity to devote a large part of her speech to, and to place unnecessary emphasis upon, the problem of malnutrition amongst the non-Whites. The hon. member holds it against us that we say that this sort of speech harms the name of South Africa <span class="col_1813-1814" refersTo="page_0921"/>abroad. I am prepared to say that again to-day. I have no objection to her telling the world how much malnutrition there is amongst the non-Whites, but I do object when she makes that statement without emphasizing what the Government is doing for the non-White races in South Africa; without referring to the opportunities which are created for employment, for higher wages in new posts which the non-Whites did not occupy in South Africa before and the opportunities which are being created for better education. All these are items which contribute towards giving the non-White a higher standard of living. If the hon. member gives the world a fair picture of the position here, I have no objection at all but I do object to the unnecessary emphasis which is placed upon the question of malnutrition and to the fact that she does not want to admit that to a very large extent malnutrition amongst the non-Whites is in the first place the result of ignorance regarding food values and correct eating habits. I am sure that the hon. member has on many occasions passed some caf&#x00E9; or other and watched a non-White enter that caf&#x00E9;. Instead of buying himself a loaf of whole wheat bread, he buys a white loaf and a bottle of mineral water. I say that I am sorry that the hon. member emphasized the question of malnutrition. We agree with her that minimum wages in South Africa must be raised. The Government is sympathetic as far as this matter is concerned. We on this side do not say that we are opposed to an increase in minimum wages but we do differ from her regarding the way in which that increase should be brought about. We differ on the question as to whether it should be a minimum national wage or whether minimum wages should be determined on a regional basis, which I shall deal with in a moment. In reality the hon. member did not mention one authority in South Africa who agrees with her on this question of a national minimum wage. She did mention the name of Mr. Graham. The scheme proposed by Mr. Graham has already been analysed in various articles. The hon. member had the article in front of her because she quoted from it. In that article Professor Steenkamp has the following to say about Mr. Graham&#x2019;s scheme&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Graham&#x2019;s calculations have fascinated many people but it is clear that they rest on shaky foundations.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton went on to mention the Bantu Wages and Productivity Association. I shall tell her in a moment where even Mr. Silberbauer, the Director of that Association, expressed himself against a national minimum wage. I want to emphasize immediately that we are sympathetic as far as this question of increasing minimum wages is concerned. No decent and right-thinking South African will say that it is not in the interests of South Africa and in the interests of race relationships to increase minimum wages, and one is pleased that particularly over the last few years attention has been given to this matter. For example, attention has already been given this matter in the first place by employers. The Federated Chambers of Industry have had long discussions on this matter. The National Development Foundation has held a symposium on this question and the Economic Advisory Council has also discussed this matter on various occasions. There is one point on which we differ from the hon. member for Houghton. On many occasions in this House, the Opposition and the hon. member specifically, have accused us of imposing restrictions on the economic development of South Africa, and it is ironic that she now seeks to support us in our plea that the Government should introduce a minimum wage in South Africa, a minimum wage that will have a restrictive effect on our economy.</p>

<p>I spoke just now about the bodies which have already given attention to this matter, but there is not one of these bodies which has seen its way clear to recommend a national minimum wage or a minimum wage on a regional basis. The Federated Chambers of Industry not only declared themselves opposed to a national minimum wage, but they also decided that the wage determination machinery which exists under our wage legislation to-day was the most effective way of tackling the problem of minimum wages in South Africa except&#x2014;so the Federated Chambers of Industry said&#x2014;that it should take place more swiftly. In other words, the Federated Chambers of Industry did not see their way clear to recommend any particular method by means of which minimum wages can be laid down on a national or regional basis. This decision of the Federated Chambers of Industry was described by the <i>Star</i> of 16 March 1962, in a leading article as a &#x201C;dismaying decision &#x201D;.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton spoke about the Bantu Wages and Productivity Association. This is an association which was founded with the very object of encouraging an increase in the wages of non-Whites. It is an association which is very active in educating our people in respect of this problem and for that one must express one&#x2019;s appreciation. Nevertheless, the director of that association, Mr. Silberbauer, as I said just now, declared himself opposed to a national minimum wage or a minimum wage on a regional basis. In Bulawayo on 3 April of last year he stated&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In South Africa there is a tremendously complex industrial set-up and for that reason the establishment of minimum wages is a very difficult thing to achieve.</block>

<p>He said then that a system of minimum wages was clumsy and inflexible and that he would prefer to see recognition being given to individuals according to merit and requirements&#x2014; that they should rather be remunerated on that basis. The report goes on further to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He attacks in particular the machinery behind minimum wages and the complex investigations which are necessary before the system can be brought into being.</block>

<p><span class="col_1815-1816" refersTo="page_0922"/>I shall say something in a moment about the scheme which the hon. member for Houghton suggested. Mr. Speaker, I regard this statement as being very important in the effort to have the wages of the Bantu increased. The director of an association, whose aim is to bring about higher wages in South Africa, says that he rejects this scheme of minimum wages! As I have said, the Economic Advisory Council has also given attention to this matter on various occasions, and in his statement of 26 April 1962 the Prime Minister&#x2014;in pursuance of a meeting of the Economic Advisory Council&#x2014;stated that all the members of the Advisory Council supported the principle of increased wages most strongly but that there was a difference of opinion regarding the way in which it should be started and its scope and the tempo at which it should take place. Even the Economic Advisory Council therefore struggled with this problem but unlike the hon. member they were not hasty in suggesting a system. I also want to say immediately that the Government is very sympathetic as far as this matter is concerned. The Minister of Labour issued a statement in 1960 in which he stated the policy of the Government very clearly. In his statement of 15 November 1960 he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Government is not convinced of the fact that the introduction of a general minimum wage is the best way of bringing about the desired increase in the standard of living of the lower-paid workers. The Government and the Minister of Labour deem it advisable to strive for the desired raising of the standard of living by means of a gradual and selective increase in minimum wages.</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister stated on that occasion that it was desirable for the Wage Board to review its determinations periodically and that increases in the various spheres of industry should come into operation more swiftly. That is still the policy of the Government to-day. In terms of its policy I think that the Government has made a very important and positive contribution towards increasing minimum wages and I am sorry that the hon. member for Houghton does not want to give the Government credit for the great contribution which has been made by it over the past 15 years in respect of an increase in the wages of the non-Whites and the lower-paid workers in the country.</p>

<p>Fifteen years?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, and particularly over the last five years. I shall deal with the 15-year period in a moment. The House will remember that the hon. the Minister of Labour amended the Wage Act about five or six years ago and divided the Wage Board into two sections. He has also tried in other ways to accelerate the proceedings of the Wage Board and the result has been spectacular. The result has been that the number of determinations made by the Wage Board over the past four years has increased threefold, and that is why the hon. the Minister of Labour was able to announce in the Other Place that it was hoped that the Wage Board would be able to overtake the backlog this year. This means that all wage determinations can now be reviewed every four or five years. The effect of this will be that the lowest wage levels can be reviewed and increased more swiftly than has been the case in the past. A few days ago in the Other Place the hon. the Minister told us what had been achieved. He pointed out&#x2014;this was mentioned by the hon. member&#x2014;that from 1959 to 1962 an additional amount of R22,000,000 was paid to Bantu workers in the form of wage increases. What the Government has actually achieved only becomes clear when one realizes that the average annual wage of a non-White factory worker increased by almost 100 per cent from 1948 to 1962. That is the average annual wage. Let me give the figures. In 1948, the average annual wage of a non-White factory worker was R226. In 1962 it had increased to R443. I agree with the hon. member that this is the average wage paid to non-Whites; it is not the average wage for the Bantu nor is that the increase in the minimum wage. The average wage of a non-White worker has therefore risen by 96 per cent since 1948 and this is far higher than the cost of living has risen since 1948. We often talk about a minimum wage of R30 or R45; some people talk about R60, but let us see how the average monthly wage has increased. In 1948 the average monthly wage was R19 per head. In 1962 it already stood at R37.</p>

<p>The hon. member spoke about the difference between skilled labourers&#x2019; wages and the wages of unskilled labourers. I want to point out immediately that Professor Steenkamp drew attention to the fact that unskilled wages had risen far more rapidly over the past five years than skilled wages, and that Bantu wages have risen far more rapidly than White wages. I just want to point out that according to a report in the <i>Rand Daily Mail</i> of 1 May 1962, Professor Steenkamp pointed out that in 1958-9 the growth in real Bantu wages had amounted to 2.1 per cent while in reality there had been a drop of 0.8 per cent in the net national income per head. In 1960-1 real Bantu wages rose by 4.9 per cent in comparison with an increase of 1.9 per cent in our net national income per head. In other words, the proportion of the increase in Bantu wages over the past five years has really been phenomenal.</p>

<p>That is what the Government has achieved and I think that the Government has been successful. That is borne out by the almost general absence of industrial unrest in the country. I do not want to deal with this matter, but to-day we hardly have strikes in this country. I think that we can congratulate the Government and the hon. the Minister on what they have achieved for the whole of South Africa and for that reason I would like to move this amendment to the motion moved by the hon. member for Houghton&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_1817-1818" refersTo="page_0923"/>To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(1) expresses its thanks to the Government for its sympathetic attitude towards the problem of increasing the wages of the lower income groups and for its real contribution towards increasing these wages; and</li>

<li>(2) requests the Government to continue its policy of gradually increasing minimum wages on a selective basis in accordance with the progress in the economic sphere in South Africa&#x201D;.</li>

</ol>

<p>Before dealing with my objections to the motion of the hon. member for Houghton, I want to draw attention to a fundamental problem that we have in South Africa and that is the very high birth rate that we have amongst our non-Whites. The problem that we have to-day is to ensure that our economy develops at such a rate that we shall be able steadily to raise the standard of living of all our workers, the standard of living of the people. One of the greatest problems that we have in this regard is in fact this very high birth rate amongst the non-Whites in the country. This is the great problem which is occupying the minds of economists and responsible people&#x2014; whether our economy will be able to grow to such an extent in the future that it will be able to keep pace with this very high birth rate.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked for a minimum wage. I thought that she was going to advocate a minimum wage on a regional basis but although she wanted to make provision for certain regional differences, she actually advocated a national minimum wage.</p>

<p>I want to say immediately that if one had to consider regional circumstances, one would really be creating difficulties because people would move from one region to another if we did not have a uniform national minimum wage. It would mean that people would move from a region where a lower wage is paid to a region where a higher wage is paid.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker; that is to say, they can go from one position to another but they need not go from one region to another. The hon. member is trying to put me off. All I am saying is that if we did this on a regional basis, then certain difficulties would arise. I want to point out immediately that to determine a national minimum wage would be one of the most difficult things in South Africa, far more difficult than would be the case in countries like America and Australia and England because there they have a homogeneous population. Not only do we have great differences in various regions&#x2014;our standards of living differ from one region to another&#x2014;but we also have race differences; we have people maintaining different standards of living according to the stage of development they have reached. That is why it is a very difficult task to make provision for a national minimum wage to cover everyone.</p>

<p>I also want to point out that all the undertakings in a particular region are not operated at the same level of profit. The hon. member says that she does not mind if certain undertakings close down. The fact remains that we cannot allow that to happen on a large scale without harming our economy. I want to point out another fact and that is that one finds that all businesses do not always fare equally well. One finds that at a given time there is a recession in certain branches of industry while there is no recession in other branches of industry. Think of the recession which has been experienced in the furniture industry and in the building industry over the past few years. In other words, if we had to lay down a national minimum wage, it would mean that those businesses would not be able to adjust themselves in a time of recession. They would have to pay that minimum wage and if the wage was increased they would be forced out. This would not happen because they are not good managers or because they are not good entrepreneurs, because they are not well organized or because they are not running at a profit but it would be as a result of a recession in the industry. I say that if we did not lay down wages on the basis of an industry, it would simply mean that those industries which experience a period of recession would suffer great hardship.</p>

<p>I want to point out that on various occasions over the past years the Wage Board has refrained from making recommendations for an increase in wage determinations precisely because there have been recessions in the particular industries which it has been investigating. A few years ago we had the recession in the basket-making industry and the Wage Board refused at that time to recommend a determination to the Minister in respect of that industry. If we had a national minimum wage we could not make that exception and if we did make it, it would mean that we would no longer have a national minimum wage. There is another difference that I also want to point out, a very important difference, and that is that in some industries a very large percentage of non-White labour is used while in other industries a very small percentage is used. A national minimum wage would affect most heavily those industries which use a large percentage of cheap labour and they would perhaps be the industries which can least afford it. One can quite understand, Sir, if we had a national minimum wage and one industry had five lower paid workers and another had 100, that it is going to affect that industry with the 100 lower paid workers far more severely than the one with five. In other words, it would be those entrepreneurs who make use of non-White labour <span class="col_1819-1820" refersTo="page_0924"/>on a large scale who would be most severely hit under a national minimum wage system in South Africa.</p>

<p>I also want to refer to the question of concentrations of workers if one does this on a regional basis. The fact is that we already have very large concentrations of workers to-day, for example on the Witwatersrand, and if one draws a distinction on a regional basis, it will then mean that one is going to create far greater problems than we have to-day in the concentrated areas.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question? Does the hon. member know that wage determinations are made on a regional basis to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_der_walt">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with that, but the fact remains that if wages were laid down on a regional basis, the big cities would be a greater magnet than they are to-day in attracting labour.</p>

<p>I want to make a few general observations. I want to point out that the wage structure in any industry is built up on the lowest wage paid in that industry. The lowest wage forms the foundation of the wage structure. If the lowest wage is increased, it means that the entire wage structure is going to be affected; in other words, if we had a minimum wage throughout, the wages throughout the country in all industries would have to be adjusted to that minimum wage that is laid down. In other words, every time the minimum wage was increased, an increase would take place throughout the whole of the industrial world as an adjustment to that minimum wage. I want to point out that some people say that there should be an increase of at least R20 minimum wages. We have more than 1,000,000 unskilled industrial workers in South Africa. If we gave them an increase of R20 per month, it would mean an increase of R240 per person per annum. This would bring about an immediate expenditure to industry of R240,000,000 per annum. If what I say is correct, that the wage structure has to be adjusted to the lowest wage, the effect of this would be that a further R240.000.000 or more would perhaps have to be paid out in wages in that year because people higher up the scale would agitate for higher wages in order to be able to maintain the difference in the level of wages. I want to say immediately that the hon. member contends that higher wages will also result in higher production. I agree with her to some extent but we are not quite sure, as the Economic Advisory Council also stated, that that increased production would take place at such a rate that it would be able to cushion the effect of the increase in wages on our industry. If it did not cushion that effect, certain problems would arise. I accept that if industry paid higher wages it would soon try to increase the productivity of its workers by means of rationalization, automation and better methods of management. But the question is whether this would happen within a year or within two or three years. If it did not happen very soon, it would have a very detrimental effect on the economy of this country. Besides this one must accept the fact that it is not every business that has capable managers, people with the necessary talent for organizing and with management ability people who can immediately set that process in motion. Many of those businesses possibly do not have the means to bring this about. Even the Economic Advisory Council stated that it was not sure whether that increase in productivity would be able to take place so swiftly that it would be able to cushion the jolt which a wage increase of this nature would give to our economy. If that production did not take place very soon, it would have various effects on our economy. In the first place it would increase the cost of certain articles. If the cost of production rose in the primary sector, it would affect a large number of our exports because most of our exports are primary products. If production costs rose&#x2014;and we already have very strong competition abroad to-day&#x2014;we would experience a greater setback in this sphere than we realize.</p>

<p>It could also result in workers being forced out of their work. I want to mention this fact to the hon. member. An increased minimum wage would affect certain workers. I want to mention the case of domestic servants. Mr. Speaker, if one introduced an increased national minimum wage, certain groups of non-White workers whom one wants to assist would be affected; they would be pushed out of the labour market. The question arises whether if our economy received a setback it would be able to absorb those workers. That is why I say, Mr. Speaker, that it is idealistic to advocate a minimum wage. There are problems which we must face and try to overcome. We are living in a world where there is keen competition. We want to help these people but the question is how that wage increase is to be effected. That is why I come to the conclusion that the best way is the way and the policy followed by the National Party. We can only hope that the Government and the hon. the Minister specifically will continue with their efforts to increase minimum wages in South Africa along the lines that I have mentioned.</p>

<p>*Mr. VAN RENSBURG: I second the amendment. The picture which the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) painted for us this morning of the position of the unskilled workers in South Africa, together with the proposal she made here that a living wage should be guaranteed to all workers in South Africa, really created a wrong impression of the position here in South Africa. It is a fact after all that the standard of living of the Whites is one of the highest in the world. Some people think that this country probably ranks amongst the first five countries in the world in this regard. The standard of living of the non-Whites is higher than that of any other non-White group in Africa. Although the hon. member for Houghton does not like to be reminded of it&#x2014;I do not know why&#x2014;I <span class="col_1821-1822" refersTo="page_0925"/>think it is just as well that this is said. Mr. Clarence Randall, an American financier and adviser who visited this country recently, emphasized the fact that the Bantu in South Africa, let alone the Coloureds and the Indians, have the highest income of any Black group in the whole of Africa. The Bantu in South Africa have an average annual income of R270 and compare this figure, Sir, with the two best developed Black countries in Africa &#x2014;Ghana with an average income of R90 and Nigeria with an average income of R72. The hon. member said that we must not draw comparisons between this country and undeveloped countries; we should draw comparisons between this country and modern industrial countries. What did Mr. Randall state further? He emphasized the fact that the Bantu in South Africa, as a group, owned 100,000 motorcars. Mr. Randall said that proportionately this compared far more favourably than in the case of the Russians in Russia.</p>

<p>What progress has the Bantu made in industry in South Africa? In 1930 there were 80,0 Bantu employed in our industries. Their total earnings amounted to R6,000,000. In 1957 we already had 367,000 Bantu workers with a total remuneration of R 114,000,000. That is to say, from 1930 to 1957 the income of the Bantu worker in industry had risen from R75 to R310 per annum, an increase of 313 per cent. This was over a period of 27 years. In 1960 their average income was R348 per annum, a further increase of 12 per cent, and since 1960, as the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) has shown, their wages have been considerably improved by more favourable industrial agreements and by better wage determinations by the Wage Board. Besides this, we must not lose sight of the fact, Mr. Speaker, that particularly cheap housing is provided for these Bantu workers in our industrial areas. Nor should we forget that even their transportation from their residential areas to their places of employment is subsidized. I think that it is necessary for these things to be mentioned in order to see the complete picture in South Africa. If the conditions described by the hon. member for Houghton really did exist, the unskilled Bantu worker would be dissatisfied, and if the workers were dissatisfied about their wages, or about their conditions of service or about the arrangements under which they work, this would manifest itself in the form of labour unrest, strikes or labour disputes which may arise.</p>

<p>The hon. member knows that it is unlawful for them to strike. They are put in gaol.</p>

<p>*Mr. VAN RENSBURG: In the discussion of a motion of this nature it is as well to consider everything. The hon. member says that I know that it is illegal for them to strike, but why do we still have strikes? Does she not know about them? What is the position of the Bantu workers in our labour field? In 1957 there were 112 strikes involving 4,800 Bantu workers. Since 1957 the position in respect of strikes has gradually improved every year until we only had 11 strikes involving 400 Bantu workers in 1962. Does this indicate labour unrest, Mr. Speaker? Does this indicate dissatisfaction? On the contrary, it speaks volumes as to the satisfaction and the wellbeing of the unskilled labourers of South Africa. In 1957 there were 243 disputes. If they do not have the right to strike, let there be disputes about their conditions of services or the wages they receive. There were 20,500 Bantu workers involved in those 243 disputes. These were disputes which did not lead ta strikes. The position has also improved in this respect. In 1961 there were 109 disputes in which only 6,100 Bantu workers were involved. In 1962 the number of disputes decreased and wc only had 88. Does this indicate dissatisfaction amongst the Bantu workers? On the contrary, it indicates the greatest satisfaction on their part in regard to conditions of labour in this country.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton suggests in her proposal for a system of minimum wages that this should be done with a view to the expansion of our internal markets. Only higher wages can expand or stimulate our internal market. It is quite true that an increase in Bantu wages will help to develop our internal market. I agree with the hon. member for Houghton in that regard. But the Bantu will only&#x2014;this is what the hon. member for Houghton forgets&#x2014;have greater purchasing power if higher wages are accompanied by a proportionate increase in productivity. Otherwise the money will be taken from the employers and the entrepreneurs and placed in the hands of the unskilled workers. If an increase in Bantu wages is not accompanied by a positive effort towards higher productivity, we will have increased production costs and if we experience this we will have inflation which in its turn will completely neutralize the benefits of increased wages.</p>

<p>The hon. member did not hear a word that I said.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>The point that I want to emphasize, Mr. Speaker, is this that the Bantu will only have greater purchasing power in South Africa because of increased wages if this goes hand in hand with increased productivity and a increase in labour turnover. It is therefore all very well to contend summarily that increased wages will expand our internal market, but it must be remembered that certain conditions are required to bear out that argument.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is just as true that drastic increases in Bantu wages, which is the aim of the hon. member for Houghton, can also be very detrimental to our economy and our country as a whole, as the hon. member for Pretoria (West) correctly indicated. Drastic wage increases can lead to the ruination of many undertakings which cannot afford those higher wages. After all, Mr. Speaker, it is and <span class="col_1823-1824" refersTo="page_0926"/>will always be uneconomic to pay more for poor or undrained labour than that labour deserves or justifies. Higher wages can also lead to large-scale unemployment amongst the Bantu. The hon. member for Houghton dealt with this point this morning and did not actually see any danger in it. We noticed recently that with the rationalization of their non-White labour forces in the service of the Johannesburg City Council, the City Council reduced their non-White labour force by 1,687 over the past two years. This was as a result of an increase in wages. Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, who is a member of the party of which the hon. member for Houghton is the only representative in this House, stated last year that the Anglo American Corporation had taken steps to reduce the number of Bantu in its employ in order to pay higher wages to the better skilled labourers. What will happen to those workers who are dismissed? This must lead to unemployment. I accept the fact, however, that the problem of unemployment can be combated to a large extent and overcome if this labour can be diverted to the factories to be established under the border development scheme, something of course which the hon. member for Houghton does not want. The motion of the hon. member for Houghton states further: &#x201C;To institute a system of minimum wages with a view, <i>inter alia,</i> of combating malnutrition&#x201D;. But should malnutrition really be ascribed to the low wages paid to Bantu employees? The hon. member quoted the Report of the Research Bureau of the University of South Africa, but is she aware of the fact that this Bureau recently also investigated the purchasing habits of the Bantu on the Witwatersrand and in Pretoria? And what did the Report of the Bureau reveal regarding the purchasing habits of the Bantu? It revealed the fact that the Bantu in South Africa were more inclined to spend their money on luxury articles than to make provision for the necessities of life. That was the finding of the Bureau&#x2014;that the purchasing habits of the Bantu in those areas were a contributory cause of malnutrition in South Africa.</p>

<p>Minimum wages, regional wages, national minimum wages will do nothing to solve this problem. On the contrary, this will create a competition cycle amongst the Bantu. The higher his wages, the more will this create a competitive cycle amongst the Bantu to spend more and more money on luxury articles and les and less on food. The solution to the problem of malnutrition lies to my mind in another direction, and that is to give food to the employees as part of their remuneration. Dr. Steenkamp, Chairman of the Wage Board, had the following to say in 1960&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He thinks that undertakings will benefit if they make the supplying of meals a condition of service. The question of malnutrition is one of the reasons why an increase in Bantu wages will have a more favourable effect upon productivity over a short period. But the danger is there, of course that this will not be spent in the right direction. He is informed that Bantu attendance at horserace meetings in Durban is increasing sharply. That is why a portion of the increase should rather take the form of goods and service.</block>

<p>We have the example of the South African Railways, to which the hon. member for Houghton has also referred, which is to-day supplying a balanced ration to 30,000 of its employees in the compounds and on the various sections, and the Railways do so for the simple reason, as the hon. member for Pretoria (West) has correctly indicated, that it has been their experience that if these Bantu have to buy their own food, they merely go to a caf&#x00E9; during mealtimes and buy a bottle of mineral water and a piece of white bread and they try to do their work on that. That food is not nutritious and so we have disease as a result of underfeeding. This is an idea which should perhaps be considered more seriously and which should be carried out by more employers in South Africa, this idea of giving Bantu labourers a balanced ration as the Railways are already doing in the case of 30,000 of their Bantu employees. A few years ago the example was given in this House of one particularly large factory which provided their Bantu workers with food; and over the same period after they decided to supply their Bantu workers with food, they discovered that production had increased by as much as 40 per cent. I think that malnutrition can be more effectively combated in this way, and that that may perhaps be of greater assistance in combating the problem of agricultural surpluses than the idea of regional wages put forward by the hon. member for Houghton.</p>

<p>The amendment moved by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) expressed gratitude to the Government for what it has already done. Indeed. the Government has done a great deal, as the hon. member for Pretoria (West) has also pointed out. When industrial agreements are concluded, wages are determined by means of negotiation between employers and employees and the majority of Bantu wages is to-day controlled by industrial councils. As far as the Bantu are concerned, there is additional machinery available to protect their interests when agreements are concluded by industrial councils. The reason being, of course, that Bantu cannot be members of a trade union or be represented on an industrial council. It was this Government which, by means of legislation, passed in this House in 1953, ensured that an instrument to represent the unskilled Bantu worker be called into being, namely, the Central Native Labour Council which represents the unskilled Bantu at meetings of the industrial councils when wage agreements are concluded. When it acts there, it acts on behalf of those Bantu employees. Mainly as a result of the actions and the intercession of this Council, improvements amounting to millions of rand have been effected in the wages of thousands of Bantu workers under industrial council agreements. Thus during the period <span class="col_1825-1826" refersTo="page_0927"/>1959 to 1962 wage increases totalling R22,385,000 were granted to 514,000 Bantu workers. When an industrial council agreement is concluded, it is submitted to the Minister, but it cannot be submitted to the Minister if it has not also been recommended by the Central Native Labour Council. In this way the Government has ensured that the Bantu who fall under industrial council agreements will receive their fair and rightful share of any wage improvements which are effected in terms of industrial council agreements. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) referred to the legislation which was introduced in 1957 to improve the operations of the Wage Board and which divided the Wage Board into two sections so that they could dispose of more work. To illustrate how swiftly the Wage Board operates to-day I may mention that between 1 January 1958 to 1 January 1961,38 branches of industry were investigated and 38 determinations were made affecting 110,000 Bantu workers. This was during the period immediately following upon the legislation of 1957, a period of three years, but from 1 January 1961 to date, that is to say, over the past two years, 22 determinations have been made affecting 93,000 Bantu workers. In other words, the Wage Board is operating much more swiftly. In the past two years it has speeded up its work even more than it did during the previous three years. Increases amounting to millions of rand have been granted in this way and 200,000 employees have been affected.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton has again used the old excuse that it was difficult for employers to increase wages because under a system of free enterprise the employer had to consider all his competitors. In other words, the employer who increases his employees&#x2019; wages is placed in an unfair position and cannot compete with those employers who do not increase wages. That was her argument, but it is an argument which does not hold water. If an employer wants to increase wages and if together with that wage increase he wants to ensure increased productivity, it does not necessarily follow that his production costs will rise as a result. That was precisely what the Anglo American Corporation announced they intended to do&#x2014;to dismiss some of their Bantu labour, to increase the wages of the others and thus maintain the same production at the same costs. There are other examples. There is a good example of a factory which over a period of five years dismissed 50 per cent of its Bantu labour, but over that same period increased the wages of those remaining in its service by 50 per cent. Its wage bill, therefore, remained the same. They discovered that by making use of more efficient labour they could increase their production by no less than 50 per cent. What happens now to the argument advanced by the hon. member for Houghton that employers are in this difficult position that because of free enterprise, they are placed in an unfair position in the industrial sphere as against their competitors when they decide of their own accord to increase wages. And what about the industrial council agreements? There are about 80 industrial council agreements in South Africa to-day involving no fewer than 20,000 employers and</p>

<p>300,0 Bantu workers. These 20,000 employers have a say in 80 wage agreements for various industries. If the wages prescribed in an agreement are lower than those which the employers are able and ought to pay, it is the employer himself who is responsible for this state of affairs. These agreements are revised from time to time&#x2014;most of them are revised annually&#x2014; and they can also be amended during the period of their validity. If the employers wish to pay higher wages, the employees will be only too willing to conduct negotiations in this regard under the agreement. No, the excuse advanced by the hon. member for Houghton in this House on behalf of employers was a weak excuse&#x2014;the excuse that because of the danger of unfair competition with their competitors, they are not able to increase wages. The Wage Board has even found that wages laid down by industrial council agreements have often been lower than the wage determinations made by the Wage Board itself. Who is to blame for that? Nobody but the employer in our country, and the hon. member for Houghton is wasting her time pleading the case of these people. No, if the Government is urged to take steps to accelerate wage increases or to introduce minimum regional wages, which is what the hon. member for Houghton wants, so that wages will be increased, my question is this: Why should the Government do so? What prevents commerce and industry from doing so? That argument advanced by the hon. member of free enterprise simply does not hold water. Why is State action or legislation required to increase Bantu wages or to determine minimum regional wages? Do these people want to make the Government the scapegoat; do they want the Government to take the blame if the general public reaction is against it or if our economy is adversely affected?</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I think the House welcomes this opportunity to discuss the motion moved by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman), but before I discuss the motion as such, I should like to deal with one or two of the points made by speakers on the Government side. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) mentioned that we should not lose sight of the fact that Bantu wages in the Republic are higher than in any other area in Africa. I do not know that anyone denies that fact, because we are all familiar with the wage pattern throughout Africa, and we certainly do not deny that. What we do say is that that is not a reason for complacency as far as our own Bantu are concerned. I think the fact that we have got a lead is to the credit of the Republic, we should not rest on our laurels but we should get on <span class="col_1827-1828" refersTo="page_0928"/>with the job. That brings me to the next point made by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East), namely that although the Government has every sympathy with a policy designed to increase the basic wages applicable to Bantu workers, I got the impression that both of the speakers on the Government side were giving every conceivable reason why a living wage should not be established. I did not hear them suggest one way in which this problem could be overcome, and I think I have got to say the same about the hon. member for Houghton. She did give, I think, a very broad and a very interesting resum&#x00E9; of the whole problem dealing with the Bantu wages, the whole structure of Bantu wages, but I do not think that the real crux of the matter, the core of the whole matter was mentioned by the hon. member for Houghton, or for that matter by the two members speaking on the Government side.</p>

<p>But it is not my intention to anticipate my own speech, and I think this question will crop up as I proceed with my contribution to this debate.</p>

<p>The proposal of the hon. member for Houghton that there should be a system of living wages applicable to all workers with due regard to regional differences in the cost of living and to the value of wages paid in kind, is a basic proposition that as far as the Progressive Party is concerned can be solved by the application of a system of minimum wages; as far as the Government members are concerned, they are satisfied that the policy of the Nationalist Party will solve this problem without any additional machinery being set up, such as a system of minimum wages. They feel that their policy is sufficient to overcome this problem without taking any further steps. I think that is a fair statement to make based on what was said by the two hon. members who have spoken so far. The hon. member-for Houghton has quoted all the recent authorities, experts and others that have dealt with this question, Mr. Katzen, Mr. Goldberg, chairman of the Bantu Wage and Productivity Council, I think the South African Congress of Trade Unions &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<p>No, I did not mention them.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>Well, they also advocated the same principle, and also the fact that it is the generally accepted policy of the Progressive Party that a minimum wage should be applied throughout the Republic. Against the proposition of the Progressive Party are Professor W. F. J. Steenkamp and Professor O. P. F. Horwood and also the South African Federated Chamber of Industries&#x2014;I am only dealing with those that have recently written or expressed opinions about this question.</p>

<p>Now I think I must endeavour to state, as simply as I possibly can, what the problem is, and I think I can put it in a very few words. The basic problem that we have to face, as I see it, is that the Bantu is earning Black and is paying White. In other words, the goods which are bought by the Bantu, both consumable and durable goods, cost the Bantu exactly the same as they do the White worker. That is our basic problem. No matter what we do, unless we can reduce the gap between the earnings of the White workers and the earnings of the Bantu workers, we will be in trouble all along the line, and I suggest that that is the problem that we should be considering to-day: How to reduce this gap. And I would also suggest that if there were an increase in the minimum rates throughout the Republic of RX per month, there would automatically be an increase in the price of consumer and durable goods throughout the Republic. It is as simple as that. And the question would then arise: Are they any better off as a result of having received an increase in basic pay? In other words, for an increase to be of any value it has to be more than sufficient to meet an inevitable price increase in consumable goods. I think if we accept that as our basic proposition, we will then be able to see in what direction we have got to go to meet the problem that presents itself, to us. I must add in passing here that it is because of this factor that we know that the low wages paid in cash to domestic workers and farm workers have not the same impact upon them as in other industries where wages are paid and nothing paid in kind. In other words, domestic workers and farm workers invariably do receive food as part of their income, which means that the biggest single item in the budget of other workers is therefore not present as far as these two categories of workers are concerned, so that the problem is not so acute in the case of farm workers and domestic workers as upon other workers who receive straight cash payments for work done.</p>

<p>A very interesting article was quoted in part by the hon. member for Houghton, an article to be found in the June 1962 issue of the <i>South African Journal of Economics</i> written by Dr. W. F. J. Steenkamp on &#x201C;Bantu Wages in South Africa &#x201D;. We must remember that Dr. Steenkamp is the chairman of the Wage Board, so that he should have a very good insight into the problems facing us, and on page 116 under the heading &#x201C;A Target for the Future&#x201D;, he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Unless we managed to increase our tempo of expansion appreciably, or European and wage and salary earners could be induced to accept a much smaller rise in real average income, a 5 per cent annual advance in Bantu real wages could, I fear, not be maintained for long. Wages cannot, it should again be emphasized, be considered in isolation. Wage increases should be related to the rate of economic expansion achieved. Target sitting in vacuo is senseless.</block>

<p>Now, in that statement we have a problem which this Government has done nothing to assist in solving. I refer to the statement where <span class="col_1829-1830" refersTo="page_0929"/>it is said that unless the European wage and salary earners could be induced to accept a much smaller rise in real average income, it will not be much use. How would one go about persuading European workers to accept a lower increase in real wages so that the Bantu could have a higher increase in wages? Prior to the accession to power of the present Government, one could say that we had a united trade union movement in South Africa and it was possible to get discussions at top level as far as trade unions are concerned, but actions by this Government, by amendments to the Industrial Conciliation Act, have made that impossible, so that we will have to rely on the goodwill of the European trade unions to bring about what Dr. Steenkamp considers to be essential. In other words, if the European trade union movement were prepared to accept as a basic fact that their wages would have to be slightly increased while Bantu wages are considerably increased, unless they are prepared to accept that I do not think that any Government would be prepared to enforce it on them. Therefore the importance of maintaining good relations with the trade union movement is of considerable importance and a matter which we cannot overlook when we deal with this question of how to reduce the gap between wages paid to the Blacks and those paid to the Whites. The question then arises how to reduce the gap between Black and White wages without disrupting the economy of the country, and here we have possibly two ways open to us. There can be wage adjustments of the type I have mentioned and as suggested by Dr. Steenkamp, or there can be a system of food subsidies, the former method is included in the further amendment I am now moving and which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House requests the Government&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) to set an example to all employers of labour, whether covered by wage regulating machinery or not, by ensuring that all workers employed by the State are paid a living wage; and</li>

<li>(b) to improve and to utilize existing wage regulating machinery to ensure that workers covered by such regulating machinery are paid a living wage and thus, <i>inter alia,</i> increasing internal markets and combating malnutrition.&#x201D;</li>

</ol>

<p>The purpose in moving this amendment will become apparent. Before I go into detail, I think I should mention that the United Party stands by the machinery that was created during the time when it was in office&#x2014;the Industrial Conciliation Act which has as its main principle collective bargaining&#x2014;without of course the clauses dealing with job reservation and the splitting of the trade unions&#x2014;the Wage Act for the workers not covered by the Industrial Conciliation Act, the Shop and Office Hours Act, which deals with the hours of work etc., and the one other Act which was introduced since 1948 and which has played an important part, namely the Native Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Act, which was supported by this party, with the Central Native Labour Board as one of its main instruments. This machinery has resulted in the improvement which has already taken place as far as Bantu workers are concerned. When one considers the numbers that have been assisted by way of this machinery, one can see that it has played a considerable part in attempting to solve the problems presented because of the low wages paid to the Bantu and the relatively high wages paid to the Whites.</p>

<p>But the point I want to make here is that outside of this machinery, the Railways, the G.P.O. and the Public Service account for no fewer than 225,000 Bantu workers. That, together with the numbers that the annual report of the Department of Labour for 1962 reveals, shows that the Central Labour Board succeeded in getting wage increases for 151,0 Bantu workers, entailing a wage expenditure of approximately R7,750,000 per annum. That fact, together with the figures I have mentioned in respect of the Railways, the G.P.O. and the Public Service, shows that the Government has direct machinery for influencing the wages of no fewer than 377,347 Bantu workers, which is a considerable proportion of the Bantu workers employed in the Republic. I do not know whether the figure given to us by the hon. member who moved the amendment on the Government side is correct, but he suggested that there are just over 1,000,000 Bantu workers employed in the Republic and receiving wages. If we accept that figure as correct, we see that the Government has a direct say in the wages of over one-third of the Bantu workers employed in the Republic, and that is an important matter. In terms of our amendment, it will be seen that if the Government were to be satisfied that the wages paid to all of those that it is in a position to control is a satisfactory wage, is at least a living wage, the influence which that must have on the agreements arrived at by employers and employees in other than State controlled undertakings must be considerable. In other words, if we are going to accept that it is not only the responsibility of employers in outside industry to pay attention to this problem, but that it is and should be the direct responsibility of the Government, and that the initiative should be taken by the Government, we can see how much the Government can do in this direction; and there are one or two reasons why this should be so.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Government employs workers in every conceivable type of work from manual labour to highly skilled work. Secondly, it is in a position to establish and provide a living wage through on-the-spot investigations under all conditions. Here I must mention the proposal made by the mover of the motion that <span class="col_1831-1832" refersTo="page_0930"/>there should be a semi-judicial body set up to implement what the mover wishes to bring about. She admitted that that could only be done by such a judicial commission after considerable research and investigation which would necessarily take a long time. But, Mr. Speaker, is it necessary to set up an organization like that, when the Government itself has all the machinery within its own control and can establish within a very short while what a living wage is for every type of worker in the Republic?</p>

<p>They do not seem to have done so, though.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>That is my complaint, and that is why my amendment is worded in the way it is. I suggest that because the Government is in this favourable position it has an obligation to set the ball rolling, to take the initiative and to bring about the first movement, which is to establish what should be a minimum living wage for every section of the community. I do not know whether we appreciate the extent to which the Government has a direct influence on thousands of workers and the wages they receive. We need only mention a few of the industries which are either Government controlled or where the Government has a direct say in the wages paid, like Iscor and Escom and other semi-State organizations, the great industry we have in the Forestry Department and the number of experimental farms run by the Government, which give the Government a first-hand opportunity of establishing what a minimum wage should be for all categories of workers, who are employed not only by the Government in these various departments but also in outside industries. So that the need for an independent investigation to establish these facts does not exist. The Government could at very short notice establish what these factors are.</p>

<p>I now come to the next point made in the same article I quoted earlier on, and here I think we come to the crux of the matter. It is on page 116, where Dr. Steenkamp went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Target-setting in vacuo is senseless. The most we can do. I submit, is this. First, both the Government and Industrial Councils should, where this has not yet been done, as soon as possible raise Bantu wages to the levels set in the latest wage determination and collective agreements.</block>

<p>That means that this will be a continuous process. There would be an adjustment in terms of this proposition put forward by Dr. Steenkamp which would bring about a considerable change in a very short time. I do not know whether the significance of this paragraph is apparent to most hon. members, but what is suggested here is that when an industrial council agreement is signed by the Minister and it lays down for the lowest paid employees in that industry or undertaking that a wage rate should be paid to them which is higher than anything else laid down either in the Government service or outside, there should immediately be an adjustment upwards in all other industries or undertakings. Now one can see why it is considered important by Dr. Steenkamp that there should be agreement that where this type of increase takes place there will not be a corresponding demand for increases by other workers who enjoy a much higher rate of pay. That is the basis of his proposition, and it would appear to me that unless we are prepared to think along these lines we are not going to get to the crux of this problem merely by insisting upon a minimum wage rate throughout the Republic. It will be the same as what we experienced in regard to the cost-of-living allowances. They were always paid after there had been an increase in commodity prices, with the result that the increased C.O.L.A. merely compensated for the increased commodity prices and the workers were no better off. It merely enabled them to keep pace with the continued increase in the cost of living. So let us take this proposition a step further and see what happens in fact. We have an illustration in what happened last year when the Minister of Transport set a new wage rate for Bantu labourers employed by the S.A. Railways and according to the information I have been given that wage rate amounted to R36.40 a month for a 26-day month. That is higher than the average paid by outside industry, which I understand at present is R31 a month. This would mean that if the Government were in a position to, and did in fact increase the level of Bantu labourers&#x2019; wages to R36.40, that would become the new basic wage to be paid throughout industry. This has to be done without disruption, without forcing the cost of living up to the point where this increase would not be worth while. The proposition we have to face here is the one I mentioned earlier, that the gap between the earnings of the Whites and the Blacks has to be reduced. I am satisfied that the Government, by using the means at its disposal, can establish what is a living wage for all types of work under all conceivable conditions. I am sure that if this information is made available to the country it will in turn form the basis upon which the Minister of Labour can evaluate the wage proposals submitted to him for approval in terms of the wage-regulating instruments. We must remember that the Minister of Labour has to sign all the wage determinations, whether they come from the Industrial Council or the Wage Board. The Minister is then in a position to assess whether the wages agreed upon for the Bantu workers are in keeping with what the State establishes as reasonable for its own workers in similar employment throughout the country. I say that this problem can be met in that way if there is the incentive as far as the Government itself is concerned. It is no use the Government saying to outside employers that it is their responsibility, because we know what their position is, one employer in a particular industry may be prepared to increase Bantu wages, but another employer in the same industry<span class="col_1833-1834" refersTo="page_0931"/> may not be prepared to do so, with the result that nothing at all is done. The competitive factor compels the employers to see that if there is an adjustment in wages it takes place throughout the industry, otherwise the competitive factor cannot be overcome.</p>

<p>I did mention that the Government has another method, the paying of State subsidies. Earlier on we had a quotation from the Committee of Inquiry into Family Allowances. This Committee investigated this whole problem of family allowances and on pages 79 to 81 they came to certain conclusions, and in paragraph 317 they say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It would surely be logical to subsidize staple foods for our lower-income groups, rather than to spend vast sums in an attempt to cope with disease resulting from nutritional deficiencies.</block>

<p>That presents the other choice the Government has. If it is not prepared to take the initiative in regard to Bantu wages in one way or another, then this gap can also be narrowed by subsidizing staple foods to the lower income groups. The Government is facing the problem of large surpluses in the very commodities referred to in this Committee&#x2019;s report, the protective foods, it would appear that the Government should also investigate whether the subsidizing of staple foods would solve the problem. I put it to the Government that it has the choice. It can do nothing. It can institute a system of food subsidies, or it can accept the proposition set out in our amendment. I think the Minister should give us some indication of what he intends doing about this problem and what the Government&#x2019;s policy is, because the more I listen to debates on this question the more convinced I am that we only get a lot of views put forward. We get to know what other people think, and we get propositions from the Government side, but what is missing is positive action. And the Opposition is not in a position to take the positive action that should be taken; that can only be done by the Government in power. It would appear to me that the suggestion which has been made by Dr. Steenkamp is one which should be examined very closely, not only by the Government but by trade unions as well, because I say that it would be a very brave Government which would take the initiative in saying to the White workers that an improvement in Bantu wages can only be brought about by a sacrifice on their part. I am quite sure that the workers would retaliate and say; Rather than do that to us, we suggest that you go ahead with a system of food subsidization paid for by all taxpayers and not by the White workers alone. I think that is a factor we have to consider. The Minister has to face up to this responsibility and I hope he will come into this debate and give us some idea of what the Government will do.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I second the amendment and I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) on what I think is a very well-reasoned and responsible speech. It is the type of speech which we so rarely have the opportunity of hearing in this House. I want to take this matter a little further than my colleague, and from a slightly different angle. Let me say at once that we on this side of the House, as hon. members will have gathered from what my colleagues had to say, are not opposed to the principle of paying a minimum living wage. On the contrary, as merely a humanitarian measure, apart from anything else, we believe that the country can afford to pay a living wage to all its workers. It is true that there are different conditions under which they are employed but basically the country is able to afford a living wage for all workers, and it is therefore a matter of organization and administration and possibly just of good government on the administrative side, to enable that desirable aim to be brought about. But, as I say, there are so many aspects of this question that it is not a simple matter. It is not a matter which we could sit down and study in the library and then come to Parliament and make speeches about. This is a matter with many involved aspects, and one of the difficulties I want to deal with arises from the approach I wish to make, which is not from the angle of industry but from the angle of people in the country districts, under different conditions from those which obtain in the urban centres.</p>

<p>One of the difficulties with which we are faced is this, that while it is true that we would wish to see a living wage paid, this impinges immediately upon another matter which stands right alongside it. and that is the question of unemployment. Here we are up against the position of the man who is unemployed and who is willing to work for a lesser wage than the other man would work for. We have in some parts of the country to-day a shortage of labour of certain types, and I would say a great shortage in some areas. I hear tales of farmers who are taking their lorries and travelling 150 miles and more to find labour to help them reap their crops, and who are willing to pay high wages. There is no fixed wage for them. There is no figure fixed by legislation and to which they must adhere as a living wage. They go out to find labour which they need to reap their crops and they are willing to pay for it, and if they have to travel 100 miles to get the labour, they do it. Academic considerations of what is a living wage leave them stone cold. They want labour. That is economics; it is reality. On the other hand, you have the case of the unemployed, and in certain areas to-day it is becoming a grievous problem. If one assumes that the labourers I have referred to are in the main Bantu, it can also be said that the unemployed are in the main also Bantu, people who because of pressure from urban areas have hitherto been excluded and sent

<span class="col_1835-1836" refersTo="page_0932"/>back again to the reserves or to the areas from which they have come&#x2014;not necessarily " reserves&#x201D; in the legal sense&#x2014;but there they are; they have not gone back to employment. There is no employment there for them. What do they do? It is not a question of a living wage with them; it is a case of whether they can get employment and the wages that they take will be the wages offered to them because they will do anything to get money, to get something, to be able to live. So you have these two things running together at the same time, and in dealing with a question of this kind one cannot look upon it as though it is just a simple issue of laying down, as the hon. member for Houghton suggested a living wage and then make allowances for the cost of living here and the cost of living there. What allowance do you make for the cost of living of a person who has not got a job? You see, here is a pressure building up from two sides, from totally opposed angles&#x2014;a shortage of labour and a surplus of labour all at the same time, but not in the same area. But I want to go further and say that there is a growing body of employers to-day who are not Whites. I will leave out for the moment the Indians in my own province and possibly elsewhere and even the Coloured man. I do not know the position as far as the Coloured man is concerned but I refer now to the type of employer who is himself a mantu and who employs other Bantu people to work for him. You have bus companies which are Native-owned. That is not agriculture; it is a recognized portion of our economy, of our way of life, of our industry. Sir, bus companies run all over the country to-day. There are Native-owned bus companies who employ Bantu to run their companies. You have Bantu storekeepers who employ Bantu people to work for them. What is the position of these employers <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> their employees? What is the position of the competitor under those circumstances? Sir, these are realities. You have people of various racial groups running competitive services, whether they be bus companies or stores or other services, and the whole trend to-day is for a greater and greater number of non-Whites to come into all these avenues, not as employees but as employers. They are taking part to-day in the industrial and commercial life of the country, and that must surely be so, otherwise what do we visualize for the future? Surely we must visualize that that movement will gain ground and that there will be an increasing number of Bantu employers in various callings and walks of life which they have never yet entered as employers. Where they have been employees they will now be employers employing their own people, and so you get another cross current running, because where that kind of development takes place you can expect competition of a kind that is not going to be met by any rule of thumb solution, by saying, &#x201C;we are going to insist on a minimum wage being paid &#x201D;. Having said that I want to come to the Indian in Natal. Let hon. members go to the Department of Labour and ask them what kind of difficulties they have had with those folk in enforcing wage determinations. Precisely the same difficulty is going to arise in other cases. It does not only arise amongst the Indians. It has arisen also amongst certain White groups. When we come to the motion of the hon. member for Houghton, she seeks to give the impression that if only the Government takes into account the cost of living in the various regions and the value of wages paid in kind, then we have a cure for all evils, a panacea for all our troubles; that having taken those into account we will have solved all our problems. Then we would increase the internal market and we would combat malnutrition. Sir, I admit that if you inject into the economy of the country extra wages whether it be for the Bantu people or any other section, that tends to create a better internal market; there is more money to spend internally on the products of our commerce and industry and so forth. But when I first read what the hon. member had to say in her motion about malnutrition, my mind went back to the history of our own country, particularly in my own province. What wages did the Zulu people get in Zululand in, say, 1820, and how much malnutrition was there? There was no malnutrition but they did not have a living wage.</p>

<p>But they had plenty of land to farm.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The point I want to make is this: The hon. member now says that the Zulus then had plenty of land to farm. Let us just leave that alone because that is a statement which cannot be substantiated. The point is that her motion does not say &#x201C;a living wage and plenty of land to farm&#x201D;, and it does not say &#x201C;a living wage or plenty of land to farm &#x201D;. A living wage, with the qualification that she laid down, was the panacea for all our troubles, but that was not the position in those days. Those people, probably one of the finest races on earth, physically, did not have a living wage. They did not have any wage at all. My point is in dealing with this question of malnutrition that they did not have a living wage and that they did not have malnutrition. A living wage is not the thing that makes malnutrition extinct. Malnutrition does not disappear because you have a living wage. I do not subscribe to the view that the hon. member expressed that various people have said in defence of the present system that it is the social custom of the Bantu not to have milk, this, that or the other thing. I do not agree that anybody who professes to be an expert as far as the Bantu are concerned has ever said that. Of course the Bantu has always had milk and green stuff and meat; they had a well-balanced diet. The point is that to-day your industrial worker, particularly in the urban areas is a bad buyer of protective foodstuffs. It is not so much a living wage or the failure to have a living <span class="col_1837-1838" refersTo="page_0933"/>wage, but what does he do with his money even though he has a living wage and when he has that extra money to spend? It has been said that he has not been educated to spend his money on the right foodstuffs. Well, whether it is education or not, that does not matter for the moment, but the fact remains that he does not spend it wisely on protective foodstuffs. If it is a question of education, who educated the Zulu in 1820? Who told him what protective foodstuffs to have? He did not need any education in 1820 to tell him what the protective foodstuffs were. It was his way of life. Through hundreds of years he had come forward and had reached almost the peak of perfection as far as human beings are concerned. This question cannot be tied on merely to a living wage. This thing is an intricate problem, it is a social problem. It is in all aspects a human problem but it is a social problem&#x2014;employment and housing and the condition under which people live&#x2014;and in the rural areas where to-day the Bantu are living free of this malnutrition that we hear about I have never seen a case of kwashiorkor on any of our farms. I am in touch with district surgeons and doctors throughout the length and breadth of my province and I cannot recall one of them ever telling me that he had come across a case of kwashiorkor on a farm.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Have you looked at the C.S.I.R. Report which relates to rural as well as urban areas? There you will see that kwashiorkor is prevalant in that area.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know whether the report says that it is prevalent in those areas and I do not know to which areas it refers, if indeed there is such a statement in the report. Does it refer to the rural areas in my own province? Because I am not talking about the position of Coloured people elsewhere or anything of that sort. I am talking about the Bantu on our farms. I want to go further and say this, and here is something that money cannot buy and you are never going to pin it down with a living wage: I refer to the care given by the farmer and his wife to those little piccanins and children of all kinds of Bantu people who form part of the whole build-up that forms a farm in the rural areas. How do you account for that in terms of money? How can you say: &#x201C;The living wage shall be R29 per month and then you must make allowances for the cost of living in the area and for wages received in kind?&#x201D; When it comes to the personal interest taken in these people and all the free medicine, the free health services and all the various things which are given by the farmer and his wife to these people, how do you put that down in terms of money? It cannot be done; it is absolutely impossible. I say therefore that this thing is not as simple as the hon. member for Houghton would have us believe. It is by no means a simple thing. May I say also that in my opinion one of our troubles, one of the side-issues but having a very direct bearing upon this question, is the matter of the ability of the Native to sell his labour in the best market. I know all the difficulties and all the trouble in that regard, but when you are dealing with this question of a living wage and you are faced with the difficulties that we are experiencing in this country because of the gap between the White man&#x2019;s wage and the Black man&#x2019;s wage, it is a warning. But when at the same time you find that gap between the Bantu in one area, in very short supply, being paid very high wages, and the Bantu in another area, with an abundance of labour and no jobs available, willing to work for the barest minimum that will keep body and soul together, when you find at the same time in the same country, in the same economy of the Black man with his wage, the White man with his much higher wage, and then this tremendous discrepancy between Black and Black, that is one of the things which to my mind is showing a red light for the future, a thing that we should be investigating to see whether we cannot overcome it, and allow the Bantu to sell their labour in the area where they are going to get the best returns for their labour. If we want the Bantu to be contented and to settle down happily, then one of the things that they must get is contentment in their place of work. Sir, every farmer will tell you that the dissatisfied, the unhappy, the grousing, grizzling, grumbling labourer is no good to him. We all get rid of him as soon as we can. We do not want him. But nor does anybody else want to work in a place where he is not happy. Look how happy we all are here; we stay here year after year&#x2014;at a living wage, may I say.</p>

<p>The hon. member over there is surely the best judge of her own capacity. Who am I to say that she is wrong in judging her own capacity? Sir, I do not want to deal with this matter any further. I have tried to point out that from a certain angle this matter is a difficult one and it cannot be solved by simply having a minimum wage fixed, with certain rigid ideas applied to it so as to make it applicable here or there. But I do want to come back for a moment or two to this question of the Bantu selling their labour in the best market. In the farming areas at the present time those of us who live on border forms particularly, are coming up against this problem and it is going to affect us probably to a very much greater extent than it does at the present time. Sir, let me give you an example of the kind of thing that I personally experienced the other day. I am a border farmer. A Native came round from the adjacent area. My Native told me that he called himself a trade unionist. They had no idea what a trade unionist was, but they said that he called himself a trade unionist; that is <span class="col_1839-1840" refersTo="page_0934"/>not the way they pronounced it. He came along and told them that they were entitled to a higher wage. He had a lot of figures there and he was able to tell them what was written in the papers and he told them that they were entitled to much higher wages. In due course the induna came along and said, &#x201C;look here, we want these higher wages that we are entitled to get &#x201D;. I said to him, &#x201C;look, my business will permit of so much being paid in wages. You sit here every week with me when I pay or when my son pays when 1 am down in Cape Town. You see how many pounds and pounds and pounds are paid out. I am not going to pay out more than that. I am going to leave it to you now. I am willing to continue paying that amount of money. If you are satisfied that I should pay a fewer number of you, I will sack some of you; I will take the same amount of money and I will pay to those of you who remain, so those who stay on will have higher wages. I will sack one-third and the two-thirds who stay on will get exactly that amount of money but you will have to work harder to earn it. I am paying that money for work done and you will now do the extra work and get the extra pay, but you must work it out for yourselves now &#x201D;. Sir, I employ quite a lot of Native labour. They took two or three days to bunga about it, and then the indunas concerned came to me and said, &#x201C;no, sir, we would sooner stay on and work as we are. We do not want you to sack anybody. We will work for the wages &#x201D;. They had no complaint against the wages as such. They had been told that they were entitled to higher wages so they wanted the higher wages because somebody had told them that they were entitled to it, but when I made this offer to them that I would pay those who stayed on higher wages provided they worked harder, the answer was that they did not want to go. They all wanted to stay on at the same wage. This is what happened when it was left to them to decide for themselves. They decided for themselves that the extra inducement as far as they were concerned was not going to be rewarded by extra labour on their part. They were not going to work any harder so as to get extra money. They were satisfied to stay as they were. Sir, where we on border farms are concerned we have to realize that these unemployed who are now coming back to the Native areas are going to start the pressure against us on our border farms; I am seeing it already. I have seen Natives come along and offer to work for half of what I am paying my labour, and when it comes to tractor drivers and people like that, I am getting Natives who are coming to work for a quarter of what I pay my tractor driver. This is the kind of thing that is happening, and I repeat that the gap between White and Black wages in this country that my hon. friend here refers to, the gap between Black and Black wages all in the same economy, is the red light. We will at our peril let that develop and get wider and wider apart, and a bare minimum wage or a living wage or whatever it may be called is no answer to the problem. Far more drastic action than that has to be taken. I agree with my hon. friend that in his amendment he has suggested ways and means of battling with that problem.</p>

<p>The MINISTER OF LABOUR: I thought I should intervene in the debate at this stage.</p>

<p>I have been asked by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) to reply to certain suggestions that have been made in the course of the debate. Sir, I agree with the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) whom, by the way, I must congratulate on a very down-to-earth speech which I think puts the whole question in the right perspective. I agree with him when he says that the hon. member for Hougton (Mrs. Suzman) simply moved her motion and then proceeded to make quite an academic speech which she culled from various authorities which she probably got in the library. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) and the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) traversed the speech of the hon. member for Houghton in a practical way and showed in the course of their remarks how it was quite impracticable to introduce any system such as was suggested by the hon. member. Sir, I dealt with this question of a national minimum wage very fully last year in the Other Place. I have not got the time now to deal with it as fully as I did last year. If any hon. members are interested they can read it in the Senate Hansard of last year. The motion of the hon. member for Houghton. I think hon. members will agree, is simply a variation of the old theme of a national minimum wage. The impracticability of a national minimum wage is, I think, fairly accepted and appreciated by thinking people. The hon. member has tried to give her proposal an air of reasonableness by throwing in a few phrases such as &#x201C;due regard to regional differences in the cost of living and to the value of wages paid in kind &#x201D;. <i>I</i> am afraid that she has not succeeded in making the proposal anymore acceptable to those of us who are charged with the responsibility of striking a balance between a practicable and fanciful solution of the problem of raising our standard of living in South Africa. I think that in essence her proposals suffer from the disadvantages which rendered previous proposals that we have had for a national minimum wage quite impracticable. A great portion of her speech was devoted to the subject of malnutrition. Of course, those remarks should be addressed to my colleague the Minister of Health, and the hon. member will have an opportunity of doing that when his Vote comes before the House. I do not propose therefore to deal with that except that I want to emphasize what the hon. member for South Coast has said, and that is that there is no connection really between a living wage and the question of malnutrition.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from><span class="col_1841-1842" refersTo="page_0935"/>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Oh really! It is like saying there is no connection between tuberculosis and the bacillus.</p>

<p>The MINISTER OF LABOUR: Sir, I did not interject when the hon. member was speaking and I suggest that she extends the same courtesy to me. Mr. Speaker let me say at once that I find no fault with the hon. member&#x2019;s desire, as expressed in the motion, to ensure that all workers are paid a living wage in order to increase the internal market and to combat malnutrition. This is possible. All these of course are very excellent objectives but the minimum wage system proposed by the hon. member in my opinion is not the way to achieve this object. I was under the impression that this subject had in the past been sufficiently aired in this House to make it clear beyond a doubt that it is impracticable to prescribe a minimum wage for all the workers in South Africa. I refer to the fact that this matter has been raised in this House during the past four years, and it seems that in view of the motion it might not be inappropriate to mention some of the difficulties which will militate against this system of a national minimum wage for all workers. In the first place let me pose the question to the hon. member for Houghton: What do we mean by a minimum wage, even if it does vary from area to area? Do we mean a fixed minimum cash wage payable by all employers to all employees including farm labourers and domestic servants and, if so, how do we calculate that wage; how do we ensure that the wage so fixed is in fact suitable both for farm labourers and factory workers in any given area? If we fix a wage which can be paid by a farmer to his labourers or by a householder to his domestic servants, what significance is it likely to have throughout industry? If, for instance, we exclude agricultural and domestic servants, which seems the only sensible thing to do, as I think hon. members will agree, then we exclude half the working population of South Africa. I think that is quite a fair statement. It has always been Government policy to bring about increases in wages for the lower paid worker with due regard to practical consideration. This policy, I find, was re-affirmed when the matter was debated in Parliament on previous occasions, and again in a statement which was issued by my predecessor in November 1960. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) dealt very fully with that aspect of the statement by my predecessor and I do not propose to repeat it. But I would say this that according to that statement it was considered some years ago and later on steps were taken to accelerate these wage determinations. Up to that time one of the difficulties had been that these wage determinations were too few and far between, and steps were then taken to accelerate wage determinations. The result has been that the Wage Board&#x2019;s rate of activity has increased threefold. Substantial increases in the prescribed minimum wages of the unskilled workers have resulted. Sir, appreciable wage improvements were also effected through the machinery of the Industrial Conciliation Act and the Native Labour Disputes Act, as the hon. member for Umhlatuzana quite rightly pointed out. That Act was supported by the United Party and hon. members will know that it has done very good work; I need not refer to it now. Hon members have referred to it and it has resulted in an appreciable rise in the wages of unskilled workers. I refer, of course, to the Bantu. The Government is convinced that in the circumstances prevailing in our country planned wage increases will in themselves help to bring about an increase in labour productivity. It is not only because they increase the work potential of the worker, but also because they encourage the employer to utilize his working force more effectively. The hon. member for South Coast gave a very practical example of that statement which I have just made. Systematic increases at shorter intervals, as I have said, as in the past will be aspired to in future by the Government. The Government is far from convinced that the introduction of a general minimum wage on an area basis, is the best method of obtaining an improvement in the standard of living of the lower paid income groups. Of course while such an increase in wages will indeed increase the demand for consumer goods and perhaps, according to certain quarters, bring about increased labour productivity it will at one fell swoop raise the whole cost structure of the country which will lead either to inflation or to widespread unemployment. Should this happen, I think hon. members will agree with me, the country&#x2019;s export trade, not only of manufactured goods but also of the products of agriculture and mining, will inevitably suffer. In addition it could also affect the profitability of our undertakings and it would restrict internal growth and expenditure in those industries. Export trade and capital growth are, of course, of such vital importance in the country&#x2019;s future economic development that the Government cannot in any circumstances afford to jeopardize it. This would not be in the interests of anyone, least of all in the interests of persons in the lower paid categories.</p>

<p>In view of the divergent labour conditions encountered in our country and the fact that our national economy, although highly developed in certain industrial spheres, is in some spheres still virtually undeveloped, the Government deems it more advisable that the improvement in the standard of living which we all aim at, should be achieved by means of gradual and selective wage increases. In this way commerce and industry generally will be in a position better to adapt itself to any wage increases. In particular the danger will be averted of trade sectors, which are now experiencing great difficulty due to a temporary set-back or to incomplete development, suffering irreparable loss or even in some cases being ruined. If we are forced to make allowances for all relevant factors, such as the varying cost of living, then of course any wage <span class="col_1843-1844" refersTo="page_0936"/>eventually fixed will have so many variations that it will no longer be a national minimum wage. Indeed fixed minimum wages, even on an area basis&#x2014;which was suggested by the hon. member&#x2014;are a physical impossibility. Such a minimum wage would be either so low as to be quite meaningless or so high as to place an impossible burden on some employers in our country. The present complementary system which we have of collective bargaining and statutory wage determination represent, I think the only practical way to fix wages in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton), in his amendment, suggested that additional machinery should be set up to the existing machinery. I think that idea was also propounded by the hon. member for Houghton. I think she talked about some judicial body being set up. Whether that body is to be over and above the Wage Board or whether the Wage Board is to be done away with I do not know, but the hon. member for Umhlatuzana suggested that there might be an improvement in the present machinery. All I can say is this, that in the short experience which I have had in this portfolio, I have found that our industrial legislation is as good as any in the world. I had the experience of travelling overseas last year as hon. members know and in addition to meeting ministers of immigration I also met ministers of labour. When I told them that we had had industrial peace in South Africa for many years they expressed the opinion that it was incredible; it could not happen. Some of the countries which I visited had six or seven strikes on their hands. They could not believe that in a country like South Africa which has a fairly hostile Press overseas, we have had industrial peace for so many years. That is why I say that our existing industrial machinery is effective; it has resulted in peace, it has resulted in satisfaction to particularly the lower income groups; we have had no strikes; we have had disputes which have been settled by the machinery which has been provided. This present wage fixing machinery to which I have referred and which is in operation is, as hon. members know, raising wages at a reasonable pace and without causing any dislocation or unemployment. The wage increases which have been effected by our Industrial Council agreements, by wage determinations and the efforts of the Central Native Labour Board during the past few years have added substantially to the pay-packets of the lower income groups. Through the efforts of the aforementioned instruments my Department has been instrumental in raising Bantu wages particularly in private industry by 5.9 per cent during 1959-60 and by 6.2 per cent in 1960-1 and by the same percentage in 1962. There have been new determinations, as hon. members know, under the Wage Act and they have often raised current unskilled wages by between 15 percent and 30 per cent. The revision of the older determinations has now been completed while Industrial Council agreements are automatically reviewed at frequent periods. Almost every week hon. members will notice the <i>Government Gazette</i> contains a new wage regulating measure which raises unskilled wage rates with the consequence that the unskilled wage bill has risen by between R30,000,000 and R40,000,000 per annum in the last few years. This has been achieved without disturbing our orderly economic progress.</p>

<p>I think I should state that the economic interests of the Republic necessitate a balanced approach to this whole question of wage regulation. Our experience has shown us that the present wage regulating system offers the safest and the most effective way to bring about a steady increase in minimum wages, on a selective basis, at a tempo which will not jeopardize what must be our primary consideration and that is to ensure sufficient industrial expansion in order to offer reasonable prospects of absorbing all our available labour now and in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>I have no time left to go into any other questions. I simply want to reiterate that, as my hon. friend who moved the amendment on this side of the House stated as well as his seconder, we have found that our present system is a fair system. It is working well, wage increases are taking place at a progressive rate each year. The Wage Board has got its work practically up to date; it is reviewing agreements from time to time and wages. I feel that this debate has probably achieved quite a great deal. It has ventilated this question of our lower paid wage-earner. But at the same time I cannot accept any suggestion whatsoever that there should be a subsidization of wages. It is quite unnecessary and it is quite impracticable. The Government could never accept any suggestion that wages in South Africa should be subsidized.</p>

<p>Mr. FIELD: During the few minutes left I would like to put forward two or three points which I think are of importance for consideration, points which have not as yet been raised in this debate. I support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Umhlatuzana (Mr. Eaton) because I consider it sets up a method best calculated to achieve the desirable objects which were put up by the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman). The original motion put forward by the hon. member for Houghton, to my mind, is an over-simplification of the problem and will not achieve the highly desirable objects which she has put forward, but on the contrary is more likely to have the opposite effect. A basic minimum wage could no doubt be arranged to ensure a living wage for those workers who are in employment. But at the same time it will have the effect that those work seekers who are not in employment will starve. The fact is that a basic minimum wage is a two-edged sword. It not only tells the employer that he may not employ anyone below a certain wage but it also tells the work-seeker that he may not accept employment below that wage. If he <span class="col_1845-1846" refersTo="page_0937"/>cannot find employment below that wage what must he do? He must starve unless there is a dole. That is the main point I want to raise. In comparing South Africa with countries like Great Britain you find that in Britain they have a dole. Anyone who is not in employment does not starve, he goes on the dole. Here in South Africa we have no dole. Therefore if a basic minimum wage were laid down for the whole country it must be accompanied by a dole to be feasible. The point is: Is a dole feasible in South Africa? I feel sure all hon. members in this House, even the hon. member for Houghton, will agree that a dole is not at the present time feasible in South Africa.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>What about unemployment insurance?</p>

<p>Mr. FIELD: Unemployment insurance assists up to a point those who have work and who become unemployed but the unemployment insurance system is breaking up in South Africa even to-day. There are so many people to-day who are not getting anything under it. What about those who have not worked for some time? They do not fall under it. The idea of the hon. member for Houghton definitely falls away. If we have a basic minimum wage we must have a dole and with the vast numbers in the reserves, squatters on farms, etc., who are still on a subsistence basis, how can we bridge the gap between that and a living minimum wage? That is the problem in South Africa. Unless we can bridge that gap in some way&#x2014;which will have to be by a dole; there is no other way&#x2014;there will have to be an extensive system of subsidies as my hon. friend suggested but which the hon. the Minister has turned down. Unless we can have a dole the whole idea of a minimum wage must be discarded.</p>

<p>I know of numerous instances of Bantu in the border area where one member of the family has been unable to work and has succeeded in getting help from the Government with the result that the whole family squatted and did no work at all. If it were possible to bring in a dole in South Africa on such a low basis for the Bantu that people overseas would simply laugh at it, it would do more harm than good. It would be better to have no dole than to have a dole on such a low basis which would ensure that a large number of Bantu would never work at all. Therefore I feel that point in itself is sufficient to rule out the idea of a basic minimum wage in South Africa. There are many casual jobs around the cities and on the farms which can provide those who are seeking work with something to do, something to keep the wolf from the door. With those wages they can keep alive until they can get a better job. If there is a basic minimum wage and they are unable to get employment at all it will force them to criminal methods. That is a point to be borne in mind. When you have large numbers of people who cannot get work and who are forced to starve because they may not accept a low wage, the only thing left to them is to resort to criminal methods and an increase in the crime rate in the country will tend to frighten away capital which is the one thing that we really need in order to bring about a living wage for all concerned.</p>

<p>I just want to refer to the position in Australia which I have studied. There the Government has been trying for many years to absorb the aborigines into the economy of the country with very little success because of the high basic minimum wage. People will not pay that high basic minimum wage to the raw aborigine who is incapable of earning it. They find that the high basic minimum wage prevents them from bridging the gap between savagery and civilization, it prevents them from bringing those people into the economy of the country. We in South Africa at the present time are fortunate in that we have not got a basic minimum wage; we have an easy adjustment in scales by which the unskilled worker coming from the Native areas with no knowledge of anything can find something to do; he is gradually being brought into the economy of the country. A basic minimum wage will hamper our bringing the unskilled worker into the economy of this country. The only sound approach to a living wage for employees in South Africa is, as I have said, that we must build up the economy of the country. It will not necessarily build up the economy of the country to simply pay out high wages all over. The method as set forth by the hon. the Minister, to my mind, is the only practical way. We must gradually raise wages on a selective basis; in as many industries as possible we must pay a living wage to the unskilled worker. We will find that we will actually improve the output by paying higher wages in as many selected industries as possible. We will get a better output because if the workers in those industries do not give their best they will lose their jobs and they will have to fall back on lower wages. But a basic minimum wage throughout the whole country will tend to reduce output because it will tend to have this effect that a man who has a job will try to do less work in order that his pal may also get a job beside him. Whereas if you have a selective wage and not a basic minimum wage you encourage increased productivity and on that basis alone can you build up a substantial and increasing economy in the country which will then provide more work and better wages for a greater number of people. It is an economic fallacy to imagine that by simply paying out higher wages all around you will improve the economy of the country. A country cannot lift itself up by its own boot strings. That is what a basic minimum wage in South Africa at the present time will be endeavouring to do.</p>

<p>The principle of a minimum wage is in keeping with United Party policy of the rate for the job, but practical considerations of the varying stages of development of the workers in South Africa make it essential in the interests of the workers that there should be freedom at the very lowest level. We should <span class="col_1847-1848" refersTo="page_0938"/>leave the door open at the very lowest level for the workers to sell their labour as they are able to do according to their knowledge and their physical and mental ability and to bridge the gap between savagery and civilization. A basic minimum wage would do more harm than good, to my mind, to the workers under conditions prevailing in South Africa.</p>

<p>In the few minutes at my disposal I just want to refer to one point in the speech which I have prepared and that is that it has been suggested here that malnutrition is simply a question of inadequate wages. I want to say that that is an oversimplification of a very complex problem. I also want to add that the non-Whites themselves can make an important contribution towards combating malnutrition and poverty. This brings me, Mr. Speaker, to a problem which we must face sooner or later, a tragedy which one actually hesitates to discuss. I can assure you that when I do so to-day I do so with the greatest sense of responsibility. I refer to the large-scale, unplanned, irresponsible, reckless, illegitimate procreation of children amongst the Bantu.</p>

<p>When the debate was adjourned I was about to rise and to speak on a subject on which I have on previous occasions touched on lightly in this House, a subject which is of vital importance to all our farmers in South Africa. It deals with this particular feature of a farmer&#x2019;s livelihood and farming development that everything he produces by way of grain and everything he takes off his farm has got to be clothed. Such is the position in South Africa that I will not even at this stage attempt to guess at the number of bags which are actually required for this use. This I must say, Mr. Speaker, that I look upon this particular subject as of very vital importance to our producers and to our country and I am very sorry indeed that the Minister who, I feel, is responsible for the subject on which I am talking is not with us at the moment. I hope, however, that his colleagues will pass on to him any point which I might raise.</p>

<p>I come back to the position of those of our producers who require these large quantities of bags &#x2026;.</p>

<speech by="#dodds">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DODDS</person>:</from>

<p>I was dealing with the question of packing for farmers&#x2019; produce. I had dealt with the position in so far as I had said that I had no conception of how many bags we required for the vast number of products that we are so happily able to produce in this country. As regards the question of wool packs&#x2014;with that I am of course fairly at home&#x2014;I happen to know that that is in the vicinity of some 1,000,000 packs. Before I can develop my argument, I think 1 should refer to the position that unfortunately developed some years ago when sanctions were imposed against this country, as a result of which we had tremendous difficulties in obtaining for the farmers of this country bags and woolpacks. The development which flowed from that ultimately was that two or three manufacturers were encouraged to get themselves established in South Africa in order to make this country self-sufficient in respect of its requirements for packing. Along with the fact that these manufacturers established themselves in South Africa at tremendous cost, one would have expected that the development in regard to raw fibre, which would be so necessary for the manufacture of packing, would have been brought forward over these years, and that we might have attained a position where we could say that we were very nearly in a position to meet the demands of these mills. Unfortunately, that position has not arisen. In discussing this matter in the House last year, the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services gave us a brief report on the position and indicated that research had taken place over the last few years and that during 1960 and 1961 the Government had expended some R75,000, and, Sir, quite recently, as late as the 19th of this month, in reply to a question that 1 put, the hon. the Minister indicated that research was still continuing. I know that the hon. the Minister has a tremendously difficult task in trying to bring about what to all of us must be the obvious ultimate end, that is to be able to produce in South Africa sufficient fibre to be able to manufacture all the grain bags and woolpacks we need. But what could the Minister tell us? He told us that the production at this stage from local-grown fibre was only sufficient to manufacture some 4 per cent of the goods required. Some 4 per cent! It is a very small percentage. The position simply is that we are faced with a very serious problem. It is not only serious for the producer but also for the manufacturer.</p>

<p><span class="col_1849-1850" refersTo="page_0939"/>These big institutions have been encouraged to establish themselves and I feel the Government is in duty bound to do something for them. But the point is that we maintain these factories which are producing possibly half of our needs both in grain bags and in wool-packs, at a tremendous cost to the producer. I know that it is a difficult task, and I want to say more: By way of a question on the Order Paper I asked the hon. the Minister whether he could give us some indication of forward planning. It does seem that the Minister has a gigantic task in planning to be able to produce sufficient raw fibres to be able to meet the needs of this country. We have a double problem. Our labour costs in this country are so much higher than those for instance in India or Pakistan and when we, as we are doing now, in order to keep our factories going, allow them to import raw jute and manufacture the articles here, then you find that the farmer has got to pay in some instances very nearly double the price. This is not a matter that we can deal with lightly. It has received attention for many years 1 was associated with it myself for a very long time, and I know that it is difficult. I hoped that as the years went on it might probably work itself out, but it looks to me that at this stage we have to bring this very forcibly to the notice of the House. Something must be done. We have constantly been told that farmers must produce more economically. Now let us look at the position with regard to grain bags. I think the chairman of the Mealie Board is with us, and I know he would admit that this is the position. 1 am not going to burden the House with a lot of detail. I think that the hon. the Minister feels his responsibility and so do farmer members, and they must realize that this is a very serious matter. In 1961 quite a substantial quantity of grain bags were imported, millions of bags, and the price was 21.20 cents. In 1961, locally manufactured bags cost 46.36 cents. How can we go on like this? Can we keep this under blanket longer? I think difficult as the task is, something must be done. The question I would like to ask is, who subsidizes who? Who is carrying this burden all the time? Who is talking about overproduction and all the rest of it? Look at this position! Can&#x2019;t we arrive at the position where the Government will say: We know our commitments <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> these manufacturers. But who is carrying this burden to-day? Do the wool-farmers know that in 1961 it cost them R370.000 extra! That is the extra cost on the</p>

<p>1,0,000 packs. In other words, half were imported from overseas, half were manufactured here, and for the half that was manufactured here, he paid R370,000 more. This is a very far-reaching matter, and it is one we have to apply our mind to. It is not a political issue. It is probably due to a lack of forward planning. But then it might be said and it can be said that had we tackled the Orange River scheme years ago, this could have been tied up. But the problem I pose is: How long can we expect the farmers to carry the burden? This thing is running parallel. You have a position here where you say: We must keep these factories going in case &#x2026; In case of what? In case Pakistani raises sanctions against us? But if she does, where is your jute to process through these factories? Then we have lost both ends. As I said, I do not want to burden the House with a lot of statistics, but I think that really the position is very serious. I have not worked this out on any specific price and quantity, but I do know that in 1961 for instance, our woolpacks cost us imported R1.37 per pack and our local pack cost us R2.23. I raised this matter on previous occasions, but I am sad to say that in not one instance have I had any support from hon. members opposite. What I do ask is that the Minister concerned will give us all the information he can with regard to plans. If he can encourage us, we do not want to do any harm to these factories which have been established, and we can be assured of some real forward planning, then I myself would feel very much happier about it. But it is taking such a long time. The Minister the other day gave us some encouraging news, but looking through various reports I have received, we somehow have been bungling around with machines that were not properly made. We have not set about this as one would as businessmen. We have not imported the very best in order to be able to get on with the job. That is how it seems to me.</p>

<p>I am very glad to hear that, but I know the hon. Minister&#x2019;s report last year was not so very good in that respect, but I have been recently told that there was one implement which was used in connection with pineapples which someone thought came out of the Ark. It certainly was not suitable for the experiment. But to bring home the seriousness of the position to hon. members opposite, I will give them some of the figures in respect of the 1959-63 woolpacks. The locally manufactured 8 lbs. woolpack cost 15s. 9d&#x201E; but the standard which we had to eventually use of 10-f lbs. cost 17s. 4d. The farmer did not pay those prices, but those were first costs. Now the imported packs of 10&#x00BC; lbs. cost 7s. 2d., 7s. 6d. and 7s. lid. at the restrictive ports. In 1960-1, the local manufacturers&#x2019; price was 17s. 4d. and the imported pack 9s. I am sure the hon. the Minister knows all about that.</p>

<p>I do not know what the hon. member is referring to, but I do know that in 1961-2, locally manufactured woolpacks cost 22s. lid. and your imported bag was 15s. 9d. Unfortunately the information supplied by the Department to me in regard to grain bags was not complete, but 1 hope in due course that information will be brought to the attention of members so that they can fully realize that the problem that I have been discussing is one of vital importance to the country. It does not only affect the producer but it is wide spread. If the cost of your packing is excessive, it affects the consumer and everybody. The sooner we tackle this proposition and the sooner we clear it up, the better for all. As I said earlier, as I see the matter as a layman, I am asking myself at this stage: Who subsidizes who in this jumble of price fixtures that we have here to-day?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#labuschagne">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LABUSCHAGNE</person>:</from>

<p>I too listened to what I shall call the &#x201C;help each other&#x201D; speech and I came to the conclusion that the hon. member had stated the factual position and that the hon. member for Drakensberg with her accompanying comments had made the political part of the speech. In any case it was interesting and I readily agree that the hon. member has raised a matter of very great importance. At the present moment one of the greatest problems which faces agriculture is the question of bags but I want to state clearly that years ago the cry went up right throughout the country: Why do we not produce our own bags in South Africa? That is the question. Hon. members opposite obviously now want to blame the Government for having displayed the necessary courage in connection with this matter which we knew would be accompanied by growing pains. The hon. member said himself that he realized that there were great difficulties connected with the establishment of such an industry. That was exactly what happened. We are busy to-day and as we know South Africa you can be sure of it beforehand that things will not always work out the way you have drafted your blueprint in an office. You will encounter difficulties. That has happened. The fibre which we thought would be a great success was not successful in South Africa and new fibre had to be found and imported. That takes time. If you fail, a year has gone by and you have to start all over again. The Government has, however, tackled the matter and I want to assure you, Sir, that none other than also myself already raised the question of the price of grain bags for the agricultural industry last year, and I asked the Government to do everything it could to assist the farmers in that regard. And the Government did so, it has already assisted as far as it has been possible for it to do. But we must at least be fair and a businessman like the hon. member knows that if you have to establish such an industry from scratch and you have to import fibre and test it to see whether it is suitable or not you must be prepared to do that for a number of years and to struggle. I am convinced of it and I think the country is convinced of it, that within a few years&#x2019; time we shall be able to meet all our needs at a much lower price than is the case to-day. I want to remind the hon. member of this that when the Government was forced by the public to assist this industry and to support it we paid 7s. for bags overseas and not 21 d. like we do to-day. That is the test. Should we have continued paying up to 7s. overseas for a grain bag? If we pay 4s. to-day for a bag which we manufacture locally and 2s. for an imported one, we are still in a much better position than we were when we started. So progress has already been made in this regard.</p>

<p>I just want to say this briefly in connection with the suggestion made by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) who is not here at the moment. I think it is unfair to say that the Government has done nothing for the farming community during this critical period. On the contrary I think the Government has done what it could. I do not think the Ministers personally are responsible for what we have had to contend with during the past few years. I think of the unusual drought conditions which have prevailed throughout South Africa. Moreover whereas you were faced with the severest drought conditions in one part of the country, such as South West Africa and the northern part of the Cape Province, and in Northern Transvaal, other parts of the country produced the biggest surpluses we have ever had in the country. Whereas in the past we have only had to deal with about</p>

<p>30.0. 000 bags of maize, the production has been increased this year to 60,000,000 bags, and that production may perhaps be increased further. I wish to state that the position is this that what we are contending with in South Africa to-day is a world phenomenon namely the terrific development of technique, of the implements and tools which are used by the agricultural industry to-day in the world. We know that in certain European countries which never previously thought about supplying their own needs as far as grain was concerned, surpluses are being produced to-day. We think of a country like France and a country like Austria who were previously big importers of maize products and who have grain surpluses to-day. It is the age of the machine and the machine has made the development possible in South Africa with the result that whereas we previously produced 25.000,000 bags we produced</p>

<p>60.0. 000 bags last year. South Africa is not <span class="col_1853-1854" refersTo="page_0941"/>the only country which faces that problem, but it is a problem which also faces countries like America and practically every other country in the world. The problem is how to deal with the additional production potential which has become possible because of science and the techniques of the times in which we are living. I wish to point out that we are being strangled in this cost price spring trap. The problem which confronts the agriculturist in South Africa to-day is this: Whereas on the one hand his costs are continually rising he has succeeded in increasing his production; he is placed in the difficult position that his prices are declining while his costs are rising. That is a world phenomenon. I recently had the opportunity of witnessing in America how they were struggling with that problem and how the American Government was injecting millions of dollars into its agricultural industry to enable it to combat the same evil and problem with which we in South Africa are struggling. There is simply no magic wand to solve that problem. I merely want to plead, and I know I am not pleading in vain, that the Government should not leave the farmer of South Africa to stand alone in this critical period but that it should continue to recognize the problems of the farmer in the great national set-up and that it should realize that a poor farming community can be fatal to South Africa. No depression will impoverish a country more than an impoverished farming community. We know that the agricultural industry remains the backbone, remains the strongest foundation on which the economy of our country is based, in spite of all our gold and all our wealth. That is why I can confidently plead this afternoon that we should not panic and look for scapegoats or blame the Government which is not at all responsible for the position in which we find ourselves. I also want to plead with the Minister not to view the position in which we find ourselves in a desperate light but that he should regard it as a temporary world phenomenon and that we should assist our agricultural industry over this crisis in such a way that we will reach the other side as a strong and sound agricultural community which can keep pace with the other developments and the progress of South Africa. I know how a small set-back can send out waves which affect agriculture as a whole. Last year, for example, we were compelled to lower the price of milk and when you lower such a small thing as the price of milk the results may be such that you cannot imagine where it will end, because if that farmer to whom you granted a loan yesterday or the day before to buy milk cows, now receives a reduced price for his milk and he has to sell those cows. He can no longer sell those cows at the price which he has paid for them, he may have to sell them at half the price which he has paid for them and that means that financially he is immediately ruined. And that is not all, the industry may shortly find itself in a position where there is a shortage in the same sphere. I want to plead, therefore, that we should keep on the right track in these critical times which we are experiencing to-day and that we should support our agricultural industry in such a way that it will always remain the backbone and mainstay of our economy in South Africa. That is why I am convinced that a motion such as the one introduced by the Opposition to-day, a motion which is nothing but criticism, cannot be conducive to progress. Nor must we make the mistake of regarding the surpluses which we have in South Africa to-day as an evil, nor must we regard them as an insoluble problem. In a country where there are surpluses there is prosperity, there is food and we should be grateful for that. But we must use the surpluses which we have, we must use them to the advantage of the entire community, we have the maize surplus and we must not only think of the problem of exporting it. We must exercise our minds to try to find a way in which we can thereby benefit other sections of the farming community. If the sheep farmer can use the necessary maize to maintain the growth and condition of his sheep throughout the year, just think what his wool cheque will be at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Sir, just think how much greater his lamb crop will be at the end of the year. When I think of the droughts which are continually striking our country and I think of how the stock of the farmers deteriorate and how the animals, almost skeletons, wander around the barren veld, I ask myself the question whether sufficient maize cannot be fed to those animals to keep them in a proper condition. Just think how that will increase the prosperity of the farming community. No, I do not think we should ever be dissatisfied when there is a big maize crop, but we should be grateful for it that we in South Africa can produce one of the best concentrated feeds in the world and that we can produce better than most countries in the world. When the American farmer has a big crop he does not think how many bags he can sell but how many oxen he can feed. In America they have what they call the &#x201C;beef-hog economy&#x201D; and the farmer&#x2019;s wealth lies in that, not in the sale of so many bags of maize in the form of bags of maize. He feeds his beautiful young oxen and his pigs and he takes them to the market. If we could do that in South Africa instead of exporting so many million bags of maize, and we use that maize to feed slaughter cattle which we can export, just think how many fewer trucks will be required, how many fewer bags will be required, and how much higher the prices for the end product will be. These are merely suggestions which I am putting forward to show that we should not panic; when we have had a good crop in this country we must not carry on as though a catastrophe has befallen the country. We should be grateful and try to use that crop to the best advantage for the greatest possible section of the nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate the <span class="col_1855-1856" refersTo="page_0942"/>hon. member for Vryburg (Mr. Labuschagne) on his speech.

<p>It is a pity that the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) is not able to be here to-day, because of circumstances beyond his control, and he has asked me to listen to what is said here on his behalf so that he may reply to it. But I wonder where the two Ministers of Agriculture are? We on this side were very glad, because we thought that they had taken the hint and had resigned. I see the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services is here now, but the Minister to whom we really want to address our remarks is not here. Will the Minister of Information make a statement to the Press to say that the Minister of Agricultural Economics has already resigned?</p>

<p>This motion of the hon. member for Gardens reads that the House expresses its deep dissatisfaction at the obvious lack of planning and guidance in respect of the serious problems threatening the agricultural industry and requests the two Cabinet Ministers responsible for it to resign immediately. Now I can well understand that the Government supporters are perhaps not very anxious to support the last part of it, that the Ministers should resign, but are there actually farming members in this House who are not seriously concerned about the position of agriculture in South Africa? If there are such members, let them have the courage to get up and say; I am not concerned. No, now they are dead quiet. [Interjections.] We have reached the position to-day where some members who represent the farmers here do not care a sixpence for the fate of the farmers, as long as they can sit here safely and exploit the colour prejudices of the public in order to retain their seats. They do not care that the farmers are going under in the way they are doing. I challenge any hon. member opposite to tell me that agriculture in South Africa is still a payable part of our economy to-day and that the farmers are satisfied with the prices they receive for their products, taking into consideration the high production costs. [Interjection.] There sits the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais), who does not know the difference between poultry and dairy farming, and he attacks a practical farmer who is trying to produce in order also to contribute towards paying his salary, when I discuss a matter affecting my living. This Parliament is his living, not mine.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I say I do not know whether it is the policy of the Government completely to squeeze out the small farmer, because they say every day that the farmers must produce more economically. The Minister of Agricultural Technical Services should rather tell us how we can produce more economically, because as far as I know the farmers of South Africa I do not know one who deliberately tries to produce uneconomically. When the Minister of Agricultural Economics says that the farmers should be prepared in times of surpluses to compete with the outside world then I ask this Government to do the same, and let it compete with Governments overseas. I shall point out in a moment how this Government discriminates against the farmer. Although we made the statement that this House expresses its deep dissatisfaction at the obvious lack of agricultural planning, the hon. member for Christiana (Mr. Wentzel) moves an amendment, and what does he move? The usual thing, that the Government should be thanked for the steps taken to promote agricultural production and to make agriculture more efficient and stable. I do not know what this Government has done to promote agricultural production. Surely the hon. members who moved the amendment should be able to give reasons and say: This is what the Government did to promote production and to make agriculture more efficient and more stable. Secondly, they thank the Government for the orderly and stable marketing system. Where is this orderly and stable marketing? Just talk to the wheat farmers and the mealie farmers and the producers of meat and hear what they say. Last year the Minister of Agricultural Economics said that it was not the Government&#x2019;s duty to come to light with a marketing scheme for meat; he is only there to decide whether the schemes submitted to him are good or bad. And what happened? All control and all planning in regard to meat was abolished and it is now a case of letting things take their own course. There is no planning in regard to meat any more and the housewife is being exploited to-day in times of scarcity, <span class="col_1857-1858" refersTo="page_0943"/>whilst the farmer is being destroyed in times of surpluses.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, it may be a soap-box speech, but the hon. member should talk, to his own farmers and to the housewives in the urban areas. There is no longer any control. We are left to the mercy of the middle man, whom this Government has so often said that they would restrict. But the problem has become too involved for these two Ministers. The two of them together do not do even one man&#x2019;s work and they have given up. [Interjections.] The hon. member for Christiana says we must thank the Government for its planning, but I want him to get up and tell us where that planning is, because I know of none.</p>

<p>Then they say the second reason why they thank the Government is for the assistance given to the farmers who were in trouble. When is a farmer in trouble? Farmers find themselves in trouble during a drought, and then it is the duty of the Government to assist them. They land in trouble in times of floods, and then the Government must help them. But the greatest trouble which the farmers are in at the moment is that they cannot make a profit as the result of rising costs of production and falling produce prices, and when they are in that trouble and the Government grants loans it is not assisting the farmer; it is just aggravating the trouble because the farmers have to repay those loans. Let me say that the farmers&#x2019; record for repaying loans is a good one. The farmer does not want charity; he only wants an opportunity to make a success of the operations.</p>

<p>What is the fourth reason why hon. members opposite thank the Government? They say the Government has ensured the independence and the freedom of the farmers. I can speak only about the area which I know best, the Western Province, and not for many years have the farmers in the Western Province found themselves in the trouble in which they are to-day, and the Minister knows it. He knows that the farmers in the Western Province find themselves in a difficult position to-day, due to a large extent to the lack of planning on the part of these two Ministers who do nothing or very little to assist them. Let us take a few instances. Let me first come to the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services. Years ago the S.A. Agricultural Union asked him to ensure closer co-operation between the research services, the field services and the extension services, and the S.A. Agricultural Union went as far as to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If this link cannot be closer than the present incorporation into one Department of Agricultural Technical Services, there is only one solution, namely that these services should be provided by bodies outside the Public Service.</block>

<p>These are serious allegations emanating from the farmers themselves. Another thing they say is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Another complaint is that the regulatory services also suffer from a lack of manpower. There are too few officials to ensure the implementation of precepts in regard to fodder, stock remedies, vaccines and fertilizer. There is also the complaint that the results of research reach the farmer too slowly. The question may be asked as to why the farmers believe the salesmen who sell unnecessary things to them rather than the scientists and the extension officers of the Department. There is an appreciable lack of research and guidance in regard to the question of agricultural mechanization. The establishment of an institute of agricultural engineering is absolutely essential.</block>

<p>I think the Minister will agree that that is true, and now I ask the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, as he is here and the other Minister is not: What has he done to meet these needs? If he will rise and tell us he has done this or that, I will thank him, but we appoint one commission after another and simply nothing is done. What place is there in the Western Province for the training of young farmers and farm workers as far as the mechanical section of farming is concerned? The Minister just laughs. As far as I know, there is no actual place where this training is given to-day. except at Ficksburg in the Free State. But has the Minister ever made an attempt to give any training to farmers here in the Western Province, where we have the greatest concentration of agricultural machinery? The Minister now seems to prefer to talk to the Minister of Information. Perhaps he is seeking information, but he can just as well go to the S.A. Agricultural Union. I honestly hope that the farmers will now get Ministers who will not just tell them how much they care for them but who by their actions will show them how much they care about them.</p>

<p>You see, Sir. that is the sympathy the farmer gets&#x2014;just politics, just the colour question over and over, and the impoverishment of the farmer; and the poorer he gets the easier it is for him to become a Nationalist and the more easily he becomes afraid of the Native. First impoverish him and destroy him so that he loses his self-respect and then you can frighten him with the Native. But an independent farmer is not afraid of the Minister of Information, <span class="col_1859-1860" refersTo="page_0944"/>nor is he afraid of the Native problem, because he is quite able to hold his own.</p>

<p>I say this Government has done nothing new for the farmer. I shall be pleased to hear what they have done for the farmers. But they have even taken away what the former Government did for the farmers. Let us take one instance. One of the basic essentials on a farm as far as certain aspects of farming such as dairy farming or pig farming or poultry farming are concerned is fodder, and the biggest expense is providing fodder for your stock, and a great deal of the fodder is composed of the proteins obtained from fish meal. This Government saw fit to increase the fixed price of fish meal from about &#x00A3;27 to &#x00A3;37 per ton. But when the farmers asked that wheat prices be increased a little, the Minister of Economic Affairs said no, the wheat farmers were making enough, because you must take the farm as a whole, the wheat, the cattle and the sheep together, and when you take them all into account then the farmer makes enough. But when it came to the fish industry and we pointed out that the fish industry paid huge dividends and was building up big reserves, the answer was yes, but each sub-division of that industry must show a profit, including the fish meal section. Let us take fertilizer. We get a subsidy of R2 per ton, and the quality of that fertilizer unfortunately makes no difference. The Government is so apt to tell the mealie farmer he must remember there is a surplus and he must compete with world prices. But when is the Government going to tell the fertilizer companies that the farmer in South Africa is having a hard time and that they must compete with world prices for fertilizer? What is happening at present? The farmer is being forced to pay Sasol and Foscor a subsidy, because as a result of an agreement which the Government apparently has with the fertilizer companies, they are compelled to buy a certain quantity of their requirements from those two organizations at &#x00A3;3 more per ton, as in the case of phosphate and nitrogen, and then the farmer gets a subsidy of &#x00A3;1. Now who pays that subsidy? The farmer. I have no objection, but I say that if Sasol and Foscor are two national industries requiring help, then it is the duty of South Africa as a whole to subsidize them and not just the farmers. Let the Minister tell me how I am to produce mealies and wheat on poorer soil than that of most of the countries abroad where the same crops are produced. Compare the production figure for wheat in South Africa with that in Western Europe and it will be seen that their yield per acre is four or five times as much as it is here, but they get their fertilizer cheaper than we do. even though they have more fertile soil. It is difficult for a farmer to produce under those circumstances. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>We are to-day in this position. The Government appoints a commission. It is not supposed to be economic to invest your money in an undertaking unless you get 10 per cent to 12 per cent on your investment. The Viljoen Commission said that. I now ask the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services, who ought to know: What type of farming gives you 8 per cent on your investment? And if what I say is true, that there is practically no branch of farming in South Africa that gives you even 5 per cent, then there must be something wrong with farming under this Government. [Interjections.]. There may be some farmers who are not good farmers, but I say, generally speaking, the farmer does not show 5 per cent profit on his investment. I ask the Minister to stand up and tell me that my figures are wrong. I say there is no profession which pays less than farming in South Africa to-day. We farmers would also very much like to pay our workers the wages paid by the factories. I would very much like to do that. I would like to see them decently clad and living under better conditions, but I ask the Minister again: Is it possible for me, out of the income I get to-day from sowing corn, or from a cow&#x2019;s milk, to pay better wages? Why do they not make it possible for us? I do not want to talk too much to this hon. Minister, because I must say that his officials try very hard, if only he will allow them, to give us services, and the real culprit is not here to-day. But I want to ask the Minister what they are doing to increase milk consumption in South Africa? Has an investigation ever been made to discover why even the White people in South Africa use dairy products to a much lesser extent than in most European countries?</p>

<block name="quote">That the House go into Committee on the Estimates of Additional Expenditure to be defrayed from Revenue and Loan Accounts during the year ending 31 March 1963.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to ask the House for additional supply of R24,564,000 on Revenue Account and R3,296,000 on Loan Account.</p>

<p>Hon. members will recollect that in Committee of Supply on the Treasury Vote last session (1962) <i>I</i> announced that the balance on Revenue Account for the financial year 1961-2, after allowing for certain expenditure included in the Supplementary Estimates for that year, would be credited to the Defence Special Equipment Account. The amount is R7,000,000 and is included in the R9,000,000-odd requested under Vote 40&#x2014;Defence.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, therefore, the extra amount asked in respect of the 1962-3 financial year is R 17,564,000 or 2.2 per cent of the amount originally voted which is most reasonable and is equal to the average percentage of additional amounts asked for during the past six years. Especially so when cognizance is taken of the large amounts requested for essential services under Votes&#x2014;Public Works (R2,245,000); Social Welfare and Pensions (R1,690,000); Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones (R 1,054,000); Health (R 1,875,000); Agricultural Economics and Marketing: General (R2,704.000); Police (R 1,590,000); and Defence. I do not intend going into the reasons for these supplementary amounts at this stage &#x2014;my colleagues will give full details of the amounts that are asked for under the Votes relating to their portfolios.</p>

<p>As far as the Loan Account is concerned, we are requesting an amount which is well below the average over the past six years. Nearly half the amount requested is required to supplement the Police Standard Stock Account due mainly to the switch over to the new type of police uniform and the increased establishment of the Police Force.</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<p>I agree with the hon. the Minister that this is not the moment for a long debate on the motion to go into committee. The hon. the Minister comes forward with these Additional Estimates each year and he tells us the percentage of increase for which he is asking. Of course, it can be extremely misleading to talk about percentages because it entirely depends on what amount you are asking a percentage of. The amount this year is 2.2 per cent, but it is 2.2 per cent of a considerably larger amount than the amount last year, when it was 2.3 per cent. It is no excuse to come along and plead that your illegitimate baby is only a small one. It is our duty this afternoon to make sure that the baby the hon. the Minister is foisting on the House is a legitimate one. He has told us that his colleagues are here to give us full details as to why these amounts are necessary. That being so, I agree with him that the best thing to do is to get into committee and to allow his colleagues, supplemented by himself, to give the House information about the reasons for the very substantial additional amounts being asked for.</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>I can give full details if hon. members would like to have them but briefly the position is that there is a saving on salaries of about R5,000. But there are additional costs which are mainly attributable to the Economic Advisory Council, the Scientific Advisory Council and the South West Africa Investigation Committee. That amounts to roughly R34,000. Then there are also charges for additional post, telegraph and telephone services in connection with the same three new services which have been added lately to my Department. The same applies to printing costs. There is an additional expenditure therefore of R37,900 and a saving of R5,200, which taken together represents this additional expenditure of R32,700.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think we should ask the Prime Minister for further details, but I think in printing the Estimates it should have been indicated that the increased expenditure was due to two major items which were not really considered when the Estimates were originally framed, namely the Economic Advisory Committee and the South West Africa Committeee.

<p>This Vote is, of course, becoming a very big Vote. It involves something like R22,000,000 and the increase is something like R2,250,000. There are three items here which one wonders how they are split up. I refer to J, K and L. Item J is &#x201C;Rent, rates, electric current, etc.&#x201D; and the additional amount to be voted here is R803.000. Item K is &#x201C;General Maintenance Services&#x201D;, where an additional R20.000 has to be voted, and Item L is &#x201C;General Repair Services&#x201D;, for which an amount of R598,000 extra is required. That takes no account of R153.000 which is the increased amount to be voted for furniture, safes, plant, machinery and tools. I do not know how maintenance is separated from general repairs. When is maintenance not repairs? I should have thought that in most circumstances when you are maintaining something you are also repairing it.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_public_works">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS</person>:</from>

<p>At the risk of contravening the rules of the House I may say that there is a difference between repairs and maintenance. If you re whitewash a house it is maintenance and not a repair. But I will give the hon. member the reasons as far as I can. With regard to subhead J there is an increase of R803,000, which is made up as follows. Firstly, rent accounts for R242,100. This increase is due to (i) the demand for additional hire accommodation for expanding departments and (ii) increases in rentals in respect of existing leases arising from higher property valuations as well as increased costs of cleaning. Secondly, assessment rates account for R 19,400. This increase is due, firstly, to newly erected Government-owned rateable properties; secondly, higher municipal valuations and tariffs and, thirdly, the provision of R4,000 to meet late accounts rendered by the Durban and Kimberley Municipalities. In the third place, municipal services (water, sanitation, etc.) account for R198.500. This increase is due to, firstly, the erection of new buildings and the taking over of certain technical colleges by the Government; secondly, continual increases in municipal tariffs; thirdly, increased water consumption as a result of drought conditions which prevailed throughout the Republic, and fourthly, the restoration of military camps for occupation by the Permanent Force. The fourth item is electric current and gas. This increase of R343,000 is due to (i) the occupation of additional Government and hired buildings by Government Departments; (ii) the restoration of military camps for occupation by the Permanent Force; (iii) the taking over of certain technical colleges by the Government, which I referred to previously; (iv) the replacement of coal by electric stoves in Defence official quarters, and (v) continued increases in municipal tariffs for electricity. With regard to sub-head K, General Maintenance Services, the increase here is R20.000. The continued expansion of the Public Service inevitably results in corresponding increases in the provision of State-owned occupations. The increase of R20,000 is due to (i) the maintenance of installations and gardens at newly erected Government-owned buildings; (ii) the maintenance of installations in Defence camps which are being restored for occupation by the Permanent Force; (iii) an increase in the price of coal, and (iv) more cleaning materials required for newly erected Government-owned buildings.</p>

<p>Under sub-head L, General Repair Service, there is an increase of R598,000. The additional provision is required to enable the Department to carry out essential and urgent repairs to State-owned buildings, furniture, plant and machinery, postponement of which would be uneconomical and in some cases constitute a danger to public safety. At the request of the Treasury the Department&#x2019;s original estimate of expenditure under this subhead was reduced by R200.000. In the absence of details of the work involved, no specific position for the restoration of camps for housing the full-time Defence Force was made in the original Estimates. Treasury approval was subsequently obtained by the Department to include in the Additional Estimates for 1962-3, an amount not exceeding the estimated expenditure of R367,197 during the current financial year on the restoration of accommodation for the full-time force.</p>

<p>We are being asked here to vote a good deal of money and we are really being asked in advance to validate the expenditure of money which has already been spent. I must say that sub-heads J, K and L generally do indicate the necessity for the closest possible eye being kept by the hon. the Minister on this continued expansion and extension of buildings occupied by the Public Service. Wherever you go in the Republic to-day there are new buildings going up and as soon as they have been built they are leased by the Government for a new Department. I do think that this very substantial increase of R1,250,000 does indicate the necessity for the hon. the Minister with his colleague, the <span class="col_1865-1866" refersTo="page_0947"/>Minister of Finance, to keep the closest possible check on the undoubted tendency of Government Departments to spread, in giving effect to Parkinson&#x2019;s Law and hiring premises and extending themselves without any obvious increase in the efficiency of the Public Service.</p>

<p>I think one is entitled on this occasion to emphasize that we do expect the Minister concerned to keep the closest possible eye on the tendency of the Public Service continually to grab and demand extended accommodation, extended offices, extended buildings and thus increasing the cost of this Vote which we have to deal with every year.</p>

<p>I shall be very glad if the Minister can give us some information in regard to sub-head E, &#x201C;Miscellaneous Expenses; Relief of distress in Iran&#x201D;, where we are being asked to vote an addition R17, I56. I would like to ask the Minister whether this was a direct contribution to the Government of Iran or was it a contribution assessed through the United Nations agency to which the contribution was made for this particular relief. Then in regard to sub-head K, &#x201C;United Nations&#x201D;, there is an increase of R96,400. I should be glad if the Minister could give some details of that item. Are we to understand that this is an increased contribution to the United Nations as the result of United Nations&#x2019; operations in the Congo or does this represent an increase in our own contribution to the United Nations?</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>With regard to sub-head E, these extra funds are required in connection with the relief of distress in Iran. There was an earthquake there and like other nations we felt that we should make a contribution towards the relief of that distress. The amount of R17.156 represents the cost of medical supplies donated to Iran following upon the earthquake disaster in that country. We have done that in the past too. In the case of the Madagascar catastrophe some years ago we also contributed very liberally by sending food and also medical supplies.</p>

<p>As regards the other points raised by the hon. member in connection with the amount due to the United Nations, the position is that the annual contribution varies from year to year. It is worked out on a certain percentage of the costs.</p>

<p>The original estimate of R250,000 in respect of the annual contribution to the United Nations for 1963. payable in March 1963, was made in the light of the assessment in respect of the 1962 contribution. South Africa&#x2019;s assessment in respect of the 1963 contribution is, however, now to hand and amounts to R346.200, i.e. R96.200 in excess of the original provision. Then there were the annual contributions to the Voluntary Funds (UNICEF&#x2014;Children&#x2019;s Fund; EPTA&#x2014;Expanded Programme for Technical Assistance, and the Refugee Fund and also the Special Fund) which amounted to R53.800 and then there was also the emergency force in the Suez to which we have regularly contributed, unlike a very large number of other United Nations members who have not contributed a penny. We have again contributed this year the sum of R75.000.</p>

<p>I would like the Minister of Finance to give us some information regarding sub-head E, &#x201C;Miscellaneous Expenses: <i>Ex gratia</i> payment to Schmidt, le Roux and Company,&#x201D; R5,952.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The position in regard to this <i>ex gratia</i> payment is as follows: A contract for the supply to Government institutions of first-grade potatoes at 57.5c per pocket during the period 1 January 1961 to 30 June 1961, was granted to Messrs. Schmidt, le Roux and Company, Johannesburg. The quantity of potatoes to be supplied was estimated at 27,153 pockets. The firm was, however, eventually required to deliver 52,186 pockets, i.e. 25,033 or approximately 92 per cent more than the quantity originally estimated, whereas the firm allowed only for an oversupply of 10 per cent. Due mainly to protracted rains in the Eastern Transvaal Highveld from April 1961 which severely affected the quality and availability of supplies, the price of first-grade potatoes rose steeply and in some months increased by as much as 100 per cent. The firm therefore suffered extensive losses by having to acquire potatoes for supply to the Government at considerably higher prices than the contract price of 57.5c per pocket and consequently submitted representations to the State Tender Board for compensation. The Tender Board investigated the matter thoroughly in consultation with the Potato Board and in view of the exceptional circumstances recommended that relief be granted. On the representations of the Tender Board the Treasury approved of an amount of R5,952 being included in the Additional Estimates as an <i>ex gratia</i> payment to the firm subject to parliamentary approval.</p>

The R 16,000 is made up chiefly by the following factors: Firstly the Registrar and Deputy Registrar of Financial Institutions proceeded on official visits to the United States and New Zealand, the costs of which amounted to R3,500&#x2014;the Registrar in connection with the International Congress of Building Societies and the Deputy Registrar in connection with investigations in New Zealand into third-party insurance. Secondly, three officials have been transferred from the South African Embassy, London, to the Treasury, resulting in unforeseen expenditure of R6,000; thirdly the appointment of the Commission of Inquiry into Stock Exchange matters necessitated the payment of fees to the members attending meetings and transport costs; and, fourthly, no provision was made in the original Estimates for the increased subsistence allowance payable to parliamentary staff with effect from 1 January 1962.</p>

<p>_ In regard to the other matter, the amount is made up as follows: It consists largely of adjustments of the accounts of previous years.

Then there is due to the Transvaal, also in respect of 1961-2, R512,170, and the Auditor&#x2019;s Certificate has also been received. Thirdly, there is an estimated amount due to the Transvaal resulting from the fact that salaries and wages paid to the domestic staffs at provincial hostels and to departmental school bus drivers were inadvertently omitted from the figure on which the subsidy claims from 1958-9 to 1961-2 were calculated. Those are the main additions and they amount to R850,927. Then there is also an increase in the Estimates of the Transvaal as the result of regarding of posts, the creation of additional posts, the filling of posts previously vacant and unforeseen overtime payment, and finally there is the adjustment of salaries of all employees in the Provincial Administration, of which we have to bear a share, with effect from 1 January 1963.

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The first is the case of Romer. The taxpayer, who is a New Zealander by birth, has been ordinarily resident in South Africa for the last 13 years. On the attainment of her 21st birthday in 1923 she inherited 5,000 &#x00A3;1 shares in a New Zealand company. The dividend from this investment amounts to approximately R4,000 per annum, but in Mrs. Romer&#x2019;s hands it has been exempt from tax in pursuance of the provisions of Section 10 (1) (k) (v) (b) of our Income-Tax Act of 1941, as amended. During October 1960 Mrs. Romer donated these shares to her son who is also ordinarily resident in South Africa. The value of these donations amounted to R35,370, on which the tax due and payable is R3,005.50. The transaction is also subject to donations tax in New Zealand where a tax of R8,793.60 has been paid. Mrs. Romer felt&#x2014;and I was inclined to agree with her&#x2014;that morally the New Zealand taxing authorities are entitled to the donations tax in view of the fact that the assets represented by the shares are situated in that country and that the company conducts its business there. She was of the opinion that the fact that the dividends will henceforth accrue to her son, who is domiciled in South Africa and will be subject to South African tax, is a mitigating factor in her application for relief from the payment of a South African donations tax, otherwise she would be paying donations tax there and here, and having regard to the benefit which the fiscus will enjoy for a period of years by way of tax from the donee, I think generally this was a fait case in which we agreed to authorize the remission of the tax plus interest as an act of grace subject to prior parliamentary approval being obtained. The amount of "the tax, as I have said, is R3,005.30: the interest is R488.50, making a total of R3,494.</p>

<p>The next case is Cobra Brassware. That is a question of the non-residents&#x2019; shareholders&#x2019; tax. Section 42 (1) of the Income-Tax Act provides that the non-residents&#x2019; shareholders&#x2019; tax shall be paid in respect of any dividend declared by any company if the shareholder to whom the dividend is payable, is <i>inter alia,</i> a person other than a company not ordinarily resident nor carrying on business in South Africa or a company not registered nor carrying on business in South Africa. The shares in the above-mentioned company were owned by a company registered and carrying on business in Switzerland. On 28 June 1961 the South African company declared a dividend of R442,000, having first obtained permission from the exchange control authorities to remit the dividend to Switzerland. Non-residents&#x2019; shareholders&#x2019; tax on this amount amounted to R33,153.75, and that was duly paid on the above dividend on 25 July 1951. Before the net dividend could be remitted on which the tax had been paid, more stringent exchange control measures were introduced and permission was given to transfer only that portion of the dividend which consisted of profits earned during the preceding year of assessment, namely an amount of R 124,775 less the non-residents&#x2019; shareholders&#x2019; tax amounting to R9,358. In view of the above-mentioned restrictions the South African company, at the request of its shareholders, rescinded the dividend declared on 28 June 1961 to the extent of R317,275. Section 89 of the Income-Tax Act does not permit the Commissioner to make a refund in cases of this nature. Non-residents&#x2019; shareholders&#x2019; tax will, however, again be payable on the sum of R317,275 when it is utilized at some future date for the payment of further dividends. Double taxation will therefore result. The Treasury advised the Department that the Minister was agreeable to this refund, as an act of grace, of the amount of R23.795 being the non-residents&#x2019; shareholders&#x2019; tax on the amount of R317,275 which was not actually declared as a dividend.</p>

<p>The next one is the Pieter Haak Trust; the Willem Haak Trust (Pty.) Ltd. and the Seti Investments (Pty.) Ltd. are very much the same. It is also a case of undistributed profits tax. It was not paid over within the specified period. They paid over all their profits but part of the dividends fell outside the specified period in their particular cases. They carried out the spirit; they paid over all the dividends; there is no undistributed profits tax, but there is only this technical mistake that it was not within the 12 months. They could have withheld the dividend and then paid it over later, but they carried out the spirit of the Act and we are now putting the cases right. All the dividends have been earned within the 12 months.</p>

<p>In the case of the Pieter Haak Trust it is just a question of a special licence for a club dinner for 31 December. The licence was given from 10 p.m. to 12 p.m. on the Sunday. This was cancelled and withdrawn when this was discovered. We are now refunding the R4 paid for this special licence.</p>

<p>We have here the second largest additional estimate. It is a sum of almost R1, 750,000 which the Minister has subdivided into headings H, J, K, and L. We are pleased that this large amount is asked for but will the hon. the Minister please be good enough to tell us how these amounts have been estimated and how they have been disbursed?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>As hon. members will be able to understand, this falls under various heads. There are certain larger amounts connected with certain heads and smaller amounts connected with other heads. In the main the position of this particular Department is that it is very difficult to frame Estimates. In certain circumstances one may overestimate and in others one may underestimate. Let me give hon. members the reasons. Under H, for example, there is a sum of R50,000 for retirement benefits. It is very difficult to estimate the amount required for retirement benefits. It is very difficult to estimate the gratuities. One does not know how many people are going to retire. Then there is a further R60.000 for compensation in respect of injuries or fatal accidents in the course of duty. One does not know how many cases there are going to be. In this case the number of beneficiaries who will have to receive benefits in the future shows a greater increase than was anticipated. Then there are, amongst other things, the temporary allowances and bonuses payable out of the civil pension fund. The anticipated requirements for this financial year were underestimated. Amongst other things I can mention this example: Until last year the position was that people who retired before a certain date all received a fixed amount. We have now switched over to the new arrangement, which met with the approval of all hon. members. A bigger bonus is now being granted to those persons who suffered because they retired earlier. It is difficult to estimate to how many increased bonuses will have to be granted. One never knows precisely how many will be retiring. The greater the number of people who retire, the more the expenditure rises. I want to mention an example under sub-head J. The original Estimate there was R1 4,044,000; the revised Estimate is R1 4,700,000. The reasons for the increase are, <i>inter alia,</i> an increase of R600,000 in the R for R contribution to the Pensions and Government Employees&#x2019; Fund. This increase is necessary as the result of the increases in the salaries of public servants. I want to mention another example in this connection and that is the interest on the arrear contributions of members. When a member falls into arrear with his R for R contribution he is allowed to make his contribution the following year, but the State does not make its R for R contribution until the employee has made his. It is very difficult to know whether the employee will make his contribution next year. If he does make that contribution, we have to be ready to add our R for R contribution. The biggest item under J is the increased provision that has to be made as the result of the increase in the salaries of public servants.</p>

<p>As far as K is concerned I can only say that the number of beneficiaries has not decreased. The Department had reason to believe that the number would decrease, but the number has in fact increased. The number of Indian beneficiaries has also increased to a small extent. The increase in the case of Whites is R80,000 and in the case of Indians R1,000. With regard to the question of old-age pensions, although the number of White old-age pensioners showed a decline at a certain stage, we discovered in October that there had been an increase. Since October the figures have started to rise again. The increase in the case of Indian pensioners is also greater than was anticipated. The increase as from October has been calculated at R1 80,000 in the case of old-age pensioners and in the case of Indians at R20,000. We have had the same phenomenon in connection with disability allowances. The increase in the case of people drawing disability allowances is higher than we anticipated. In the case of Whites it is R290.000 and in the case of Indians R30,000. That is more or less how these items varied.</p>

<p>Then I come to L, &#x201C;Child Care &#x201D;. Child care forms a very important part of the Department&#x2019;s activities. Under &#x201C;Child Care&#x201D; there is a deficit of R320,000. Amongst other things, the reasons are as follows: In the first place there are the non-State places of safety for the temporary detention of children. When a child is picked up in the streets he is taken to a temporary institution, a non-State institution. The expenditure under this item is constantly increasing because of the larger number of children who are taken to these institutions. From those institutions they are sent to children&#x2019;s homes. It goes without saying that there is an increase in the expenses in connection with children&#x2019;s homes when there is an increase in the number of children who are temporarily detained. Increased provision had to be made therefore in the case of these children&#x2019;s homes.</p>

<p>The next item is maintenance allowances to children who are cared for by their parents, guardians or attendants. We are getting more and more cases where children have to be cared for by their parents, guardians and attendants. We do not know, therefore, how many applications we are going to get. A considerable amount is therefore required under this item. Then there is the question <span class="col_1873-1874" refersTo="page_0951"/>of family allowances. There has also been an increase in the number of beneficiaries under the family allowance scheme. These are more or less the main items under sub-head L; these in the main are the general increases which have taken place. It is like Shelley&#x2019;s cloud; the position constantly changes and one cannot budget with any degree of accuracy. There is the possibility that one may underestimate. In the case of certain items, however, one may overestimate. There is, however, always a tendency for the amount to increase, however, and we are making provision for all unforeseen circumstances which may arise during the year.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services is in the Other Place. I have the reply here. If the hon. member wants to know what it is, I can only say to him that the Afrikaans is perfectly clear. This is an International Office for Epizootics. It was originally established in 1923. At that time we were not a member, although we became a member later on. Our membership lapsed, however, and we are now becoming a member again. This is the annual subscription that we have to pay as a member. The annual subscription is calculated on a fixed scale. It is very important that we should be a member. We have always taken a lead in combating stock diseases and it is only right that we should play our role here too.</p>

<p>This increase is for salaries and for an expansion of the establishment&#x2014;for new appointments, for promotions, salary adjustments and improved salaries. All these factors contributed to this increase. The amount is approximately R53.000. Then there is an increase in the holiday savings bonuses as the result of promotions, new appointments and salary adjustments. Then provision is being made for an additional assistant secretary as the result of the establishment of new soil conservation committees. Altogether this amounts to R58.004. There have also been reductions under this head and that is why we are asking for R51,000.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood) referred to Item G, &#x201C;General Maintenance Expenses.&#x201D; The original Estimate for general maintenance expenses was R701,400 and the revised Estimate is R727.400. We are now asking for an additional sum of R26,000. The increases are as follows: This increased provision of R33.390 is due mainly to the late delivery of laboratory equipment ordered from overseas. There is also an increase of R450 in respect of coal for the dairy research buildings in the Free State region, which were formerly provided by the Department of Public Works. In the case of the Karoo region there is an increase of R 1,000 which is covered by a similar amount that was received from the Mohair Advisory Board for the equipment of a laboratory, and R500 is required to cover the cost of obtaining data in a survey of the mohair industry&#x2014;a total of R 1,500. Then there is also an increase as a result of the late delivery of equipment and machinery on the farm&#x2014;not in the laboratory. This equipment was ordered in 1961-2 but it was only received and paid for in the present financial year, the amount being R4.320.</p>

<p>In the case of the Agricultural Faculty at the University of the Orange Free State there is an increase in respect of chemicals, glassware and equipment that was ordered in the 1961-2 financial year and only received and paid for in 1962-3. The delivery of a great quantity of similar equipment was delayed when the <i>Kirsten Skou</i> sank. A corresponding saving of R17,000 was shown in the previous year in respect of this increase. In connection with Groot Constantia, wood was imported for the manufacture of casks for the purpose of maturing wine. This wood also arrived late, and the amount of R1,200 that was ploughed back in the previous financial year will be used in the financial year 1962-3. The total amount is R57,860. Then there are reductions amounting to R31,860 and the net increase which is being asked for under subhead G is R.26,000.</p>

<p>This expenditure of R1,000 is in terms of the provisions of the Diamond Trade Ordinance of 1903. In terms of Section 20 of this Ordinance a duty rests on the Receiver of Revenue when issuing a licence to a trader in diamonds to see to it that he is a suitable person and that he gives a guarantee for R1.000. That guarantee was given in the case of a certain Mr. Vorster. He was found guilty in the magistrate&#x2019;s court of having contravened the law in that he did not keep a proper register of the diamonds sold by him. He was called upon to forfeit the R1,000. Subsequently he applied for a refund of the R1,000 on the ground that the contravention was only a technical contravention. A sentence of ten days&#x2019; imprisonment or a fine of RIO was imposed. The magistrate who tried the case found that it was purely a technical contravention and that there was no intention to trade in diamonds illicitly. The S.A. Police as well as the Department supported this application, and that is why we are asking here that provision be made for the refund of this R1.000.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Drakensberg, I want to say that it is estimated that as a result of the revised salaries payable from 1 January 1963, a large amount will have to be made available, practically all of the R825,000, but there is also an additional amount due to an increase in overtime payments necessitated by the release of officers for military training, and also resulting from certain structural changes in certain ranks of the Post Office, especially clerks who qualify for long service increments.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) asked whether Coloureds are included under this increase. This amount covers all employees, whether Coloured or European.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) referred to sub-head P, the contribution of R 190,000 to the British Post Office far the maintenance of the marine cable system. The hon. member will see that no amount was voted in the original Estimates, but the amount payable every year to the United Kingdom as the result of an agreement between South Africa and the United Kingdom for the maintenance of the marine cable system was R190,000 per annum. This cable system has always been regarded by us as being of strategic value in times when there are atmospheric disturbances which make it impossible to make use of the radio services between South Africa and Europe. As the result of the necessity for using this cable an agreement was entered into between Britain and South Africa, in terms of which we paid an annual amount of R190,000. But recently South Africa left the Commonwealth and the Post Office did not know what the amount would be in future. That is why originally when these Estimates were framed no amount was mentioned, but in die meantime the agreement with England has again come into operation and the original amount of R190,000 now has to be voted.</p>

<p>Before a postmaster can pay anything to his staff, he receives a Letter of authority which clearly states what he should pay each official. Then instructions are issued to postmasters from time to&gt; time to make any alterations which become necessary. There are continually adaptations in salary as the result of marriages or promotions or as the result of increased salaries. This often makes it very difficult for the postmasters in the various post offices, and mistakes are sometimes made. But unfortunately in this case a mistake was made, and when it was discovered an excess amount of R2,605 had been paid to 14 officials. Unfortunately all of them are people drawing small salaries. The mistake was not due to the officials themselves, but to the Department. These poor people spent the money they received every month, and now the Post Office regards it as unreasonable to demand repayment from people who can hardly afford to repay it, when in fact it was due to a mistake on the part of the Post Office itself.</p>

<from><span class="col_1879-1880" refersTo="page_0954"/>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>There are three items that I would like a little further information on. The first is the enormous increase in what is already an enormous Vote, namely, the additional amount of R1,200,000 for tuberculosis. Furthermore under N, &#x201C;Other Infectious Diseases&#x201D;, I should like to know what was the outbreak which caused the expenditure of the extra R60,000. Lastly, under R, there are two items in respect of tuberculosis and venereal diseases clinics under the Divisional Council of the Cape, and apparently neither of which had been estimated for. Was it presumed by the Department that there would be no more venereal disease and has there now been a recrudescence in that respect?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member will appreciate that it is very difficult to estimate exactly what the expenditure by local authorities is going to be. As the hon. member will remember, the Central Government pays back a refund of seven-eighths of the expenditure incurred by local authorities. You cannot say in advance what their expenditure is going to be, and as a result of that exact budgeting becomes very difficult. The increase is due to the following factors: Firstly, an increase in the number of tuberculosis sufferers who require treatment; it is due also to the increase in the number of beds that have become available in the various hospitals; it is also due to the increase in the daily fees of the hospitals and the SANTA institutions; and also due to a larger number of patients receiving out-patient treatment; and finally, to the more expensive drugs which are being used in increasing quantities, and in addition it is due to the expansion of the B.C.G. vaccination scheme. The hon. member will be interested if I mention this: If he will go back to the Budgets of previous years, he will find that under this head there has always been an additional expenditure amounting to R1,000,000 to R1, 500,000, because obviously the Department wants to budget conservatively, and it means that it generally underbudgets. In 1957, an amount of almost R 1,000,000 was under-estimated and this year it is in the neighbourhood of R1, 200,000.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>I want to refer to the first item B, &#x201C;Dairy Products&#x201D;, &#x201C;Loss on the Importation of Cheese &#x201D;. This is a new item and I would like to ask the Minister concerned&#x2014; he apparently is also not here at the moment &#x2014;why it was necessary to import cheese into South Africa, when it was imported, and if during about the same period we exported any cheese from South Africa to other countries. I would also like to ask the hon. the Minister the price at which the cheese was imported and why it was necessary to incur a loss of some R42,000 on the importation of cheese. At what price was it imported and at what price was it sold to the consumer in this country? I know we have had the answer given to previous questions, that the importation was due to the fact that certain parts of the country were suffering from drought affecting dairy production as a whole, but there has also been a suggestion that we had heavily exported cheese and never kept a sufficient reserve, and therefore allowed ourselves to be landed in this position that we had to import. I would also like to ask the hon. Minister what quantities of cheese were imported, incurring the loss of R42.000.</p>

<p>Sir, this importation is a reflection of the chaotic conditions existing in the control of the dairy industry as a whole, a chaos which is affecting not only the producer but also the consumer in this country. It has been most marked over the last month or so that it was practically impossible to get any adequate supply of a decent quality of cheese in South Africa. Much of the cheese that is offered to our local consumers to-day is just about sufficiently above the grading margin to save it being used for the manufacture of soap; you certainly cannot call it cheese. One would like to know what this heavily subsidized dairy control board is doing to permit this state of affairs. I am sure the manufacturers of cheese themselves are not very happy about the position. We have in this country manufacturers who can produce first quality cheese that compares favourably with anything produced in the world, but they are not permitted to do so, and then we are calmly asked in an estimate such as this, by an absentee Minister, to approve of the expenditure of another R42.000 to cover losses which his Department has suffered on the importation of cheese. It is no excuse to say to me that the hon. the Minister is busy in Another Place. I understand that this particular Minister is not busy there in any case. He was well aware that this particular matter was to come before the House to-day. The whole Vote amounts to R2,750,000 additional expenditure. Surely we can expect the Minister responsible for that expenditure to be here and give adequate explanations for the increases.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I can only give the hon. member the information I have before me: In comparison with 1961 there was from the second quarter of 1962 a decrease in the production of cheese; in the <span class="col_1881-1882" refersTo="page_0955"/>second quarter of 1962 it was 902,000 lbs., in the third quarter it was 2,295,000 lbs., and in the fourth quarter it was 1,946,000 lbs. The Dairy Board launched an intensive advertising campaign from 1961 which resulted in the consumption, particularly during 1962, increasing sharply. As compared with 1961, the increased consumption in 1962 was as follows: First quarter, 570,000 lbs.; second quarter, 671,000 lbs.; third quarter, 518,000 lbs.; and fourth quarter, 1,137,000 lbs. Although sufficient supplies were available to satisfy current demand, the Board considered it desirable to import 505 tons of cheese, which is only approximately two weeks&#x2019; consumption, so that there would be enough time sufficiently to mature the local cheese in order to provide cheese of the desired quality, for which a market had already been built up to the consumers. The imported cheese was sold at the same price as local cheese, and if we calculate the cost of importing the 505 tons, it works out to a loss of approximately 4.2c per lb., but customs duties had to be paid on the imported cheese which in fact made up for the loss of the 4.2c per lb.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister of Finance who has to deputize for his absent colleague, the hon. Minister of Agriculture, has endeavoured to reply to certain of the points raised in regard to the loss of the importation of cheese, but the hon. Minister still has not made it clear why it was necessary to sell this cheese at a loss. Surely any businessman in South Africa who imports cheese would not sell it at a loss. What type of cheese was imported? We are being asked on this Vote to approve of a total additional expenditure of R2,750,000 by a Minister who is not in the House to justify the reasons for this extra expenditure.

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>In reply to the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay) I can say that the cheese was sold at a loss because we did not want to penalize the consumer here, and we sold the imported cheese at the same price as the local cheese. But on the other hand we gained the import duty on the imported cheese.</p>

<p>*In reply to the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay), I may just say that in recent years there has been an annual increase in the consumption of fertilizer. The Government pays a subsidy of R2 per ton of high-grade fertilizer, and the additional amount to be made available becomes necessary as the result of this increased consumption. Guano has just been included here because it appears together with it every year, but I cannot say how much falls under the one or how much under the other item.</p>

<p>In regard to Item E, the maize, the position is that the Government last year undertook to contribute 5 cents per bag towards the transport of export maize and primary maize products exported during the 1961-2 season. This amount was paid into the Stabilization Fund of the Mealie Board to compensate for the increased expenditure on bags and other costs flowing from certain protective measures which affect the production cost of mealies and thereby have a deleterious effect on the competitive position in the export market. In the beginning of the maize season, 1 May 1962, certain claims for subsidies were still outstanding and an estimate was made of it. It later appeared that the outstanding amount had been estimated at too low a figure. I may just say that there was an increase in the Board&#x2019;s sales for local consumption, but this amount is in regard to export maize where 5 cents per bag was granted.</p>

<speech by="#gay">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GAY</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite obvious that the hon. the Minister of Finance has not been properly briefed by his colleague. Is it not a fact that the cheese when it arrived in this country was found to be so inferior in quality that the South African consuming public was not prepared to buy it? Is it not a fact that a quantity<span class="col_1883-1884" refersTo="page_0956"/> was put on sale in Durban and even after the price was reduced, the consumers still were not prepared to take the cheese? That give rise to the question as to what arrangements were made for inspection, and what general supervision there was in regard to this purchase. These are points that want clearing up. The general information in the country is that the cheese was so inferior in quality that it was completely unsuitable for our local consuming public who expect a high quality cheese, which we can produce in this country if the Dairy Control Board will allow the producer to produce that quality.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Finance with the best will in the world cannot be expected to know the details of another Minister&#x2019;s department, and I should like to know where is the responsible Minister? Has he made his apologies to the Minister of Finance? We have not had a word from the other side of the House as to why the hon. the Minister is not here. Two years ago we had quite a show-down over this business and last year the hon. the Minister had mobilized his platoon and they were all here, and we got through the Votes quite quickly. The hon. the Minister has done his best this year, I know, but there are one or two backsliders. Surely both the Ministers of Agriculture cannot be in the Senate together; they are not Siamese twins.

<p>As far as the <i>ex gratia</i> sums are concerned, the first one concerns the supply of isoniazed powder to the Central Medical and Veterinary Stores, Pretoria, in terms of Contract No. FT.7647 dated 27 February 1961. The tender of International Rotterdam S.A. (Pty.) Ltd. of Johannesburg was accepted for the supply of 2,000 kilos of this powder. This firm ordered the powder from its principals in Communist China, who later declared that their firm offer had expired and that the powder had been sold elsewhere. The State Buyer, however, maintained that the order was despatched in good time, and that if the powder was not supplied at the tender price of R10,262.50 it would be ordered from another source for the firm&#x2019;s account. The powder was subsequently ordered from Messrs. Lennon Ltd. at the contract price of R 12,390 and Messrs. Internatio Rotterdam S.A. (Pty.) Ltd. were informed that they would be held liable for the increase of R2,127.50. The latter firm, however, maintained that they acted and handled the transaction in good faith, and that they could not possibly be held responsible for their supplier&#x2019;s inability to execute the order. The State Buyer recommended that the relative firm should not be held liable for the additional expenditure involved.</p>

<p>The second item is this: From the beginning of 1957 Field Cornet C. F. van der Merwe attended the University of Stellenbosch for that year, and thereafter the Military Academy for two years to acquire a B.Mil. degree at State expense. He signed a memorandum of agreement on 3 January 1957 whereby he undertook to serve as a member of the Permanent Force for a period of seven years after the successful completion of his course, and that if he resigned his appointment within that period he would refund portion of the costs incurred by the Department on his behalf. He successfully completed his studies during 1959. After serving two years he resigned his appointment in the Permanent Force with effect from 1 March 1962. As the Department felt that it was unrealistic to expect candidate officers to refund the whole or part of the actual cost of the three-year course, it was decided to fix the costs at R200 per annum, with effect from the 1960 academic year. In order to amend the then existing memorandum of agreement, all second-and third-year students were requested to sign an addendum to the memorandum of agreement. As Field Cornet van der Merwe completed his course during 1959, he did not sign the addendum. On the State Attorney&#x2019;s recommendation, the Department only claimed the amount which he would have had to refund had he signed the addendum to the memorandum of agreement, i.e. R360.19. The Treasury agreed, provided the balance of the costs amounting to R3,600 incurred on his behalf be accounted for as an <i>ex gratia</i> decrease of the amount outstanding. I want to mention further that it costs about R19D per annum to keep a student at Stellenbosch University.</p>

<p>It is a good university. It costs us much more to keep a student at the Academy at Saldanha and we are now asking the young men to refund a sum which is a little more than it costs us to keep a student at Stellenbosch.</p>

<p>The explanation of the third item is this: A bomb explosion occurred on the Grahams-town Commonage on 6 November 1960 and the son of Mr. du Toit (Desmond) was seriously injured. It transpired that Desmond was target shooting with an airgun on the commonage and hit a live bomb which exploded. The State Attorney maintained that as the ground was accessible to the public, and due to its failure to remove live bombs after practice, the Department was liable to the full extent of the claim, but as the claimant failed to render his claim within die specified period it became prescribed. The State Attorney, however, recommended that as the boy was seriously maimed an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R6.000 was justified.</p>

<p>The explanation of the fourth item is this. Lt.-Commander G. F. Gower who was a passenger in a vehicle was injured in an accident on the Maltmesbury-Hopefield road. In spite of an amount of R528 paid to him by the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Commissioner, he instituted a claim of R8,000 against the Department. The Deputy State Attorney, after negotiating with Lt.-Commander Gower, recommended R4.000 in full settlement of the claim for pain and suffering, loss of amenities and possible loss of future income (over and above the amount of R528 already paid to him in terms of the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act). Lt.-Commander Gower, however, was under the impression that the Department would waive its rights in so far as the six months&#x2019; period of prescription was concerned. It, however, transpires that the prescription period is two years. A period of two years has elapsed since the accident occurred and the claim appears to have become prescribed. In view of the above, an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of R4.000 was approved.</p>

<p>The position is that the standard stock capital controlled by the Department of Police stood at R2,100,000 at 31 July 1962. Due to the switchover to the new type of uniform and the increased establishment of the Police Force, which necessitated larger reserve stocks of material and equipment, it became necessary to supplement the capital of the standard stock account. State President&#x2019;s special warrants Nos. 5 and 15 were issued for the purpose to cover the parliamentary approval that is now sought. Most of these Departments have their standard stock accounts.

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>_ Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>We are asked to vote the little sum of R604, but actually the Committee is being asked to approve an expenditure of something like R3,500,000. There seems to have been a severe outbreak of new police stations and prisons during the recess, and we are being asked to approve in principle of the establishment of a large number of these new places by means of token payments of <span class="col_1891-1892" refersTo="page_0960"/>R50 or even less. I think this Committee should be given a good deal of information about these new developments before we can be asked to agree to them. One wonders why it is necessary, right at the end of the financial year, to introduce a number of completely new items, about a dozen of them, within a month of the end of the financial year. I can understand it once the principle has been approved and progress has been made and more money is needed, and one can understand where a scheme has been approved of and larger ideas have prevailed, but where it comes to completely new schemes it becomes very difficult for this Committee at short notice to approve of such large sums. For instance, we have here at Paarl (Switzerland) a new prison. The estimated cost of it was R700,000, of which we are asked to vote R50 now. I think the House is surely entitled to a full account of just exactly what is -envisaged there. I think the hon. the Minister of Finance will agree with me. I do not suppose he has ever known any Public Works undertaking of that nature which has been carried out at less than 50 per cent above the original estimate. So when we are talking about R3,500,000, we are probably talking about something nearer R5,000,000 in the long run. Then, of course, we have, <i>inter alia,</i> the proposal to acquire two new residences in Pretoria for Ministers. There is one which is estimated to cost R63.000 and there is one which -costs R35.000. In other words, we are being asked to spend R (00/100 for two ministerial houses in Pretoria and I think we are entitled to ask for some more information in that regard. Perhaps I can assist the hon. the Minister by asking him one or two specific questions. I would like to know where these houses are; I would like to know from whom they either have been purchased or for whom it is proposed to purchase them; I would like to know what accommodation they have and the valuation of the properties, and we would like to know for whom they are intended. Depending on the information that the Minister furnishes we can decide whether or not to pursue this subject further.</p>

<p>The MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS; As far as these prisons are concerned, I can only tell the hon. member what we have done, but I cannot justify them; that is for the Minister of Justice to do. In regard to the Paarl prison, the farm known as Switzerland near Paarl was recently purchased, and it is proposed to develop the property into a prison for 1,500 White males. On completion of the proposed building it will be possible to transfer prisoners from other centres in the Republic, thus alleviating the condition obtaining at other institutions.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member raised the question of two ministerial houses that were purchased in Pretoria. As the hon. member no doubt knows, there has been a shortage of houses there and we have had to hire houses for Ministers in Pretoria. We advertised for houses last year and two suitable houses were acquired. The one cost R62,9Q0. That was bought from Mr. Kirkness&#x2014;and that is a residence which will be occupied by the Minister of Finance. I do not know from whom the other residence was purchased. It was purchased for the Minister of Defence. They arc both situated in the Brooklyn area of Pretoria. They are both suitable houses. They are both very well built &#x2026;</p>

I must say that <span class="col_1893-1894" refersTo="page_0961"/>I do not think the Minister said anything to justify the expenditure of R63.000 on a ministerial house, however worthy the occupant himself may be. The hon. the Minister simply gave us this information very briefly, but I do not think that there is any justification for expenditure of nearly R63,000 on a ministerial house at a time especially since there have been undoubted signs in recent years of very reckless expenditure by this Government on matters of this nature.

<p>I would like to support the hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) in his amendment. I think that few people can deny that R63,000 is an extravagant amount to spend on a ministerial house, particularly when we take into account the money that has already been spent on these ministerial homes. Only last year when a question was put to the Minister of Public Works, information was provided which showed that already there were properties being occupied by Ministers with a total municipal valuation of R1,056,690, and that was last year&#x2019;s figure. We are now being asked to vote two additional amounts totalling R98,500, and it would be interesting to hear from the Minister what the municipal valuations of these properties are. The hon. member for Constantia asked this question but unfortunately the Minister has not yet told us what the municipal valuations of these properties are. Then if the Minister has the information available I would also like to inquire what rent is being paid and will be paid by these two Ministers occupying these houses. With this tremendous capital outlay, if the Minister concerned were to pay only 5 per cent he would have to pay a rent of something like R3,150 per annum. I should be glad if the Minister would try to justify the expenditure of these large amounts on this Vote.</p>

I invited hon. members&#x2014;and some made use of the invitation&#x2014;to visit Leeukop in the recess, and they will know how successfully Bantu are rehabilitated there. It was in order to establish a similar rehabilitation centre that this farm was bought. Hon. members will also know that to an increasing extent, and quite correctly also, we are moving away from closed institutions in urban areas to open institutions in the rural areas. We have confidence that as the result of purchasing this institution we will be able to do proper and sufficient rehabilitation work in respect of Whites.

The hon. the Minister said that the municipal valuation of the one house for which R63,000 was paid is R59,000. In other words, R4,000 more than the municipal valuation was paid. But in the second case the position was just the opposite. There the municipal valuation was R39,000 and R35,000 was paid for the house. It seems to me that something went wrong here.

<speech by="#minister_of_bantu_education">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF BANTU EDUCATION</person>:</from>

<p>The reason for the particular hurry in regard to this matter is that for several years there was talk about the State taking over the University College of Fort Hare. In all those years the previous Council of the University College did not extend the buildings, which was really essential. There was a tremendous backlog in building requirements at Fort Hare. After the transfer the question was whether Fort Hare would continue to remain on the present terrain. During the period in which there was uncertainty about that, nothing was done in regard to the building needs at Fort Hare either. After negotiations between the Government and the Church societies owning the ground adjoining Fort Hare, and which cuts Fort Hare off from the Bantu area, those Church societies agreed to transfer the ground to the Native Trust or to Bantu churches so that the whole area, including that on which Fort Hare stood, should be incorporated into the Bantu area. It was then decided that Fort Hare should remain on the terrain where it is at present. After the decision was taken we immediately tackled the tremendous need which existed in regard to buildings. The greatest need was in regard to the administrative building which was much too small. They actually had to make use of lecture rooms in order to do their administrative work. In order to get the administrative staff out of the lecture rooms it was necessary to tackle this work immediately.</p>

<p>This amount refers to the teachers training school and the secondary school near Eshowe. This complex of buildings belonged to a missionary society, I think the Lutheran Mission Society. This society some time ago entered into negotiations with the Department and asked it to buy the buildings from them. They wanted to use the money to build a training centre for evangelists of their Church elsewhere, because we did not want to allow them to give that training at the State institution which we were leasing from them. That could have caused confusion. They asked us to buy the buildings from them instead of continuing to lease them as in the past. The valuation they put on the buildings, and with which the valuators of my Department and of the <span class="col_1899-1900" refersTo="page_0964"/>P.W.D. agreed, was R1 13,000. The Church Society, however, said that if this transaction could be completed before the end of March they would be prepared to accept an amount of R82BOO in full settlement for the buildings. Under those circumstances it was decided to obtain the necessary approval to put through this purchase this year, because this Church was prepared to abandon a large part of the actual value of the buildings in order to receive the cash earlier.</p>

<p>On Clause 3,</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I do not wish to move an amendment, but I want to focus attention on the responsibility of the maintenance officer, and to draw attention to the fact that this is a new sphere, I think, for a member of the Civil Service previously connected only with prosecution. This will have to be a very versatile person; somebody in the nature of the family lawyer; somebody who will be coping with the maintenance problem of two persons who are at arms length. I want to emphasize the need for a wise selection when it comes to this particular official. You will see from the clause, Sir, that a very great responsibility is placed upon this official for this further reason: Where a complaint is made on oath he is obliged to investigate the complaint and he may institute an inquiry. It is required that he acts speedily to ensure that maintenance is forthcoming at the earliest moment. At the same time he will need to exercise caution in not launching inquiries where they are not required. It is very easy as the law stands for a person who feels in any way aggrieved to institute an inquiry. I think he will have to use his discretion very carefully. As I said at the second: reading there will have to be adequate staff because once it becomes known that this procedure is available, I think there will be a considerable demand for its facilities, which of course points to the value of the institution. 1 hope therefore that the hon. the Minister will look around for appropriate people to undertake this task and it may well be that he will have to appoint additional people to staff his Department to cope with this work. I think very possibly persons experienced in this work, perhaps people from the Side-Bar will be valuable as additional recruits for this work.</p>

<p>It is indeed as the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) has said. He knows that the prosecutors are the people who mainly do this work. For the rest they are people with years of experience. We shall naturally gain experience as we go along but it is obvious that we shall not make work unnecessarily for ourselves and that we shall not start court cases unnecessarily in this connection.

<p>May I ask the hon. the Minister a question? I just want to say that I think there is something which the hon. the Minister should investigate in connection with the appointment of justices of the peace. As I understand the position it is divided into wards and each ward has six justices of the peace. We have the position that justices of the peace move away as far as 20 miles and even further but they remain appointed as justices of the peace. That means that their services are lost to the public and that there is not a sufficient number of justices of the peace. I think the position ought to be that justices of the peace should act as such where they are living. In my constituency for example, we have the position that there is a shortage of justices of the peace on account of the fact that some of them have moved.</p>

<p>It is a very simple matter. In terms of Clause 2 a justice of the peace remains in office as long as it pleases the Minister. He is also appointed for a specific ward. If he leaves that ward without resigning of his own accord because of his departure, and the Department is notified that he is no longer resident there, it is customary to withdraw his appointment and for somebody else to be recommended in his stead. If the hon. member experiences difficulty in this regard he need only bring it to the notice of the Department that the justices of the peace concerned are no longer resident in that ward and the necessary will be done.</p>

<p>At first glance, the hon. Minister's amendment meets the situation I had in mind. I had particularly in mind the individual who is involved in a motor accident and who according to the law has to be in possession of a third party policy. Therefore, although legally he is responsible, he has a contractual arrangement with some insurance company who are really the people who have to pay whatever damage is finally assessed. One wants to make sure that in a case like that, the person aggrieved will not have to wait, but the hbn. the Minister&#x2019;s amendment appears to meet my difficulty.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>There are two other matters in regard to this clause which I want to raise with the hon. the Minister. The first is in respect of sub-section (2) (b) dealing with the payment of rent. In terms of the Bill as it is now before us, rent which falls due as the result of occupation of a dwelling house, room or tenement whilst the ballottee is in training, is not excluded from legal action. That is to say, the landlord can take action for the recovery of rent which accrues to the landlord while the ballottee is in training. The position therefore is that if a ballottee for instance is the tenant of a flat which he has leased under a long-term agreement, a year or two years, or whatever it may be, and if he happens to be a married man, and his wife continues to occupy such flat, then as the clause now stands, his wife could be ejected from that flat, whilst he was undergoing his training. On reflection it seems to me wrong that we should create a situation where because a man is called up to do duty to his country, where he has no option, and where he is only paid a nominal amount, that we should put his family in the position where the wife might be thrown out on the pavement, and he would not be able to do anything about it. There is of course provision in sub-section (5) which gives certain rights to any person who feels that a trainee is taking advantage of this Act. In referring to this sub-section I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this right which a landlord would have if he felt that this moratorium Act was merely being used as an excuse to evade payment. I hope the hon. the Minister will give us his reaction to this point, and perhaps he can remove our difficulties.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_defence">

<from><span class="col_1907-1908" refersTo="page_0968"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF DEFENCE</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate the objection raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point) but I just want to point ont to him that I regard it as an ordinary necessity of life and if we wish to afford moratorium protection in that respect as well, we would be faced with the danger that people might be deprived of an ordinary necessity of life. Just as it is provided that nobody may enjoy moratorium protection in respect of ordinary necessities of life which he purchases after his training has started, we have to protect this ordinary necessity of life of people. I may just say that that has been the position in all the moratorium laws which we have had so far, since 1914. All of them treated this as an ordinary necessity of life. If we were to meet the hon. member&#x2019;s objection I envisage that these people will not be able to rent a house. We should also remember that a married man who occupies such a house receives an allowance as a married man. He does not draw the maximum nominal amount which an unmarried man receives, but he gets an allowance.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister has pointed out that this provision has formed part of the old laws ever since 1914, but the position was different then. Firstly the allowance paid to wives and children was higher during the war period; special provision was made to ensure that the family of a man did not suffer. There were also emergency measures which laid down that people could not be ejected. There were other provisions which protected persons as far as their housing accommodation was concerned.</p>

<p>No, that is not the position here. There are certain provisions but the protection which existed previously is no longer there, and where we are dealing with a new measure I feel we should not overlook this problem. Not many people will come under this. Not many of the youths will be married at the age of 17 and 18; there will be a mere handful, but the boys who will experience this difficulty will be those who marry at a young age and I feel that we should at least afford that protection to the wife of a person who is undergoing training.</p>

<p>We are dealing here with a serious matter, and 1 appreciate the hem. the Minister&#x2019;s difficulty namely that he is afraid to deprive a person from an ordinary necessity of life. But in the first place people are protected against being ejected from a house or a flat at random; unless they break their contract. But if necessary we should afford additional protection to the wife of a person who is undergoing training so that if he has a contract in respect of a flat or a house that contract would be binding for the nine months&#x2019; period of his training. I think the Bill can be improved in this respect.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to discuss Section 2 (2) (e) with the hon. the Minister and his proposed amendment. If one looks at (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e), one sees a reason for it. Here provision is made that the moratorium should not apply to certain contracts which the trainee enters into because these are necessary amenities that he must acquire during his period of training. For instance he may want to rent a dwelling in the same town in which he is doing his training so that he can accommodate his family, and there is no advantage of the moratorium. Now under (e) certain exemptions are made in respect of hire-purchase contracts, but it seems to me that the effect of that will be that the supplier of goods will not extend the advantages of hire purchase to a trainee if he knows that he is in training, because the suspension of civil remedies under the moratorium will apply. That means that unless the trainee is able to purchase furniture for cash, it will be impossible for him to obtain the advantages that the hire-purchase system normally offers. I would like the hon. Minister to explain that, because it seems to be in conflict with the purpose of the other exemptions. The purpose of the other exemptions is to enable the trainee to acquire these particular facilities, to contract for them and even to get credit if necessary, and the creditor is protected in that he can take the necessary action. I am thinking now of rent and other necessaries of life.</p>

<p><span class="col_1909-1910" refersTo="page_0969"/>My point is that furniture under hire purchase is as important to the trainee as the necessities of life which he purchases. Every creditor is then in a position to know that in giving credit under the hire-purchase facilities, he can still take action and is not held up for the period of training plus three months. Then he will be prepared to enter into a hire-purchase contract; but the way the clause now reads, the creditor will not extend those facilities and the trainee will not be able to acquire anything on hire purchase, even be it a moped or a bicycle or any other form of transport which young people usually acquire on hire purchase.</p>

<p>I would like to ask the hon. the Minister to give very serious attention to the point raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) with regard to the protection to be afforded to wives of people called up under that particular sub-section. The hon. the Minister did mention that this particular protection advocated by the hon. member was not afforded in previous moratorium Acts, but I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) has made it quite clear that there is a complete difference between the conditions appertaining to wives under the old wartime measures, when wives and dependants drew very considerable allowances so as to enable them to meet their liabilities, and what exists here where they have to depend entirely on the amount drawn by the trainee. I believe it will make a better Bill of it if some such protection is provided, and if the hon. the Minister can see his way clear to accept it, I think he would be on the right track.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In this instance I really want to oppose the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) because I think he is rendering a disservice to people by suggesting such an amendment. If we change it the way he wants us to it will mean that it will be possible to give notice to anyone of those people in which case he will have to vacate the property concerned. People will no longer be prepared to grant facilities to them and it will be impossible for them to hire premises because the lessor will be unwilling to let the premises because he knows that they enjoy moratorium protection. In that way a disservice will be done to those people. As the clauses stand at the moment it is actually affording them protection; it is not as though it does not protect them as the hon. member would make us believe. The fact of the matter is that if you give moratorium protection creditors will simply not let premises to such people. While I am on my feet I should like to raise another point. I do not know whether this is a mistake on the part of the legal draughtsmen and whether it is a mistake on the part of the translators but I think the time has arrived that we drafted our Bills in proper Afrikaans. I object to the word &#x201C;order &#x201D;. In Afrikaans the court issues a &#x201C;bevel&#x201D; and not an &#x201C;order&#x201D;. You may perhaps still find a sergeant-major issuing an &#x201C;order&#x201D; on the training field when the soldiers &#x201C;drill&#x201D; but a court issues a &#x201C;bevel &#x201D;.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with the hon. member for Durban (Point) for the same reasons as those mentioned by the hon. member for Heilbron and also on account of what I have already said. The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) has for example pointed out that if we accorded moratorium protection young people would find it impossible to buy furniture. But the hon. member for Durban (Point) also wants the moratorium to apply to housing. In that case those poor people will not be able to find accommodation either. I cannot reconcile those two attitudes. I regard housing as a necessity of life. If hon. members were to read the proviso at the end of (f) they will find that it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Provided that any action or proceeding so instituted may be stayed by the court on such terms as it may deem proper.</block>

<p>I really cannot heed the plea of the hon. member because I am convinced that it will not be in the interests of those young people if I did heed it. Housing is a greater necessity of life than furniture and if it is already dangerous in the case of furniture, how much more dangerous will it not be in the case of housing as such.</p>

<p>I want to say to the hon. member for Florida that I already explained in my second-reading speech that I realized that the benefits of the hire-purchase system would probably not be extended to them, but that I regarded that as a good thing and I still regard it as good that not too many such contracts are entered into.</p>

I feel that this is unfair in the case of contracts or agreements which are already in existence. Let me take a bond on a property where a person has an agreement to pay a fixed rate of interest (whatever that rate of interest may be). He borrows against the bond a certain capital sum on which he is going to have to pay the agreed rate of interest even if the payment thereof is delayed during the period of his service&#x2014;but he is going to pay in full on the capital which he has borrowed at the stipulated rate of interest. Now in terms of this clause, that person is going to have to pay not only the interest which has been agreed upon by contract, but in addition he is going to pay 6 per cent.</p>

<p>Yes, as the clause stands now. &#x201C;Whenever a person is debarred under this Act from obtaining payment of any money due to him &#x2026; the interest of 6 per cent is due to that person who has advanced the money, and he shall be entitled to 6 per cent on all such money due to him. Now if the interest due is interest already on a capital loan, if it is interest on anything at all, he has an agreement to pay a fixed rate of interest on that.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>He has borrowed a fixed amount of money and he is paying a fixed sum of interest. In order to make my point clear, I want to move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 65, after &#x201C;rate&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;stipulated in any existing contract or if no interest is provided for at the rate &#x201D;.</block>

<p>That will make the clause read that a person will pay money at the rate of interest already stipulated in a contract, or failing such specific agreement already existing, he shall then pay 6 per cent. If there is an agreement with any creditor that interest will be charged on overdue accounts at 10 per cent or 3 per cent, this Bill as printed provides that the person shall not pay the stipulated rate of interest, but shall pay 6 per cent. Let us take it from either point of view. If the person has incurred a debt and under his agreement or contract, he has to pay 3 per cent on any overdue amount, why should we now specify that he should be penalized over and above what has been decided in an agreement between him and the person to whom he owes the money? Let us look at it the other way. If a person has an agreement with any person and part of that agreement is that arrears shall bear 10 per cent interest, we are now saying no, that agreement must go by the board and because a man is unable to pay as the result of his military service, although he has agreed by contract to pay 10 per cent, he will now pay only 6 per cent, whereas the amendment means that contractual agreements will stand, but where there is no existing agreement 6 per cent will be paid. There are very few agreements without provision. The case the Minister made by way of interjection was that the person would have had the use of the money in the interim, but that is normally provided for in any agreement. It is normally provided that if a person gets into arrears in his payments interest will be paid on such arrears. If you take municipal rates, if you do not pay them on a certain date you have to pay a fixed rate of interest. I do not feel that it is right that we should now interfere with agreements and contracts made between people and lay down an arbitrary rate which a person shall have to pay irrespective of whether it is going to harm him or harm the person to whom he owes the money. Therefore I ask the Minister to consider this amendment.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I hope the Minister will be able either to accept this amendment or to deal with the point raised and clarify the clause, because I have no doubt whatever that this clause will be read in different ways by different people. The Minister shook his head when he was told that it may be a question of paying double interest, but it is my firm conviction that as the clause stands there are cases where double interest will be paid. e.g. if a person has a mortgage bond and has to make capital payments. In terms of the bond he has to pay interest and in terms of this clause he would be obliged to pay 6 per cent interest on arrear instalments, notwithstanding that he is already obligated to pay interest in terms of the bond. As I understand the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (Point), it makes it clear that where there is a stipulated rate of interest, whether it be 3 per cent or 7 per cent, that is the rate of interest which will continue to be paid, but on a debt in respect of which no rate of interest is provided, unless the amendment is accepted, the interest will be 6 per cent. I think that achieves exactly what the Minister wishes to achieve, but I think it is quite wrong, and that it is not the Minister&#x2019;s intention, to pay interest twice on the same amount of money, because a man has to do his military service.</p>

<p>I cannot accept the amendment at this stage. It is clear to me that we should also protect the businessman. If I were a businessman and money was due to me, I would make my calculations accordingly and if I did not receive that money I would have to borrow money in order to carry on with my business. The average rate of interest is 6 per cent. I think this affords reasonable protection to the trader, the businessman. From the outset we adopted the attitude in this House that we should be very careful that we did not apply a moratorium in peace-time in such a way that we unnecessarily hamshackled commerce. We should also treat the traders fairly. I simply regard it as a protection to the businessmen. I must say, however, that I am not a lawyer. I cannot go into all the implications at short notice because I was not given notice of this amendment. I shall, however, study it and if necessary I shall accept it in the Other Place.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>May I thank the hon. the Minister for his undertaking to consider the amendment in the Other Place. I just want to make this one point. In terms of my amendment a person will not be prohibited from charging interest on money due to him. In other words, if he does not receive his money he can charge interest. But in that case that interest must conform with any agreement which has been entered into, and if there is no agreement it will be 6 per cent. In other words.</p>

<p><span class="col_1913-1914" refersTo="page_0971"/>if he falls in arrear and his agreement provides that he will pay 3 per cent on all arrear instalments, that agreement remains of force. It is only when there is no agreement that he will have to pay 6 per cent. It does not prevent a person from charging interest on arrear payments. It only ensures that the interest is in line with the original agreement. The amendment does not place a prohibition on the payment of interest oh arrear payments; it is simply to protect existing agreements. Where there is no agreement it will be 6 per cent. As the clause stands at the moment the original agreement falls away and 6 per cent will apply irrespective of what was provided in the original agreement. I hope the Minister will regard it in that light.</p>

<p>Thirteenth Order read: Adjourned debate on motion for Second Reading, &#x2014;Colouerd Persons Education Bill, to be resumed.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Coloured Affairs, upon which an amendment had been moved by Dr. Steenkamp, adjourned on 21 February, resumed.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Before I proceed with what I was saying when the debate was adjourned last week. I would just like to deal with some of the figures which were queried by the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) who is not here now. He questioned the figures given by the hon. member for Hill-brow (Dr. Steenkamp), but I have here now the latest figures from the Cape Provincial Administration dated the 21st of this month, from which I see that the amount allotted to Coloured education this year was R21,385,000, out of a total Education Vote of R47,943,000. The figure quoted by the hon. member for Hillbrow that it was 39 per cent of the total Education Vote. I have now checked those figures and I find that my hon. friend was correct.</p>

<p>When the debate was adjourned last week I was dealing with the claim by the Minister and by the hon. member for Malmesbury that they were doing something wonderful for the Coloured people and their education in this Bill. I went on to say that so far from doing anything wonderful and asking us to give them praise for it, they were to be blamed for their dilatory approach to the subject and for the fact that they have been in power now for some 15 years and that they have been very late indeed in paying attention to this matter, and that they have year after year applied their minds to all sorts of ideological concepts and that this Bill which is designed, according to them, to give benefits to the Coloured people, was something which they had left until the very last minute. I went further and pointed out that the machinery was there already whereby the Provincial Administrations could deal with this particular problem, and that they could have used the existing machinery without now expending extra money on establishing new Departments to do the work already satisfactorily being done by the provinces; and all that was necessary to give the benefits they claimed for the Coloureds was to make the money available to the provinces. The whole of the machinery was there and all that was necessary was to make available the extra money. They are now promising the extra money to the Coloured people if their education comes under the Minister, but why was that necessary? Why was not the money made available in terms of the existing arrangement? The existing Education Departments had more than 100 years&#x2019; experience in dealing with education and the whole of that experience is to go for naught now and education is to be taken away from the existing Departments and handed over to another Department. We should be realists and realize that the Government was following their own policy of fragmentation, and that is why it is being taken away from the provinces. It has nothing to do with benefits for the Coloureds, or with better education.</p>

<p>Through the Department of Information there was issued to the Coloured people a little pamphlet in 1962 with big headings saying that &#x201C;transfer paves the way to improvements. Transfer leads to positive results &#x201D;. Let us look at the improvements which this pamphlet dangles in front of the Coloureds to get their support for the change-over. They are such as, firstly, compulsory education. Why is that important for an improvement? There is compulsory education in my province already for the Coloureds, and also in the Cape, under certain circumstances, and what are the circumstances which limit it? Money. The Minister of Coloured Affairs only had to get his own Government to accept the principle of assisting the Coloureds, and not the principle of the fragmentation of our population, but the trouble is that we have the wrong principle here. He could not get the money from his Government to give better education to the Coloureds, but he can get plenty of money if he can tell the Government that if they give them the money he will help them to get more fragmentation. What is the. second promise? The fullest development of talents. What a mockery!</p>

<p>Why cannot there be the fullest development of talents under the existing system? Why is there a limitation of their talents? Shame on the Government for having done nothing for 15 years! And the next is more and better facilities for vocational and technical training. Technical training was taken away from the provinces and we were told about the wonderful benefits that would flow from it, but now we are told that if only they leave their training to the Minister they will get still better education, with special attention to the specific needs of the individual. What is this that is being held out as a carrot before the Coloureds to try to persuade them to agree to the changeover? Then we come to the statement that transfer leads to positive results because the salary scales of teachers will be raised. That is said in an official document to try to get Coloured teachers to support the transfer to the Union Department. It is sheer, utter, outrageous bribery. It is an appeal to self-interest, to dominate the thoughts of the Coloured teachers who are being appealed to. It says that, secondly, all teachers are to be afforded the opportunity of improving their qualifications. Where is there a barrier to any Coloured teacher improving his qualifications, and if there is, who put it there? This reminds me of the famous story of the days of Cecil Rhodes when he had thousands of pamphlets printed before an election saying: &#x201C;Vote for Cecil Rhodes, and no tax on wool,&#x201D; but no one had ever suggested a tax on wool. There is nothing to prevent the teachers improving their qualifications to-day. They do not have to go over to the Minister&#x2019;s Department to improve their qualifications. Then it says that parents will have a say in the education of their children. We have that to-day in my own province. We have parent teacher associations, exactly as for the other race groups, and as far as I know, that is also the position in the other provinces and in the Cape.</p>

<p>Then it says that with centralized control further improvements in the education system are possible. Sir, further improvements need money, and it is money and the will to develop the education of the Coloureds that has been lacking so far. The money was there all right because it can be found now, but the will was absent. Then it says that full attention is to be given to adult education. Well, that is something for the Government to attend to in any case and it does not need this Bill to do so. So much for this precious document which was circulated to all the Coloureds to persuade them to put their education under the control of the Government. As far as I know, amongst the teachers&#x2019; associations throughout the whole length and breadth of the Republic, with the possible exception of one body, not a single organized body of Coloured teachers accepted in principle the transfer of Coloured education to the Government.</p>

<p>Let us look at one or two of the points made by the hon. member for Malmesbury. He said there were one or two special principles he wanted to lay down. One principle was that it was very undesirable that one body such as this Parliament should tax and hand the money to the province, which should then spend the money. The hon. member waxed quite eloquent about it. He did not like Parliament to raise money by taxation and hand it to the provinces on the rand-for-rand basis. But the hon. member should study his brief better before making such a statement, because I would like to quote to him a very important opinion in that regard, in connection with the development of Coloured affairs and taxation for the purpose of financing Coloured services. The statement is this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But the direct and indirect taxes which were paid by the Coloureds could be calculated so that a global sum could be paid over for the financing of the services under Coloured control, and the Coloured Control Board receiving this money, would then decide what could best be done with this money and would be responsible to their own people.</block>

<p>So the suggestion here is that the direct and indirect taxes paid by the Coloureds should be collected into a global sum and paid over to the Coloured Affairs Board instead of to the province. I want to ask the hon. member for Malmesbury what is the difference? And who said this? The hon. the Prime Minister, in December 1961. He said Parliament would tax and collect the money and pay it over to the Coloured Control Board. Now what happens to his sacred principle that it is wrong to do things like that? Here is the Prime Minister repudiating it 15 months before he made his speech last week.</p>

<p>But the hon. member went further and said that the most unfair thing is for Coloureds and Whites to get education out of the same pot&#x2014;a very earthy metaphor. He did not want education to come out of the same pot for White and Coloured children, and then he elaborated and said there should be differentiation. Sir, I am wondering whether the hon. member has not let the cat out of the pot my making that statement. What is the Minister going to say about this differentiation that his colleague talks about? Is not that the point, that there will be differentiation, and that the education for the Coloured child has to be differentiated?</p>

When the Chief Whip of the Nationalist Party makes that interjection, he is bearing out what was said by the hon. member for Malmesbury, and he is now making it worse and saying in the clearest possible language that to meet their needs the Coloureds will have to get a different education from that of White children. What is their destiny, in the mind of the hon. the Chief Whip? What kind of education do the Coloured children need to fit them for their destiny?

<p>Yes, I accept it, but what is the inference? It is that the Coloured child needs a different education from the White child. Does the Chief Whip deny it? No, he does not. Here we have a responsible man, the Chief Whip, admitting that differentiation and fragmentation in the field of education, as well as in the racial field, is now the policy of the Government. We feared that this step was going to lead to a diminution of the standards of education of the Coloureds, and I say now without any doubt that I believe that that must be so. I cannot believe that the Chief Whip and the Minister will see to it that their standard of education is put at a higher level than that of the White children. So that is what we are faced with, and now we know precisely where we stand&#x2014;differentiation, because educationally it will be the right thing for the Coloureds, bearing in mind their destiny, whatever that may be.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>When the adjournment took place, I was dealing with a certain document which had been circulated by the Department of Information, and with other points. Now I should like to come back for a moment to the question of the organization which has been in existence and in this regard still is in existence, namely where we have in the four provinces the different departments of education, so that in their own educational institutions, i.e. the Whites in theirs, the Bantu the Coloured and the Asiatics in theirs, they receive education in their own areas. All the races therefore had their own schools under the jurisdiction of the Provincial Administration concerned with its department of education. And I think I can say that subject to the limitations imposed upon them by considerations of finance, they did a very good job of work. What was needed was finance.</p>

<p>May I in this respect draw the attention of the House to a similar situation in the past where the provinces ran short of finance for education. I quote this as an example to show what would have been an easy step for the Government to have taken in this matter. I want to go back to the policy which was at that time and by the then Opposition, called the &#x201C;Hofmeyr-beleid &#x201D;. Mr. Hofmeyr felt that more should be done for the education of the Natives. The money was not there&#x2014;the provinces did not have the necessary funds. The net outcome&#x2014;without going into detail&#x2014;was that Mr. Hofmeyr arranged for the necessary funds to be provided by vote of Parliament. That money went to the four Provincial Administrations <i>in toto</i> for Bantu education. They were therefore not expected to contribute anything. Whatever the Central Government felt should be expended on Bantu education, was provided by Parliament. The present Minister of Bantu Administration and Development was one of those who issued a pamphlet at the time in which he criticized most strongly the expenditure of such large sums of money. However, my point in this connection is that a precedent was created then and that there is no reason why this Government could not have followed that precedent, i.e. to have voted more money for the expenditure by Provincial Administrations on education. But, no! That would not do for them. That is why I say that we must be realistic and realize that this Bill has got nothing to do with the education of the Coloured people and that despite all the protestations of the hon. the Minister and the hon. member for Malmesbury. This Bill has nothing to do with that. What this Bill does is to bring about fragmentation of our population.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. the Minister is going to be very philosophical about this when he replies to the debate when the time comes. He might put on a show of wrath, but that does not matter; that would just be fending his way. We understand that by now in this House. But why do I say that the Minister will be philosophical about this matter? Because he knows that he is simply here filling a gap for the time being. The Minister knows that very well.</p>

<p>I am not talking about that hon. member&#x2019;s intelligence, Mr. Speaker. That has not been filled since 1948&#x2014; there still is a gap! Let me, at this juncture, deal with a certain speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister and in doing so, I am sure there is going to be no voice of protest raised from the other side, whatever members, may think. There will, on the contrary, be a dumb acceptance of what the Prime Minister <span class="col_1919-1920" refersTo="page_0974"/>said on this occasion. That is why I said &#x2014;in the light of the Prime Minister&#x2019;s words&#x2014;that the Minister of Coloured Affairs is not going to complain too loudly when the time comes. This is what the Prime Minister said in December 1961 namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Council for Coloured Affairs must be developed into a more representative Union control board, actually a Coloured Parliament which would control all Coloured interests in the country, with administrative and legislative powers, and officials to carry out its decisions. The control board must also have a permanent body, an executive council, of four persons, each of whom would, like a Minister, be responsible for carrying out the functions of the board. One member of the executive council would be responsible for rural settlements and all professional activities, one for &#x2026;, and one member for Coloured education which would gradually be taken over by the Coloured community so that the Coloureds would have a say in the education of their own children.</block>

<p>In other words, this member would be like a Cabinet Minister. In other words, the present Minister of Coloured Affairs is serving as a stop gap. How long did the Prime Minister visualize this transition to take place? In the same speech the Prime Minister also said&#x2014;I am not going to quote at length from it because I am not a free advertising agent for the Prime Minister&#x2014;that it would last ten years. He said he was in a hurry and that he was going to get on with it. That was why he fixed ten years. That he did in December 1961 &#x2014;one year and three months have already gone by since.</p>

<p>Here then is the position which we have to face under this Bill: What we must see in this Bill, Sir, is not an attempt to take Coloured education away from the provinces for the purpose of handing it over to a Minister here in Parliament, but an attempt to take Coloured education away from the provinces to hand it over, for the time being, to a Minister until such time as a central Coloured body has been built up with a Coloured Minister of Coloured Education who then is going to take over control. It is quite interesting to surmise as to who is going to have precedence in terms of status&#x2014;the Coloured Minister of Education or our own Minister of Coloured Affairs&#x2014;and whether, when the time comes, the present Minister of Coloured Affairs will simply abdicate when that transfer has to take place at the next stage of development. The present stage is only a temporary measure until the time when Coloured education will be taken over permanently by a Coloured Minister. This, then, is the position which is facing us under this Bill. We are not being asked to vote or fight against the passing of control from the provincial administrations to the Government. That is not the point at all. What is being done in terms of this Bill is merely a temporary measure because ultimately Coloured education must go to the control of the Coloured people themselves. And where does the question of finance come in then?</p>

<p>I want to deal with this matter very carefully. I have already quoted from this report where the Prime Minister said the taxation presently being levied from the Coloured people, could be taken and paid over to this central body of four Ministers for them to distribute. Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister laughs and smiles. That means that I have his acquiescence. I know him well enough to appreciate that gesture. At present, Sir, there is a heavy subsidy necessary for Coloured education. What is then to be the position in future? If this interim step is to inveigle the Coloured people into accepting a new set-up with the aid of promises of higher salaries for the teachers, higher benefits in terms of money for the purposes of Coloured education, etc., what then is to be the position after that? What will happen then? Can the hon. the Minister answer this question when he replies? What is the destiny of these people when he ceases to be the Minister of Coloured Education having passed Coloured education on to its permanent home, namely to the shoulders of a permanent Coloured Minister of Coloured Education? Are the Coloured people then to find the money for their own education from their own resources?</p>

<p>You see, Sir, when Mr. Hofmeyr arranged for Parliament to vote all the necessary funds for Bantu education within what was then the Union, he did so because the taxation then allowed to the provinces was very small indeed; there was very little income for them. There was, in any case, very little direct taxation coming from the Bantu. What is, in the main, the position with the Coloured people to-day? Surely they are a section of the population who to-day are not economically in a position to pay for their own education? They do pay indirect taxes, like the rest of us do. Our revenue account benefits from the indirect taxation levied on all sections, even the poorest&#x2014;by way of customs duties, and in many other ways. The Coloured people are therefore paying their whack. But are they, when the time comes, going to be told that now that they have their own Cabinet, their own independence and their Minister of Coloured Affairs, they have to find the money to pay for their education and that to the extent that they will be able to finance themselves in this respect, will they be allowed to spend money for their own education?</p>

<p>This, Sir, is I think a detestable approach to the whole problem. Here we have a section of our population who, at any rate from the days of the public statement made by General Hertzog, the leader of the Nationalist Party at the time, is an appendage of the White folk in this country. We have accepted that all along. They are our natural allies in regard to all matters&#x2014;including culture. Their education builds up their culture in the same way as it does ours. Their songs, their writings, etc. are part of the stuff which is being read by White people of this country. Are we <span class="col_1921-1922" refersTo="page_0975"/>going to throw them aside now on account of this policy of this Government to bring about fragmentation of our population? And that an unready and unprepared people? If we want to do that, let us first give them an education which will fit them for all those responsibilities; let us first put them in a position where they would be able economically to pay their way as a viable community and where they would have understanding and appreciation of precisely what responsibilities they would be accepting. Do not let us throw them into this atomic age with the call for freedom and for self-determination which we are manufacturing for them because they did not ask for it, Sir. They never asked for it! They have never asked for freedom and self-determination in regard to their education! We are manufacturing it for them because we tell them that we are going to give it to them, i.e. the right to determine their own future in regard to education and in other ways. Thereby we are throwing an unready 1,500,000 people into a condition for which they are completely unprepared. From whatever angle we view it, I think it is absolutely fundamentally wrong. Let us spend the money, the revenue of this country to which they have contributed their small widow&#x2019;s mite, to build them up into a viable community and then to give them a free choice as to whether they want to go their own way in regard to education or anything else. Then we will be playing the game by the people whose trustees we are to-day.</p>

<p>When the hon. member for Natal (South Coast) (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) accused the hon. the Minister of &#x201C;filling a gap&#x201D;, I told him by way of interjection that he had been &#x201C;filling a gap&#x201D; since 1948. Then he mumbled something about &#x201C;intelligence&#x201D;, I do not want to draw comparisons between his intelligence and mine, but would prefer to leave it to the judgment of others who are more objectively disposed towards this point than he is. The hon. member for Natal (South Coast) was elected to Parliament in 1948 because General Smuts wanted him as a member of his Cabinet if he won the election. But they did not; with the result that he had to stay in Opposition. He is still there to-day, and I predict that he will never be anywhere else.</p>

<p>Because the hon. member for Natal (South Coast) attacked the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) this afternoon. I want to defend the hon. member for Malmesbury and say that he had to withdraw from the discussion of this matter this afternoon in order to prepare for a meeting which is to take place in his constituency this evening. The fact that he is not present, was not intended as a slight or anything of that nature. To return to the speech of the hon. member for South Coast, I may say that his whole speech can be summed up in the word &#x201C;fragmentation &#x201D;. To his way of thinking, everything is being fragmented. All that I want to ask him in this connection is whether, if it is fragmentation when the Coloureds receive their own school system and the Whites, Bantu and Asiatics each have their own, it is not fragmentation also if the same type of thing is applied to the various groups of the population in other spheres? I take it therefore that the hon. member will agree with me when I contend that according to this view it was also fragmentation to place the Coloureds on a separate voters&#x2019; roll? Will it also be fragmentation if they are kept on a separate voters&#x2019; roll?</p>

<p>I have here a cutting from the <i>Cape Times</i> of 24 September 1959 of a report on a speech which the hon. member for Natal (South Coast) &#x201C;The Leader of the United Party in Natal&#x201D; made in Johannesburg. He is reported as having said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He said, in reply to a question, that the United Party would not necessarily restore the Coloured people to the common voters&#x2019; roll when it again got back to power. &#x201C;We will consult the Coloureds first,&#x201D; he added. &#x201C;It may be possible that by then they will be so content with the present system of having their own representatives in Parliament that they will choose not to be put back on the common roll.&#x201D;</block>

<p>I ask now, Mr. Speaker, whether what the hon. member is advocating here does not also amount to fragmentation of the people? [Interjections.] Yes, during that meeting somebody put a question to the hon. member by way of an interjection, to which the hon. member reacted as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Oh, go and boil your head, man!</block>

<p>The hon. member now wants to know what our intention is by fragmenting the people in this way. May I refer him to his own province, the province of which he is the Leader of his Party. In Natal the promotion of Coloured education was started in 1885. No progress was made in that connection; they left the matter to the mission schools. But in 1900&#x2014;still before the other provinces were able to do so&#x2014;Natal made a positive effort to establish Coloured schools in order to accommodate Coloureds and Whites in separate schools. This happened in his own province; in other words, his own province started as early as in 1900 with the fragmentation of the people. The hon. member later became Administrator of that province, but he neglected to tell us what steps he took to combat this fragmentation of the people in Natal!</p>

<p>But I want to discuss another consideration. If it is fragmentation to divide up the Coloureds, Whites and so forth into separate school systems, then surely it is also fragmentation to divide up Whites and Whites into separate schools? And is that not what they are doing in Natal?</p>

<p>I can well understand that this hon. &#x201C;Little Pitt&#x201D; is thinking about last year. But I am sure that he noticed what happened recently at Michaelhouse, one of the English single-medium schools, when a survey was taken there and it was found that a fairly large percentage of the children in that school were Republicans and Nationalists. For that reason hon. members are now concerned about fragmentation! [Interjections.]</p>

<p>The hon. member for Natal (South Coast) asked what this Government has done for Coloured education. In reply to that question I need only refer him to the Cape and ten years of United Party Government, that is to say, from 1935-45, as compared with ten years of Nataionl Party Government, that is to say, from 1950-60. During the ten year period from 1935-45 the number of Coloured scholars in the Cape alone increased by 58,726, while during the period 1950-60 the increase was 127,951. Moreoever, this number increased by a further 30,000 in the next two years. I think that this is an adequate answer to the question of the hon. member in regard to what the Government has done for Coloured education.</p>

<p>In pursuance of the hon. member&#x2019;s argument that segregation is fragmentation, I want to ask the hon. member whether he is not the same person who lead the agitation against single-medium schools and in favour of parallel-medium schools?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a very stupid question and so it is very easy to answer. I led the agitation for parallel-medium schools because I was opposed to English-medium schools as separate schools. I have always told Afrikaners that if Bishops and other schools of its type were parallel-medium schools, so much more attention would be given to Afrikaans. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>But to return to the hon. member for Natal (South Coast). He wants to tell this House that this Government is doing so little for Coloured education and that by means of what he calls the &#x201C;process of fragmentation&#x201D;, we are apparently neglecting the education of the Coloureds, the Indians and the Bantu. Let me prove to him how much better off the Coloureds, Indians and Bantu in South Africa are than the Indians in India. I have here the latest that is to say, the 1961 issue of <i>The International Yearbook and Statesmen&#x2019;s Who's Who,</i> on page 339 of which we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Literacy in India is as low as 12 per cent of the total population, but this gives no indication of the illiteracy among women which is much greater. The Government plan to provide free and compulsory education within the next ten years for all the children under the age of 14 years.</block>

<p>Hon. members say now when we try to promote Coloured and Indian education that we are introducing fragmentation, but fragmentation in India means that only a small percentage can read and write. Our Coloureds and our Indians are far better off under this Government.</p>

<p>We heard the old complaint from the hon. member for Natal (South Coast) and also from the hon. member for Hillbrow that the proposed transfer of Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs will mean that this education will become inferior education. But that same accusation was forthcoming from them when we wanted to do and did the same thing with Bantu education. Then they also told the world that this would mean inferior education; that it would actually mean nothing because it would be of a lower standard. But when the curricula were announced, the instructors of the hon. member for Houghton, the Institute of Race Relations, stated that those curricula compared well with the best in England. [Interjections.] Mr. Speaker, I want to ask you to appeal to the hon. member for Durban (Point) who is making a noise like one of those empty vessels we hear so much about, to try and conceal that emptiness.</p>

<p>This argument of inferiority was also used at the time when we wanted to establish separate universities for Coloureds, Indians and Bantu. At that time the United Party also tried to tell the world that those university colleges would be inferior institutions which would actually amount to nothing more than differentiation in education. It would be education in the bundu, so they said. But what is the case to-day? A senior lecturer was recently appointed to the teaching staff of the University College of the Western Cape, a man with more qualifications than any other man in his subject can lay claim to in any other university either in South Africa or, for that matter, in the world. Let me also refer to the University College of Fort Hare. I have the honour to be a member of the Council of that college. That is why I feel that I am in the position of being able to state that Fort Hare has never in its history had a teaching staff of the standard and calibre as that which it has to-day. It has never had such an extensive curriculum; it has never had as many faculties; and it has never had such highly qualified people as it has to-day.

Under the new r&#x00E9;gime there are seven students&#x2014;and they write the examination set by the University of South Africa; in other words, of a world-renowned standard&#x2014;and all seven had passed.

<p>Now, Mr. Speaker, these are the results of a r&#x00E9;gime which hon. members of the Opposition have tried to make out has lowered the standard of non-White education. Because the hon. member for Natal South Coast) how much to say about fragmentation, I would like to confine myself to this matter and I want to draw your attention to the fact that the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs pointed out that Coloured education would be planned as an undivided unit. In this he touched on a principle which is fundamental to all education, that is to say, that education of itself is indivisible. While education as such is indivisible, the control over education is something which must be divided. In all civilized countries of the world which have to deal with various race groups and language groups, there is a system of divided control over education. What the hon. member therefore calls &#x201C;fragmentation of the population&#x201D; is nothing less than divided control over education. As against this education as such ought to be planned for every group as a unit. But when we come to the control of education, we can simply take our own country as an example. In the Republic we have no fewer than four different education control systems, that is to say, one for each province. Besides this we also have South West Africa with a fifth system. But can we call this &#x201C;fragmentation of the people &#x201D;? Take a country like Belgium. There they have separate control over schools in the Walloon and Flemish areas. In the one area Flemish is used as the medium of education and in the other area French is used as the language medium. The universities there are either Flemish or Walloon universities. Only last year the Gelbium Parliament adopted a Bill to draw a linguistic boundary through Belgium. Those on one side of that boundary speak Flemish and those on the other side speak French.</p>

<p>The hon. member does not quite understand what I am talking about. I say that if divided control over education means fragmentation, then we have fragmentation of the population in Belgium. I have also pointed out what the true position in Belgium is. If the hon. member investigates these matters a little more and keeps quiet in the meantime, he may perhaps get to know something more about them.</p>

<p>What is the position in Great Britain in this connection? Remember, the hon. member for Natal South Coast said that divided control over education means the fragmentation of the people. But in England there are separate education systems for England and Wales. This is provided for in terms of the Education Acts of 1944 and 1953. In those Acts it is provided that local education authorities&#x2014;the county and county borough councils&#x2014;will be responsible for education in their various areas. The whole of Britain and Wales is divided into various areas for this purpose. Does this amount to fragmentation of the people? Scotland also has its own system. The Scots do not follow the British system at all; they have their own system of education under <span class="col_1927-1928" refersTo="page_0978"/>their own laws.

<p>I was referring to the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). If divided control over education means the fragmentation of the people, then it will be difficult for me to find a better example than the Republic of Israel. In the Republic of Israel there are Jewish schools to which no Arabs are admitted and there are Arab schools to which no Jewish children are admitted. They have complete segregation between Arab and Jew. In the Arab schools the language medium is Arabic and in the Jewish schools the language medium is Hebrew. Yiddish cannot be used. They used to have a theatre in which Yiddish plays were performed but even this was later forbidden by the State. The language medium is Hebrew and control over education falls under the Ministry of Education although the curricula differ. The curricula for the Jewish children and the curricula for the Arab children are completely different. The strongest complaint of the small Aram minority within the State of Israel is simply that they have no control over their own school system. That is as much fragmentation of the people as one can find anywhere.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Under one department?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#jonker">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">JONKER</person>:</from>

<p>Fragmentation under one department is still worse. Mr. Speaker, if differentiation in education, if various controls over different languages for population groups means the fragmentation of the population, then we have fragmentation of a far more serious nature in Canada. Public education in Canada excludes all Indians and Eskimos. They are completely excluded; they are beyond the pale! In <i>Quebec</i> they have a Roman Catholic system with French as the language medium. This is controlled by the State of Quebec. In the other nine provinces they follow the Protestant English tradition. In Newfoundland the schools are denominational. There they have the following control in one State: Anglican, Roman Catholic, United Church, Salvation Army and Seventh Day Adventists. The control over education in one State is divided up amongst all of these denominational bodies. Fragmentation! To my mind it is more like complete destruction! I quote from the same book that I quoted from just now&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In each province, except Quebec, education is administered by a separate department of the Government, headed by a Minister of Education.</block>

<p>Every province has its own department headed by a Minister of Education. They go on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In Quebec education comes under the Provincial Secretary.</block>

<p>One cannot find a better example of the fragmentation of education and the fragmentation of the people than that of Quebec. And still the hon. member for South Coast&#x2014;for whom this argument has now become a little too much and that is why he is sitting next to and chatting with the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore)&#x2014;says that this divided control, this school system for Coloured children under the Department of Coloured Affairs together with the fourfold school system for White children under four provincial systems, is fragmentation of the people.</p>

<p>I want to mention the further example of Switzerland. In Switzerland primary and secondary schools are controlled by the various cantons. The cantons are French or German or Italian. Each has control over its own schools. Each educates its children in its own tradition; in the French tradition or in the German or Italian tradition with French, German or Italian as the medium of instruction in the various schools. If fragmentation of the people means different school systems, different school control for different race groups, what do they have in the United States of America? In the United States of America there is no national control or management of education. The legislative body in each state sets its own minimum requirement itself. They dare not leave the hon. member for South Coast alone so that he is able to listen to what I am saying. They must keep him occupied. Every state in the U.S.A. has a separate legislative body which sets the minimum requirement for education in that state. They narrow it down even further; the educational programme, that is to say, the curriculum, is not set by the Federal State; it is not set by an individual state but it is set by community school boards. Every small area within that state has a community school board which fixes its curriculum. In certain states with a large Negro population there were and still are separate schools and colleges <span class="col_1929-1930" refersTo="page_0979"/>for Negroes. I do not have the cutting here but you know that a retired judge in one of the states in America said recently that this was one of the most hypocritical things that could happen in America&#x2014;that the Federal Court should decide that the separate school system was a contravention of the Constitution of the United States. You know how they have forced the policy of integration on the people; they have forced this policy on the people by means of rifles and bayonets. [Interjections.] I am talking about fragmentation of the people; I am not talking about the fragmentation of the hon. member himself. In 1934 the Federal Court ruled that this was unconstitutional but they have had and still have certain states in America to-day which have separate schools for Negroes and for Whites.</p>

<p>The argument of the hon. member for South Coast therefore does not hold water but is merely a smoke-screen in regard to something which exists throughout the world. Every country has it. If anyone wants to he can read the latest book written about Rhodes, the latest biography of Rhodes, and he will see that mention is made of the fact that the Rhodes bursaries were instituted because they wanted to give a particular type of training to certain people, people to be trained in what was called the British Colonial system. We have hon. members here who were Rhodes scholars. The hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell) who is now entering the Chamber was one of them. They were sent here to be trained under a particular system of education, a particular indoctrination, a word of which hon. members are so afraid. All education is indoctrination.</p>

<p>By means of this legislation probably one of the most important forward steps ever taken for the training of Coloured children will now be taken. We have said that the only difference is that we cannot make Coloured education compulsory for all Coloured children; we can only do so in places where circumstances permit of this being done, that is to say, at places where there are adequate school facilities and so forth. But we already have compulsory education for Coloured children here and when they have their own fully-fledged Ministry of Education and their own fully-fledged system under the Minister of Coloured Affairs, a future will be created for Coloured education such as it has never had in the past; a future which these people have not had in Natal or in the Free State or in the Transvaal and to a large extent in the Cape as well, although the Cape has progressed furthest in this sphere.</p>

<p>I want to say therefore that the hon. the Minister must not allow himself to be upset by this talk of the fragmentation of the people but must continue with this great ideal which he has set himself. I am very pleased that he has already made provision in this legislation for the appointment of a Coloured Education Advisory Council, something that I asked for last year. When the hon. the Minister announced the transfer scheme, I told him that it would be a wonderful thing if, at the start, he could make provision of a Coloured Education Advisory Council. This is something for which we as Whites had to fight for many years before we received it&#x2014;for which we had to struggle many years because we only received it last year. A Coloured Education Advisory Council is being established here right from the start, an advisory council which will be able to inquire into all the aspects of Coloured education and advise the Minister from time to time in order to enable him to supply the needs of Coloured education as such. The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) was quite correct in saying that one cannot treat Coloured education and White education in the same way, as the hon. member for South Coast apparently wants to do. These are two different national groups and each has to be educated according to its own nature and its own requirements, its own traditions and its own civilization. Even in his own party the hon. member discovered what happened when one tried to treat different groups in the same way. He has had that experience&#x2014;that fragmentation in his own party. I hope that he will not begrudge the Coloureds the opportunity of going forward to meet a brighter and better future under their own education system under the Department of Coloured Affairs.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I have no desire whatsoever to become involved in the political argument between the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) and the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell). This is far too an important matter for me to waste my limited time on entering into their dispute. I am sure, Mr. Speaker, that they will both forgive me if I concentrate my remarks on this measure before the House for the reason that I have just mentioned.</p>

<p>I must say at once that I am not very impressed with the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reason that this Bill has been introduced by the Government largely because the Cape Provincial Administration could no longer carry the financial burden of Coloured education. [Interjections.] Someone says it is true, but I am not impressed at all with that reason. During the course of his introductory speech the hon. the Minister said that the financial implications of Coloured education in the Cape, where 90 per cent of the Coloured people lived, were such that the Cape Province could no longer carry the burden of Coloured education. The Minister went on to point out that there were 347,730 Coloured children at school in this country; that there were 10,793 Coloured teachers; that there were 13 Coloured teachers&#x2019; training colleges and then he went on to say that the State could not shirk this ever-increasing task or shift the financial responsibility on to the shoulders of others. I think that this reason, when carefully analysed and examined.</p>

<p><span class="col_1931-1932" refersTo="page_0980"/>will carry no weight whatsoever. The hon. the Minister claims that it is the Government&#x2019;s intention to face up to the financial responsibilities of giving to our Coloured children in this country a proper primary and secondary education. At long last, Sir, we have had the pronouncement made by the responsible Minister that the Government is prepared to face up to that responsibility. I say, Sir, that if financial considerations were the chief reasons which motivated the Government in introducing this Bill, I suggest that there was a much easier way of dealing with the matter. All that the Government need have done, if it were only the financial implications that were involved in this matter, was to have acceded to the request of the Cape Provincial Council to increase the Government subsidy. On 16 May of last year a motion was introduced by the National Party leader in the council calling on the Government to pay the province a subsidy of at least 80 per cent of its annual expenditure on Coloured education and failing that to take over Coloured education itself. I repeat, Sir, that if financial considerations were the most important aspect in the Government&#x2019;s approach to this matter, all that the Government need have done was to give effect to that resolution which was passed in the Provincial Council and moved by the leader of the National Party in that council. By doing that the Government would not have disrupted the well-established educational system in the Cape; it would not have diminished the power, the authority, the work and the status of the provincial councils in this country and, above all, it would not have disrupted or interfered with the Provincial Education Department. It would not have caused the province to lose control, as they are going to lose, of more than half the school children within its borders. If this Bill becomes law the Cape Provincial Council will lose control of more than half the school children within the borders of the Cape Province. I think that the Government would have done much better had it been frank with this House and declared that, in accordance with the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy, it had now decided to transfer Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs.</p>

<p>The Minister gave that as the second reason; I think that is the primary reason. I want to say that after all this decision to transfer Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs is in line with the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid. It is in line with the Government&#x2019;s determination over a number of years to centralize and to administer every aspect of our citizens&#x2019; lives from the Central Administration. I think the Government should have been absolutely frank with this House and the country by telling us that this Bill is part of the pattern of the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>No, but I read the speech which the hon. the Minister made. The Coloured people, and I include those who are not opposed to this measure and there is a number of them who are not opposed to it, generally view this Bill in the light that it is part of the pattern of the Government&#x2019;s apartheid policy. They feel that this is an inevitable step in the Government&#x2019;s ideological policy of apartheid. It is also important to remember, and I want to emphasize this, that no Coloured body or any responsible Coloured leader asked for this change. The proposed transfer of the control of Coloured education emanates entirely from the Government because it falls in line with the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid.</p>

<p>There appears to be, in the Cape Province at least, a mixed reaction on the part of the Coloured people towards this Bill. I will endeavour to the best of my ability to place before this House both sides of the opinions expressed by Coloured leaders themselves on this very important measure. Those who support this fundamental change hold the view that the Coloured people as a whole are likely to receive greater benefits by way of educational facilities from the well-disposed Coloured Affairs Department than from a Provincial Administration which is dependent for the amount of the subsidy it obtains from the Central Government for Coloured education. They feel that from a benign and well-disposed Coloured Affairs Department they are likely to get greater benefits for their Coloured people. To my mind they have no doubt been influenced by the Government&#x2019;s failure to respond favourably to the Provincial Council&#x2019;s request for a larger subsidy. I think that they have also been influenced to a very large extent by the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister when he urged the Coloured Affairs Council and through them the Coloured people of the Cape, to accept the situation that when Coloured education was removed from the Provincial Administration to the Coloured Affairs Department, brighter days would lie ahead. I will quote the actual words used by the hon. the Prime Minister in a moment.</p>

<p>The leader of the National Party in the Provincial Council, when introducing his motion, asked for a subsidy of at least 80 per cent of the cost of Coloured education. He quoted a large number of statistics to show that the Province was no longer in a position to keep pace financially with the rapid strides which Coloured education was making to-day. I will, in due course, deal with some of the statistics used on that occasion. For the present, all I wish to emphasize is that this motion adopted in the Cape Provincial Council and later subscribed to by the hon. the Prime Minister himself, has no doubt influenced a large number of Coloured educationists to give <span class="col_1933-1934" refersTo="page_0981"/>support to the principle of transferring Coloured education to the Coloured Affairs Department, because they feel that they will get a more sympathetic treatment from this Department.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, this was what the hon. the Prime Minister told the Union Council for Coloured Affairs in December 1961 in respect of this very matter that we are now discussing. The hon. the Prime Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An investigation must immediately be conducted into the desirability of placing all Coloured education, including the Coloured University College, under the control of the Department of Coloured Affairs. This will make it possible for Coloured parents to share in the control by means of their own school committees and school boards, and possibly a Coloured Educational Council to develop their own inspectorate. Coloured officials will be able to occupy administrative posts as they become qualified. It will be possible to improve the salary scales of Coloured teachers within such a pattern. The need for farm schools to serve the children of farming families also requires attention.</block>

<p>Those Coloured people who support this measure feel that once Coloured education is taken away from the Provincial Administration and vested in the Coloured Affairs Department the Government will be obliged to provide the necessary funds in order to give to these approximately 350,000 Coloured children the best possible education on an equivalent basis to that given to our European children. I think they have been influenced to a very large extent by the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister himself in that regard. They feel that under a so-called benign Coloured Affairs Department, in terms of the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s statement, Coloured parents will be able to share in the control of Coloured education by means of their own school committees and by means of their own school boards. They feel, Sir, that a Coloured inspectorate will be created, that Coloured officials will be able to occupy important administrative posts, that there will be a substantial improvement in the salary scales applicable to Coloured teachers and Coloured principals, and that there will be facilities to serve the educational requirements of the children of Coloured farming families. I have no doubt, Mr. Speaker, that all these factors have influenced a large measure of support from the Coloured leaders to this proposed change.</p>

<p>On the other hand those Coloured people who oppose this measure&#x2014;and there are many of them&#x2014;contend that the aspirations of the Coloured people are to obtain education, not Coloured education. I am sorry that the hon. member for Fort Beaufort is not in the Chamber at the moment, because the trend of his remarks was&#x2014;and I hope the hon. the Minister will, during the course of his remarks, disassociate himself with that&#x2014;that these Coloured people would receive what some of them regard as Coloured education as distinct from education. These Coloured leaders have expressed the fear that a full-scale switchover of Coloured education to the Coloured Affairs Department may bring Coloured education down to the standard of the highly unpopular Bantu education in this country.</p>

<p>They are also divided. I have given you one side of the picture where some of the Coloured leaders support this measure for the reasons that I have advanced. I am also giving you the other side of the picture in fairness to that section of the Coloured population who oppose this measure, for reasons which I have also advanced. This latter category contend&#x2014;and here I say with absolute justification; I side with them here&#x2014;that the intellectual needs of the Coloured people are the same as those of people of any other race. This fear on the part of some of them of a retrogressive and retarded form of education has alarmed a large number of educationists and has caused them to voice their protest against this measure. This section of Coloured educationists claim that in this Bill the Government is aiming at channelling the education of the Coloured people into the ideological framework of apartheid. For that reason, Sir, they oppose it..</p>

<p>I have indicated to this House as fairly as I possibly could the two divergent views of leaders of the Coloured people, the views of those who oppose the Bill and those who support the Bill. My colleagues and I are now faced with the necessity of deciding whether the placing of the control of Coloured education in the hands of the Department of Coloured Affairs will better serve the interests of the Coloured people generally in South Africa than the continuance of the existing system under which the control of Coloured education is vested in the Provincial Administration. I would like to say immediately that my colleagues and I have given this matter our most serious consideration. We have had most serious deliberations with both sections of the <span class="col_1935-1936" refersTo="page_0982"/>Coloured leaders, with those who support this measure and those who oppose it. We are motivated in our decision by one thing only and that is to do what we consider to be in the best interests of the Coloured people. We have given this matter the most careful consideration and we have endeavoured to collate as far as we possibly could the system which presently exists in regard to Coloured education and to compare it with the system which is envisaged under this Bill. I think, Sir, it will be of interest at this stage for me to give to the House some of the basic figures which apply to our present system of Coloured education as compared with the present system of European education. I think it is necessary that some hon. members who simply do not realize the importance of Coloured education, should appreciate the conditions which prevail with regard to Coloured and European education in this country. My figures of necessity relate to the position in the Cape Province where the largest number of our Coloured people live. The hon. the Minister has told us that 90 per cent of the Coloured people live in the Cape Province.</p>

<p>In 1961 the total enrolment in all schools in the Cape of European pupils amounted to 204,419. This represented an increase of 3,574 on the number for 1960. The enrolment of Coloured pupils in 1961 in the Cape amounted to 275,415, more than 70,000 more than the Europeans This figure represented an increase of 16,390 as compared with 1960. As we are principally concerned, however, in the Cape with primary education I think I should give comparative figures in regard to primary pupils in the European and Coloured categories for the same period. At the end of the second quarter of 1961 the number of primary European pupils in our schools in the Cape was 139,815. This represented 1,149 more pupils than in the previous year. As far as the Coloured children were concerned, the number of pupils in substandard A to Std. V&#x2014;which I regard as the primary school&#x2014;was 261,557 in September 1961 as against 139,000-odd European pupils. Almost double the number of European children. That represented an increase of 14,467 on the previous year as against 1,149 in the Cape of European children. The enrolment in the primary classes of mission schools was 188,426 as compared with 180,048 for 1960. The House will therefore see how the number of Coloured pupils is increasing from year to year and how important it is to ensure that these Coloured children whom we regard as part of the Western civilization of this country should receive the same type of education as our White children.</p>

<p>It is also appropriate for me to draw attention to the position of the mission schools in our midst. According to the latest report of the Superintendent-General of Education of the Cape, the mission schools were managed by 25 different bodies. Six church bodies, however, controlled the largest number of schools, and incidentally the largest number of Coloured children attending those schools. In 1961 the Dutch Reformed Church controlled 543 mission schools with an enrolment of 59,329 pupils; the English Church controlled 182 mission schools with an enrolment of 34,996; the Congregational Church 155 schools with an enrolment of 21,052; the Roman Catholic Church 78 mission schools, with an enrolment of 18,924; the Methodist Church 83 mission schools with an enrolment of 12,616; and the Moravian 52 mission schools with an enrolment of 9,198.</p>

<p>How is this relevant?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. member the relevancy now. From these figures it will be obvious to anyone that the Government will have to take steps to provide for these large masses of Coloured children who are attending these mission schools and for whom the Churches are trying their very best to give them the best possible education, but who have not the funds to do so, the Government will have to accept the responsibility of giving to those children the necessary education to which they are entitled as citizens of this country. From these figures it will be seen that the Dutch Reformed Church manages by far the largest number of schools and controls the largest number of pupils, and all credit to them for having done this. They need as much financial help as can possibly be given to them to give to these children the education to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature which emerges from the report of the Superintendent-General of Education is the ratio between the number of pupils instructed mainly through the medium of English, and those instructed mainly through the medium of Afrikaans. The percentages show that a considerable majority of pupils in the primary standards receive their instruction mainly through the medium of Afrikaans. The percentages decrease somewhat in the secondary standards, but compared with 1960, the 1961 records show an increase in the percentage of pupils receiving their instruction through the medium of Afrikaans even in the secondary schools. This would indicate to my mind that fewer Afrikaans-speaking pupils have left school at an early age. Again all the more credit to them. It also indicates that the policy of giving instruction through the medium of the language which the pupil knows best is being applied more consistently in the secondary schools, again a feature which I think should be perpetuated by the Government if this Bill goes through. The unfortunate feature which emerges from the report is that the number of Coloured pupils leaving school after Std. VI, is still very great indeed. This is an unfortunate feature of Coloured education in this country, and this is due to the fact, undoubtedly, that the children of necessity are obliged to go and look for work by reason of their economic position, in order to supplement the earnings of the breadwinners of their respective families. This unfortunate position strengthens our contention that whilst the Coloured children remain at school they should <span class="col_1937-1938" refersTo="page_0983"/>be given the best possible education in the interest of our country. These unfortunate children who have to leave school at tender years should get every possible advantage to get the best possible education.</p>

<p>I have mentioned these figures in order to impress upon the House the great problem with which we are confronted when dealing with Coloured education. I agree with the hon. Minister of Coloured Affairs when he said during the course of his second-reading speech that the task of educating the Coloured people was continually growing and that the State should not continue to shirk this ever-increasing task. I agree that it is an ever-increasing task, and the time has come when someone must face up to the responsibility of giving them the education to which they are entitled.</p>

<p>The question therefore arises: How are my colleagues and myself best able to serve the interests of our people in this educational field? Quite obviously there would be a simple solution, as I have said already, to this problem if the Government were prepared to face up to the requests that has been made to the Government from time to time by the provincial administrations for an increased subsidy to enable them to continue to give the best possible education to our Coloured population.</p>

<p>Without any question, because after all the provinces have established over many, many years now, a professional and administrative staff in the teaching field which can hold its own in any part of the world.

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Provided funds are made available, this well-established educational system could deal adequately with the question of Coloured education. The Government, however, has decided that it is not prepared to make available increased subsidies, without which Coloured education cannot progress. There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that in making this decision, the Government was influenced by its own policy of apartheid, which I mentioned previously. Whether this is a wise move or not, remains to be seen. At present, however, we are confronted with the decision of the Government that it is not prepared to grant increased subsidies for Coloured educational facilities. What are we to do in these circumstances. The Government has come forward with this measure to transfer the control of Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs, and we have the statement from the responsible Minister himself that if this change of control takes place, the Government will not continue to shirk its responsibility of meeting this ever-increasing task, and that it will not shift its responsibility on to others. In those circumstances I ask myself whether I would be right to take up an attitude in relation to this Bill which might do harm to the interests of the Coloured people. Is it not wiser, I ask myself, for us to try and obtain from the Government specific assurances with regard to the future educational facilities that they intend to make available to our Coloured people? It is quite obvious that the Government is determined to transfer Coloured education from the provinces. The very fact that they have come forward with this measure as a Government measure shows their determination to effect this transfer of control. In the interests of the Coloured people therefore, we have to obtain from the Government specific assurances which I believe are most essential in the interests of our Coloured people. I therefore want to move a further amendment asking the Government to give us those assurances which we regard essential before we can consent to the transfer of control. I move as a further amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House, whilst realizing the urgent need for the immediate improvement and advancement of Coloured education, declines to pass the second reading of the Coloured Persons Education Bill unless and until the Government gives the undertaking that Coloured education will be brought to a level equal and parallel to that of White education by, according to a planned programme&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) providing that there will be no curtailment or diminution in the standard of education;</li>

<li>(b) enforcing the principle of compulsory education for all Coloured children as expeditiously as possible;</li>

<li>(c) providing for a progressive extension of school hostel and transport facilities for Coloured children;</li>

<li>(d) implementing a uniform system of administration for all Coloured education. including Church and mission schools;</li>

<li>(f) providing for a progressive extension of avenues of employment for Coloured professional, administrative and clerical personnel in this new field of Coloured education.&#x201D;</li>

</ol>

<p>The assurances which we now ask, I suggest, are most reasonable. We regard them as essential and in the interest of our Coloured people.</p>

<p><span class="col_1939-1940" refersTo="page_0984"/>If the hon. Minister in the course of his reply is prepared to give us these assurances and have them placed on record he will do much to allay the fears and suspicions which exist in the minds of many people in regard to this measure.</p>

<p>Let us examine these assurances. My first request is that the Government assures us that in their programme there will be no curtailment or diminution in the standard of education. Surely the Government can have no other intent. Surely the Government intends to give our Coloured children the same and equal type of education which is given to our White children. Surely the hon. the Minister can unequivocally give us this assurance. I would remind the hon. the Minister of a request that was made in the form of a recommendation by the Inter Church Joint Committee on Coloured Education, where they said this (and the Dutch Reformed Church was a party to it)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We are opposed to any policy which might introduce a differentiation of policy and content of education and would press therefore that the education of Coloured children should remain a part of the general education policy.</block>

<p>I mention this to the hon. the Minister because I feel certain that he can unequivocally give us this assurance.</p>

<p>Secondly we ask that in the Minister&#x2019;s programme he will enforce the principle of compulsory education for all Coloured children as expeditiously as possible. We know that compulsory education for Coloured children cannot be brought in overnight. It would be an unreasonable request to ask for that. But even under our existing system compulsory education operates already in six areas, in towns like Alice, Simonstown, Kimberley, Cradock, King William&#x2019;s Town, and I think in the Keiskama. All we ask is that the hon. the Minister will say by way of an assurance to this House that principle will be extended as expeditiously as possible. I suggest that this is an assurance that the hon. Minister can also give without any hesitation.</p>

<p>We then ask that the hon. the Minister should give us an assurance that there will be a progressive extension of school hostel and transport facilities for our Coloured children. Is there anything unreasonable about that request? Surely the Government does not intend not to provide for an extension of these hostel facilities and transport facilities.</p>

<p>We also ask that there should be a uniform system of administration for all Coloured education, including the Church and mission schools. I suggest that there is nothing unreasonable in that request that this should be the policy of the Government.</p>

<p>Then we ask that there should be a progressive extension of avenues of employment for Coloured professional and administrative clerical personnel in this new field of Coloured education. Surely we are entitled to ask for that in the light of the statement made by the hon. the Prime Minister himself to the Coloured Council when he said that the transfer of this control to the Coloured Affairs Department would provide these additional avenues of employment for Coloured personnel.</p>

<p>Finally, we ask that there should be a progressive adjustment of the Coloured teachers&#x2019; salaries so as to bring them into line with the salaries of White teachers. Is there anything unreasonable in that request? These salary adjustments are long overdue. Surely under a sympathetic department the Coloured teachers are entitled to expect fairer treatment than they have received hitherto.</p>

<p>These assurances if given by the hon. the Minister in the course of his reply, will have the effect at least of establishing the Government&#x2019;s <i>bona fides.</i> If the hon. the Minister cannot see his way of giving these assurances, he cannot blame us if we come to the conclusion, and he cannot blame the outside world for coming to the conclusion, that this Bill is motivated by reasons other than the general welfare of the Coloured people. I have no doubt that the hon. the Minister will be in a position to give these assurances. I think in accordance with the promises that he and the Prime Minister have made to Coloured leaders, through the mouthpiece of the council, and in public statements that they have made from time to time, these assurances can well be given. I sincerely hope that the hon. the Minister will dispel any such belief and suspicion that exists in the minds of people and will give to this House these reasonable assurances which we ask for in this amendment. This is the least that we can expect in the interests of the people whose educational future we are determining to-day. I move the amendment.</p>

<speech by="#le_roux">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. S</person>:</from>

<p>I second the amendment. As the leader of our group has said, political considerations did not count with us. We considered this matter only in the light of what was in the interest of the Coloured population, and after having thought for a long time as to what would really be in the interests of the people whom I represent, I came to the conclusion that if the hon. the Minister can give me these assurances, which I know he has in his heart, then the people outside will be satisfied and I will be satisfied. But what was peculiar to me in connection with the whole matter was that when the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) spoke I almost changed my mind again. He told us here how Coloured education had expanded in the last ten years under the Nationalist Government. But surely that was under the provincial system! The hon. member was such a good advertisement for the provincial system that I really had to scratch my head and wonder whether I was not judging wrongly in the light of what he had said. He is an educationist and I am a layman.</p>

<p>I do not believe in beating about the bush and uttering sweet blandishments. The fact remains that in my humble way I regard the <span class="col_1941-1942" refersTo="page_0985"/>matter as follows: At the moment we have in the Republic five different systems of education for our Coloureds, and there are five S.G.E.s. Under the proposed scheme we will have only one man, one director. Talking about fragmentation, as the hon. member for South Coast (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) did, I think we have it at the moment, but in terms of this Bill we will put an end to fragmentation in so far as Coloured education is concerned. What makes me feel further that perhaps there is something really good in this transfer is that hon. members will remember that three or four years ago we had grave doubts when we started the separate university college for Coloureds, and two years before that we also had doubts when we discussed the separate technical and vocational training of Coloureds. We had doubts about all those things and made a great fuss about them. A few of us were bold enough to say that we thought it was in the interests and to the benefit of the Coloureds. To-night I am proud to be able to say that experience has proved that my judgment at that time was correct. Now there are also doubts again in respect of this new idea. Let me tell hon. members that a year ago 90 per cent of the Coloured teachers were opposed to it and did not want to know anything about it. But what is happening now? Now the hon. the Minister comes into this House, and the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) begins it, and they say: We no longer mind what anyone says, what the Coloured Council says, or what anybody else says, but next year we are going to take over Coloured education. Well, I know the Coloured man as well as I know myself. They struggled and made a rumpus. Now the Minister was clever. He appointed a Director of Coloured Education, a person of whom the Coloureds are fonder than of anybody else on account of sport. Long before he had anything to do with our education he was already popular with them. He went along and got acquainted with the teachers and, Mr. Speaker, he came to certain places where the teachers had said: If he comes here we will stone him; we want to have nothing to do with him. And they asked me: &#x201C;Mr. le Roux, what do you think we should do?&#x201D; I said: &#x201C;People, just listen to what he has to say and you need not do anything else.&#x201D; And almost without exception, in almost 99 per cent of cases, when that man left they cheered him! Now I again come to the conclusion which I mentioned in the beginning, that the Coloured teachers on the whole have really thrown in their lot with us to-day. They have no alternative. I am not saying that they could have done anything else. They are now throwing in their weight with us. and I cannot but say in all honesty that I think this thing will be a complete success. If this principle is accepted, we will have our Coloured education, from the youngest child right up to the university, all under one Department. There is no fragmentation. It will be under one Department throughout. And how many other branches of education will we not establish in future, whereas to-day nothing tangible has been done under the provincial system? Here we now have a Department which will devote its full attention to the Coloureds, and every day we see the various directions in which we should train these people, not with the idea of giving them inferior education, but of qualifying them better for life.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is no easy matter on which to decide. It was very difficult for us first to see what would really be in the interests of the people we represent. We then came to the conclusion that if we received these assurances we must accept it. Everything the Coloured feels in regard to his education is embodied in these few points mentioned in our amendment. If we can satisfy the Coloureds in regard to these matters they will go along with us 99 per cent, and then it cannot be anything else but a success. Then things will go well under this set-up. If we cannot satisfy them, there will be suspicion. As far as I personally am concerned, I do not think that the hon. the Minister is in any way dishonest or that/he has other motives in regard to this legislation. He wants to do what he feels is to the benefit of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Certain of the matters we mentioned here is of fundamental interest to the Coloureds. Take. e.g.. the question of compulsory education. The great majority of Coloureds feel that it is essential, but all of them are not in such a position that they can afford it. Do not think that every parent says: My child must go to school. In many cases the child cannot go to school because the parents cannot afford it. On the other hand again, if all the children are to be compelled to attend school say from their sixth year to their twelfth year or up to a specified standard, where will we at the moment find the necessary space for all these children? We cannot do it all in one day. But this Bill provides that the Minister can expand it as and when it becomes possible, and although it may take a long time I should like to have the assurance that the Minister really has this matter at heart and that he will apply it as we make progress. We should not exaggerate anything. We must understand the intellectual capacity of these people in the various areas, and their economic circumstances. It is a very complicated matter, but I think that with the necessary enthusiasm revealed by the Minister in regard to everything he tackles, he will do everything possible.</p>

<p>In this connection we deliberately mentioned the transport of Coloured children and the necessary hostel facilities. As far as this aspect of the matter is concerned, the position is that if we have compulsory education we will have no alternative but will have to bring the children to school. I mention this particularly because this is one of the sore points with <span class="col_1943-1944" refersTo="page_0986"/>the Coloureds to-day. You can go where you like in my constituency and throughout the country and the first reproach the Coloured makes is to tell you: &#x201C;Yes, my children must walk to school in the morning for four or five miles, or further, and then the bus carrying the White children goes by and even spatters them with mud.&#x201D; And that is true. We cannot get away from it. We shall simply have to do it. We talk about the provinces which have done their best. I do not deny that, but even in the six areas of the Cape Province where there is compulsory education to-day the children are not yet transported to school. That has been left in abeyance, and the time has arrived for us to show these people that our intentions are honourable. In one of the paragraphs we say that the standard of education should not be lowered. In that we include the existing facilities. The Coloured schools are operating under extremely difficult conditions. They do not have the facilities the White schools have, and their classes are almost twice as big as those in the White schools, with the result that the teachers cannot devote the necessary attention to the children in the way that the White teachers do. This position must be remedied.</p>

<p>Whilst talking about improved facilities, I want to say that we are in the peculiar position to-day that in the mission schools, where the children of the poorest section of the Coloured population receive education, the children have to pay for their books, whilst in the schools falling under the school boards, where one finds somewhat more well-to-do children, the child who cannot pay receives his books free. In Natal the position is that all the Coloured children receive their books free. I take it that the privilege enjoyed by Coloured children in Natal to-day will remain undisturbed. I must say that there are educationists from Natal who have requested me to ask that the privileges they enjoy are not taken away. I do not think that will be an insurmountable obstacle. The Minister is given so many powers in this Bill that he can do practically what he likes.</p>

<p>In regard to the provinces, we have had the position ever since 1910 that the provinces have looked after Coloured education to the best of their ability, but something which has grieved me all these years since I first began thinking about the matter is that the provinces never took the slightest trouble to try to train Coloureds for administrative posts. If one goes to Wale Street one will not find a single Coloured section in that building, except for the man who cleans the floors. I think our Department of Coloured Affairs will not take it amiss if we ask that Coloureds should be trained to do the administrative work themselves. Under the present set-up we have no Coloured inspectors of schools. Now hon. members should not think that I am of the opinion that one can find a Coloured teacher behind every bush to whom one can sav: &#x201C;You may become an inspector.&#x201D; That is not so. There are relatively few of them. But the province has had quite a few years during which they could find individuals to show their good faith and to say: We will appoint these people to a few of the higher posts. There was nothing to prevent them from doing so, except that the spirit and the willingness were missing. Now I know that under the present Minister that will be there, and although I am now unfortunately opposed to the Government&#x2019;s policy, I cannot help myself now. I must simply agree with it in so far as that is concerned, because I honestly think that this proposed legislation, if it is implemented correctly, and if the assurances for which we ask are given, is a sound piece of work, even though we cannot do everything at once, and I think it will do much towards promoting the future happiness and prosperity of our Coloureds.</p>

<p>*Mr. S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;: I want to congratulate the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux) and the other Coloured Representatives on the attitude which they have adopted this evening in regard to this very important matter.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#holland">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOLLAND</person>:</from>

<p>Please do not try to make political capital of it.</p>

<p>*Mr. S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;: I want to congratulate the Coloured Representatives on allowing the best interests of the Coloureds to weigh most heavily with them and not trying to make political capital out of this matter, as the Opposition tried to do. In the course of my speech I shall refer to practically all the claims, all the conditions which the Coloured Representatives put forward in their amendment. I want to refer to what the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) said. He tried to suggest a very simple solution to the financial problem created in the Cape by Coloured education, just as the hon. member for South Coast tried to do, and that is simply that the Central Government must make more money available. It is not as easy and as simple as hon. members try to suggest. I can assure them that the Cape has been struggling with this problem for decades and that the solution to the problem is not yet in sight. That is why in my speech I want to deal chiefly with the expenditure aspect of this matter, and right at the start, without repeating myself, I want to say that the source of my statistical information has been mainly the Interim Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Financial Relations between the Central Government and Provinces. One of the points made in that report on which I want to dwell for a moment is that there will be a considerable increase in expenditure in connection with Coloured education in the immediate future whether it stays under the provinces or is taken over by the Department of Coloured Affairs. It is estimated that within the next ten years expenditure in connection with Coloured education will double and that by 1970 it will amount to about R46,000,0000 per annum. Various reasons can be advanced for this fact. The first and most important reason is the natural increase in the number of Coloured children of <span class="col_1945-1946" refersTo="page_0987"/>school-going age. If we note the tendency during the past ten years, we see that the increase in the number of Coloured pupils in the Republic has been 42.7 per cent as against an increase of 29.1 per cent in the number of White pupils. The increase in the number of Coloured pupils has been 39.2 per cent as against only 15.6 per cent in the number of Whites. On the one hand this is due to the fact that the Coloured population is increasing more rapidly than the White population. Over the past ten years the increase in the Coloured population in the Republic has been 34.9 per cent as against an increase of 16.1 per cent in the White population. The increase in the Coloured population in the Cape over the same period has been 33.9 per cent as against 6.7 per cent in the case of the Whites. But on the other hand this is also due to the fact that there is a considerable reserve of Coloured children of school-going age who as a result of the non-compulsory school attendance are continually finding their way to schools. It is estimated that there were about 54,200 of these children in 1960. We also have the right to conclude that Coloured education will increase considerably in the immediate future because the cost of Coloured education over the past ten years has risen by no less than 158.4 per cent and under normal circumstances will continue to increase at the rate of about 7.7 per cent a year. Then there are requests for better and more school accommodation and hostel facilities and better educational facilities, and this will of necessity increase expenditure. We also have the constant request for the introduction of compulsory education on a complete or gradual basis. There is the question of increased salaries for Coloured teachers which is receiving attention and this too will result in additional expenditure. There is also an increasing demand for the taking over of church schools by the authorities, which would also increase expenditure. Moreover, there has been a tendency over the past years for the Coloureds to give preference to departmental schools instead of church schools for the reason mentioned by the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux), and between 1950 and 1961,17,000 more pupils were enrolled in departmental schools than in church schools.</p>

<p>The swift rate at which the Coloured group areas policy is being implemented will also have an important effect on the cost structure of Coloured education in the immediate future. Take the school board area of Parow which is particularly affected by the implementation of the group areas policy. Notwithstanding the fantastic scale on which Coloured schools are being built there, double-shift classes are being held there this year in no fewer than 49 Coloured schools. This gives us an idea of what the requirements are going to be in the future. The introduction of a system of differentiated education for which there is a great need on the part of the Coloured people and the additional provision that will have to be made for technical and other education, will result in an increase in capital expenditure in connection with Coloured education.</p>

<p>I have mentioned all these things deliberately in order to put it to you, Sir, that <i>if it</i> can be said that the Cape has reached the <i>stage</i> where it can no longer bear the burden of Coloured education, then it is high time, bearing in mind the foreseeable increase in expenditure, that Coloured education should be taken away from the provinces. The provinces, and particularly the Whites in the Cape, will not benefit much by the taking over of Coloured education in that 90 per cent of the schools, 84.4 per cent of the teachers and 86.3 per cent of the pupils are here in the Cape. Let us this evening record our thanks and appreciation to the provinces, and particularly to the Cape which has done most of this work, for the manner in which they have performed their task in respect of Coloured education in the past. The Cape has succeeded in achieving two main ends under difficult circumstances. With the means at its disposal it has given the maximum service to Coloured education. In 1961 the Cape&#x2019;s unit cost per Coloured pupil was 40 per cent as against 51.8 per cent in the Transvaal and 50.3 per cent in Natal. And because the Cape has succeeded in keeping the unit cost so low, it has been able to educate so many more Coloured children. But on the other hand the Cape has succeeded, with the means at its disposal, in doing justice to the White child. Indeed, over the past nine years, the unit cost in respect of White children has riven by 65.2 per cent as against 59.6 per cent for Coloured children.</p>

<p>On this occasion we must also acknowledge the role played by church schools in the education pattern of the Coloureds, particularly in the Cape but also in the other provinces. 1,257 of the 1,456 Coloured schools in the Cape were church schools; 5,808 of the 8,499 teachers were in the church schools; 196,690 of the 383,770 students were in church schools, and the vast majority of them were in schools of the D.R. Church. There is an increasing need and desire for these church schools to be taken over eventually by the State. Machinery is also being created in this measure to make provision for the possibility of the eventual taking over of these schools through the medium of negotiation. But I want to ask the church never to lose its interest in Coloured education. The church will always have a task to perform in respect of Coloured education, even if these church schools are taken over by the State in the near or distant future. The most important contribution that the church will be able to make in respect of Coloured education in the future will be to make available more hostels and boarding facilities for Coloured children because there is a great need for these facilities.</p>

<p>No one will deny that over the years Coloured education has been a burden which has fallen particularly heavily on the Cape. This has resulted in discrimination against the taxpayer of the Cape, and notwithstanding this fact the increase in the province&#x2019;s expenditure <span class="col_1947-1948" refersTo="page_0988"/>on education&#x2014;an average of 5.2 per cent over eight years up to 1960-1&#x2014;has not kept pace with the increase in the average general expenditure of the province amounting to 8.3 per cent. Education has therefore been cut and pruned at the expense of the inhabitants of the Cape.</p>

<p>The question may quite rightly be asked: How will the Cape benefit by the taking over of Coloured education? It is estimated that on the present subsidy basis the Cape&#x2019;s net expenditure will be reduced by R8,000,000 per annum, which will mean that at this rate its net expenditure in 1970-1 will be R17,500,000 less than would have been the case had the province retained Coloured education. Having regard to the fact that the indirect expenditure of the Cape in connection with Coloured education, that is to say, its inspectorate and administrative expenses, will not be reduced to any great extent at the start, it is estimated that by 1964-5 the Cape will be receiving R 11,246,000 less in State subsidies but that, by that time, with the loss of Coloured education which by then will amount to R22,480,000, the Cape will show an annual saving of more than R 11,000,000. The result of this will be whereas the Whites pay 90 per cent of the taxation in the Cape, the province will be able to spend more on White education and on other necessary services on which savings were effected in the past because as much as 20 per cent of the province&#x2019;s expenditure was devoted to Coloured education.</p>

<p>On the other hand the question also arises: What is in store for the Department of Coloured Affairs in taking over Coloured education? We have no illusions in that regard. There will be problems&#x2014;for example, obtaining the necessary staff with the requisite standard of ability and knowledge and experience. There will be other problems with far-reaching financial implications which will have to be overcome. There are apparently people like the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg), who are rather enthusiastic about the taking over of Coloured education by the Department of Coloured Affairs because in this they see the realization of their ideals in connection with Coloured education. There is, for example, the Council for Coloured Affairs, which is a responsible body. In supporting the transfer of Coloured education they also ask for a uniform educational policy throughout the Republic, equal standards with White schools, compulsory education, parallel-medium schools and the taking over of all mission schools by the Department. Although we believe that the transfer of Coloured education to the Department will be very beneficial to the Coloured community in many respects, we realize that some of the demands which are being made are very high, excessively high, and that for the present at least they are unrealistic. Take for example a question like the institution of a system of compulsory education. In my opinion this system with the best will in the world cannot be instituted at this stage. The Coloured Representatives do not advocate this either, but there are other people who think that it should be done. We cannot institute this system immediately under the present circumstances. What is more, in large parts of the Cape, as the hon. member for Karoo indicated, it is not practicable at this stage. The socio-economic conditions of the Coloureds, particularly in the lowest strata, must first be considerably improved before compulsory education can be carried out in practice. The Cape Provincial Council adopted a resolution in 1945 giving school boards the right to ask that education be made compulsory for Coloured children between the ages of seven and 14 years, with the proviso that no Coloured child could be compelled to attend school if he lived further than a radius of three miles from the school. What was the result? That resolution was adopted in 1945. to-day there are five or six insignificant little places where this system has been introduced, as the hon. member for Peninsula indicated. The fact that the Cape School Board has not yet found it possible to introduce a system of compulsory education in the Peninsula should prove conclusively to hon. members that this system is not practicable at this stage. The provision of transport and hostel facilities is a most important factor in the institution of a system of compulsory education. The 1956 report on Coloured education emphasizes the fact that the provision of hostel facilities is the most important requirement in connection with Coloured education. In the Cape there are only seven private hostels at the moment which accommodate about 581 student teachers and secondary pupils and they exist chiefly as the result of a general rental allowance from the Department. They simply could not exist otherwise.</p>

<p>Apart from these stumbling-blocks which I have already mentioned, it is estimated that a system of compulsory education will bring about an increase in the expenditure in respect of Coloured education of R2,285,000 per annum in 1965-6 and R3,778,000 by 1970-1. There will be an increase of R1, 178,000 in capital expenditure now and of R3,238,000 by 1970-1. But I think it is unnecessary to be in too much of a hurry to make education compulsory. The urge for education on the part of the Coloureds is such that without making education compulsory the percentage of enrolments of Coloured scholars in relation to the population in the age group six to 14 years rose from 79.3 per cent in 1950-1 to 86.8 per cent in 1960-1 and it is estimated that this figure will rise to 91 per cent in 1964-5 and to 93 per cent in 1970-1 &#x2014;and that is the position under normal circumstances, without compulsion.</p>

<p>If we have a higher socio-economic standard of living with better educational facilities, with better transport and hostel facilities, I predict that within ten years the number of Coloured children not at school will shrink to an absolutely insignificant percentage. But I think, too, that the question of compulsory education is one of the matters which can most fruitfully be referred to the Coloured Education Advisory Council which is to be established. Secondly, the question of the taking <span class="col_1949-1950" refersTo="page_0989"/>over of the Church schools has been mentioned. As has been stated, this Bill opens the door for negotiations in connection with the taking over of these schools. This will result in very heavy capital expenditure which at this stage must be carefully considered. While strong support is forthcoming on all sides for the taking over of the schools and while the desirability of such action is strongly emphasized, there have always been Churches in the past and there are still Churches to-day which are very strongly opposed to the taking over of Coloured education by the State, particularly the Churches which had benefited considerably financially by the generous subsidies and rental allowances which they had received from the Department of Education. There is no doubt that this transfer will eventually be proceeded with.</p>

<p>But that is not all that is anticipated. Now that the transfer of Coloured education to the Department of Coloured Affairs has become an accomplished fact, there is a very strong feeling that there should be a drastic increase in the salaries of Coloured teachers. Some people even advocate and agitate for equal salaries with White teachers. In this regard too we must be realistic. At the moment the salaries of Coloured teachers are 72.1 per cent of those of White teachers. If they are to be paid the same as the White teachers, it will mean an immediate increase in expenditure of R5,000,000 per annum; and by 1970-1 this increase will amount to about R7,000,000 per annum. But if a more realistic increase of 2.5 per cent per annum is effected up to a maximum of 80 per cent of the salaries of White teachers, the additional expenditure will amount to RI, 678.000 at the moment and to R2,800,000 in 1970-1. This means that the current cost of Coloured education, excluding capital expenditure which in the normal course of events would have increased from R20,518,000 in 1961-2 to R41,306,000 in 1970-1, will amount to R44,144,000 in 1970-1 with an increase of 80 per cent in the salaries, and this without making education compulsory. If education is made compulsory, it will mean an additional R3,700,000. After investigating this cost aspect properly, one asks oneself: What will be the lot of the Cape in five or ten years&#x2019; time if it still has Coloured education debited to its account at that stage? It is very clear from enquiries that for the next ten years the Whites will still have to bear most of the responsibility for Coloured education. The Cape is not only responsible for the Coloureds and therefore it is necessary for Coloured education to be taken over by a State Department so that the expense in this connection can be distributed on a national basis.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that apart from the purely financial consideration in a matter such as this, there are also important and broader educational, social, political and other miscellaneous aspects which merit consideration. In its report, the Cape Commission on Coloured Education. 1953-6. stated as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The purpose of education ought to be to build up a happy, useful and productive Coloured community which will live its life to the full in general society.</block>

<p>One of the basic problems which we have to consider is the fact that the Coloured people are not a homogeneous group. On the contrary, the community shows great mutual differences. There is a small number of Coloureds who have risen above the masses. Most of the people in this group are teachers who owe their progress in life to parallel development If it were not for the fact that the education of Coloured children was reserved for Coloured teachers, many of the more than 10,000 Coloured teachers would not be able to compete with the Whites. It is tragic to think that many of these Coloureds who have risen above the masses are continually trying to be acknowledged as Whites; that in their striving they try to escape their own people and in this way leave the Coloured masses to their fate. In contrast to this there is the National Government with its policy of socio-economic development which envisages the upliftment of the masses of the Coloureds in order to afford everyone wanting to help himself an opportunity to progress in life. As in the case of Coloured teachers who would not be able to compete with the Whites if they were not protected in their profession, so the Coloureds find it very difficult, if not impossible, to compete on the open market with the Whites in every sphere of society. The Coloureds are now receiving the opportunity to progress to the highest levels in every sphere of life in their own group areas or rural areas. The demand for well-trained, reliable and hardworking manpower is increasing daily in these areas and the Coloured himself feels that he is not capable of performing many of the tasks which are available to him because he has not received the necessary training. Many of them have had little schooling; some have not been to school at all and some have only attended school for a year or two. As is the case with other groups of the population, they do not all have the same talent. If we want to concentrate their education upon giving each one the opportunity for full development, we must give more attention to adult education, practical education and more vocational training. Therefore it is necessary and in the interests of Coloured education for Coloured education as a whole to be planned within that same complex. That is why it is also necessary to put an end to the divided control of Coloured education and to place it under the same control&#x2014;under the control of the Department of Coloured Affairs.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I reply to the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;), I want to say a word or two about the remarks made about the absent member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker). He gave us a long talk which was almost a travelogue about what was happening in other parts of the world. One of the most important things he said was <span class="col_1951-1952" refersTo="page_0990"/>the comparison of the state of education and development of the Indians and Coloureds in South Africa as compared with the Indians in India. He gave us some facts and figures and compared it with the populations of that country. If there was ever a reason for education to remain in the hands of the provinces it was his argument. He told us that development had taken place in South Africa at such a rapid rate and so economically and so efficiently that it far surpassed the education of Coloured people in any other part of the world. So how he could stand up here and argue against us on this side when we say we want education to remain in the hands of the provinces, is beyond my comprehension. The rest of his speech was boring and tedious, and if I ever thought that Members of Parliament earned their money it was while listening to him to-night.</p>

<p>Then we come to the hon. member for Karoo (Mr. G. S. P. le Roux), who seconded his leader&#x2019;s amendment. Why, I do not know. What he said in seconding that amendment is something we will perhaps hear about later, but I do say this, that he should have sat down after his first few remarks when he said that he agreed wholeheartedly with the efforts of the Minister.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I am not doubting the hon. member&#x2019;s honesty, but what I am doubting is his method of approach to this subject. If he wanted to approach the subject in the manner in which he did, he had no right to second the amendment of his leader.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow has given us an interesting talk this evening. He told us what it is going to cost the Government, and what it has cost the province, and what it may cost the province in the future to educate the Coloureds. He did not say, and he did not give any reason at all, why we should have this changeover. What it is going to cost the country for Coloured education it will cost the country whether it comes out of the pockets of of the Government or out of the pockets of the provinces. We have in our provinces machinery which has been built up over many years, which is efficient and which has done its job excellently and which we should keep going. We should go out of our way to ensure that the machinery the provinces have, should not be altered. This is a movement towards an erosion of the powers of the provinces. When we talk about fragmentation let us say that it is not only the division of education in the provinces, it is not only the taking away of education from the provinces and giving it to some central body, but it is a step for the taking away of the Coloured people, whom we on this side want to take with us along the road of the future South Africa, and hon. members, led by their Minister, see danger in that. Why I do not know. The fragmentation is that of those people who wish to be associated with the Western way of life in South Africa. We on this side depend and will continue to depend to a great extent on the abilities and the help of the Coloured people. We must do everything in our power to ensure that those people remain with us. I cannot see good in this move of the Minister in taking away education, which is the key-stone of progress, from the provinces and giving it to the Coloured Affairs Department which will, I am sure, put these Coloured people on a way of their own and take them away from the road we on this side want to follow.</p>

<p>What is there that has been promised by the Minister which the provinces cannot carry out? Is there any single aspect which he in his second-reading speech or which the hon. member for Peninsula has put down in his amendment, that cannot be carried out more efficiently and quicker by the provinces than by the new organization which will be set up.</p>
