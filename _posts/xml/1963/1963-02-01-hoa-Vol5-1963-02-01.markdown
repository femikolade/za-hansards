<from>Capt. HENWOOD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of the Interior&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether there is any delay in the issuing of identity cards; if so, (a) what is the reason for the delay and (b) what is the average delay from the date of receipt of the application to the date of issue of the identity card;</li>

<li>(2) whether his Department has received complaints in regard to replies from the Department to applications for identity cards; if so, what is the nature of the complaints; and</li>

<li><span class="col_613-614" refersTo="page_0321"/>(3) how many identity cards in each race group are still outstanding in respect of persons who (a) have and (b) have not applied for cards.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_the_interior" to="#henwood">

<from>The MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes. (a) The Department was inundated by the exceptionally large number of late applications for identity cards, (b) Approximately three weeks at present.</li>

<li>(2) Yes. A few applicants complained that their identity cards were not issued as expeditiously as they would have desired them to be issued.</li>

<li>(3) No reliable statistics are available. Because of the presence of various unknown factors it is not possible to give a fair estimate of the number of identity cards still to be issued. It is, for instance, not known how many persons to whom identity cards have been issued, are no longer in possession thereof because the cards have been lost or destroyed. Many of these persons have again applied for identity cards whereupon new cards have been issued to them. It is also not known how many of the persons who have died or who have left the country since the first issue of identity cards, were in possession of identity cards at the time of their death or at the date of their departure. Because particulars in this regard are unknown, it is not possible to estimate the number of persons to whom identity cards must still be issued.<br/>I wish to add that, in view thereof that it is an impossible task to deal before 2 February 1963 with all the applications for identity cards which are now coming in, administrative arrangements are being made not to take any steps in terms of the Population Registration Act, 1950, against such persons until such time as they are furnished with their identity cards.</li>

</answer>

<question by="#henwood" to="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>Capt. HENWOOD</from>

<p>Arising out of the Minister's reply, the Minister says that it is not known how many people died. Surely in the Population Register the names of those who died are struck out.</p>

<answer by="#minister_of_the_interior" to="#henwood">

<from>The MINISTER OF THE INERIOR:</from>

<p>The difficulty is that one does not know how many of those who died were supplied with identity cards.</p>

<from>The MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE:</from>

<p>No, because it is not a function of my Department. The South African Association for the Advancement of Science, which receives a State subsidy, has convened a conference for 25 April 1963 where all the scientific implications of the Orange River Irrigation Scheme, including the preservation of prehistoric remains of archaeological interest, will be discussed by experts. Apart from this the Director of the National Museum, Bloemfontein, has applied to the C.S.I.R. for a grant to make a preliminary survey. He envisages discussions with all persons interested to elaborate a master plan and to obtain the co-operation of teams of experts in the different fields. The hon. member sees therefore that the entire matter is receiving the necessary attention.</p>

<block name="quote">That, in view of the rising costs of medical services and of medicines, this House expresses its thanks to the Government for its timeous and positive action in&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(i) instituting a thorough investigation into the factors causing these rising costsand the manner in which they can be combated; and</li>

<li>(ii) finding the most effective methods by which medical aid and provident <span class="col_635-636" refersTo="page_0332"/>schemes can help to lower these costs for the public,</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">and requests the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the recommendations made as a result of such investigations and aimed at achieving the desired objects, be speedily implemented.</block>

<p>At the outset let me express well-merited thanks and appreciation to the Government and the hon. the Minister for the attention they have given to, and the interest they have shown in this matter for appointing the Snyman Commission and also for the preference which has been given to this motion. It is quite clear that they consider it to be very important. I particularly want to tell the hon. the Minister that not only we but all those concerned in this matter are very impressed by the fact that he is sympathetically disposed towards this question and that he has been very active and diligent in this regard. I also want to tell him that since he has taken over this portfolio there has not been the slightest doubt that we have made very good progress in respect of health services in our country.</p>

<p>I am particularly pleased that we have already progressed so far. I spoke about this matter 10 years ago from the back benches, and on various occasions thereafter, and in 1957 I specifically asked for the appointment of this commission. My motives have always been the same, namely, that where in the past the patient or his next-of-kin paid the full costs of his illness in the form of a moderate amount to the family doctor, the seriously-ill patient to-day receives accounts from various quarters, from the hospital, his family doctor, from one or more specialists, from the laboratory, from the chemist, for the services of trained nurses, for radiological examinations and so forth. Every account represents a unique contribution towards his recovery, but the fact of the matter is that the financial burden of paying all these accounts has in the normal course of events become too heavy for the ordinary individual. The whole intention of this inquiry and also of the Government is to relieve this burden. It is the intention of the Government to put the recommendations of the Snyman Report into operation in such a way that we will achieve this aim.</p>

<p>As far as the Snyman Commission is concerned I want to congratulate and thank not only the Chairman, Professor Snyman, but every member of the commission for the valuable work they have done and the mass of information they have made available to us. Very hard work and study has gone into this matter. We also want to thank them for the positive recommendations which they have made. I want to say for the information of the House that this commission was appointed on 30 December 1959, and reported in the second half of last year. The commission was therefore busy with its inquiry for a full 18 months. I want to emphasize the fact that all those interested in this matter knew about it. It was publicized in the Press and over the radio and all interested parties, including the public in general, were invited to give evidence. In the second place, particular groups were specifically invited to give evidence. In the third place, this commission visited various centres in the Republic. There can therefore be no doubt that everyone had ample opportunity to put his views to this commission.</p>

<p>I think that it is also necessary for me to say at the outset that I am particularly grateful that this is not a party political matter. We cannot permit the health of our people to become a party political question. I have unshakeable confidence in the fact that not only each member of this House but everyone outside will give his full support to maintain this sound position. In the light of this and also in the light of the fact that this is a private motion I want to say very clearly that I am speaking for myself. The conclusion which I draw is my own with this qualification: I fully agree with and support these important principles which have been accepted by the Government, principles which I and others have advocated for the past 14 years. I make this statement unreservedly.</p>

<p>I also want to thank the hon. member for Odendalsrus (Dr. Meyer) in advance for having agreed to second this motion. He is not only a respected member of this House but, Mr. Speaker, he is highly thought of ip medical circles. That is why I feel privileged that he is willing to second this motion. I and all who have to deal with this matter are fully aware of the fact that confusion and uncertainty exists in the country in regard to what is actually going to happen in regard to health services. Let me state very clearly that no real reason at all exists for concern and a lack of confidence. You can be assured, Mr. Speaker, that there is no secret plan or sinister intent. On the contrary, the whole purpose of the Government is to safeguard the reasonable interests and requirements of all interested parties and to strengthen them in the future. Therefore I also want to express the hope that this discussion will assist in removing misunderstanding, ignorance and the unnecessary suspicion which exists, so that everyone will assist in making a success of this great undertaking with the greatest measure of goodwill.</p>

<p>I do not want to start with a parrot-like eulogy of the Snyman Report, although I agree with most of their views, but I want to start with one point in the Snyman Report which I think is a pity and which I feel is unfortunate. Surgeons, obstetricians and gynaecologists are the particular scapegoats mentioned in the report. I think that is a pity. It detracts from what is otherwise mainly a very comprehensive report. I always welcome frankness, on the part of a commission as well, but the specific findings in respect of surgeons, obstetricians and gynaecologists can only refer to individual members of the aforementioned groups. I consider it to be unfair; individual members of all branches of the medical profession do sometimes err as is the case in <span class="col_637-638" refersTo="page_0333"/>any other profession. I think it was unnecessary to pick on them. What has happened? In their hunt for sensation, and perhaps for other reasons, good reasons too because they simply do not have the space to do justice to a report of this nature, both the Afrikaans and English medium newspapers have grasped at this one fact and created the impression throughout the country that this has been the most important finding of the commission. I must say, space or no space, I take it amiss of the newspapers for having caused this harm and unnecessary antipathy by their report.</p>

<p>I want to mention another point and that is in respect of the wording of this motion. The original request which led to the appointment of this commission, the popular name which the Snyman Commission was then given, as well as the wording of this motion, is somewhat misleading. This motion refers to the rising costs of medical services and medicines. It is therefore misleading because many factors are involved in the health services which are performed in the country. On page 7 the commission states [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It was not merely the problem of the individual with his high expenses, but of the community as a whole. It was not only in respect of the services of doctors but of all the supplementary services in medical care. It was not only the relations between the patient and the doctor but also the participation and contribution of authority in the general picture.</block>

<p>That is why I say the wording is somewhat misleading. It is also somewhat misleading because it has appeared very clearly from this report that of the total expenditure spent on health services, hospitalization amounts to 50 per cent, medical and dental services amount to 20 per cent and medicines to slightly less than 10 per cent, while sundries make up the rest. In respect of foreign countries, the commission&#x2019;s findings was as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The general impression gained &#x2026;</block>

<p>this is referring to foreign countries&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; of the various countries is that hospital expenses comprise on the average about 50 per cent of the total and in recent years have increased out of all proportion to the rising cost of living.</block>

<p>The commission found further [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That expenditure on doctors comprised on the average about 20 per cent of the total and was a fairly consistent item.</block>

<p>One gains the impression therefore that the emphasis was wrongly placed upon the rising costs of medical services and of medicines and that hospitalization was actually the highest factor. The commission came to this conclusion. They say the following [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The recent rise in the total cost of the services is in the first place due to an increase in hospitalization costs.</block>

<p>I do not want to discuss this but I think that the obligations rest very heavily upon the provincial authorities to give careful attention to the finding of this commission.</p>

<p>A further interesting point, Mr. Speaker, is that the total cost of health services is not disproportionately high. The total expenditure in respect of health services amounts to from 4 per cent to 6 per cent of the national income. The commission found as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The commission finds from this general picture that compared with other countries as well as compared with specific other items, the expenditure of authorities and personal expenditure on medical services cannot be regarded as being extraordinarily heavy.</block>

<p>It is interesting to note further that the increase over the past years has not been out of proportion to the rise in the cost of living in other spheres. I want to give a few examples. If we take the year 1951 as compared with the year 1959 and we take 100 as the yardstick, we find that in 1951 personal care and health was 100 and in 1959 it was 193, an increase of 93. Food rose to 170; fuel and light to 190; transport and communications to 205. We see therefore that the cost of health services did not rise disproportionately. I do not think that one can leave it there because it may be misleading. The figures I have just given are spread over the entire population. Our problem&#x2014;and that problem remains&#x2014;is that although these figures may sound good, the practical situation is that at a given time the individual has to pay a large account and this becomes a great burden to him. I must also say that one has to be reasonable and that progress in medicine must of necessity cause increased expenditure. If the community does not want to be deprived of the benefit of this progress, these rising costs will have to be met. The increase will therefore continue. In this connection the report states [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reasons for more expensive medical care are so inherently linked to the standard as well as the scope of the services, that they will to a large extent continue in the further development of medicine. The conclusion is therefore that total medical expenses will remain high and will rise even higher.</block>

<p>It ought therefore to be clear to all that no one must have the illusion that we are dealing here with a cheaper medical service but that an attempt is simply being made to give each one an opportunity of being insured against heavy expenses and secondly, to keep the rising costs as low as possible. We must realize this very clearly.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I feel compelled to emphasize the next point strongly also and that is that <span class="col_639-640" refersTo="page_0334"/>we are not dealing here with a State medical service. I personally feel that a State medical service is a bad thing which we should not even discuss. I am also pleased to say that it is not the policy of the Government to establish a State medical service and the hon. the Minister of Health stated very clearly in this House last year that he was opposed to it. On page 106 of their report the Snyman Commission also states that it disapproves of a State medical service. In my opinion none of their recommendations embodies the establishment of a State medical service. If it were ever to develop in that way, or if it ever does develop in that direction, I want to say positively that I will oppose it most strongly. In contrast to a State medical service we have had a spontaneous development in South Africa in respect of the approach towards public health. I want to give the House a few figures. In private hospitals 80 per cent of the patients were private patients in 1950 and only 20 per cent belonged to sick funds. Ten years later, in 1960, the picture was reversed. Then 20 per cent were private patients and 80 per cent were sick fund patients. We have to deal here therefore with a spontaneous development of health insurance which is not, ought not and will not be administered by the State nor will it be financed by the State. The State will only act as co-ordinator to bring about uniformity and, where necessary, as mediator. I think that it ends there. The aim therefore is eventually to have everyone covered by health insurance. That is the aim of the State, as the hon. the Minister stated. As an ideal it is right and a good thing but I think in practice &#x2014;and this is my considered opinion&#x2014;there will always be a section, let us say <b>25 per cent,</b> of the public who do not belong to sick funds. I base this standpoint on the experience of countries like Holland and other countries where they have had social medical services for many years and still find that 25 per cent of the patients are private patients. I want to add that I think that if we can reach the stage where 75 per cent of our people belong to sick funds we will already have completed a very great task and then the intentions of the Government and the hard work of the hon. the Minister will have been fully rewarded.</p>

<p>In this connection I also want to say that it would do a great deal of harm&#x2014;and I know that this is not the intention&#x2014;if these aims were to be achieved by compelling people to belong to sick funds. I refer now to an obligation which has been imposed by the Government. The conditions of service in certain private organizations are another matter completely.</p>

<p>In order eventually to achieve this global object, there are two things which in my opinion must be done and must be done fairly soon. The first is to give statutory power to a central board for medical schemes and in the second place to establish a board of control over medicines. I think that that principle is right and we must do so. In the implementation of its duties this board will have to deal with certain aspects and I think that it is as well for us to discuss a few of these aspects briefly. The first is the question of the level of income. The question arises whether a restriction must be imposed in respect of the income of the person when he is considered for membership of a sick fund. What is the present position? The present position is that the Medical Association has drawn up a preferential tariff, a tariff which is slightly lower than the usual private fee, but that preferential tariff is only applied to persons earning R4,600 and less per annum. Anyone earning more than that cannot belong to a fund and make use of this preferential tariff. Let me tell you that there is a history behind this matter. It may appear wrong&#x2014;I am coming to it&#x2014;but the Medical Association made this preferential tariff concession at the time with the specific purpose of assisting only those persons in the lower income groups. That was why they were prepared to do it and not include others having higher incomes. I want to say that I do not agree in principle with the present position, and I do not think that it should continue in this way. My standpoint is that everyone should be able to be members of a sick fund, irrespective of income, as is the case with other insurances. I also think that that is the aim of the Government. I want to give an example. The owners of large factories, large-scale employers with many employees from the nature of the case have large incomes, but they subsidize their sick funds to the extent of 33&#x2153; per cent and sometimes 50 per cent. The manufacturer subsidizes his employee&#x2019;s sick fund but because he is earning a higher salary he himself may not belong to that fund. I think that that is unfair. We must of course also consider the doctors. This concession was made specifically with the purpose of helping the lower income groups and I feel that the tariffs which are fixed in the future, when everyone belongs to a sick fund, must not have as their basis the fact that a person has a reasonably low income, but that that preferential tariff should be determined on the sole principle that the doctor has the benefit of avoiding bad debts in that his accounts are paid in full.</p>

<p>The second point is the position of individual members. The position to-day is that individual members cannot become members of sick funds or obtain insurance. I myself for example would very much like to insure myself and my family, but as an individual I cannot do so because of a request from the Medical Association. I want to express the hope that this position will also be changed. In saying this, however, I want to make it very clear that from the nature of the case it must be so arranged that there will then be more than one premium payment, or whatever the case may be, because one cannot treat an individual on the same basis as one would a large group scheme. I feel that the principle that the individual should also have this opportunity must certainly be adopted. The idea is to take only three groups into account in fixing premiums, namely, the individual, the individual with one dependant and the individual <span class="col_641-642" refersTo="page_0335"/>with one or more dependants on the basis of 1:2:2&#x00BD;<i>,</i> or something of that nature. I do not want to elaborate in this regard, but with a view to what I said just now about the individual and with a view to the fact that old people must also certainly be covered, and also as a result of the experience of many sick funds and of some insurance companies, I take the liberty of emphasizing the fact that this matter should receive careful attention and should perhaps be reconsidered. From the nature of the case it is not a matter of principle, and therefore I take the liberty of making this request. I hope that careful consideration will be given to this matter.</p>

<p>There are two matters about which I feel very strongly and I do not think that anyone will disagree with me in this regard. The first is that if we want to avoid a State medical service, if we want to keep the relationship between patient and doctor on as high a plane as possible, if we wish to create a sense of responsibility on the part of the patient as well as to have quality service on the part of the doctor, we must at all costs ensure that in connection with all sick funds a free choice of doctor and dentist must be retained. That to my mind is a basic principle. The second point is that the cover in respect of the patient must be as wide as possible. I am referring to hospital expenses, doctors&#x2019; fees, dental expenses and all supplementary medical services. They must be as wide as possible. This can only be achieved if there is a register of sick funds which lays down minimum requirements and effects uniformity. For this reason a registrar of sick funds must be appointed. I do not know precisely what the position of insurance companies will be but it is very clear that a fund as such must be registered. Whether this must or can apply to insurance companies dealing only in insurance is another matter. This is a particular point which must be discussed. But when I advocate uniformity I do not want to create a misunderstanding. By this I mean one type of insurance. I am convinced that the circumstances and the requirements of our country, of individuals, of certain employers and employees, of old people and all these things, will result in there perhaps having to be more than one type of insurance and of benefits, on condition that the basic principles are not affected. That is also a matter of detail.</p>

<p>The next point is the fixing of fees, and I refer here particularly to the fixing of fees for doctors and dentists, but I want first of all only to speak about the fixing of fees in regard to sick funds and not private fees. When any fee is paid, the basic attitude is that it is a matter between the patient and the doctor or the patient and the representative of the medical profession or the dental profession. But we cannot allow disputes, the fact that they cannot reach agreement, perhaps because of unreasonable demands on one or the other side, to hamper or impede this great development of health insurance for everyone. That is why it is necessary for the State to act as mediator and it appears to me that in the event of a dispute the Central Board for Sick Funds will eventually itself have to decide, with perhaps an appeal to the Minister, but this is also a matter of detail which can be decided later. One has to be practical in this regard and the only practical manner is for people to negotiate. But eventually somebody must decide and in my opinion the statutory board is the board to fulfil that function. If anybody has a better idea I shall welcome it, but at the moment I cannot think of anything better.</p>

<p>In respect of private fees my humble opinion is that it is unnecessary and undesirable to want to fix those fees, and I will give you my reasons. When all have the opportunity of belonging to sick funds, and persons still prefer&#x2014;they may form 25 per cent of the people&#x2014;not to join and not to make use of the benefits, but to be private patients for reasons of their own, then it is not necessary to fix fees. They may have other claims and requirements; they may be people who are very wealthy and who for reasons of their own do not join a sick fund. Where a person does so voluntarily and where he is a private patient, it is not necessary to fix fees. Then the question of payment becomes a matter between himself and his doctor. We have experience of the type of patient who makes all sorts of claims which actually have nothing to do with his illness; he creates all sorts of problems for the doctor and demands much of his time which is something one cannot always express in terms of fees. We must also remember that any person has the right to appeal to the South African Medical Council if he is dissatisfied about any fees. I feel very strongly that this matter must remain a private one between the doctor and his patient. I want to mention another point in this connection. We talk about the fixing of fees but we have never heard about the fixing of hospital fees and I wonder whether one should not give some attention to this matter. I feel that it is our duty to make it possible for everyone in South Africa to belong to a sick fund and to have insurance to cover the expense which may be incurred in times of illness.</p>

<p>I want to say a few more words about the doctors in our country and I take the liberty of saying&#x2014;because for some years now I have not been in active practice&#x2014;that the entire world, our country included, owes a great debt of gratitude and appreciation to the medical profession and to doctors in particular, and particularly in the Republic of South Africa where the standard of our medicine&#x2014;I do not want to exaggerate&#x2014;is in any event equal to the best in the world. That is the evidence of foreigners, not even of our own people. A question now arises to my mind which I would like to air in public: Why is it that in so many cases the account of the doctor is always the last to be paid?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#member">

<from>*An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>Because it is too high.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from><span class="col_643-644" refersTo="page_0336"/>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that that is correct. The hospital account is always much higher, but that is paid first because people are afraid of being taken to court, while the doctor is not so quick to take action. I think that there should also be an improvement in this connection.</p>

<p>I want to mention a few points concerning doctors. Firstly, the training period of a doctor is the longest of all the professions&#x2014;7 years if he is fortunate enough to pass each year, and secondly, it is the most expensive. Thirdly, you have the position in many professions where a student earns a salary while he is being trained. In medicine he earns nothing during the whole of his training period, except in his last year when he may earn a small amount. The factor must also be considered&#x2014;as appears clearly from the report&#x2014;that at the start, a practice is always <b>very</b> small. I can well remember when I started. Fortunately, I always had at least one patient a day but there were many days when I had only one. A doctor can buy a share in a practice, but then he has to pay for it, sometimes a fairly large amount, in order to participate in that practice.</p>

<p>The next point I want to mention that I think is of importance is that it is being proposed that doctors should send their patients specified accounts for every service. I fully agree with that but it will also mean that the administrative expenses of the doctor will be greatly increased. He will have to employ more people and so forth. I refer to page 166 of the Snyman Report where it is stated</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Has that report already been tabled?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#de_wet">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE WET</person>:</from>

<p>No, but it was released some months ago. The report states [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The practice, particularly in the urban areas where one finds many of the fund patients, is being characterized more and more by increasing administrative work. An analysis of a Cape practice revealed that about 10 hours a week had to be spent purely on administrative work with the filling in of many certificates and forms which are required in our modern communities.</block>

<p>I want to mention another point concerning doctors and that is that their earnings per hour, not only in our country but also in other countries, are lower than in many other professional callings. We all know that a doctor is on duty 24 hours of the day. In the days when I saw one patient a day, I was not tired from working but I was tired from waiting. A doctor has to be available and the fact that he must be available never gives him the opportunity to relax completely. I see that the hon. the Prime Minister is looking at me. Even though he may go to Betty&#x2019;s Bay, he must always be available; he can never be completely relaxed. It is for that reason that we sympathize with him and I think that we ought to have the same amount of sympathy for the doctor who has to be available 24 hours of the day.</p>

<p>The next point that I want to mention is the question of <i>pro deo</i> work, the treating of patients <i>gratis,</i> the Robin Hood idea. It is quite true that <i>pro deo</i> work has decreased over the past years, chiefly because the Provincial Administrations decided some years ago to remunerate doctors for work which they had always performed free of charge. But there is still a large amount of <i>pro deo</i> work. I want to mention my own example. For 24 hours of the day, 12 months of the year, my partner and I were responsible for all the <i>gratis</i> treatment at the Vanderbijlpark Hospital. We were in the service of the Provincial Administration and therefore under an obligation, and we were remunerated. Do you know what the remuneration was? to-day it is more but then it was &#x00A3;84 per annum! It was only a nominal amount. But apart from that it is a fact that the scope of <i>pro deo</i> work is still considerable for all doctors. I want to say that more <i>gratis</i> work is done by doctors and dentists than in any other profession in South Africa. I welcome it and ask no reward for it; I merely state it as a fact. The report reads as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The doctor would still have to do considerably more <i>pro deo</i> work than any of the other free professions</block>

<p>I want to mention a further consideration in respect of doctors and dentists, particularly in connection with the fixing of fees. I do not think that it has previously been mentioned, nor do I think that it has been dealt with in the Report. What of the doctor, what of the dentist, who grows older, or shall we say more senior? He can no longer work as hard as he did when he was 30 years&#x2019; old and yet his family commitments are heavier at his more advanced age. As an advocate becomes more senior he becomes an S.A. and receives higher fees. An ordinary domestic servant receives wage increases as a result of seniority &#x2014;and not because he does any more work&#x2014; as he becomes older and more senior. In all spheres of life, in the Public Service as well, there is the prospect of an increase as the years go by. But what of the doctor? What of the old faithful family doctor when he is 50. 60 or 65? This must certainly be remembered and it is not an easy matter, when fees are fixed, to give consideration to this question. Should provision not perhaps be made in this regard? In England they have already done some work in this connection but I do not think it is a great success there. But should provision not be made for, senior or quality men, or whatever you want to call them, bearing in mind the older doctor or dentist? The older doctor can no longer do the quantity of work which he did in earlier years or should have done at any rate. We must not forget him when it comes to the fixing of uniform fees.</p>

<p><span class="col_645-646" refersTo="page_0337"/>Now one final point and here I know that some and perhaps many of my colleagues differ from me, but it is my considered opinion that doctors should not have an interest in health insurance schemes and that the recent development where doctors have brought their own schemes into being and are administering them is unsound. That is not the function of a professional man, least of all of members of such a respected and honourable profession as the medical profession. This also holds good for chemists and dentists. But I want to go further and say that it is not in the interests of the profession or of the patient that the doctor should have an interest either in these schemes or in nursing-homes or in pharmacies or in the pharmaceutical industry. Here I am speaking about the man who is in practice. There is this exception that one sometimes finds in smaller places that a nursing-home is needed, or that a pharmacy is badly needed and so forth, and the only way to meet that need&#x2014;and it is sometimes done on a very high level&#x2014;is for the doctor to have a share in it. That is the exception, but generally speaking this should not be done. I want to congratulate the Central Board on having said already that it is not in favour of the proposition that doctors should administer their own schemes and on having tried to discourage this in a Press statement.</p>

<p>Just a word or two about dentists. What I have already said largely applies to them too. but there are also a few additional matters. The first is that South Africa has a great shortage of dentists and the second is that we must not lose sight of the fact that particularly in the case of a dentist the day-to-day expenses associated with the practice are very high as a result of the cost of material.</p>

<p>I come to my next point&#x2014;the fixing of premiums in respect of sick funds. I am not very worried about this aspect because I think that the ordinary economic laws of competition and so forth will regulate this matter. I am very sure of one thing and that is that if the State wants to fix premiums, it must also accept the responsibility for losses, and obviously the State could not be anxious to do so. I think it is in this connection that the State or the Board can best give advice and assistance when funds are put into operation. We are all in agreement that the premiums should be kept as low as possible and I think that the State can give active assistance in connection with those things which will tend to keep insurance low. Part of the expenditure connected with such a fund or insurance company consists of administrative expenses, and this brings me immediately to one important factor which increases administrative costs, namely, the small claims. You yourself will realize that the smaller claims in respect of one visit result in tremendous administrative expenses for the fund, or whoever has to handle it. The position is that in the case of certain funds the first visit, a small amount at the start, has to be paid for by the patient himself and he is only insured in respect of the bigger amounts which are payable thereafter. In this connection one must not lightly adopt this standpoint and leave it at that, because the first visit is very important and one does not want to prevent the less-privileged man with a family of five or six children from calling the doctor for a first visit because he has to pay for that first visit himself because that first visit may perhaps prevent some serious illness. But is that so? I do not think so and I will tell you why. I do not think it would prevent the man from calling the doctor because he does not have to pay the bill immediately. It does apply to medicines which usually have to be bought for cash but as far as the doctor is concerned it is not an immediate factor because he is not paid immediately. In the second place, this difficulty can easily be overcome in respect of first visits by fixing a maximum for every person, for example: A man will pay for the first visit but if he has a large family and all eight children contract measles at the same time that man will not have to pay R30 or R40. We fix a minimum of R10 or R5 or whatever the case may be, and that is all he will have to pay. We must not forget that the man with the large family already receives a certain amount of benefit. In the first place the premiums are determined on a sliding scale, in other words, the smaller his income, the less he pays, although he may perhaps have a much larger family than a person with a larger income. You may ask why I emphasize this aspect. I do so because experience has always shown that the administrative costs in connection with these small claims greatly increase expenses which in turn result in loading the premium becoming unduly, something that we want to avoid. It is not the big claims which bring about heavy administrative expenses; it is the small claims which cause heavy administrative expenses and it is precisely in these cases that abuses take place, where the doctor is called for any reason at all, where he is called in the middle of the night or on a Sunday. The commission emphasizes this fact. Not only do they say that the patient should bear a share of the expenses, but they also ask that that share be increased. On page 308 they say this [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is necessary that the personal share, and participation of the patient should be maintained and even extended. The patient ought to make judicious use of his service benefits. It is the opinion of the commission that it is necessary for every patient to pay a portion of the costs himself.</block>

<p>There are two ways in which to combat this abuse and the first is, to mention an example, that the sick fund should pay 75 per cent of all expenses and the patient 25 per cent, with a maximum to be paid by the patient so that he is not threatened with financial ruin if, for example, his whole family falls ill at the same time. The second way is that the first amount, once again subject to a maximum, should be borne by the patient himself, provided it is not too much, particularly if he has a large <span class="col_647-648" refersTo="page_0338"/>family. I believe that both methods should be applied to obtain the desired effect and at the same time, to help to keep the premiums as low as possible. This is the tendency in Canada, the U.S.A, and in many other countries and here too in South Africa our experience is that many sick funds specifically ask that the so-called principle of surpluses should be incorporated.</p>

<p>I want to deal with a further point, the question of subsidies. In terms of this Report the Government will quite possibly not be unwilling to give some sort of subsidy for the promotion of this scheme. Indeed, this opinion is clearly expressed in the Report but it is based on the fact that a subsidy must be given to funds whose administrative expenses are low. I cannot agree with this principle. I agree with the principle that there should be a subsidy but not that it should be based on low administrative costs and I will tell you why. We all know that it is the easiest thing in the world to manipulate administrative costs. Just put me in charge of a large business and I will manipulate my administrative costs in such a way that I will receive the maximum subsidy. There are so many facets of administrative costs and these are linked up with so many other things that they are easily manipulated to appear lower and therefore I think that this is an unsound basis. I would prefer to suggest another method and at the same time solve other problems which may flow from the application of these schemes while also providing a form of subsidy which fits in with the pattern of the present subsidies which the State provides in various spheres.</p>

<p>In the first place the commission draws attention to old people and pensioners. I fully agree that provision must be made for them and that we cannot neglect these old people. But it is also a fact that as a result of their needs the obligation to insure them or to absorb them in a fund must of necessity increase the premiums, and that changes the whole picture; in other words, it creates real financial implications. If a subsidy is considered, I wonder whether it cannot be given to two groups instead of being based on administrative expenses, so that firstly, in the case of the aged and pensioners, they will be specifically subsidized when they belong to a sick fund; secondly, a great deal is said about children&#x2019;s allowances. It also has its drawbacks. Read about the experience of other countries, which has been anything but favourable. Would it not perhaps be a wise thing in respect of health assurance to subsidize the large family together with the old people and the pensioners and to use the subsidy in this way rather than to base it on low administrative costs?</p>

<p>While I am on the question of subsidies. I think we should refer to the employers of South Africa because they make a valuable contribution towards the sick funds which cover their workers. It is only right that they should do so but one is grateful for their cooperation and it is appreciated. The second point that I want to mention is the role of insurance companies. I think that South Africa is fortunate in that numbers of insurance companies have entered the field of this specific form of insurance. I cannot imagine that we are going to attain complete success in our aim to make health insurance available to all without having the assistance of the large insurance companies. Large sums of money are needed in this matter. I also think that the experience which they have gained and the problems which they have faced over the past years should be very carefully considered when we deal with the details of this matter.</p>

<p>A further point that I want to mention is the pharmaceutical industry. This is an aspect which has unfortunately received very little attention in this House over the past years. I am talking about the manufacture of medicines. Relatively speaking, this is a new industry in South Africa but it certainly has very great potentialities. We must make every effort to assist in making the Republic as independent as possible from the outside world in the sphere of the manufacture of medicines as well, and at the same time create great opportunities of employment for our own people. I want heartily to congratulate the firms which have already started production on what they have done and on the excellent standard of the preparations which they are placing on the market. In this sense not only do they merit the attention of the hon. the Minister of Health but also of the hon. the Minister of Finance and the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs. There is no doubt that the pharmaceutical industry has made a very important contribution towards the combating of illness. In the Snyman Report they say the following [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The pharmaceutical industry has by means of a large number of extremely effective medicines made a great contribution towards public health. Particularly in the sphere of infectious diseases has there been a striking decline in the mortality rate, the disappearance to a large extent of former complications, the earlier recovery of patients with a resumption of activities, a reduced need for beds for specific infectious diseases, amongst others tuberculosis, and a great improvement in the incidence of mental diseases with the result that to-day many patients can be discharged sooner and can recover sooner. Not only is there a tremendous saving in lives and an improvement in health, but there are also savings in respect of expensive institutions. Family doctors are able to-day to treat numbers of diseases at home, diseases which formerly required hospitalization.</block>

<p>This is most probably as a result of the efficaciousness of these medicines.</p>

<p>I want to mention another point in this connection and that is that in England, although the population has increased tremendously, one nevertheless finds that the number <span class="col_649-650" refersTo="page_0339"/>of prescriptions for medicines has not actually increased materially. In 1949 there were 202,000,000 prescriptions and notwithstanding the tremendous increase in the population, in 1959 the number was about the same, 214,000,000. I think this must be due to the greater efficaciousness of the medicines and, because of that, their more infrequent use. But I must also point out that in 1949 the cost per prescription was 30.05 cents and in 1959 it was 68.13 cents, which is also the picture in Canada and the U.S.A. The commission states. [Translation.]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Notwithstanding a larger population there has been no appreciable increase therefore in the total number of prescriptions over the years. There has in fact been a notable increase in the cost of prescriptions which must probably be attributed to the devaluation of money. &#x2026; It is reported from the U.S.A, that the American consumer is to-day spending about the same percentage of his income on medicines as he did in 1939. Here too the order of expenditure continues to be hospitals first with medical expenses and medicines second and third.</block>

<p>I would like to give the House this interesting information in respect of Canada, namely, that the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on alcohol is R20, per annum, on tobacco, R 12.50 and only R2.61 on medicines supplied on prescriptions. One finds further that all health services make up about 4 per cent of the national income but that medicines form 10 per cent of the total expenditure on health services. In other words, .4 per cent of the national income in England and in other countries is spent on medicines. In South Africa it is estimated to be about .6 per cent of our national income. But what is of importance is that over the past ten years the cost of medicines has only increased from 7.7 per cent to 10.1 per cent which is a small increase over ten years. In South Africa the position has been analysed a little further and we find that the public of their own accord buy medicines over the counter to the value of about R14,000,000, without prescription, whereas the amount spent on ethical preparations on prescription is R13.5 million. In other words, the public spend just as much money on medicine which they buy themselves as they do on medicine which they buy on prescription. In respect of the pharmaceutical industry I just want to say that there are about 80 manufacturing firms in South Africa. Of these only 15 are full fledged South African companies. All the others, in various forms, are overseas firms operating here. In other words, there are 15 South African firms and 65 non-South African or partly South African firms. This is one thing which disturbs me considerably. I feel that the local manufacture of medicines must be strongly encouraged and that these people must be given positive assistance. To avoid misunderstanding, I want to say very clearly that I do not underestimate or belittle the good services of foreign firms. I also realize that it is difficult in practice to manufacture certain medicines for a relatively small market in South Africa but nevertheless these foreign firms can make a far greater effort to manufacture locally and I want to bring this very pertinently to their notice.</p>

<p>Now, in respect of the local manufacture of medicines, the Report states as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On inquiry the opinion was voiced the the local manufacture of medicines will not necessarily lead to lower prices but that it will perhaps result in increased costs. Besides this it must be borne in mind that the erection and equipping of factories able, for example, to undertake the involved processes of antibiotics or hormones, is particularly expensive. Furthermore, this requires expert staff who know and can control all these processes. On the basis of what has happened in other sectors of industry, it is anticipated that the local manufacture of some medicines may well lead to lower prices. A specific hormone tablet was mentioned as an example. These tablets were previously imported at R8 per 100 and were manufactured locally in tablet form from material supplied at R7.50 per 500. Other examples are the pre-manufactured intravenous solutions in litre size which cost 75c each in the U.S.A and which are manufactured by a subsidiary company in South Africa and sold at 42c each. It will be possible to manufacture more cheaply if raw materials can be used which are gradually being made available by local industries, particularly the chemical industry.</block>

<p>I want to emphasize a few of the ways in which we can assist the local manufacturers of medicine and stimulate this industry. As the law stands at the moment, the managing director of a pharmaceutical factory must be a chemist; the law requires that. I think this is an obstacle which should be removed. From the nature of things any pharmaceutical industry will employ a pharmacist or a well-qualified person, a chemist, to do that work, but I do not think that this specific legal provision that he should be the managing director is necessary. It is useless and merely increases costs. On page 241 the commission also emphasizes this point and states [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The experience of two firms indicates that these particular legal requirements may prevent the economic use of an existing institution and existing management in the manufacture of medicines.</block>

<p>The second way in which we can help them is in respect of customs duties. The report states as follows [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Some medicines indicated by the State as being essential for the combating of great <span class="col_651-652" refersTo="page_0340"/>endemic or epidemic diseases such as tuberculosis or malaria, for example, are exempted from such duties. If, however, the raw materials are imported, customs duties are paid at a rate which is usually 15 per cent of the landed price.</block>

<block name="quote">From information received from the manufacturing group of the pharmaceutical industry it appears that 65 per cent of their raw materials are imported and that the raw materials are not available locally. This figure is also apparently increasing and is bound up with the involved chemical compositions of some of the basic ingredients of modern medicines.</block>

<block name="quote">In this taxation policy therefore lies a hidden factor in the total cost structure of medicines in the Republic. The commission feels that there can be no justification for levying customs duties on medicines which are not or cannot be manufactured in South Africa.</block>

<p>I also feel very strongly that in the light of this finding there is no justification for the levying of import duties on raw materials which are needed for the manufacture of necessary medicines. A concession in this regard will greatly stimulate the industry.</p>

<p>In the third place we can assist the pharmaceutical industry by reviewing patent rights. I just want to say that I think that although this is a highly technical matter, it is true that in our new set-up 16 years is too long a period for patent rights to remain valid. I come now to the next point where we can be of great assistance to the industry and that is by using the generic name of a medicine as its main name. In this connection I want to say that under prevailing conditions many preparations having recognized standards are marketed under various patented names. Retail chemists are compelled to ensure that the same preparation can be supplied under any one of a large variety of names. Of course this in no way facilitates their work and this state of affairs must of necessity increase the cost to the public. These increased costs are due to the fact that chemists are compelled, for example, to stock six or more different patented antibiotic medicines containing identical chemical compounds each of which sometimes has to be opened to make up one prescription. This means that the original packing has to be broken, resulting in an additional fee of at least 10 per cent. A further result is that chemists have to invest far more capital in stocks, extra labour, in orders and the maintenance of stocks. The practical use of patent names for preparations which may only be supplied on prescription from doctors has resulted in a wide variety of prices, in some cases five or six times higher than when that same article was supplied under its generic name. In many cases manufacturers spend large sums of money on propaganda amongst the medical profession in order to influence doctors to prescribe an expensive variety of a general preparation. In most cases doctors are so overwhelmed by representatives and advertising material that they are not aware of the fact that a certain preparation is obtainable under its generic name at a very low price. In some cases the ordinary chemical formula is known but over and above this the formula is supplied as a long and complicated chemical compound. If it is possible therefore for the medical profession to use the generic names and the manufacturers are compelled to state that their preparations are the same as those sold under a particular generic name on a prescription, patients will save considerable sums of money, because a chemist will then be in a position to supply any preparation. The International Federation of Chemists is also in favour of the use of generic names in preference to patented names. It is felt that if it is made compulsory in medical propaganda to use the generic name together with the patented name, it will be a step in the right direction to make the medical profession <i>au fait</i> with the use of generic names. The Western Cape Branch of the Pharmaceutical Association has already discovered that where a local sick fund asked their doctors to use generic names, the cost of their medicines dropped considerably. If the generic names can be prescribed, open competition will certainly influence chemists to supply the most economic preparation which complies with a particular standard, for example, as approved by the South African Bureau of Standards. In view of the fact that chemists supply prepared medicines at a tariff approved by the S.A. Pharmaceutical Council, there can therefore be no question of chemists supplying a cheap article and charging for an expensive one. The Pharmaceutical Council is fully entitled to control this element. It may also be worth mentioning here that where there are large variations in the prices of medicines, we find practically without exception that the price of the South African product is lower than that charged by foreign firms. The use of generic names must necessarily stimulate our swiftly expanding local pharmaceutical industry which is already entering the field of basic manufacture. I think I have said enough in connection with generic names. The next point that I want to emphasize very strongly is that South Africa should establish her own pharmacopoeia. There are many good reasons for this. At the moment we are working on the British one but our climate here differs completely from that of England. Our prescription habits are also different and the clinical picture varies in many respects. With our disintegrated health service we also have a great need for standardization and furthermore our own pharmacopoeia will certainly link up with the growth and expansion which we are so anxious to have in our local pharmaceutical industry. The S.A. Bureau of Standards which is doing excellent work in so many spheres can easily undertake that work and they are also eminently suitable for the task. Indeed, my information is that they are already doing so. They already have a list. They are already making analyses and they <span class="col_653-654" refersTo="page_0341"/>are in close contact with the pharmaceutical industry. It appears from inquiries&#x2014;and they have given me this assurance&#x2014;that this service can easily be extended. If we do have our own pharmacopoeia, we will than have our own standards and we will have a full guarantee in respect of quality.</p>

<p>I want to say a word about pharmacists. I think it would be wrong to have this discussion without saying something about them because they perform valuable and necessary services. We now have 1,500 of them. It is true that in certain cities there are too many pharmacists, but it is equally true that there is a general shortage of pharmacists throughout the country as a whole. They also have their problems because their practice has changed completely. In 1955 80 per cent of the medicines they supplied were medicines which they prepared themselves and only 20 per cent came from their shelves. But five years later, in 1960, they only prepared 20 per cent and 80 per cent comprised ethical medicines. Their dilemma is of course very great because of the fact that they have to stock a great range of ethical medicines, from 1,600 to 2,000. The Report states [translation]&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Details of the multiplicity of preparations which have to be stocked were supplied. It is pointed out briefly that for example, in the case of the preparation cortisone there were six identical trade marks available on the market in 1950; in the case of hydrocortisone there were ten, in the case of hydro-cortisone ointment there were 16. in the case of prednisone there were eight, in the case of prednisolone there were eight, in the case of decametasone there were five &#x2026;</block>

<p>And so they go on. In the case of vitamin B12 there were 14. It is said that there are about 1,800 known ethical medicines in current use for which there may be a demand at any time and all of these are supplied on prescription only. I spoke about the generic names. I think that this will be of great assistance to pharmacists because as I have already indicated the compulsory use of the generic name will help a great deal.</p>

<p>Another sphere where we can be of assistance is in respect of the packaging of medicines. It appears to be quite unnecessary for expensive medicines to be made up in bulk. After all, the chemist has to charge extra when a small quantity is prescribed. This extra amount is recovered from the patient in order to make it an economic proposition for the chemist. The S.A. Pharmacists&#x2019; Association has already approached the Association of Ethical Manufacturers in this connection without success, and a specific and perhaps smaller quantity will therefore be welcomed in some cases and will be of great assistance to the chemist. There are other matters as well but I want to leave it at that with this thought that we should try to assist the chemists in such a way that it will not be necessary to have connections with wholesale chemists, because I regard that as an unhealthy state of affairs.</p>

<p>I have dealt with some aspects and everything that I have said, with certain exceptions, has referred in the main to Whites, because we must make a start somewhere. But I must add immediately that this sort of development also holds out great possibilities, and, from the nature of things, immediate benefits as well for all non-Whites, and in particular it holds out possibilities for future development when this is practicable, when their living conditions and their approach to the medical profession change. I feel very strongly about two things, firstly, that the principle that the patient should have a share in the responsibility for supplying health services should also be extended to the colossal <i>gratis</i> health services which are given particularly to the non-Whites. In other words, they should pay a small portion themselves for every service. Secondly, the commission recommends that a minimum amount be determined for every service and I full agree with it. Secondly, I feel very strongly that long-term hospitalization should be provided to the Bantu in their homeland for tuberculosis, mental diseases and chronic diseases and that this policy should be tackled with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that there is no doubt regarding the principles underlying these matters. We know precisely what we want to do. The details have to be carefully worked out and further studied but I do not think that we should hesitate to change them if it will lead to an improvement. It is the task of the Minister and his Department, and later of Parliament, to introduce legislation, and I want to encourage the hon. the Minister to set up at least two boards, the Central Board for Medical Schemes and the Board for the Control of Medicines, as soon as possible, or rather as soon as this can be done, by means of legislation. I feel that people who are in daily practice must be appointed to this board. This is a detail which we can discuss later. I want to mention one example. I feel that the board should have at least one chemist as a member, a man who has to deal daily with practical problems. These however are matters which we can discuss later. I am certain that under this legislation matters will be handled in such a way by the hon. the Minister of Health and his Department and also by Parliament with the machinery at its disposal that there will be a full opportunity as far as the details are concerned to make representations and to deliberate. Because it is in the interests of everyone and because this is a most important matter to every member of the population in South Africa, I want to make an appeal to all, in case there may be confusion or suspicion or fear&#x2014;for which no real reason exists&#x2014;to co-operate with one another with mutual trust and goodwill in order to establish a service of quality for the whole population.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>I have very great pleasure in seconding the motion moved by the hon. <span class="col_655-656" refersTo="page_0342"/>member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) and I should like very much to congratulate him at the outset on the very capable way in which he introduced this subject. I think you will also permit me, Sir, to join him in thanking the hon. the Minister and the Government for the fact that they took the initiative in appointing this commission to investigate this important matter. It is fitting also that we should express our appreciation to the commission for the very comprehensive inquiry undertaken by it and for the very interesting, instructive report submitted by it.</p>

<p>As we all know, one of the objects of the commission was to see what could be done to bring about a reduction in the costs of medical services. I think that the public waited hopefully and believed that the commission would come forward with some sort of plan which, perhaps by a touch of the magic wand, would reduce the cost of medical services. Unfortunately, I personally believe that they will be disappointed because I believe&#x2014;I have always believed&#x2014;that we cannot expect any drastic reduction in costs. We must realize that the increase in the cost of medical services is a world-wide phenomenon which has been caused by quite a number of different factors, and we must bear in mind the fact that practically every year there is a steep rise in the cost of living and that that in turn affects the cost of medical services. We all know that 20 years ago one could get a tailor-made suit for R10 or R12; to-day it costs perhaps about R60. The fact remains that our standard of living has risen. The fact remains that salaries and wages, particularly of administrative clerks and nurses in hospitals and institutions and clinics and even in private practice where nurses and receptionists are needed, have increased. Salaries and wages have a very great effect on the increased cost of medical services, but better services are being provided to-day than those to which we had become accustomed in the past. We know that whereas in former years the patient was dependent on the services of one medical practitioner it is a general phenomenon to-day in dealing with difficult cases to find that a whole team of medical practitioners is called in to treat some particular illness or other. We must think of the more efficacious drugs which are being used to-day. These are expensive medicines into which an enormous amount of capital had to be sunk during the research years. All these things are inclined to push up the cost of medical services. And I want to mention another aspect in particular and that is the demands made by the public. The public is inclined, perhaps more than we realize, to make its own demands, which it is entitled to do&#x2014;I admit that&#x2014;but we sometimes forget that if we want to ride in a Rolls Royce we must not expect to pay the price of a Ford. What we find in our practice every day is that the patient comes along and demands certain drugs. He has no hesitation in telling you that he wants this, that or the other thing for a particular illness. We cannot blame members of the public because they read and hear about the tremendous strides made in medical science, and it is only right that they should demand that the results of this development should be placed at their disposal, but nevertheless it does mean that their demands, particularly if they are injudicious, bring about a very great increase in costs. We often find that certain sections of the public believe that all one has to do is to put the patient &#x201C;under the lights&#x201D; and then one can see immediately what is wrong with him, and that is why we constantly find that demands are made for X-ray plates which are sometimes quite unnecessary but the effect of which is that a hole is made in the patient&#x2019;s pocket. In the same way patients demand a particular treatment or, contrary to what many people think, they demand operations which are unnecessary.</p>

<p>It very often happens, whatever the reasons may be, that in spite of the fact that the medical practitioner is not in favour of a particular operation, a patient nevertheless insists on it, even if only to be able to boast over a cup of tea at some future date about the expensive or intricate operation that he or she underwent. Talking about operations, I notice that the Snyman Commission also raises this objection that too many operations are performed nowadays. I want to emphasize this aspect that perhaps members of the public are partly to blame if too many operations are in fact performed. However, the commission alleges that far too many operations are performed nowadays, the underlying idea being that certain medical practitioners perform operations simply for the sake of financial gain. I do not know whether that has been properly established and I do not want to express an opinion in that regard. What I do believe is that if there are cases where medical practitioners operate just for the sake of the money, they will certainly be rare exceptions. I feel that this is an unfortunate observation in this report. But I do think that the commission is offering a wrong solution in suggesting that perhaps it will help if the fees charged for operations are reduced. The commission argues that if that is done, then perhaps there will be no tendency on the part of the younger family doctor lightly to decide upon an operation. I think that is perhaps an erroneous argument. I think that if there are people who operate for the sake of financial gain, a reduction in fees would in fact mean that they would perform more and more operations in order to keep their income stable. I do not believe therefore that that will prove helpful, nor do I think that if the family doctor performs fewer operations there will in fact be fewer operations because members of the public will still insist on operations and if the ordinary family doctor does not operate, the patient will go to the next medical practitioner and then to the following one until he eventually falls into the hands of the specialists, and even if the first, the second and the third specialist refuse to operate, he will still have the operation performed in the end by some specialist or other at a very much higher <span class="col_657-658" refersTo="page_0343"/>fee. If there are such cases then in my opinion the solution lies rather in educating the public to realize that unnecessary, injudicious demands are to their own detriment and that they should rather leave the decision in the hands of their family doctor in matters of this kind, and secondly the solution also lies in educating those few medical practitioners, if there are such people, whose character development may leave something to be desired. That would help, but not a reduction of fees. To come back to the question of costs, I think we must expect a gradual increase in costs and not a reduction. When we look at the present position we find, according to the Snyman Report, that the State spends about 2.4 per cent of the national income on medical services. We find that on an average the head of the family in South Africa spends R75 per annum on medical services. That means, on a percentage basis, that his costs in connection with medical services amount to something like 2.59 per cent of his expenditure. Generally speaking&#x2014;and this is also the commission&#x2019;s opinion&#x2014;that is perhaps not an unduly high figure, but, as the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark has also stated, the trouble is that one may suddenly be presented with a heavy bill. That is what makes the position difficult for the patient. In looking for a solution it seems to me that the solution lies in two directions. In the first instance we should try to spread the costs over the longest possible period and the second solution is that we should make an effort, although we may not be able to reduce the costs, to bring about a saving and to check a further rise in costs. As far as the spreading of costs is concerned, this has often been suggested and there are various methods which are already being used. I have in mind the various sick funds, the medical aid funds and insurance schemes.</p>

<p>I do not want to deal with this in detail; I merely want to point out that already there are 169 medical funds of this nature in this country and that something like 40 per cent of the total White population already falls under one scheme or another. I do not want to enlarge upon this except that I want to mention this fact that while I am in favour of the proposition that we should get as many people as possible to join these schemes, I think it will be essential, if we encourage this, for the State to make sure that there is proper control over these various funds, because it will be of no earthly use if there is maladministration and the patient then finds that his monthly contribution is so high that he does not benefit at all, or conversely, that the medical practitioner will have to be exploited so that the balance-sheet will be able to balance ultimately. The question arises whether this medical fund system should be on a compulsory or a voluntary basis. Like the Snyman Commission I believe that to begin with at any rate, it should be an entirely voluntary matter, although it would perhaps be useful to exert pressure gradually so that we can give as many people as possible the protection of these funds. The other question is whether the whole nation should be drawn into this scheme, or would it be right to say that the upper layer, the very rich, should not fall under medical funds? This is an issue in regard to which there is a very great difference of opinion even amongst medical practitioners. The Snyman Commission recommends that everybody should fall under these medical schemes or insurance schemes, and it mentions certain reasons. The commission alleges that there is only a very small percentage of rich people and that it will make no great difference to the medical practitioner as such if they are excluded, but the commission&#x2019;s main argument is that the so-called Robin Hood system should no longer be applicable in this country. This is a system which has been used throughout the world, and this is how it works: It is argued that because the medical practitioner has to do so much work free of charge, because he has to treat the poor man free of charge, he is entitled, when he treats a rich patient, to call upon him to pay a higher fee in an attempt to compensate him for the cases which he has to treat free of charge. The Snyman Commission alleges that there is no reason to-day why the medical practitioner should make use of that method because, so it argues, the State takes care of the poor man in this country. In my opinion that is an erroneous argument put forward by the commission because what it says there is only a half-truth. The State does not take care of the poor man. All the State does is to contribute to the costs, but the rest still has to be borne by the medical practitioner. Certain figures are given in this report. It is alleged that the State takes care of the poor through the medium of its district surgeon, but the commission mentions that the average district surgeon is paid at an average of 67 cents per hour. Here we find that an educated person who has taken an expensive course and who has to do highly responsible work is remunerated by the State at 67 cents per hour.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is correct. And sometimes he has to run great risks. According to the report that we are dealing with here, the system is that the district surgeons themselves have to provide medicines to their patients. They are able to claim a refund from the State in respect of expensive drugs, but the ordinary medicines they have to provide themselves and they are given a monthly allowance. This report points out that on an average the district surgeon receives less than 10 cents per bottle for medicine given to his patients, which means that he is obliged to contribute the rest out of his own pocket. I want to mention just one further figure as far as operative work is concerned. The specialist&#x2019;s fee for an appendectomy is R50. The general practitioner&#x2019;s charge is R34. The district surgeon is paid R20 by the State. There was a time when it was only R10. But apart from this, the fact of the matter is that in certain <span class="col_659-660" refersTo="page_0344"/>provinces the district surgeon is still faced with two problems. If he sends his patient to the hospital for the operation then in many cases he loses all contact with the patient; he never sees him again; he himself does not perform the appendectomy. In other words, he derives no financial benefit from the fact that it is stated in his contract that he will receive R20 per operation. Another aspect is that even if he were to perform the operation himself, in certain provinces the Health Department says: &#x201C;The patient is no longer my responsibility now; the matter falls under the province and the province will pay.&#x201D; There are such provincial schemes&#x2014;and here I speak from experience&#x2014;where the district surgeon receives no more than R2 or R3 for his appendectomy. Reference is made in this report to the fact that the Railway medical officer works for about one-quarter of the fee of the general practitioner. In these circumstances I say that it cannot be contended that the State takes care of the poor man, and I can understand therefore why there is a large group of people who believe that there is still justification for employing the Robin Hood method.</p>

<p>I want to say a few words now about possible savings. I think that when we talk about savings we should turn our attention to the two places where the highest costs are incurred. and here I want to mention the hospitals and the overlapping of services. The Snyman Commission states&#x2014;and I accept that that is correct&#x2014;that hospitalization accounts for the biggest increase in the cost of medical services. Hospitalization accounts for 50 to 55 per cent of the costs, and if the figure is so high then the hospital is the first place where we should try to bring about a saving and on which we should concentrate our attention. We must bear in mind the enormous amount of capital which is tied up in hospitals and I am convinced that apart from hospitals attached to the medical schools, where it is necessary to have very expensive theatres and very expensive equipment, where important research is done, money is being spent unnecessarily on expensive buildings. There is no standardization of equipment in the hospitals. Expensive&#x2014;sometimes unnecessarily expensive &#x2014;equipment is purchased. Instruments are bought which are used only occasionally perhaps. I would not go so far as to say that they simply lie and rust there but in many hospitals they are practically useless and that is so simply because there is no standardization. We should try to save by making the duration of the patient&#x2019;s stay in the hospital as short as possible, and good work is being done in this respect. to-day we are keeping patients for as short a period as possible in hospitals, but there is still room for improvement. Furthermore, all clinics should be built so that patients can be treated outside the hospitals, so that it will not be necessary for them to spend long periods in expensively equipped hospitals. I think that this applies particularly to the non-Whites. We could treat an enormous number of non-Whites in out-patient clinics and thus bring about a great saving. I have referred to the overlapping of services. Just think of the fact that we are providing medical services under the control, in the first instance, of the State where we have different departments providing different services. Services are being provided under the four different provinces and then we have a large number of local authorities each providing its own medical services. To mention an example, take the State for instance. The State has a chief regional medical officer with a full complement of staff that is responsible for medical services in that region. Then we have the provinces which have directors of hospitals, also with a full complement of staff. Then we come to the local authorities. We have the Health Boards in the Transvaal and Natal with their chief medical officers and their assistants and nurses and other staff. This also applies to the Provincial Council here in the Cape and also in the urban areas. Practically every town that is worthy of the name has its own medical officer with his district nurses, etc. and they provide all sorts of medical services. We find that there is no compulsory liaison between these very large groups; there is no co-ordination. Every group works independently and this causes enormous overlapping with resultant unnecessary costs. In our hospitals we have the same story. We have hospitals under the control of the State; we have hospitals under the control of the provinces; hospitals which are attached to medical schools and which work on a different basis, and then again we have hospitals which are purely provincial. We have hospitals under the control of the local authorities, mission hospitals, private hospitals, as well as other special hospitals such as SANTA and mine hospitals, for example. All these institutions are under separate control; they have their separate staff and their separate workers. Outpatients are also taken care of separately by these separate bodies. This overlapping must necessarily result in poorer services; it must result in greatly increased organizational costs. There should be a doubling of out-patient services&#x2014;there is no alternative because to-day there is no proper co-ordination. There is no liaison between these various services. If each authority has to erect its own hospital it must result in divergent patterns and divergent control of hospitals. Just think of the fact that all these institutions purchase their supply separately instead of buying through one big channel. There is a complete lack of standardization. Another factor that we dare not overlook is the unnecessary and enormous waste of manpower. I am convinced that this country simply cannot afford to continue on this basis. We simply have not got the finances and the manpower. I say therefore that it is absolutely essential that we should try to cope with this question of overlapping without any waste of time and at the earliest possible date. I say that the time has come to do so not only because I consider it essential but it seems to me, after having read the commission&#x2019;s report, that this is the opportune time because people are more or less <i>ad idem.</i> I <span class="col_661-662" refersTo="page_0345"/>just want to quote the opinion of one or two bodies. This is what the South African Nursing Council has to say in connection with overlapping&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We as nurses feel very strongly that the division in the health services in this country is not only hampering our economy but that it is also hampering the whole of our educational and training programmes.</block>

<p>In the same way I could also quote the Transvaal Hospital Department and the Free State Hospital Department. The Natal Hospital Department says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I know there is certain competition between provinces which probably is wrong and it would probably be better if these were all centralized.</block>

<p>I do not want to take up too much time but the fact of the matter is that all these persons and bodies have expressed themselves against this overlapping. The radiologists&#x2019; group of the S.A. Medical Association says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If you could arrange for all hospitals to be under the Union Health Department there would be a vast saving if you standardized apparatus and if you standardized films.</block>

<p>I want to conclude by saying that I think that I have proved that the time is ripe, that this is a suitable time for us to concentrate as soon as practicable on the standardization of these various activities and that we should try to eliminate this overlapping.</p>

<p>I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) on his marathon effort but mostly on his quantity. Unfortunately for us on this side of the House we have not had either the report of the Snyman Commission nor the report of the Commission on Sick Funds available to us. I feel that it is wrong that a member should be able to come into this House and debate the reports of two commissions when the Opposition has not had the opportunity of seeing them. There have been odd extracts in the medical journals and odd comments, but in spite of all my efforts I have not been able to obtain a copy of the report of either commission. This make it extremely difficult to reply to the remarks of the hon. members for Vanderbijlpark and for Odendaalsrus. The machinery which is now suggested for the control of excessive medicines is, of course, of general interest to the Department of Health. But, Sir, it cannot be said under any circumstances whatsoever that their work was timeous. For the last two years this side of the House have urged action upon the Minister. During the last session the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher), seconded by myself, proposed that the hon. the Minister should at once undertake the introduction of a medical sick fund service. So the word &#x201C;timeous&#x201D;, I fear, is somewhat misplaced. As I have said, we are in a very difficult position in having to reply to the remarks of the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark.</p>

<p>My feeling about the Ministry of Health is that it is far from timeous and it is far from efficient. There are so many problems facing the health services of this country that I wish to propose an amendment to the motion of the hon. member&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit all the words after &#x201C;That&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;this House&#x2014;</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) considers that one of the principal factors causing the rising costs of medical services and medicines is the Government&#x2019;s general neglect of the real health problems of the South African population; and</li>

<li>(b) deplores the Government&#x2019;s delay in establishing a voluntary national medical aid scheme.&#x201D;</li>

</ol>

<p>To start with this Minister is working under an Act which was brought in, I think, in 1919 and he is trying with an Act of 1919, which applied chiefly to a pastoral country, to maintain the health of a country the population of which has more than doubled and which has changed from a pastoral into a highly industrialized state; from a country where the non-Whites lived in their own areas into a country where the main cities are to-day surrounded by dormitory cities containing mostly non-Whites, with all the additional problems of the enlargement of cities which takes place. Whenever you aggregate people or animals or plants into large numbers you develop problems of aggregation. If you have an orange tree in your garden it is unlikely that it will develop disease. But if you have 30 to 40 to 50 orange trees together you can be quite certain that they will develop disease. The same thing happens in the case of human beings. If anything it happens more so. And the problems which face us to-day, to my mind, flow from an attempt to lower the cost of medical treatment and medicines instead of trying to avoid the necessity to use them. We should use our doctors to maintain positive health and not allow our people to contract illnesses and then try to get them better without paying for it. The duty of the Ministry of Health and of the Central Government is to maintain health positively.</p>

<p>How do you prevent appendicitis?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Even that, Mr. Speaker, can occasionally be prevented. It happens to be one of those diseases which is a disease of civilization. There are nations who live under certain conditions, the Chinese for example, who hardly ever get appendicitis. Appendicitis was almost unknown among the Bantu until he began to live in the White areas, until he began to eat the White man&#x2019;s food. <span class="col_663-664" refersTo="page_0346"/>It was then that he started to develop appendicitis. He did not have it in the old days. That is my answer.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has in one instance, I must say, made an effort to meet what I believe to be the obligations of his Department and that it was he who introduced the universal vaccine for poliomyelitis. It was a sort of effort on his part to try to do something, to do something positive, but it was given a most exaggerated importance. In the health of this country poliomyelitis is not a very serious illness. The number of cases, even before the introduction of the vaccine, amounted to about 1,000 per annum. But this happens to affect children; it leaves people paralysed and because of that it is an emotional disease; the public consequently attached a great deal of importance to it. But the problem of poliomyelitis fades into insignificance in comparison with the problem of tuberculosis. Here we have a disease which costs the country seldom less than R8,000,000 per annum. That was what was spent last year. I think it was a little less the year before. This year it may be a little more. But the point is, Sir, that this is a preventable disease; this is a disease which could be brought under control, perhaps not eliminated. Few countries have succeeded in eliminating tuberculosis completely in the human but there are many things that can be done in order to help make this disease negligible.</p>

<p>I point to one thing: Firstly, the Public Health Act allows free radiological examination for tuberculosis subject to regulations which the Minister may make. What does he do? He charges them 2s. Now, tuberculosis is very largely a disease of the poor people; 2s. means something to them. In any case, they think that if they are well why should they go to be X-rayed? The ideal thing in this country would be to take miniature X-rays of everybody and to attempt in that way to discover the early cases, to isolate them from the other and prevent the disease spreading. What else should be done, Sir, to create a positive health in the country?</p>

<p>Take for instance the question of nutrition. Nutrition should be under the control of the Minister of Health. Nutrition is what we eat; it is the food we eat, but it is not under his control. He has passed it off on to somebody else. Take the control of pure water. We need control of pure water but it is not under the Ministry of Health. These things, when approached by a Ministry which is not the Ministry of Health are approached in general with an outlook of cost. Psychologically, Sir, there is only one Ministry which looks to the people, which looks to their health, which puts their health first. Every matter which concerns health should come under this Minister. Take the question of industrial health. This Ministry has abdicated completely from anything to do with industrial health. Inquire into industrial diseases. Take the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act; except for the compensation part of it, that should fall under the Minister of Health. How can you expect a Minister of Labour to be interested particularly in the health of the workmen? He is interested, as we saw last session, in the solvency of his compensation fund. In the case of industrial disease, what did I find when I looked into the matter? After a good deal of search I was able to find that there is a list of industrial diseases which changes a little from time to time. But the Ministry of Labour is not looking round to see what diseases are creeping into the factories. When there were enough people suffering from pneumoconiosis in the ordinary labour market it was then decided&#x2014;I think during the last year or two &#x2014;that pneumoconiosis should be regarded as an industrial disease. But it has never been anything else. Had the Government not abdicated from the medical side of pneumoconiosis to the mines it would have been detected many many years ago in the ordinary working man, those who work with cement, works where they make Vim, quarries, etc. All these things develop pneumoconiosis. But it was only recently, because people started to agitate, that pneumoconiosis sufferers have been regarded as coming under the Workmen&#x2019;s Compensation Act. Had industrial health been taken over by the Department of Health they would have been looking for it. Even the outlook to-day, Sir, is unjustifiable. I wish to refer to two recent cases which are reported in the medical journals. In the Medical Journal of April 1962. I find a description headed as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A picture of Industrial Hygiene in Germiston: Anti-rust proofing by zinc galvanizing.</block>

<p>Now, Sir, what do we find? We find an article written by a doctor.</p>

<p>Business suspended at 12.45 p.m. and resumed at 2.20 p.m.</p>

<p><i>Afternoon Sitting</i></p>

</speech>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when business was suspended I was trying to demonstrate how the whole health and industrial aspect is influenced by the psychological outlook of the observer. I want to say how important it is that in dealing with industrial health it is a great mistake to leave industrial health in the hands of the Ministry of Labour who is concerned only with work whereas the outlook of the Department of Health is that of looking after the individual worker&#x2019;s health and welfare. Only they can deal with it.</p>

<p>I want to give the House some instances which happened recently in this country. The first is reported in the South African Medical Journal of 21 April, 1962. It refers to a case of &#x201C;Anti-rust proofing by zinc galvanizing in Germiston &#x201D;. The first thing which is noticeable about this article is this. It starts like this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A health inspector of the City Council of Germiston inspected local engineering <span class="col_665-666" refersTo="page_0347"/>rooms and was not altogether convinced that the industrial process of zinc galvanizing as at present conducted at the works was hygienic and without danger to health.</block>

<p>It is noticeable, Sir, that this was a health inspector of the City Council. He was not an industrial inspector; he was not a factory inspector but he was a health inspector and he thought that things were not right. The matter was investigated and certain things were discovered. Firstly, &#x201C;An investigation of the amount of zinc oxide would be costly. I lay emphasis on the word * costly &#x2019; &#x201D;. We go on and we find that in this factory there is a turnover of labour of 50 per cent every year. It suggests that some of the workers were sick. I read further&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The clinical findings despite the absence of clear-cut clinical evidence to the contrary, there remained in my opinion &#x2026;</block>

<p>This is a doctor speaking&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; a distinct likelihood that one cause of workers&#x2019; absence from work is the inhalation of zinc oxide fumes during their employment.</block>

<p>Various methods were introduced into the factory. For instance a rail was put up. But it was found that it made the worker a bit slower so it was taken away. It was suggested that an exhaust system should be introduced to draw the fumes away. And what do we find? The manager said that he felt that an exhaust system would be too costly for the means of the company. So the only thing this factory suggested was that when any man got burnt&#x2014;they frequently got burnt by splashing&#x2014;he was fined because it was regarded as being careless. Here, Sir, we see the outlook of a factory, of an industrialist, who is not very greatly interested in his workers. He wants workmen Who can work but if any safety measures are going to cause a rise in the costs then he will resist them. It is only the State and only the Department of Health which will take sufficient interest to see that safety measures are carried out. I have discussed this matter with various health authorities, with various pathologists and chemists and people who analyse fumes and the general impression among most of them is that the industrialist will always resist anything extra that has to be put into his factory, such as a safety measure, on the grounds that it costs too much. Very often it is found subsequently that his recovering of the waste products changes the cost structure to such an extent that he is very glad to have saved it. However, that is by the way.</p>

<p>I want to draw attention to an article which appeared this week in a journal of the Medical School of the University of Cape Town&#x2014; it is their Jubilee year&#x2014;dated 19 January, 1963. Here we find that a large number of people in Cape Town are walking about with a fair amount of asbestos in their lungs. It sounds a most extraordinary thing, Sir, I want to remind the House that some two or three years ago I drew the attention of the Minister of Labour and the Minister of Health to the development of a cancer in people exposed to asbestos. This was a cancer which had been found very common in Kimberley. The general feeling was that it was due to asbestos though many other factors were involved. I know that the hon. the Minister has lent one of his staff to investigate this question but he has rather been investigating it in the mining area. I am now discussing the question of asbestos in the cities. I read from this article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In smears from 500 consecutive autopsies in Cape Town in subjects over the age of 15 years asbestos bodies were found in 30 per cent of the males and 20 per cent of the females.</block>

<p>In other words, of 500 people who died consecutively&#x2014;and it must have been in a hospital&#x2014;there was evidence that these people had absorbed into their lungs sufficient asbestos to be found without great difficulty. There was no evidence that it had anything to do with cancer nor any evidence that it was doing them any harm but the fact remains that in the atmosphere of Cape Town there is apparently quite an appreciable amount of asbestos. The pathologist who did the work goes on to say&#x2014;</p>



<block name="quote">Asbestos does not result in pulmonary disease or disability but appears to be of causal significance in mesothelioma of the pleura or the peritoneum. An increase in this tumour can be forecast. It is suggested as the main ground for regarding asbestos as an urban hazard.</block>

<p>I know, Sir, that some time back in Durban an inspector entered a factory which was dealing with asbestos and found that the men were working in a fairly dense atmosphere of dust, the dust, of course, being asbestos dust. He objected to it and what was done? The factory introduced an exhaust fan by which they sucked out the asbestos dust from the factory and blew it out into the street outside. Such a thing could not happen under a Department of Health. It can only happen under an industrial department. The outlook of the Department of Health should be and is that they must take over the industrial health so that when an inspector goes into a factory he will be a health inspector.</p>

<p>Let us turn to pneumoconiosis. Pneumoconiosis is a hardy annual in this House. It comes up as frequently as the group areas. I am not going to argue about the Group Areas Act and whether it is coming up again, but I do say that when an Act has to be constantly changed and constantly brought before this House, it is obvious that somebody is dissatisfied and that the Act is not working satisfactory. In my profession, Sir, if we are dealing with a sick person and we think we are right in our diagnosis and we think we <span class="col_667-668" refersTo="page_0348"/>are right in our treatment, and we know the treatment should be satisfactory, but the patient does not get better, we go back along our tracks and we try to see at what point we went wrong. I want to suggest that the Government should go back along its tracks in regard to pneumoconiosis, and even in respect of governments before the present Government. I know what is wrong with this Pneumoconiosis Act. It is that the men, the miners, do not have faith in the doctors of this Pneumoconiosis Bureau, and the reason for that is that these doctors are employed by the Department of Mines, that they are paid by the Department of Mines. I do not wish to say anything against them, but their outlook in general is not that of a health inspector, is not that of a doctor in practice, is not that of a man trying to get his patients better. These doctors in the Bureau have no responsibility to the man, to the patient. They have no responsibility to the patient; when they discover another disease, they do not even let the outside doctor know about it.</p>

<p>I will show you. They have no responsibility to the individual. They are employed to say various things: Is this man suffering from pneumoconiosis? If so, in what stage? If he is not, that is the end. They are not there to prevent disease, they are not there to cure disease, they are not there to help the man. They say: &#x201C;Yes, you can go underground&#x201D; or &#x201C;No, you cannot go underground &#x201D;. No doctor worth his salt can stand that sort of work. No doctor can stand where he has no responsibility to the patient. I remember at one time I had a house surgeon, the son of a rich man, who I thought was a very good doctor, but he finally decided to work in his father&#x2019;s business. I met him some months later and I said &#x201C;Well, how is it in this rich industry in which you are working?&#x201D; He said: &#x201C;It is very nice; my hours are regular; but I cannot stand it any longer; I cannot stand not having responsibility.&#x201D; It is that lack of responsibility, in respect of a sick man, that is causing the difficulty. The doctor is not responsible to the sick man, but to some committee, and as a result pneumoconiosis is a hardy annual in this House, and it will be so until such time as the Department of Health takes over the medical aspects of it and leaves the compensation point of view to somebody else. But this Government has in its department the biggest group, I might almost say the only group, of thoracic physicians and they never see a case of pneumoconiosis until it has been thrown out by the Bureau. If pneumoconiosis is to be properly dealt with, if the miner is to be satisfied, he must be satisfied, not only that he gets compensation&#x2014;that has got nothing to do with me&#x2014;but he must be satisfied that the doctor who sees him is a doctor who is interested in him and not interested in the Pneumoconiosis Act with all its various stages. Pneumoconiosis is the main industrial disease in this country. It occurs in other places than mines. It occurs in quarries, in cement factories, amongst those who live near to cement factories, those who live near asbestos mines. We know of a man who worked in the Johannesburg Tramway Company and who developed pneumoconiosis because the tram in which he either took the tickets or drove, passed near the City Deep Mine. We know that. All those things happen. But there are people in the Department of Health who can deal with these matters and they must not shirk their duty. The psychological outlook of the doctor looking after a sick man, whether he is a miner or a sailor, a working man, is different from the doctor who is looking after the interests of an employer or a Government Department. The hon. the Minister of Transport will tell the hon. Minister of Mines that he has very little trouble with his injured workers, very little. The reason is that the same doctors who attend to his railwaymen when they are sick, are the doctors that he can consult when he wants to know whether they are able to work, whether they should be given certain special work, and whether they should be compensated for injuries, etc., etc. The railwayman trusts those doctors and does not think that his doctor is merely serving the hon. Minister of Transport. There will be no peace among the miners until the Minister of Health takes over that department. So much for industrial health.</p>

<p>I want to turn now to the hon. Minister&#x2019;s own Department. The Minister&#x2019;s Department is chronically short of personnel. In fact it is in a bad way in certain very serious aspects. It has almost no pathologists; it has perhaps four or five; so far as I know the Minister has no virologists, although he can call on Dr. Kipps of the University of Cape Town. Sir, these are very serious deficiencies. Many parts of this country are sub-tropical or almost tropical. We have been fortunate up to the present in having on our northern borders countries which were controlled by modern civilized departments of health, and we have been able therefore up to a point to stop disease coming down from the north. It is easy for the Department to control the seaboard. But we are faced with changing factors in this country, changing factors in that our northern borders will need a great deal of protection and we know that protection is not sufficient. We know that the Asiatic flu which came down some three or four years ago, did not come in through the ports&#x2014;it came down from the north. We have the example of the introduction of rabies in 1960 in the north of Zululand. Now that was actually foreseen. The Department of Veterinary Services told me that they knew that it was coming, that they could see it coming down, and yet they were unable to prevent it, and the Department of Health had the misfortune of being faced almost at the same time with three epidemics at a time. There was the outbreak of rabies which made demands on their staff, there was the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which called on their <span class="col_669-670" refersTo="page_0349"/>staff and they had an outbreak of typhus in Port Elizabeth. They were very hard pushed to have sufficient staff to deal with these problems, and I feel that it is time that the hon. the Minister with all the dangers that we face to-day should have a mobile team. He should have somewhere, as should the department of veterinary services&#x2014;but that is not for me to say here&#x2014;have a mobile team which is available and can be called upon at any time to deal with an outbreak of disease. It does not exist. The district surgeons are very much below the required number. I have already drawn attention to the pathologists and the virologists. The importance about virology and pathology is that they serve the purpose of diagnosing diseases, but in addition to that they serve the purpose of manufacturing the antidotes. In the case of rabies we had an example of a breakdown. Temporary it is true, but nevertheless there was a breakdown and had we been dependent solely on the human side of it, we would have been in great difficulties. It came out that the only laboratory capable of manufacturing virus anti-bodies is that which belongs to the Poliomyelitis Research Institute and we had enough stocks of poliomyelitis vaccine to be able to offer their services to the hon. the Minister and to help prepare sufficient rabies vaccine. But what was the quantity they could produce? It was shocking that in the whole of South Africa from the human aspect virus preparations, anti-bodies, were reduced to 900 doses per week. Now, Mr. Speaker, virus diseases will not wait until these vaccines are prepared, and here again I emphasize the deficiency of pathological manufacturing departments in this country. Those of us who take an interest in the scientific aspect of the spread of viruses know to-day how near the edge we are moving when there could be an outbreak.</p>

<p>Let us look at the point of view of what this Minister&#x2019;s Department has done in regard to research. Medical research was put under the care of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Now the hon. the Minister must not come and tell me that the Du Toit Commission recommended this. The Du Toit Commission did not recommend it. I have made a close study of the recommendations of the Du Toit Commission, and I find that the Du Toit Commission, while it recommended that there should be close cooperation between this Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and medical research, nevertheless recommended that they should not be amalgamated. But they did say: Establish a Council for Research in Medical Science and in that council place research in medicine, in human pathology, in human research, in animal research, and also research into dental diseases. Had that recommendation been implemented, great benefit would have come to the Department of Health and to the Department of Veterinary Services. Because more and more is medical science and veterinary science learning that there is very little difference between the human animal and other animals when it comes to disease. But diseases which have one name in veterinary services are not recognized in the human services as being the same disease, and it is only by the identification of the actual virus that we will be able to appreciate what is happening to us when new viruses appear and what is happening to the animals when new virus diseases appear among them. I regard it as a most urgent matter that medical and veterinary and dental research should be put under one control, and that control, I believe, should be the Minister of Health. There is a country which does this to some extent and that is the Commonwealth of Australia, where all quarantine has been placed under the care of the Minister of Health. He is solely responsible for all varieties of quarantine and the quarantine outlook of the Commonwealth of Australia has been magnificent. It has of course the advantage that they are an island, an island under single control, but it is one of the few countries which has been able to keep itself free of rabies. Very few other countries are free of rabies. Scientists believe that these viruses can be changed and the research into this aspect is so essential to this country. Even the hon. Minister&#x2019;s own farm at Claremont where they manufacture the vaccine for smallpox is not controlled by a virologist. So short are we of these particular scientists. I feel that every effort, no matter at what cost, should be made by the Minister to train more virologists and pathologists and to get them into his Department. I don&#x2019;t want the hon. Minister to think that I am not appreciative of what he has done with these two commissions. I am not in a position to criticize, to approve or to disapprove of them. Their reports are not available. I feel that when they are available I shall try to consider them with an objective mind, but it is not possible to criticize or even to discuss something which one has not seen. I do feel, however, that in the diversion of his attention as far as these matters are concerned, which in their way are trivial matters compared with the large problems of poverty and health, the large problems of prevention, when you see the country as a whole and the people as a whole, the Minister cannot do justice to his task. If he wants to know one of the main reasons why medical costs are high. I can tell him. I am not running politics, but if you will realize that a hospital like our Durban hospital has to run a European section, has to run an Asiatic section, has to run an Afro-Asiatic and a Euro-african section, and has to run a Bantu section, you can well see how all this adds to the cost structure. We have to face that fact.</p>

<p>One or two things, however, the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark did mention which I still want to refer to. He spoke about our having our own pharmacopoeia. I don&#x2019;t think the hon. gentleman has given that all the thought it needs. The cost of a pharmacopoeia is colossal. It is a highly technical book of many pages, running into thousands. It is like a dictionary. <span class="col_671-672" refersTo="page_0350"/>It would mean that it would have to be translated, which under the technical circumstances probably would be impossible. To ask that the Bureau of Standards should be prepared to undertake this task is, I do not want to say absurd, but certainly far beyond their capacity. They have not got the time to do it.</p>

<p>The great thing that we have to realize is that medicine is universal. Whether you learn to be a doctor in Cape Town, or whether you learn to be a doctor in Berlin, it does not make any difference, and the countries whose pharmacopoeia we use in general are Britain, where the pharmacopoeia has been compiled probably over 50 or more years, and where it is constantly kept up to date, and the United States, and that is quite enough for us, and there is no lowering of our dignity because we use someone else&#x2019;s pharmacopoeia.</p>

<p>I know, but I see no reason to make this change.</p>

<p>Another matter to which the hon. member drew attention was the shortage of dentists. My own feeling is that we must try to find a way of lowering the cost structure of dental treatment. The unfortunate dentist has only so many half-hours per day; he can deal with one patient in half-an-hour as a rule. In addition to this he is a human being and he has to stand on his feet while he works; few people can stand on their feet for more than about eight hours a day, especially as they increase in years. Furthermore, during much of his work his position is twisted, his body is twisted, and it is not unusual to find that dental surgeons tend to break down as a result of the condition of their legs or their backs rather than that they get old mentally. So in America, while they have a lot of quacks, nevertheless they have introduced a system of dental aids who are trained to the extent that they can prepare a cavity. We must face the fact that the bulk of the dentist&#x2019;s work is the preservation of the teeth which are carious and in which cavities are appearing, by clearing out the cavities and by filling the cavities, the dentist saves your teeth. So there are now being trained in America, and used, dental assistants who prepare a cavity under the supervision of a qualified dentist, who then if he decides that it is satisfactorily done, proceeds himself to fill the cavities. They employ two or three of these aids, and in that way the cost structure of dental treatment may be reduced. But if we carry on as we are, Sir, there is not the slightest hope of lowering the cost structure of dental treatment. The man, as I say, has only so many hours and only so many years that he can work; he has to spend five of his years to learn his work. It is a fallacy to think that he makes money out of selling teeth. He does not. His cost structure is very carefully controlled so that you have to find some way by which he can treat more patients in a given time than is possible under our present system.</p>

<p>I beg the hon. Minister again to try and see his Ministry from a wide point of view. I would suggest that he should resign his portfolio of Posts and Telegraphs, because I believe that it is not within the capacity of any human being to be Minister of Health in this country unless he devotes his full time to it. I would further suggest to him to see that research work in the university medical schools is helped, that they do not have to go cap in hand to the C.S.I.R. and ask for funds. Why should the Minister of Economic Affairs control medical research, because that is what it amounts to. The Department of Health has ceased to take an interest in it. The universities are hard up, they cannot keep their research workers. Medical research workers are going. None are coming in. There is always an interchange of men between universities, but if we could only find out the number of topgrade doctors who have left this country&#x2014; not for political reasons generally, but because unsatisfactory conditions of work and research, and lack of chances for their children to be themselves doctors and research workers, we would be alarmed. The hon. the Minister should see the size of the problem that he is faced with, and he should not waste his time tinkering with the little committees that he appoints.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I second the amendment.</p>

<p>At the outset I should like to say that I share the concern expressed by the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) of the fact that this side of the House has not been made aware, nor has had copies made available to it of the report of the Snyman Commission. Only this morning an application was made to have sight of and reference to this report and the reply was given that copies are not yet available. I think it is most regrettable that this side of the House has been deprived of that courtesy.</p>

<p>There are some points arising out of the speech of the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) I should like to touch on. I followed the information he gave with the greatest interest, and I feel that some of the points he made are worthy of comment. One of the salient points in the recommendations of the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark was that the manufacture of drugs and chemicals in South Africa should be undertaken primarily in this country, and I understood him to say, primarily by South Africans. With that remark, I think, we can all agree. But if we take that position to its logical conclusion, we find that we need skilled people to perform the tasks necessary to manufacture drugs. I&#x2019;ll go into greater detail a little later on regarding the position in the labour market in so far as skilled pharmaceutical services are concerned. I hope the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark will take cognisance of the danger that is facing us in that direction. Another reference was made to a disability that is inherent in the provision that a manufacturer of medicines has to appoint a chemist to be the managing director of the body corporate which manufactures <span class="col_673-674" refersTo="page_0351"/>the particular medicines. I believe that the absence of a chemist and druggist from the commission was the cause of a misunderstanding of the position, and I believe the difficulties which led to the conclusions in the report of the commission of inquiry, are more hypothetical than real. I believe that an amendment of the Medical and Pharmacy Act, could easily overcome that difficulty. I am certain the hon. the Minister is aware of the position and that he knows of the solution which will be forthcoming that will overcome this difficulty. But I would like to put a hypothetical case to the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark so that he can appreciate the danger if the control of the manufacture of medicines passes outside the scope of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act. If such control were only enforced in terms of Section 37 of the Act, which lays down certain acts which may be performed by certain individuals such as chemists and druggists, if those are the only conditions applicable to the manufacture of medicine, you could reach a position where six small manufacturing organizations could engage one chemist and druggist who would operate on a rota and go along to these various manufacturers and supervise the manufacture of a particular medicine and then pass on and give his services to another member of such a combine. I believe that such a practice would not be in the interest of the public. The hon. member for Vanderbijlpark referred to the rising cost of medicine, but I think we must put this in its true perspective. He referred specifically to medical services and to medicine. I believe from figures, which are accurate, that in comparatively recent times many of the expensive preparations which form a large proportion of the prescriptions which are dispensed under present circumstances have undergone a considerable reduction in price. I make bold to say that antibiotics, taking the whole field of antibiotics, the various cortisone preparations and their derivatives, would possibly represent 20 per cent to 30 per cent of a chemist&#x2019;s dispensing turnover, in the number of prescriptions, and from figures which I have&#x2014; and they are authentic&#x2014;it is pleasing to note that various antibiotic capsules have enjoyed a considerable reduction in price. I do not propose to refer to them by name, but a well-known capsule which retailed not so long ago, in 1961, at R7 for 16 capsules was reduced last year to R4.35. A similar preparation in liquid form, which was originally R3.08, is now R1.71. In regard to cortisone preparations there has also been a reduction. I believe the original price of some of these preparations was as high as R15 for 30 tablets. to-day the price is R1.85. I believe that is something of which this House should be made aware.</p>

<p>The hon. member also referred to the question of the South African pharmacopoeia and I would like to enlarge briefly upon what the hon. member for Durban (Central) said. This matter has exercised the minds of those who are responsible for the use of the pharmacopoeia in South Africa, and for seeing that it is the medium of teaching in the colleges. As late as 1961 the Secretary for Health said that the question of the translation of the British Pharmacopoeia and other official reference books had been considered by the Department in 1958, when they came to the decision that as Che Union still had to import most of the drugs used for medicinal purposes, the compilation of a South African pharmacopoeia might result in a drug shortage, as the larger overseas manufacturing houses might not be willing to manufacture drugs which comply with the specifications for a relatively small market. The enormous cost of translating and producing Afrikaans versions would be prohibitive. But I know that a suggestion has been put to the Minister and I am sure it enjoys his consideration, that the establishment of a South African formulary should be proceeded with as soon as practicable and that it should be in both official languages. Reference was made by the hon. member for Durban (Central) to the expression &#x201C;timeous&#x201D;, which the mover of the motion included in his remarks. I would like to endorse that. This matter is not being done timeously; it is long overdue. If one goes back just a little into the past, one realizes that some of the things the hon. member has in mind when he moved his motion came to the attention of this House as early as 1937. It was not actually discussed by the House, but the matter did receive the attention of a Select Committee. I am referring to the Proprietary Medicines and Appliances Bill of 1937, almost 26 years ago. Now we have a call for positive action and I feel that there is a strange anomaly. No one will deny that there is urgency in supplying health and welfare services to the people, but it seems to me at this stage that to stress the urgency of the question is premature. We have the report of the Snyman Commission. I have explained that it has not been made available to all of us who are interested in it, and it would appear that legislation may be introduced without many people who are vitally concerned in such legislation being able to give the matter the full benefit of their consideration.</p>

<p>In regard to medical aid schemes, progress has been made. A council has been appointed. I have in my possession&#x2014;I doubt whether many members of the House have&#x2014;the rules which Dr. Reinach&#x2019;s Council has produced in regard to these schemes. But this, too, has come late, and in my opinion does not go far enough. The real problem has been the failure of the Government in the past to recognize the need to assist people in so far as the establishment, co-ordination, maintenance and operation of medical aid schemes are concerned. The people most affected and who need help most urgently are those in the middle income groups which comprise the largest proportion of our population. I feel that there are certain provisions under the existing legislation which there are to protect and help poor people. The wealthy people, although they might find the cost of medical services excessive, are in a position to meet that cost, but it is mainly for the middle income groups <span class="col_675-676" refersTo="page_0352"/>that the demand for assistance exists. While I realize that there are numerous medical aid schemes in existence, as far as I know they operate only for White people, and I feel that the ultimate aim should be to include all the citizens of the Republic in some form of medical aid scheme. I am not suggesting a form of national health insurance, but I believe that the Government and the Department of Health must accept a greater responsibility in assisting the members of the public to combat this great fear of sickness. We know that a great variety of schemes are in existence. I believe that the Reinach Council will try to co-ordinate all those schemes. There are numerous disadvantages in the operation of these schemes. Many of them have expensive and top-heavy management structures resulting either in an excessive contribution by the members or a reduction in the benefits enjoyed. Other schemes operate on a restricted list of medicaments, and it means that the members are deprived of access to a wide range of drugs which the modern physician regards as necessary. In any case, I do not believe that all schemes cater for all the basic essentials which are so necessary in the eyes of the people. I submit that any scheme should include medical care, surgical care, the provision of medicines, hospitalization, facilities for X-rays, pathological examinations, dental services and maternity benefits, and it should be the immediate aim to co-ordinate a scheme which would provide the citizens of our country with all these services.</p>

<p>I referred in my opening remarks to the question of the limitation in the number of skilled people and I believe that the implementation of any scheme as envisaged by the Reinach Council or by the Department, or by the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark, for that matter, will need an increased number of skilled personnel. Let us look at the personnel which will be required to administer such a scheme. Primarily it will consist of medical men, dentists, chemists and druggists and the nursing services. I should like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the Minister to the very serious position which may well arise in regard to the provision of pharmaceutical services, and I should like to quote briefly from the report of the National Bureau of Educational and Social Research published in 1960 and which, in the chapter dealing with chemists and druggists, refers to what is known as the Bremer Commission or Committee of Inquiry into the training of chemists and druggists, which was appointed in 1951. This is what the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Committee is certain that bearing in mind the rapid development of the country, both industrially and otherwise, there will be a progressively increasing demand for pharmacists in South Africa. The large non-European population is becoming more health-conscious and there is a tendency to go more and more to pharmacists for medicinal requirements. The shortage of trained pharmacists in the hospital services must be met &#x2026; It is thus essential for the future needs of the country that a larger number of pharmacists must qualify than at present.</block>

<p>It might be well to look at the position then. In 1947 to 1950,545 chemists and druggists trained and qualified in the Republic. The Committee appointed in 1951 suggested that the annual increase in the number trained should be 30 per cent, and that at least 200 per annum would be needed to make up for the expansion envisaged in the country. But what are the facts? Taking the figures for the three years from 1959 to 1962,197 new chemists and druggists were added to the register, or 66 per annum. The ceiling fixed in 1960 was 200.</p>

<p>Reverting to the question of medical aid societies, I feel that the need for the establishment of such societies has been due to the fear of the population of sickness and the expenses arising therefrom, but I believe that one of the factors which aggravates the whole position is the question of self-medication. I believe that self-medication in this country is something which cannot be ignored continually. I believe that ultimately it enormously increases the cost of the treatment of people. I believe that one has to analyse the whole position of what can be called the cost of being sick. Let us just take a very simple example of the man who has a cough and decides, after reading a tempting advertisement in the newspaper, that he will try a certain cough mixture, and having done so, he tries another and another, and finally he is convinced that he should see his doctor, and the doctor diagnoses tuberculosis. The expense involved in treating the patient at that stage is a terrific drain on the resources, of the State and it is a tremendous financial loss to the individual concerned. That is also a factor which deserves very careful consideration. Self-medication leads to the injudicious use of many drugs, and many of the drugs which are available can be used injudiciously with harmful results. It was with this in mind that I tabled a question to the Minister in an attempt to get information concerning the injudicious use of drugs. I asked the Minister whether he had any information about the tragic consequences of the injudicious use of drugs by the public, and if so, how many cases, and what drugs were concerned, and also whether his Department had found the existing method of control adequate for the protection of the public. The reply given by the Minister indicated that, firstly, no reliable statistical information existed, but&#x2014; &#x201C;in the light hereof, and having regard to the recommendation of the Commission of Inquiry into the High Costs of Medical Services and Medicines, that legislation should be introduced to provide more effective control over the importation, advertisement and sale of drugs, the Department is satisfied that better control measures are urgently required in the interests of the public &#x201D;. I do not believe that one can gainsay that remark lightly, but I <span class="col_677-678" refersTo="page_0353"/>think we have to consider the position as it exists to-day and we must ask ourselves whether this matter is so urgent that it cannot wait for the full consideration of the report of the Snyman Commission. This Commission has been given a very high status by the Minister and it has conducted an extensive investigation&#x2014;up to the present it has cost the State about R24,000&#x2014;and yet the findings are not available to the House, although information has been released to various bodies which have a direct interest in the matters under consideration. But it is quite obvious from Press reports received from the bodies which have had access to the report that not only is the question of medical aid to receive priority, but also the question of legislation to establish a board to control various aspects of drugs and medicines. As I see it, this board will control formulation, manufacture and standardization, and it will even play a part in co-operation with the S.A. Bureau of Standards in the examination and testing of drugs. I want to quote from the S.A. Pharmaceutical Journal the impression which certain sections of the public have gained in regard to the power and purpose of this Board&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board, in collaboration with the S.A. Bureau of Standards, which will set up a special department, will study each and every preparation put on the South African market, and if it comes from overseas they will examine each and every overseas test. Only when the Board is satisfied will it be allowed on the South African market. The Board will also examine the prices of such products in relation to their formulation, and if the price appears to be excessive the firm concerned will be advised what the price should be.</block>

<p>That statement was apparently issued to an organization which had the courtesy of a visit from Mr. Kempff, the Secretary of the commission. While no one who is interested in the welfare and health of our country will deny that a board with such objects would serve a very valuable purpose in South Africa, I feel that before it is established it must be put on a sound foundation and it must enjoy the support and the co-operation of every single facet of the whole aspect of the distribution of drugs and the treatment of sickness. It might be as well just to investigate what the position is at present and to see whether this position has broken down so badly that the need for the appointment of this board becomes one of such great urgency. Sir, we have had control. At present the control of what might be called drugs which may have unpleasant side effects is vested in a conjoint committee comprising members of the S.A. Medical Council and of the S.A. Pharmacy Board. I think few people would admit that the functioning of that body is perfect or adequate, but I would point out that South Africa has fortunately not had to suffer the tragedies of the Thalidomide cases which have been prevalent in so many of the Western countries of Europe. So it would seem, therefore, that there is control and that it operates with a fair degree of success. It might be interesting to investigate briefly how the system works.</p>

<p>In so far as habit-forming drugs are concerned, they are under very strict control. The amount of habit-forming drugs which can come into the country is settled by negotiation with the World Health Organization and the handling of habit-forming drugs all along the line of manufacture and distribution is safeguarded by the provisions of Section 65 of the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act. I believe this position is perfectly satisfactory because the control insists on the keeping of registers by anyone who has the power to dispense habit-forming drugs, and I would say that among the pharmaceutical outlets there must be some 2,000 registers kept. As far as medical men are concerned, those who do their own dispensing are also obliged by law to keep a habit-forming drug register. But how often are these registers inspected? I know cases where five years have elapsed before the register was inspected, and that is not an isolated case. I believe that is the crux of the difficulty which will arise after the establishment of this Board of Control, the question of policing the requirements of the Board of Control and seeing that its recommendations are carried out. It is quite obvious that at present the Department lacks the necessary personnel to effect the number of inspections necessary to safeguard the welfare of the public.</p>

<p>We also have the question of potentially harmful drugs. There again, ample legislative control exists in the form of Section <i>65bis,</i> but I say advisedly that paragraphs (5) and (6) of Section <i>65bis</i> are seldom, if ever, adhered to, and there has been no attempt by the Department, to my knowledge, at any time since the Act was promulgated in 1954 to implement those provisions which the Minister himself said last year in this House he felt were necessary. He was asked to withdraw this control, but he said he could not see his way open to doing so, and yet these provisions are not enforced; and I submit it is primarily due to the fact that the Department of Health has too few inspectors and is involved in the implementation of too many Acts. It has to deal with the Public Health Act, the Food. Drugs and Disinfectant Act, the Therapeutic Substance Regulations, the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act, to mention but a few of the major Acts, and I think the Department has shown that due to its lack of staff it is incapable of implementing all these Acts as they should be implemented. I have dealt with the question of the distribution of drugs by people who are trained by their profession and calling to handle drugs, but what is the position in regard to the distribution of potentially harmful drugs, which is permitted in certain cases by people with little or no training at all? I am referring to those people who are granted permission under the Medical, Dental and Pharmacy Act to hold poison <span class="col_679-680" refersTo="page_0354"/>licences, and certain of whom are empowered to handle potentially harmful drugs which are registered under the Farm Feeds and Fertilizers Act. There were in 1961 5,616 poison licences. It would be interesting to know how often these registers have been inspected and whether the Department can say with any degree of certainty that every one of these dealers in poisons is carrying out the rigid provisions of the law to safeguard the public. The sad feature of all this is that when contraventions are discovered, which would appear to be to the detriment of the public, there are cases when the police have been reluctant to act. There are many other aspects of the report which will in due course receive the serious consideration of this House, I believe, but I feel at this stage that in view of the fact that so many of the members of this House are not aware of the contents of the report of the commission it would be unwise to deal with it in great detail. I believe it is the wish of all of us that the question of the health and welfare of the people of South Africa should be dealt with expeditiously, but I believe that when we create something which will have to go down in history, something which will deal with all sections of the population and which will help them to overcome their dread of sickness and its attendant expenses, we should do so on the firmest possible foundations. The only way we can do that is for this House to be fully acquainted with the facts of the matter and the decisions made when legislation is put before it. Then I believe it will be possible to produce legislation which will be in the best interests of the people of South Africa and which will stand the test of time.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I should like to begin by thanking the hon. members for Vanderbijlpark (Dr. de Wet) and Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) for their contributions not only to this discussion but also towards the appointment of the Commission of Inquiry and really also for what will be achieved, which to a large extent will be the result of their efforts and their interest. I know the hon. member for Vanderbijlpark has certain doubts about the report of the commission, more as the result of what the commission, according to him, was perhaps not tactful enough to avoid saying. His objection is that the commission dared to make certain statements and to reveal certain facts which may perhaps embarrass some of our medical friends. I should like to point out to the hon. member that when a commission like the Snyman Commission is appointed, it is its duty to reveal everything, even things which are not always pleasant for everybody. If such a commission fails to reveal certain facts it would mean that doubt would be cast on it, and that its report would be much reduced in value. That is unfortunately the position if one wants to be impartial and thorough, because then one must also say things which perhaps one&#x2019;s friends do not like to hear. Unfortunately that is something we just have to accept, and the medical profession also.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Odendaalsrus had one objection which is particularly important, namely that we will perhaps not be able to control these medical schemes, and that is a real danger. Fortunately control over all these organizations was introduced some years ago, in 1956, by the Mutual Aid Societies Act. All these medical schemes and sick funds are subject to that control, which is mainly financial control. I think the hon. member can therefore be assured that financial control already exists, and in so far as health control is concerned, this will now be introduced as soon as the Central Council is clothed with legal authority.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) is one for whom I have great respect. I always regard him as a man who has good and clear ideas, but it is a fact that the best of us sometimes lose the road and I am afraid that this afternoon he did so during the first portion of his speech. That hon. member and the hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) have perhaps connived because they supported each other in their attack on the Government by saying, &#x201C;This thing is long overdue &#x201C;you are always too late, you are always too slow &#x201D;. Just let me remind hon. members of how fast things happened in fact. In the 1959 session, immediately after I was entrusted with this task, there was a discussion on this subject in this House, and I at once promised the House that I would do my best and said that the Government was so interested in the matter that a commission of inquiry would be appointed. That commission started functioning in the beginning of January 1960. The commission completed its investigation and its report, consisting of three volumes, in approximately two years, a really great and magnificent piece of work. I do not think that we have ever in our history had a commission which submitted such a report in a shorter period than this one did. I think it is an outstanding achievement that this commission could complete such high-standing work within two years, together with a report which stands four-square and which can withstand any criticism. But I know what the hon. member&#x2019;s difficulty really is and why perhaps he has not done what his sober self would have let him do, namely that the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) moved a motion last year asking that the State should introduce a medical scheme for everybody. They calculated that it would cost the State R48,000,000 every year. We on this side explained why we thought that although it would be a feasible solution it would, however, be too expensive and less effective than our solution. We gave all the reasons and I do not want to go into them again. Thereafter this commission submitted its report and shortly after that the Central Council for Medical Funds was put into operation, and whilst we are gathered here and the whole of the report has not even been printed yet, that Central Council has <span class="col_681-682" refersTo="page_0355"/>already set to work and is doing very good work. I do not think the hon. member can accuse us of having wasted any time. I think that when he is calm again he will probably get up during the next session and apologize for having so unfairly accused this side of the House. The hon. member unfortunately was not his old reasonable self, because do you know what he did? In his attempt to belittle everything that was done, he launched an attack on the energetic way in which the Department combated polio throughout the country. South Africa is one of the first countries in the Western world which combated polio on a national scale and it is now taking the next step in order to eradicate it finally in South Africa. [Quorum.] The hon. member will remember that other great countries of the world have already tried to tackle the problem but that they were faced with such problems that they became afraid and ceased their attempts, but that South Africa is one of the first countries in the world on this side of the Iron Curtain which has really managed to achieve so much success in combating polio. The hon. member then said: &#x201C;Oh, how many polio victims are there? There are only a few and you are just becoming emotional because you see that these people are crippled; it does not make so much difference.&#x201D; But the hon. member must remember that in some years there were over 3.000 cases of polio&#x2014;3,000 people who could have been crippled for the rest of their lives and would have been of no use, or of very little use, to society. But this he regards as being of little importance; it is just a trivial matter. He says that we are concerned with trivialities instead of tackling such great problems as tuberculosis. But the hon. member should not forget that ever since the time of Dr. Bremer we have been tackling tuberculosis seriously. The hon. member forgets that in South Africa we are faced with a problem in connection with tuberculosis which one does not find in other European countries, namely that the people who contract tuberculosis are mainly the Bantu, a large percentage of whom do not submit themselves for investigation or treatment. Our problem in combating tuberculosis is not to make a man healthy when once he has tuberculosis. We can do that, and we do everything in our power, but the problem, as the hon. member for Middelland (Mr. P. S. van der Merwe) said, is first to discover this man, and we have endless problems because we have many mountains and valleys and there are many millions of Bantu who hide themselves there.</p>

<p>I find it peculiar that the hon. member on the one hand condemned the Department and us, but soon thereafter he became himself again and pleaded that nutrition should be placed under this bad Department, this Department of Health which has really done nothing, and which was asleep the whole time. Nutrition must now be placed under this Department and it is wrong to put it under any other department, and industrial health must be put under this Department because it is wrong to put it under any other department, and the same applies to asbestosis and pneumoconiosis because the Mines Department cannot handle it as well. Research must be placed under this Department and should no longer be under the C.S.I.R. On the one hand the hon. member condemned this Department &#x2026;</p>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister? Is it not a fact that you spent R80,000 on polio and that you allowed only R5,000 for the use of B.C.G. for a much more serious disease, B.C.G. which is almost as effective in combating tuberculosis as vaccine is in combating polio.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_health">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HEALTH</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has again spoken too hastily. Let me just remind him of the problems of B.C.G. The hon. member will know that we started the new B.C.G. only very recently. The old B.C.G., as he knows, could only be injected after the man had been tested. If one now tests the Bantu, one knows only in five days&#x2019; time whether B.C.G. can be injected, and by that time he has disappeared completely. Then the hon. member should also remember that the new B.C.G. is only about 80 per cent effective. It is not as effective as the polio vaccine by far. The polio vaccine is 100 per cent effective. B.C.G. is only a preventive measure, and even though we use it we still do not reach those hundreds of thousands of Natives who hide in the mountains and hide their children in their homes. That problem still remains.</p>

<p>The other problems referred to by the hon. member for Durban (Central) unfortunately have nothing to do with the one under discussion to-day, namely these medical schemes and the Snyman Report. Therefore the hon. member should not blame me for not replying, but I want to ask him to be so good as to raise the matter again under my vote when the House is in committee on the Estimates, when I will give him the standpoint of this side of the House.</p>

<p>There was one complaint with which I have sympathy, namely that the printed report of the Snyman Commission is not available yet. Just let me inform hon. members what has been done. On 31 October&#x2014;really on 1 November&#x2014;this report was released for publication. Various copies of the report were then studied in roneoed form. The Press, the medical Press and all the other interested bodies could then peruse it, and the main contents of the report were announced generally. About 40 copies were also made available to the Medical Council, of which the hon. member is a member, and to the Pharmaceutical Association, of which the hon. member for Durban (Berea) is a member, and quite a number of other persons and bodies. There were always roneoed copies available for those who were sufficiently interested in the matter, but the hon. member for Durban (Berea) has just told us that this morning, shortly before this debate began, he went to the Department and that the Department could not provide him <span class="col_683-684" refersTo="page_0356"/>with a copy. But surely he asked for it a little late. I think if he had taken the trouble to ask for a copy a little earlier, I myself would have been able to assist him. Now let me just say this. The Afrikaans copy of the report has already been printed; the first proofs have been passed and we are just awaiting the final proofs. The English translation has almost been completed, after which it will of course also go to the printers. At the latest we hope that both will be available in the beginning of April, but I still hope that long before that date we will be able to make printed copies available, at least in Afrikaans, to hon. members who are interested in it.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Berea) had one objection to this commission, namely that there was no chemist on it. It is very difficult to appoint to a commission all the people who may possibly be interested in it directly or indirectly. The only principle to adopt in appointing a commission is to appoint honourable and efficient persons who can listen to all the evidence and then give their decision as honourable, intelligent and trained men, on the basis of the evidence submitted to them. May I point out to the hon. member that evidence was given before this commission by the S.A. Pharmaceutical Association itself by the S.A. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers&#x2019; Association, by the Wholesale Drug Trade Association, by the Retail Chemists&#x2019; Association, etc. In other words, ample evidence was submitted to the commission by all the various interests represented by the hon. member for Durban (Berea). Therefore I do not think he can for one moment accuse the commission of not devoting its attention thoroughly to all the problems affecting the chemists&#x2019; profession.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I have not much time at my disposal, but perhaps I should say a few things with reference to what was stated here to-day. The hon. members for Vanderbijlpark, Odendaalsrus and Durban (Central) all pointed out that medical costs are steadily increasing in South Africa and that this is something which severely affects every citizen. For years already the State has been asked to take action. Let me give the history of the matter as it started in 1959, when this matter was entrusted to me for the first time. After the Snyman Commission was appointed in the beginning of 1960, in order to speed up the matter, we appointed a departmental committee under Dr. Reinach to make a study, apart from medical schemes, with a view to including the population in such schemes in order to safeguard them from high medical costs. This departmental report, an excellent piece of work, was later handed to the Snyman Commission which accepted it with only slight changes. I think this report of the Snyman Commission is an excellent one. It is a well considered document and the findings and recommendations of the commission are all based on facts and figures, and I think this report will for many years still be accepted in South Africa as a standard work on conditions here. The commission found what we had so often said in this House in the past, that practically the greatest proportion of the non-White population and the less privileged section of the White population are already well covered medically in South Africa by free hospital services and by the services of district surgeons, but it pointed out that the great majority of Whites are very heavily burdened by the high cost of medicine, which is steadily increasing, and it also pointed out that in order to protect themselves this middle class established medical aid schemes and sick funds for themselves. This idea, says the commission, has particularly come to the fore since the end of the Second World War. When the commission reported there were already 245 schemes in operation, apart from insurance schemes. They point out that already 48 per cent of the population is served by such schemes. These schemes have, in other words, shown that they fulfil the need. They have shown that they were effective, and what we now have to do is simply to expand those systems to cover the whole population. The advantages of that are much greater than the advantages of the scheme suggested here by the hon. member for Durban (Central). In the first place, the State will save that enormous amount of R48,000,000 per annum which the hon. member himself estimated, and in fact the State will have a service which is much more effective at a much lower cost. It is a service which promotes the self-respect of the members of the scheme, because the people participating in the scheme organize it themselves; they elect their own executives; they build up those associations themselves. Everywhere we find that those associations&#x2019; executives consist of inspired people who mostly do the work in their spare time, selflessly, simply in order to render a service to their fellowmen. We find that the administrative costs are low, because these are voluntary services and because the members of the executive are so unselfish that they often do not even claim travelling expenses for themselves. We also find that the costs are low because in most cases the employer co-operates. One finds that the employers are willing to bear the administration costs of those schemes, often not only to the extent of 25 per cent, but even up to 100 per cent. In addition, one finds that those schemes promote a good spirit between employers and employees. Surely it would have been most unfair and most unreasonable to destroy that splendid system and to replace it by a State scheme such as suggested by the hon. members for Rosettenville and Durban (Berea).</p>

<p>The Snyman Commission then went further and as positive steps it recommended that a Central Council for Medical Schemes should be established, a special body in the Department of Health which can then persuade the rest of the population of South Africa, that 52 per cent of people who are not yet organized in medical schemes and sick funds, to join such associations or to establish new ones. But that Council will in the second place try to improve the existing schemes, as far as possible, to remedy their defects and to <span class="col_685-686" refersTo="page_0357"/>straighten out their difficulties, because hon. members will remember that many of these schemes have certain shortcomings, Some of them, e.g., do not provide for dental services, for childbirth and for treatment by specialists. All these are matters which the Snyman Commission regards as essential for any good medical scheme. But we also find other shortcomings in these sick funds. The Snyman Commission found, e.g., that there are certain sick funds or medical schemes which do the following: As long as a man is ill but still alive they do very little for him, but the moment he dies they assist in regard to medical expenses, death benefits and disability allowances. In other words, they first allow the man to die and then they render assistance, whilst the object of the sick fund is in the first place to assist a man during his lifetime and the other things are secondary. If one can make a man healthy, one indeed assists him.</p>

<p>There are still other problems arising in connection with these medical schemes and sick funds, and that is their relationship with medical men and the medical profession, because in every sick fund it is the doctor who renders the services. Every sick fund really revolves round the medical profession, and sound co-operation with the medical profession is absolutely essential if one wants to place these schemes and sick funds on a sound basis. Therefore the Snyman Commission says that one of the main tasks of this Central Council should be to establish sound co-operation between the medical profession and these schemes.</p>

<p>First Order read: Second Reading, &#x2014;Divorce Laws Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>This Bill deals with a very small subdivision of our marriage laws in general and in particular with our divorce laws. I want to say right in the beginning that our divorce laws in South Africa have become antiquated to a large extent and that they should be investigated on a national basis, and if this Bill of mine to-day focuses the attention of the public on the abuses created by one of the provisions of our divorce laws, I will be very happy.</p>

<p>By way of introduction I also want to say that I am aware that this Bill I am introducing to-day contains quite a few defects which can be eliminated at a later stage, but I want to ask hon. members who participate in this debate at this stage to concentrate on the question of principle as to whether the institution known as judicial separation should be abolished or not. Before I explain the Bill as such I think it is necessary to give particularly the lay members in the House a brief exposition of the legal rules concerned in a judicial separation. This term means that although a married couple are still joined by marriage, the spouses no longer live together and cannot demand conjugal rights from each other. In other words, this couple remain married but do not live together as man and wife, nor do they have a common household. Hence the term &#x201C;skeiding van tafel en bed&#x201D;, or separation.</p>

<p>The institution of judicial separation can come about in two ways. The first is by way of a bare agreement between the parties neither to live together nor to demand conjugal rights from each other, but without dissolving the marriage. These agreements entered into by spouses can of course be put into the form, as is usually done, of a notarial deed entered into before a notary public, hence the term &#x201C;notarial judicial separation &#x201D;. Where such a notarial judicial separation exists between a man and his wife, the one cannot demand marital privileges from the other before the court has cancelled that agreement.</p>

<p>The second way in which it can be done is by means of an order of a competent court, hence the second name of the other type of separation, namely judicial separation. Such an order is issued on the same grounds as for a divorce, but also on other grounds with which I shall deal in a moment. I just want to draw the attention of hon. members to the fact that Clause 1 of this Bill provides for the abolition of the institution of judicial separation. Spouses are, however, not prohibited from entering into a notarial deed providing for separation. It is only the judicial order for separation which is sought to be abolished.</p>

<p>Clause 2 deals with existing orders of court or deeds of separation, and provides that they may be set aside. Clause 3 deals with notarial deeds of separation which remain in force but which will also be subject to the rule that they can be cancelled by a court, by a divorce order or other order of a competent court. I just want to point out that I am not asking for the abolition of the institution of separation on the basis of the many grounds on which a separation may be obtained. I do not really want to go into those grounds, because I base my submission that this institution should be abolished not on the multiplicity of grounds on which such an order may be obtained, but rather on the abuses flowing from it.</p>

<p>I just want to mention these grounds so that hon. members, and particularly the lay members of the House, may see how easy it really is to obtain a separation. According to the English sacrament a marriage is an institution <span class="col_687-688" refersTo="page_0358"/> &#x201C;for better or for worse &#x201D;. But it happens so often that if the &#x201C;worse&#x201D; happens, one party or the other takes refuge in a separation. I want to quote from Prof. Hahlo&#x2019;s book, &#x201C;The South African Law of Husband and Wife&#x201D;, page 314. These are the grounds on which a separation may be obtained&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any form of deliberate cruelty or neglect. Any conduct calculated to hurt or injure, mentally or physically, which does not injure or hurt seriously, having regard to the type of person concerned, is a matrimonial wrong on which an action for a judicial separation may be based.</block>

<p>Then he gives 17 different grounds. I want to mention them briefly&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The following may serve as examples: Physical violence, refusal of sexual intercourse where no good reason exists, insistence upon sexual intercourse where some good reason exists why intercourse should not take place; excessive or abnormal sexual demands; the husband&#x2019;s compelling the wife to live in a place where she is submitted to abuse or indignities by others; continual use of foul or indecent language; habitual intemperance; persistent failure on the part of the husband to provide a home or support for his family; persistent nagging; refusal by the husband to treat the plaintiff as his wife; contemptuous treatment of the plaintiff before others; false charges of infidelity; reckless charges of serious crimes; continual allusion to a condoned indiscretion; boasting or admission of adultery; unnatural practices by the husband with another man or by the wife with another woman; unduly intimate association with a person of the other sex even though it falls short of adultery.</block>

<p>There are an enormous number of grounds on which a separation may be obtained. Now what is the object of a separation? What is the object of an institution in terms of which a couple remains man and wife but do not live together? It is generally admitted that the object is for the parties to become reconciled; a reconciliation must take place. In other words it is to give the parties a period of time in which to get rid of their ill-feeling towards each other and of all their inhibitions. But it is a fact of which all the welfare workers and all the organizations dealing with broken marriages, and all legal practitioners in the country, are aware, viz. that this reconciliation which is supposed to take place as the result of a separation takes place only by way of the greatest exception. <i>I</i> have been practising as an attorney for 25 years already and I have not come across any case in my practice where a reconciliation took place. If the matter goes further at all, it only results in a divorce. It is almost incomprehensible, with the knowledge we have to-day, that we can still think of letting a man and his wife live separately in order that they may become reconciled. It is incongruous. If one looks at the object of this institution one must declare unequivocally that it is really useless. It does not comply with its object, viz. to obtain the desired reconciliation. What is more, in some cases those laudable objects do not exist at all. Because if there is a separation, e.g. on the ground of adultery, there need not and there cannot be a later reconciliation. I again want to quote from Hahlo on page 333, where he says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Certain matrimonial offences are of such enormity that the innocent spouse is entitled to live permanently away from the guilty spouse even though the latter has become a reformed character. Thus, where the decree of separation was granted on the ground of adultery, the guilty spouse cannot obtain a rescission of the decree even if he has lived a chaste life since the decree was granted and is not likely to repeat his offence.</block>

<p>So if a poor man has always lived a chaste life, an irreproachable life, he still cannot get rid of the order of judicial separation between him and his wife. In other words, in that case there can never be a reconciliation. Now one asks oneself: Why have an institution with that object if the object cannot be attained? This is not the case only in regard to adultery. It says, &#x201C;certain other matrimonial offences of enormity &#x201D;. There can be other such offences also. I think, for example, of homosexuality. Also in that case, even though he lives a very chaste life thereafter, he will not be able to escape the order of court.</p>

<p>It is particularly in cases where &#x201C;matrimonial offences of enormity&#x201D; were committed that we get the many tragic cases we come across. I have a thick file of correspondence which I have received from people all over the country in this regard. Most of the tragic cases are due to that type of contravention. My proposition is that this institution simply does not serve its purpose. It is an unnecessary institution and ought to be abolished.</p>

<p>I want to draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to the consequences of a separation. There are firstly the personal consequences, and secondly the legal consequences. Both these consequences are legal consequences, but there is also <i>a</i> third, the social consequences affecting the children. The personal consequences are briefly, that the marriage is really suspended. It remains in existence but in so far as the parties are concerned it is really suspended. In other words one has a marriage, but no consequences flow from it. What one retains is nothing but an empty shell. The pith and essence of the marriage have been removed. All the obligations of the marriage remain, but not a single one of the rights remains. Dr. A. van der Merwe said the following in his thesis on marriage&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In the main there is a dual purpose in a marriage: a personal one which aims at enriching one&#x2019;s life and rendering mutual <span class="col_689-690" refersTo="page_0359"/>assistance, and secondly, the supra-personal, which consists of the procreation and education of children, which also leads to the continued existence of the human race.</block>

<p>By this yardstick, in so far as the personal consequences are concerned if there is a separation, that personal enrichment simply cannot take place. Nothing is left of the marriage. The other one, the procreation of children, cannot take place either. In other words, the good things of a marriage, the objects with which the marriage really took place, are suspended and only an empty shell remains. My submission is that it cannot be said that if the whole essence of the marriage is removed a reconciliation can take place so that a full married life can be resumed.</p>

<p>I now come to the other consequence, the legal consequences flowing from a marriage. Also these are suspended to some extent. In this regard I want to say that we have enough legislation in South Africa to provide for a man paying for the maintenance of his wife and children. Both the common law and the Children&#x2019;s Act make ample provision for the maintenance of children. An order of judicial separation, therefore, does not contribute to, or derogate from, the proper maintenance of the children. That is also true in so far as the wife is concerned. I admit that there was a time in the past, before our legislation was amended, when an order of judicial separation was a very useful institution for enabling the wife to retain her maintenance. That, however, is no longer necessary because we passed an Act in 1953, Act No. 37 of 1953, the Marriage Act, in which the whole position is set out very clearly. I want to quote it very briefly. I again quote from Hahlo&#x2019;s book. I do not have the Afrikaans version at my disposal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Court granting a divorce may, notwithstanding the dissolution of marriage, make such order against the guilty spouse for the maintenance of the innocent spouse for any period until the death or until the remarriage of the innocent spouse, whichever event may first occur as the court may deem just, or may make any agreement between the spouses &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is what I want to stress&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; for the maintenance of one of them an order of court and any court of competent jurisdiction may, on good cause shown, which may be a cause other than the financial means of either of the respective spouses, rescind, suspend or vary any such order.</block>

<p>Therefore this Act also provides for the maintenance of the wife, in spite of the fact that the spouses are no longer married. My submission is therefore that also from that point of view, in so far as the legal consequences of such an order are concerned it has become an unnecessary institution and that it should be abolished.</p>

<p>In regard to the other legal consequences, they are the same as in the case of any divorce and they vary from case to case. Those also will not be affected, even though this institution no longer exists. That then brings me to the other consequences of a separation in so far as the children are affected. This is not a legal consequence, but a social consequence which we have to bear in mind. A legal separation, Mr. Speaker, is perhaps a temporary solution for the ill-feeling, the malice and the enmity existing between the parents, but in so far as the children are concerned it is no solution at all because the deleterious effects are precisely the same as in the case of a divorce. The children are in fact the victims, and even to a greater extent. What they lose can never be restored to them. In the case of a divorce there may perhaps be a measure of restoration because the parties may perhaps re-marry and have a good marriage, and those children may again have a father or mother. But in the case of a separation the children will always lack the parental care of the one parent. This is an aspect of this institution which should not be lost sight of. It may assist the parents, but it is very harmful to the children. Sir, I can also quote from my correspondence to show what these unmistakable effects are. I can quote from numerous letters I receive where women, e.g., complain about their sons who had no fathers, and about what has happened to them as the result. On this aspect social workers have expressed some opinions to me. There is another group of children I wish to discuss, and those are the children born illegally as the result of this institution of judicial separation. Their fate is really a tragic one. Therefore separation not only negatives the objects of a marriage &#x2026;</p>

<p>Have you any statistics about the number of separation orders granted?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>"Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately I do not have those statistics, Mr. Speaker, but I am able to quote the statistics of the Rand Supreme Court of last year. Unfortunately I do not have the statistics for the whole of the country because in our statistics&#x2014;I have ascertained that&#x2014;divorces and judicial separations appear under one heading. It is a great pity, but statistics unfortunately are of no assistance to me in this case. I have said that these separations are contrary not only to the objects of a marriage, but are contrary to the whole of human nature. We dare not lose sight of that. More is expected from spouses who have become a prey to this institution than flesh and blood can bear. Because a couple remains married but have to forfeit al) marital privileges, it happens in almost every case that one or other of the spouses succumbs to the temptation to commit adultery. Unfortunately it is particularly the male sex which succumbs to that temptation. I know the weakness of my sex, but it is also obvious that the man is seeking affection, that he seeks <span class="col_691-692" refersTo="page_0360"/>the companionship of the opposite sex. One finds in most cases where a separation has lasted for some years that the man commits adultery and that children are born. Let me quote one case to you, Sir, from the voluminous correspondence I have had in regard to this matter. This is a letter from a woman in Johannesburg. She writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">May I tell you that 12 years ago I got divorced and was to marry a man whose wife said she would divorce him. However, she changed her mind and insisted on a judicial separation. We have been living together as man and wife for all this time and have had a small son. We are paying half of my &#x201C;husband&#x2019;s&#x201D; salary every month to he and have promised to continue to do this until she dies even if she should re-marry again if she would give the divorce, but she simply writes back and says she is not interested and that she will punish us for the rest of our lives. I feel for my little son&#x2019;s sake it is so important to get our affairs on a legal basis. Unfortunately there are so many people in our situation, simply because the third person wants to carry on punishing the &#x201C;guilty&#x201D; party.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this is typical of all the cases that have come to my notice, the type of spite which exists; people who have never learnt the Christian virtue of forgiveness. Who suffers as the result? Not the parties who have to be punished, but the innocent, illegitimate children who have to live their whole lives as such. I know cases where those poor children could not even be christened. That becomes known at school and the child is told: You have not even got a name. All this is the result of the fact that we think we can make a man and a woman live separately whilst married and imagine that they will become reconciled. We do not think of all the consequences it can have, not only for them but also for the next generation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I regard the continued existence of this institution of judicial separation as the direct cause of the birth of such children because, as I say, it is unnatural to expect a man or a woman to remain celibate for the rest of their lives. We are not all priests and nuns. Why should we expect it of these people?</p>

<p>I will come to that in a moment, Sir, I want to quote a few instances from this correspondence dealing with this aspect and to show how people act from spite. I received the following letter from a man in Milnerton. He writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Judicial separation makes a fool of the Supreme Court in that the Court, in granting the order, tells two healthy, normal people to go away, don&#x2019;t molest each other, live the life of a priest or nun&#x2014;that is, commit no adultery, knowing in effect that, to repeat my description of &#x201C;Judicial Separation&#x201D;, it is a farce and humbug. What is meant is, &#x201C;Do as you wish, but don&#x2019;t be found out&#x201D;. So the Court, while granting a divorce order where the parties are honest, and admit adultery, encourages, but soothes its conscience by granting a judicial separation, knowing full well that the judicial separation will provide one of the main grounds of divorce&#x2014;adultery&#x2014;at the first opportunity.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if we do not want to undermine the sanctity of marriage, we should not create an institution which in fact undermines that.</p>

<p>I now come to the abuses. The abuses are not only that the opportunity is taken to act spitefully; there is also a financial aspect, and it has become a sort of method of extortion. I do not think I am going too far when I say that judicial separation has become nothing but a sort of instrument of extortion, particularly in the hands of unscrupulous spouses. Firstly it is asked for, as I say, out of spite, and thereafter it is used by the so-called innocent party to extort more financial benefits than she is entitled to. The one party knows that the other would rather dissolve the marriage, and that fact is then used as a sort of bargaining factor to obtain more than is justified. I want to read a further letter in this regard, from a person in Johannesburg. I may say that most of the persons I am quoting here are very prosperous and prominent members of society. They are people holding high positions in the country, and not just nobodies. But, as the hon. member has pointed out to me. that makes no difference. This person writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">to-day she is in clover with her judicial separation order. Besides earning a salary in the vicinity of R130 per month, she recently received an increase in maintenance from R75 per month to Rall, i.e., a total of R241 per month. Residing in one of her mother&#x2019;s properties, she only pays a rental of R20 per month, and, in addition to her salary and maintenance her husband pays all medical and incidental expenses in connection with his children&#x2019;s welfare. He voluntarily pays the latter expenses because she continually pleads poverty.</block>

<p>Then it continues&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Through the vindictiveness and spitefulness of such women, there are I am sure hundreds of others placed in a similar position who are suffering in silence under what one can only term an out-dated law.</block>

<p>I fully agree with that. Here is a letter from somebody in the Eastern Province. I may say he is a medical specialist and a prominent man in the community. He writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My wife and I were judicially separated in 1934 on the grounds of imcompatibility <span class="col_693-694" refersTo="page_0361"/>and desertion, and it was abundantly proved in legal correspondence beforehand that she was prompted by spite and the desire for maintenance which I have had to pay for over 28 years even although she was earning a salary of about &#x00A3;70 (R140) a month (no dependants) and&#x2014;being married in community of property&#x2014;she still has the legal right to half of my estate.</block>

<p>So it goes on, Sir. People are continually using this weapon. Because she knows that the other spouse would rather have a divorce, because they realize that the marriage is irrevocably ruined and nothing can save it, she uses it as a method of extortion to get more maintenance than she is entitled to. The other person always gives in, thinking: If I do this, she will give me a divorce. In this way I can mention numerous cases, Sir, instances of this type of extortion. In all the correspondence I have had I have come across only one woman who did not welcome this legislation, and that is a woman who is separated and receives maintenance. She is not concerned about the institution itself; she is only concerned about her maintenance. When I wrote back to her saying that in terms of the 1953 Act she can enjoy all the protection she wants, she was also satisfied.</p>

<p>There are three objections to the Bill at the moment. The first is that there are people who on religious grounds do not want a divorce or cannot get it, in terms of their religious faith. I have in mind particularly Roman Catholics, who recognize no divorce. They now have objection to this Bill. my reply to them is threefold. Firstly, if their religion or religious convictions are so strong then those people ought to have the courage of their religious convictions and preserve their marriages, and they should not seek legal measures by means of which they retain only the empty shell of their marriage whilst violating the whole spirit and essence of the marriage. My second reply to them is that such people who do not really want a divorce can still in terms of this Bill, and by means of private agreements, have a separation; they can even have a notarial deed of separation, because that is not abolished in terms of this Bill. Thirdly, my reply to them is this: If they cannot arrive at an agreement to separate and the one spouse makes living together dangerous and intolerable, the other spouse can leave him. She need not live with him. She still has all the protection she desires in terms of the law; she can get all the maintenance she wants. It is not necessary for them to obtain a judicial order of separation. If the one spouse then wants to institute an action for the restitution of conjugal rights, the fact that she can prove that life became intolerable and dangerous can always be advanced as a defence to that action, and that person&#x2019;s action will fail.</p>

<p>The second objection raised to this Bill is one which was raised by Professor Hahlo, whom I may say is regarded as an expert in this sphere. He is a professor at the Witwatersrand University. I can best explain his objection to the Bill as it stands now by giving an example. Clause 2 of the Bill in its present form, says Professor Hahlo, really leads to a contradiction in terms, and I concede that he has good reason for saying so because as the Bill reads now it says that in cases where there is separation either of the parties can apply to court for an order of divorce, or rather an order for restitution of conjugal rights. Supposing a person who lives in adultery sues his wife for restitution of conjugal rights and the court then, as the Bill now reads, has to issue an order for restitution of conjugal rights, it would amount to the court ordering that woman to return to her husband who is already living in adultery and may still live in adultery, which would of course be a ridiculous position. She can then only come back to court and say: I was willing to restore conjugal rights, I was willing to obey the order of court, but this is the position I found. What is the court&#x2019;s position then if she comes to court on the return day and informs the court to that effect? Then the court can only grant a divorce. But it would then be a condonation of adultery and it would be placing her, who is really the injured party, in the wrong. That is a difficult position. I think that in the committee stage, if the Bill reaches that stage, I will try to amend the position to give the court the discretion in that case to act as it thinks fit, which I think will be the best solution.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister of Justice asked a moment ago whether in terms of this Bill there would be additional grounds for divorce. My submission is that no additional grounds for divorce are being added, because by abolishing this institution I think we are really limiting the scope of divorces. If we were to adopt the course suggested by certain of my colleagues, that we should make the Bill read that after a period of one, three or five years these people can then come to court and ask for a final order of divorce, it would be providing an additional ground for divorce, because it would mean that this judicial separation which exists would be regarded as grounds for divorce. My submission is that by merely abolishing it there will be no additional grounds for divorce. If there is now a notarial deed of separation in terms of Clause 3 as it reads now, and divorce is asked for, the grounds for divorce must still exist. There must still have been desertion or adultery. If those grounds are not there, the court will be entitled to say that it cannot grant a divorce. In my opinion no new grounds for divorce are created by this Bill.</p>

<p>I am aware that in the committee stage certain defects in this Bill will have to be amended. To send the matter to a Select Committee before the second reading will of course mean that the divorce laws which are not relevant as a whole now can then be discussed. I want to say that I think the time has arrived when our divorce laws should be investigated, and I would even welcome it if some of my colleagues suggest that the matter should be referred to a Select Committee, even before the <span class="col_695-696" refersTo="page_0362"/>second reading, so that the whole matter may be discussed. I feel that my task to-day is not to try to have this Bill passed in the face of all opposition. That would be a Pyrrhic victory. I want to say that we should merely direct public attention to the matter, and try to remedy the position. Therefore I myself will welcome an amendment to this effect later.</p>

<p>Let me sum up my standpoint. I firstly say that separation totally fails in its object of bringing about conciliation between the spouses. I say further that separation is actually in conflict with and is contrary to the objects of a marriage. My third submission is that separation and its consequences have a cruel effect on the parties themselves and an even more cruel effect on their children, and that separation is abused by people who use it as a method of extortion to get more money than they are entitled to from the other party who wants a divorce. Finally, I say that separation has really become a superfluous institution, because we already have other methods of dealing with these matters.</p>

<p>In June last year it was announced in the Press that I would introduce such a Bill. I may say that I heard nothing from the Bar and the Side Bar officially; I received no official intimation in regard to their attitude. But I spoke to as many members of the Bar and the Side Bar as I could in regard to the matter and all of them are agreed that at least something should be done to improve this state of affairs. They are not all in favour of this form of abolition, but all are agreed that here we have an institution which should be adopted to modern circumstances. Nor did the Churches express an opinion. I may say that this Bill appeared in the <i>Government Gazette</i> as early as December. I have watched the Church periodicals &#x201C;Die Kerkbode&#x201D;, but have not seen anything to intimate that they were opposed to this Bill. I have discussed the matter with social workers and other people, and they are all agreed that at least a change should be made in regard to this matter. In those circumstances I feel at liberty to ask hon. members to support the Bill.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) spoke with obvious feeling here this afternoon, and I appreciate that he did so in order to put the cases of many people who undoubtedly have suffered in certain ways, due, in the opinion of the hon. member, to the institution of judicial separation or notarial deeds of separation. But I shall try and show that their position would have been very little different under the new dispensation should this Bill be passed. I think though that it was the considerable feeling which he brings to bear on this point which perhaps caused the hon. member to rush in where angels would fear to tread; because I must remind him that this institution has been part of the antecedents of our law for very nearly 1,000 years, indeed since the time of the Canon Law and its effect upon the developing Roman Dutch Law in the Middle Ages.</p>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I may say that in Holland in the Sixteenth Century when the law became secularized and shook off the Canon law, the Hollanders of that time retained the institution which is now being debated. I feel that in this attack on this ancient institution, the hon. member for Heilbron has not even had the support and comfort of many important institutions in pressing with him for this reform. He very candidly admitted that he has not heard from any church quarter, that he has not heard from the Bar or Side Bar, and I don&#x2019;t think he would have heard from either the Vrouefederasie or the National Council of Women, nor indeed from, the Law Revision Committee or any other bodies. This of course is no bar to him raising the matter, but I think that it suggests why there are several substantial reasons why one should not accept this Bill and which I shall attempt to touch upon.</p>

<p>The hon. member made a reasonable case on the basis of the spite which has motivated some parties to institute judicial separation proceedings and not divorce actions. It is perfectly true that there have been cases of that kind, but I want at once to say to him that if he does away with this institution, people who are spiteful can still achieve the same object by simply refusing to take a divorce. Consequently people who wish to be spiteful can simply allow the marriage to continue, take no steps to approach the court for a judicial separation or enter into a notarial agreement, simply let the position remain that they are man and wife not living together. Therefore I think that the main evil which the hon. member sees will not be removed.</p>

<p>I think too that the reason why one has had the cases that one has had of judicial separation being taken are easily explained. It is this, that in the old days, until the Act of 1953, it was not possible on divorce, without the consent of the two parties, for the plaintiff, the so-called innocent spouse, to claim maintenance money. It was, however, possible where the claim was judicial separation. This led people to seek and take the remedy of judicial separation. That consideration no longer obtains, and I suggest therefore that the number of cases where judicial separation is in fact taken, will diminish further.</p>

<p>Let me immediately try and put this whole matter in perspective. The hon. member very fairly said that it is only a minor portion of our law. But let me put the figures of judicial separation in perspective. As he says, there are not so far as I know separate figures kept in South Africa between divorce and judicial separation. Certainly they were not available in any publication that I was able to consult.. But there are figures appearing in the Report of the British Commission on Marriage and Divorce of 1951-5, and they are astonishing. They show that in 1954 in England there were only 74 decrees of judicial separation compared <span class="col_697-698" refersTo="page_0363"/>with 27,353 decrees nisi of divorce. That is a proportion of approximately one to 370, and my own experience is that in our country too the proportion is probably not dissimilar. I would have thought that it is certainly in the region of one to 200 or more. And I say, for the reason I have already mentioned in regard to maintenance, that it is probably getting less.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I think that it can be accepted then that the number of cases where judicial separation is taken to-day is relatively small and among those cases there must surely be certain cases with which the hon. member for Heilbron would not quarrel, namely where people have a religious or conscientious objection to divorce. In such cases there is no question of spite. There are those cases where the marriage is not broken, but temporarily ended by this means where a reconciliation is hoped for. Admittedly as the hon. member very fairly said, there is probably not a large number of cases where that is the result, but they do in fact happen and they should not be under-estimated.</p>

<p>As I said at the outset, I believe that any benefit flowing to these people in cases of spite is more imaginary than real, because, as I say, you would simply get the spiteful party adopting the course of taking no action Whatsoever. In such a situation, the innocent party so-called would still be entitled to pledge the credit of the other party for necessaries and thereby obtain maintenance. They probably could approach the court and obtain maintenance without taking a divorce, and in addition there is the Destitute Wives&#x2019; and Children&#x2019;s Act. which would be available to them.</p>

<p>But I suggest that there are very great disadvantages in accepting this measure, and I think there are some that the hon. member would not have intended. May I in the first place remind him of a number of people who are in the position that they have had to put up with wrongful and unlawful conduct on the part of their spouse in circumstances in which our law does not give them a divorce. That is an important class of case and the courts have repeatedly said that that distinction must not be blurred. May I read to the hon. House a passage from the judgment of the Chief Justice in 1949, in the case of Feldman v. Feldman&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> &#x201C;In our law unlawful conduct which makes cohabitation dangerous or intolerable is a ground for judicial separation, while malicious desertion is a ground for divorce, and care should be taken not to allow an elastic application of the maxim that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts to enlarge the meaning of the word * desertion &#x2019; until it includes all unlawful conduct which renders cohabitation dangerous and intolerable and thus to blur or even obliterate the distinction between conduct which entitles a spouse to a decree of divorce and conduct which entitles a spouse to judicial separation.&#x201D;</block>

<p>If this Bill were accepted and the institution of judicial and notarial or voluntary separation done away with, the position would be that there would be quite a number of persons who would be assaulted, and, in other words, obliged to put up with wrongful conduct from their spouse and would be without any remedy at all. There would be many in that category, and the fact that that remedy does lie to hand is undoubtedly a factor in ensuring the continuation of marriage and a cessation, to some extent, of misconduct.</p>

<p>There is another important disadvantage this Bill brings. It upsets many arrangements of longstanding, and I suggest leaves the matter very much up in the air. If Clause 2 of this Bill is regarded it will be seen that the court is obliged to set aside any order of judicial separation or any voluntary separation when it is approached, after the passage of one year from such order or agreement. What may then occur? You may well get the position that the so-called guilty spouse approaches the court, obtains an order setting aside the judicial separation order, and you are then faced with this position that the so-called innocent spouse advances that the grounds upon which judicial separation was granted still operate; in other words, the other spouse is perhaps still drinking to excess, is still perhaps prone to assaulting him or her, and consequently this presumably would be advanced by that spouse. What then must the court do? It no longer may issue an order of judicial separation, and I suggest that you would then probably be in a stalemate position in which the parties are simply not divorced, living together, and the orders in regard to the children and maintenance are probably thrown into doubt.</p>

<p>I think there is a further serious disadvantage of this measure, and it is this, that it opens the door to divorce even wider than it is to-day. In South Africa it is very easy to obtain a divorce. I am not arguing the merits or demerits of that. But I think that compared with other countries it is certainly much easier to obtain a divorce in South Africa, than in almost any country. I think it is fair to say that it is perhaps easier here than in other countries. Now in my submission this Bill virtually introduces a new ground for divorce, namely wrongful conduct, which cannot be said to be done intending to bring the marriage to an end, and which has been followed by a judicial separation or notarial agreement, followed in turn by a further year&#x2019;s lapse of time. That constitutes a new ground, because having regard to Clause 2 it is clear that after a voluntary separation has been entered into, and has been in existence for one year, the party may approach the court and have it set aside and call upon the other party to restore conjugal rights; and it is clearly expected by the hon. member that the result of that will mean divorce. So you get the position that substantially a new ground is introduced if this Bill is accepted, a ground which to a large extent is in conflict with the true <span class="col_699-700" refersTo="page_0364"/>position. I say that for this reason: If wrongful conduct had been indulged in intending to bring the marriage to an end, the party could have taken divorce in the first place. But we are dealing with cases where the wrongful conduct was not done intending to bring the marriage to an end. One knows that type of case. A man perhaps is not able to control himself and is extremely inconsiderate, not to say brutal with his wife, but in fact he cannot live without her, and he loves her very much. It is quite a common position in these cases. Such an injured wife will not be entitled to a divorce as our law stands, but she would be entitled as the law would stand to negotiate a voluntary separation, wait a further year and use this machinery to obtain a divorce.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>That is a very good idea.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would rather say that most authorities feel that one wishes to endeavour to strengthen the ties of marriage, not, I may say, by legal means, but rather to encourage and strengthen the institution of marriage. One point which has been mentioned in this regard is that people should wish to see that their marriage lasts. If I may diverge slightly, I would quote a passage from the British Commission on &#x201C;Marriage and Divorce&#x201D;, which is relevant to the whole question. They say at page 10, in paragraph 51&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"> &#x201C;We are convinced that the real remedy (for excessive divorce, that is) lies in other directions, in fostering in the individual the will to do his duty by the community, in strengthening his resolution to make marriage a union for life, in inculcating a proper sense of responsibility towards his children. These objectives can only be achieved by education in the widest sense, by a specific instruction before marriage and by providing facilities for guidance after marriage and conciliation if a breakdown threatens.&#x201D;</block>

<p>The point I wish to emphasize is that this passage, with which I agree, suggests that one of the roads along which improvement may be achieved is &#x201C;in strengthening his resolution to make marriage a union for life &#x201D;. Now if a person is encouraged at the first sign of liquor, or the first knocks that occur which the law holds to entitle one to judicial separation, if a person is encouraged then to approach the court for a judicial separation, it may indeed substantially weaken the resolve of the parties to fight through the battle and make a successful marriage.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_justice">

<speech by="#thompson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>That is true. No further orders of judicial separation could be made. That is perfectly true and that does undoubtedly weaken the argument I make here.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I am not so certain about that, because for one thing it relates to notarial deeds only.</p>

<p>However, Mr. Speaker, passing on, it has been suggested by the hon. member for Heilbron that this Bill could usefully be sent to a Select Committee, and I think he said that he would welcome such a suggestion. I would suggest that in dealing with an institution of this kind, where we have had no call from the persons most closely interested, one would be very loath to set up a committee or commission of any kind; but I would in any case suggest that a Select Committee would not be the proper body to tackle such a task. I would suggest that one cannot tackle this matter piece-meal. One would need, as did the British Commission, to go into the whole question of marriage and divorce and possible defects in the law in respect of those institutions. I do not think, with respect, that a Select Committee would be the best and most convenient body. If the British Commission is any guide, it lasted for four years, it produced a report running to about 350 pages, with a further schedule with a further 50 pages. I think one would want to draw widely on people who are even more expert in this field than perhaps we are here. Equally with a commission, I do not think that in view of the numbers of cases involved, in view again of the absence of a request for a commission of this kind, I do not feel that it would be justified. I must say that in the absence of the recommendation of any such commission, and in view of the objections, some of which I have sketched to-day, it is impossible for us to support this measure.</p>

<p>I am very glad that the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) has introduced this Bill into this House. Not that I quite agree with the hon. member, just as little as I agree with the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson). But at least I agree to the extent of about three-quarters with the hon. member for Heilbron, whereas I do not agree with the hon. member for Pinelands at all. The first argument advanced by the hon. member for Pinelands was that judicial separation has existed for more than 1,000 years already. But the fact that it has existed for more than 1,000 years still does not mean that it should continue to exist. The hon. member&#x2019;s second argument was that in England judicial separation takes place in one out of 300 cases. What about that? I think that is one of the arguments which can be advanced in favour of the abolition of judicial separation. Mr. Speaker, in view of the importance of this matter, I think we should first give thought to it, and I therefore want to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#waterson">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WATERSON</person>:</from>

<p>Paragraphs (c) and (d) of Clause 1 deal with the question of having one system of collection of the tax in future. It raises the question of the poll-tax particularly in the Cape; the other provinces have a minimum earning below which the poll-tax is not collected. In the Cape Province there is no minimum. Every adult in the Cape Province is liable to pay &#x00A3;1 a year in taxation. Now in this Bill, the farm labourers and domestic servants and so on, earning less than R480, will be excluded from the operations of this Bill, so that the employers of those people will not be required to make a deduction of 4 cents a week from their pay. Because if it is only &#x00A3;1, it means a deduction of 4 cents per week, and to the Revenue Office it means a refund of 8 cents per annum in respect of the taxpayer. It seems to me rather absurd. But on the other hand, employers, factories and businesses, and so on will have to deduct 4 cents a week from all their employees, quite apart from whether they are income tax payers or not. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that they should be excluded from the Bill because it is going to involve a tremendous lot of extra work to the employers, because there are hundreds of employers in the Cape Province, who employ people who will not fall in the R480 a year category, and therefore they will not be liable for income tax. But all these people will have to be placed on the list and a solemn deduction of 4 cents a week will have to be deducted from their pay, which the employer will have to pay over. The system has never been satisfactory here in the Cape. The Revenue Office could never collect this &#x00A3;1 from these people. The province employed inspectors who go round trying to pick people up and to get them to pay their &#x00A3;1, with very limited success, I am quite sure that the cost of the inspector is considerably more than the 4 cents a week which the Treasury can get. I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that he might well look into the question whether the basic personal tax, as distinct from the income-tax, should not be excluded from the operation of this Bill, and that the Provincial Administration should continue to make what efforts they can to collect it themselves.</p>

<p>I understand the position is that as far as servants and farm labourers are concerned, if they do not earn more than R480 they are excluded from the provisions in regard to the deductions every month. When they go over R480, naturally they fall in the group which has to pay income-tax, and the personal tax and the income-tax are then merged and become one. I am not quite sure about the position of people who are not farm labourers or servants and whether they are also excluded.</p>

<p>They are not excluded, so they fall within the ambit of this Bill, and the amount will have to be deducted, but I understand that of those people who are working in factories, etc., there are not many earning under R480. The factories and business people will in any case be employers, and the collection of these small amounts of personal tax will be undertaken along with the income-tax of the taxpayers and will not bring about a great deal of additional work. That is the position as I understand it. I do not think any representations have been made on that basis by the employers, but I shall give the matter further consideration if necessary and bring about further amendments in the Other Place, if necessary.</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>This clause gives rise to certain anomalies. It will benefit some people but not others. I have certain documents in my possession from one of the Chambers and I will read the first paragraph: &#x201C;Under the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section <i>21 bis,</i> a special deduction in respect of the transitional year will be calculated either on the taxable income for the transitional year or on the taxable income for the year of assessment ended 30 June 1962 whichever amount will be the lesser. The Chamber finds this particular provision totally unacceptable and inequitable, for the following reasons.&#x201D; I would like to point out to the Minister that the original idea of making the deduction the lesser of the two periods was to stop people holding up their income in 1962 and pushing it on to 1963 and then probably getting away with a lot of tax. The answer to that at the moment is, I <span class="col_703-704" refersTo="page_0366"/>think, that by far the vast majority of returns are in already for 30 June 1962 and therefore that particular difficulty of the Commissioner falls away. This document goes on to make certain suggestions, which I want to put to the Minister as being eminently sensible suggestions, namely that the average amount of the taxable income for the two years should then be two-fifths of the aggregate income over the period of 20 months. Then there will be no purpose in saying that business this year is better than it was last year. So if anyone had a bad time last year and is doing well now, there seems to be no real reason why he should be treated more harshly than someone who is not in the same position. The effect of this section, and taking the transitional period as being eight months, will have that effect. I suggest that the Minister give consideration to this suggestion that it will be more equitable to allow taxpayers to take two-fifths of the 20 months&#x2019; period and regard that as the free income in the transitional period.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, following on the argument of the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross), I think the Minister should take into account the fact that you get the anomaly of the taxpayer who has no previous income being tax-free in this transitional period, as against the taxpayer who had a lower income in the previous years. But I really want to raise another aspect which I think has been brought to the attention of the hon. the Minister of commerce and industry, the accountants and many other organized bodies. That is the question of the loss of the special allowances. As the House knows, these special allowances were introduced to endeavour to get commerce and industry to modernize their plant and to increase building activities. In terms of the definitions in Clause 2 (a), we find the position is that in most cases two-thirds of those allowances will be lost. It has already been put to the Minister, I think. So far in his wisdom or lack of wisdom he has said that it was impossible to adjust the position. I hope that as the result of the representations made the Minister will be able to adjust this position, because it seems unfair that if a man has met the Minister&#x2019;s request and has modernized his factory he will find himself in the position of losing at least two-thirds of the special allowance benefits unless his income in the second period was much greater than in the first.</p>

<p>I do not think I can accept the suggestions of the hon. members for Parktown (Mr. Emdin) or Benoni (Mr. Ross). We already provide that it should be the tax year immediately preceding. We must have some kind of yardstick and our yardstick is the most recent tax year. If you want to go back two years, other people will say it should rather be three years. I think it is quite fair that we should accept this as a practical yardstick, namely the taxable income for the tax year ended 30 June 1962. But we also say that if your income is more than that and your estimate is not less than 90 per cent of your actual income for this period you will not be liable to taxation for the transitional period. So I do not think we can make it two-fifths of 20 months. Then we might as well go back further and use a longer period. I think this is a practical yardstick and we do not want to encumber it by people having to see what their income was not only last year but also the year before that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parktown raised another point, the loss of the special or incentive allowances of various kinds. But they are not entirely lost. Where you have to pay tax for the transitional period, that is taken into consideration&#x2014;so it is not lost. We have tried as far as possible to give the taxpayer the equivalent of an absolutely tax-free period. It was impracticable to do it in that way only, because there was a danger that income for the new year could be telescoped into that eight months and then we would have a wrong picture for the new year. In order to do that, we did not give a completely tax-free period, but we did the second-best thing and gave a deduction. If we had been able to give a completely tax-free period, naturally if there had been any allowances which had accrued during that period, you could not have deducted it from any amount for the simple reason that you cannot deduct any amount from nothing. So this is the predicament in which we are and I think we have really done the best we could under the circumstances. But I want to emphasize that those incentive allowances are not completely lost because they are still being utilized for that transitional period to decide whether you have to pay for that period or not.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 14,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>During the second reading I drew the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the difficulty which will arise as far as deserted wives are concerned under the proposal that taxation is to be deducted at source from both the husband and the wife. In his reply he said he had considered this carefully and would give instructions that the greatest consideration possible should be given to these women. Now, our advice in Johannesburg is that there are large numbers of these women. Since the second reading I have had discussions with the National Council of Women and with representatives of Business and Professional Women&#x2019;s Associations. I am afraid they were rather in ignorance of the general proposals but the Bill was explained to them, and the essence of their objection&#x2014;and a very sound objection it is&#x2014;comes back to these deserted women. In a short memorandum given to us by the Receiver it says that &#x201C;the income of a married woman forms part of the joint income of a family unit and it is the income of such unit that is subject to tax and the husband is called upon to pay the <span class="col_705-706" refersTo="page_0367"/>tax on the combined income, but under the present Income Tax Law there is nothing to prevent the Commissioner from requiring each spouse to pay his or her share of the combined tax and that position is in no way affected by the proposed P.A.Y.E. system; each spouse will now contribute to the joint tax bill by means of deductions from his or her salary that applies reasonably to families which are on a normal footing, but when you come to these deserted women it is definitely unfair. The husband gets the children&#x2019;s allowance. Even if the husband and wife have separate assessments, the husband still gets portion of the children&#x2019;s allowance. In terms of this table which was issued, a woman earning R 1,000 per annum will have deducted from her income R48.71, and if she earns R1,200 she will have deducted R70.45. So the deductions are substantial amounts. If she were a widow with two children, she would pay no tax until she reached an income of about R1,500 per annum, but according to the table of the Commissioner&#x2014;and again this woman who has been deserted by her husband is in no different position from a widow&#x2014;she will have deducted from her almost R100 per annum if she is earning R750. I realize the Commissioner&#x2019;s difficulty. I have had discussions with the Department and I made a suggestion which has met with the approval of the women&#x2019;s organizations to whom I spoke, and I have their backing in making this suggestion which will remove, I think, the majority of their objections, namely that a deserted wife should be granted the children&#x2019;s allowances. The suggestion is not going to give the Department much more work. They invite all taxpayers to come along if they have difficulties, and they will inform the employers what amounts to deduct. To me that is an eminently sensible suggestion and I think the Minister should accept it. The difficulty arises at the moment that I understand that no amendment can be made at the moment to the Income Tax Bill before us; we have to wait for the Income Tax Act, which will come later in the Session. I could go on at length on this subject but I will not. I just want to assure the Minister that there is a very large number of these women. It is no use getting the figures from the Social Welfare Department only, because many do not go there to ask for assistance, because they are too proud. The number which can be given by Social Welfare does not by any means reflect the total number of such women. We all know men of the type who just abandon their responsibilities, and it is unfortunate that these new proposals push this payment on to these women, and it should be taken off. I repeat that I can see no difficulty; if the Commissioner is prepared to interview every taxpayer a woman can go along and say: You are going to deduct R48 from my income, but I and my husband at the end of the year will not pay anywhere near as much as that, and the Commissioner will then give a directive to the employer to deduct less than the table shows. So there is no reason at all why he should not allow these poor women to be taxed as married women and be given the child&#x2019;s allowance. The Commissioner is given the power to be reasonable and to postpone payments in case of illness, but he has no power to relieve them of any actual liability they have for income-tax, and if they live apart from their husbands the 1942 Act, as amended, leaves them with a certain responsibility to pay tax. I think that is very unfair. I know the Minister is not unsympathetic, but what he told me after the second reading does not meet the position and I hope he will go into this with his Department and see that the necessary protection is given to these women before the end of this Session.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I gave this matter further thought after the second reading. I then gave the hon. member the assurance that in the case of a deserted wife who has difficulties because she does not know where her husband is, she can approach the Commissioner and he will then make the deduction and issue a directive to the Receiver of Revenue to deduct an amount which is more in line with her ultimate liability under the Act. Now, I have gone into the matter again. The difficulty is that we have the tables now and we cannot very well increase the husband&#x2019;s portion of the tables because that would do away with the big bulk of people&#x2014;married couples where the wife does not work&#x2014;and it would throw out of gear the tables if we were to increase the husband&#x2019;s contribution for those few cases. Then we would have to have a second set of tables. We find that actually, although in the first place it seems as if the wife&#x2019;s contribution is excessive, there is ultimately a shortfall in most cases, although not in all cases, which has to be paid by the husband. I have here certain figures which prove what I have just said. A husband with an income of R 1,000 and a wife with an income of R300 have a joint income of R 1,300 and they would normally be liable for R45. The husband contributed R9.61 and the wife R4.12, which is altogether only R 13.73. In other words, there is a shortfall of R3L27 which has to be paid by the husband. There are some cases where there are no children. You will realize that there are so many permutations possible where the husband earns anything from R600 upwards and the wife anything less than that, that there are just unlimited possibilities. It makes it very difficult to get tables which will satisfy every class. But in the bulk of cases where there are no children &#x2014;there is only one case of that in the various examples I have been given&#x2014;where the husband does not ultimately have to pay up, although his contribution at the beginning is less because he gets the advantage of the deduction of the children&#x2019;s rebate, ultimately he has to pay up. For example, where the income is 50-50, where they each have R1,000, the position is that ultimately the husband has to pay up an extra R73.29. In other words, where he has 50 per cent of the income, he pays 59 per cent of the tax. I have already said that <span class="col_707-708" refersTo="page_0368"/>under the existing system if a married couple applies for separate assessments that can be done and they can be separately assessed. If the husband asks for a separate assessment, the position would be the same. What we can do is what I have suggested, and then we can see in this first year, after we have tested it by experience and when we know whether there are many such cases and whether there are cases of extreme hardship&#x2014;when we have had an opportunity of seeing how the scheme works, we can see whether there are any deficiencies which have to be made up. But it is no good arguing on theory now. We have gone into the theoretical part of it as fully as possible. We think that theoretically this is the best, but we are not prepared to be dogmatic about it and say that in practice that will be so. But we are not prepared to admit that everyone who thinks differently must necessarily be right. Therefore I think it is best for all of us to give the scheme an opportunity to demonstrate its shortcomings in practice, and if there are any shortcomings, then at the end of the year we will be in a better position to come here and not merely to argue but to have some basis on which to argue. I have taken it as far as I can, but I regret that I cannot consider any amendment at this stage. We have given the assurance that if there is a deserted wife she will be given due consideration by the Commissioner and he will issue a directive.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I was not talking theoretically; I was giving the facts. There are thousands of deserted wives. It is not a question of the additional bit of tax with which the husband is charged at the end of the year. This is a case of women who have responsibility for their children because their husbands have run away, and all that I am asking is that you grant the Commissioner power to grant the childrens&#x2019; rebate to these women who are looking after them.</p>

<p>On paragraph 2,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>There are two matters here to which I wish to refer. One is in paragraph</p>

<p>2 (1), under which an employer is required to pay to the Receiver within seven days of the end of the month the amount deducted from the employee. I do not know what the urgency of the Receiver is to collect this money in so short a while; I know it is nice to have but let me quote to the Minister what is perhaps an exaggerated case but a true case where the end of the month is Monday, 31 December. The Tuesday then will be a holiday and in this beautiful province of the Cape, Wednesday will be a holiday. Thursday and Friday are working days, Saturday and Sunday will be holidays and Monday will be the seventh day. So there is really very little time and I wonder whether the hon. the Minister will not consider extending the period of seven days to fourteen days or alternatively to seven working <span class="col_709-710" refersTo="page_0369"/>days so as to give employers an opportunity to attend to this matter. There is one other point in paragraph 2 (4) under which the only amount that can be deducted is a contribution to a pension fund or to an annuity. It seems to me here that another item that could well have been deducted is any payment to a medical aid or benefit fund. I realize that there is a problem in so far as deductions in respect of medical expenditure are concerned, because the taxpayer&#x2019;s medical expenditure is an unknown amount until the end of the year. But I think it was two years ago that the main income-tax Act was amended so that a contribution to a medical aid plan could be deducted as part of the R200. Now, that is a fixed amount. The employer and the employee know each month what amount has to be deducted and it seems to me that instead of asking for directives or waiting until the end of the year, in this particular case it will be easier for everybody concerned if deductions in respect of contributions to medical aid societies or funds were allowed automatically. I know it may be argued that some sections of the taxpayers would benefit in that those who are members of a medical aid society would be able to have the deductions made whereas those who simply claim a deduction in respect of medical expenses at the end of the year would be penalized, but there are so many people who are being penalized is this legislation that I think this should be done.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think that we should extend the period beyond seven days. I do not want to use this as an argument, but at any rate if the period is only seven days, then the opportunity to succumb to temptations will be so much less! I think it is a fair period. Even in the extreme example which the hon. member mentioned there were two or three working days and the employer should have no difficulty in complying with the provisions of this paragraph within that period. The other point raised by him has really been answered by the hon. member himself. He has pointed out that it would amount to discrimination if a person who is a member of a medical aid fund were able to have his contribution deducted in advance while a person who is also entitled to a maximum deduction of R200, would not be able to have his medical expenses deducted in advance. But here again we can see how this measure works in the first year, and if any of these irritating little points do crop up, then we can always come along after the first year and amend the legislation on the basis of the experience gained in the first year.</p>

<p>Paragraph put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Paragraph 17,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In item (c) of sub-paragraph (3), to omit &#x201C;a portion thereof&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;such portion of such amount as would in terms of the ordinance under which such provincial income tax is levied be taken into account if such amount were the amount actually payable by the taxpayer &#x201D;.</block>

<p>This is a small amendment which is being effected with some verbosity, but in reality the position is simply this, if I may mention an example: We are talking now about the provincial tax which can be deducted. We have the position that there is a normal income tax. There may be a surcharge from time to time of, say, 10 per cent, and at other times there may be a rebate of 10 per cent. What we are providing for is this: Whether there is a surcharge or a rebate of 10 per cent, the Provincial Administration&#x2019;s share remains unchanged; it is a percentage of 100, the full normal income tax, and not a percentage of 110 or 90. That is the meaning of this provision and the amendment is being effected so as not to place Provincial Administrations in too great a difficulty when we reduce taxation. On the old basis, when we increased the tax, they also received a higher income, but now the position will remain the same as far as they are concerned. If there is an increase, they will not derive any benefit from it but if there is a reduction in income tax, they will not be detrimentally affected by it. That is the intention of this amendment, which is worded very clumsily, but I am assured that it cannot be drafted in a better way.</p>

My attention has been drawn to persons who operate, as has been suggested in a letter to me, as agents for overseas firms&#x2014;buying, confirming and shipping firms&#x2014;and who are subjected to almost similar vagaries as these other categories in regard to the assessment of their income. The point that has been put to me is what the Minister&#x2019;s Department would do in the case of those particular persons, or does he not think it would be in the interests of the taxpayers to add an additional category to include those who are subjected to similar vagaries as far as their taxable income is concerned.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister is aware, representations have been made by organized commerce and industry that amelioration should be given to them in respect of the three payments per year required to be made by provisional taxpayers. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that in the Select Committee, the former Commissioner of Inland Revenue expressed the view that after this new method of taxation had been in operation for a year or two, he thought it would be reasonable and correct to alter the three payments per year to two payments per year in the case of provisional taxpayers in order to meet the representations made by commerce and industry and the large number of people who now fall within the ambit of &#x201C;provisional taxpayers &#x201D;. I accept that in the first year or two&#x2014;especially in the first year&#x2014; it would not be wise to have other than three payments, but I cannot see why the hon. the Minister cannot give this Committee, and the country, the assurance that after this Act has been operating smoothly for a year, he will assist commerce and industry and all provisional taxpayers, by cutting down the number of payments to only two per year. In addition to assisting the taxpayer, this will cut down the Department&#x2019;s administrative costs considerably. and I feel that it will lead to a smoother implementation of this Act.

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>I would like the hon. Minister to tell us something about the mechanics of this paragraph. In terms of this paragraph the provisional taxpayer has to submit an estimate of his total taxable income for provisional taxation, and the amount so estimated may not be less than his taxable income for the previous year unless the Commissioner, having regard to the circumstances of the case, agrees to accept an estimate of a lower amount. After the first four months the provisional taxpayer has to submit an estimate of his taxable income for the year; it must not be lower than his taxable income for the previous year, but it is only at the end of the fourth month that the taxpayer becomes aware of the fact that his income for the year is likely to be lower. In the meantime, however; you have to make your provisional payment. How are the mechanics going to work? On 29 June you may have to say to the Receiver of Revenue, &#x201C;my income is going to be lower and I want your agreement to a lower estimate&#x201D;, whereas on 30 June you have to send him a cheque. It seems to me that there are going to be difficulties here in actually assessing your income in relation to your payment. If you pay you may have difficulty in getting a refund because the hon. the Minister does not want refunds to be made to provisional taxpayers; he wants us all to be creditors until the end of the year. It seems to me therefore that you are going to have to pay the excess amount and then hope that the thing will balance out during the year. It is the mechanics of this paragraph that I would like to know something about.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>In the second reading debate we had a discussion on whether the penalties should not be lowered. We and, I think, commerce and industry think that the penalties are too high. I know that the attitude of the Minister is that you only have to be 90 per cent correct, that you should be able to be 90 per cent correct, and therefore if you are not 90 per cent correct a 20 per cent penalty is not exorbitant. I think there is one issue here that might have been lost sight of perhaps and that is that at the end of the year you would have to lodge with the Receiver of Revenue a complete income tax return for the year. There cannot therefore be any evasion in submitting your estimate, unless you want to do it criminally. If you do submit a low estimate, knowing that it is on the low side, it is going to catch up with you one day. In other words, if in the first, the second or the third period you submit an estimate which is lower than you know your income is going to be, then when you submit your final return it is going <span class="col_713-714" refersTo="page_0371"/>to catch up with you. Under those circumstances we feel that 20 per cent is high; it is a very, very severe penalty. It is no good deliberately under-estimating your income because you are going to be found out. I know that there must be some penalty otherwise everybody would take advantage of the situation, but I want to suggest to the Minister that he should reduce the penalty by half.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Although the penalty is only 20 per cent the hon. member wants me to reduce it. The position is&#x2014;if at any time before the end of the year an unexpected advantage accrues to the taxpayer and the Commissioner is satisfied&#x2014;that the taxpayer is liable to pay additional tax, i.e. the penalty under sub-paragraph (1). If his taxable income for the year of assessment in question is affected by circumstances of which he was not aware at the time of the submission of the estimates referred to in paragraph (1), the Commissioner may in his discretion remit the additional tax or part thereof, and if the taxpayer is not satisfied with the decision of the Commissioner, he may object and appeal. I think 20 per cent is quite a fair penalty. We must try to get people to make their estimates as honestly as possible.</p>

<p>On paragraph 28,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>This paragraph contains a very harsh provision in a generally rigid system of tax recovery. The change in the system already means this: Whereas in former years the heavy hand of the tax collector was felt once in a year, under these changed circumstances it is going to be felt periodically, if not continuously throughout the year. That burden one must accept in the system, but why in addition should the tax collector be empowered to hold on to any excess payment by the taxpayer? In fact, why indeed must the Exchequer benefit because the taxpayer, by being honest, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, and by mistake makes an excess payment over what he is obliged to pay? If he pays too little he is subject to a penalty. Under the provisions of this paragraph he is also to be penalized now if he pays too much. It brings to mind the story of a taxpayer who was involved in a motor collision and left with a very obvious scar on his nose. Soon afterwards he went to the income tax offices to settle his indebtedness and the tax collector, perhaps kindly but nevertheless gratuitously, drew attention to the obvious and said to him, &#x201C;did you have an accident to your nose?&#x201D; To this the taxpayer said &#x201C;oh no, but you see I have been paying through the nose to your Department so long that it is now showing signs of wear.&#x201D; The effect of this paragraph will be an added injury to what already amounts to paying income tax through the nose. It may be true that the taxpayer has got pretty accustomed to excessive taxation over the past 14 years, but why should he be burdened in addition beyond his obligatory amount? He is now going to be deprived of the benefit of his own money, but even worse, under the provision of this paragraph the law of set-off is being altered and set-off is now no longer to be allowed at the option of the payer; it is to be at the option of the payee. Surely there is not justification of the change of the law in that regard. I understood the hon. Minister to say that <i>the</i> reason why refunds could not be made was because the machine would not operate that way. Well, he seems to have developed a sort of master machine which is able to collect but not repay, and the machine is now becoming a bigger democrat than the hon. Minister.</p>

<p>That is why I am drawing the Minister&#x2019;s attention to this provision because here he has the power to make a change. The Minister has indicated that there might be shortcomings in this Bill. I suggest that this paragraph contains serious shortcomings which I hope the Minister will take into revision at an early date. After all is said and done, whose money is it? The excess money is the taxpayer&#x2019;s money. I leave the bigger question because of this mechanical complication which the hon. the Minister has told us about, but so far as changing the law of setoff is concerned, there can be no justification for that at all. My amendment is therefore designed to restore the common law principle of set-off and to ensure that the option to use his own money as a means of set-off shall be at the option of the payer and not of the payee. After all, as I have said before, with whose money are we concerned. We are concerned with the taxpayer&#x2019;s money and therefore at this stage I move the amendment which stands in my name on the Order Paper&#x2014;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>This new system has considerable advantages to the taxpayer but I think the provisions of paragraph 28 (1) (a) under which any excess amount paid to the Receiver of Revenue on behalf of an employee shall be refunded to the taxpayer, who is not a provisional taxpayer, is the one particular disadvantage which will be suffered by the ordinary taxpayer and that is the considerable delay that will possibly have to be endured by the taxpayer in connection with refunds, because we know that in the past the mechanism of our tax-collecting machine has been to collect all the taxes payable and <span class="col_715-716" refersTo="page_0372"/>then, where any refund is payable, the machinery is put into reverse and the taxpayer receives the refund usually six or seven months after application for the refund has been made. The normal taxpayer who has been making a monthly contribution towards his tax commitments will in fact be overtaxed and will receive a credit at some later date. This particular point was raised during the discussion in the Select Committee and I understand that the former Commissioner stated that the Canadian system which is similar to the system being enacted here, was able to make such refunds within a period of six weeks. It would therefore be appreciated if the hon. Minister could give some assurance that the normal taxpayer who is entitled to a refund&#x2014;and in some instances it might be a considerable refund where there has been a change in the number of dependants&#x2014;will be given that refund expeditiously. I believe that this is the one disadvantage which the normal taxpayer will have to suffer and it can be alleviated to a certain extent if machinery is available to refund that amount expeditiously.</p>

<p>The position of the employee is very favourable. We are able to make the refund automatic. I understand that the time can be anything from six weeks to two months. We shall naturally try to expedite it still further but I cannot undertake that. But that is the period which I understand it is likely to take to make a refund to an employee.</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>I shall come back onto the rails of this railway line. Clause 2 gives parliamentary consent to shorten a railway line which has already been authorized by Parliament. The line was originally planned to run from Germiston East to Rietfontein farm, approximately 13 miles in length to serve the Native township of Katlehong. Permission is now sought to shorten this line and to make it stop at Kwesini. I want to ask the Minister this: Has there been any report from the Railway Board on this proposed shortening? I know that in connection with the construction of these lines the Railway Board has to be consulted. And I wonder whether the Minister can tell us whether the Railway Board has been consulted in connection with the suggested shortening. As we have not had it set out in the White Paper, I think we should have some idea of what the saving will be on the original estimate. I should also like the hon. the Minister to tell us if and when&#x2014; he says in about 10 years&#x2019; time&#x2014;it is decided to serve the southern section of this location will he come before this House with an additional construction Bill? Or does he think this is the end of the matter? Does he merely want to close his books? Does he feel that it will never be necessary to build the extra two miles which were called for in the original construction Bill?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I would also like a little more information from the hon. the <span class="col_717-718" refersTo="page_0373"/>Minister in connection with this railway line which is being constructed for the Native township in the Germiston/Alberton/Natalspruit area on the Witwatersrand. I am surprised that the plans for that railway line have so often been changed over the past years. In 1955 the intention was to build a railway line of 13.64 miles at a cost of R7,768, 600; in 1955 the length of the line was reduced to 13.10 miles&#x2014;at the same cost incidentally&#x2014; and now in 1963 we find that the length of that railway line is once again being reduced to 11.44 miles at a cost of R6,834,000. I have before me the Report of the Controller and Auditor-General on the South African Railways for the year 1960-61. On page 181 of this report there appears an explanation of differences between expenditure and allocations as supplied by the General Manager&#x2019;s office. A certain item (g) appears on that page in which we find the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Delays attributable to negotiations with and requirements of other bodies or departments.</block>

<p>In other words, delays due to the actions of other departments. And under that item there is this one&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Germiston East/Elsburg: New double line, R 80,755.</block>

<p>It is clear therefore, Mr. Chairman, that this is a case of poor co-operation between two Departments, the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development which was responsible for the development in that area. I want to say candidly that I do not think that the hon. the Minister is mainly to blame for this. I think that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development is far more to blame. Indeed, in this connection, we have seen what has happened in the case of the line between Bellville and Nyanga where rails and equipment worth millions of rand are rusting away. We hope that we will have less of this sort of thing in the future and that there will be better co-operation and planning between the various Government Departments. It is quite true that there has been a large increase in the number of Natives in that area. In the magisterial district of Germiston their numbers have increased from 85,000 in 1951 to 123,000 at present, an increase of almost 50 per cent. In other words, there has been a tremendous increase after that railway line was originally asked for, but notwithstanding that fact, the line is being shortened.</p>

<p>There is another technical point in connection with this railway line. As far as I can make out from the map the original idea was that the railway line would link up at Angus Station, but this will no longer be the case and the line will practically come to a dead end. I think it would have been far better to build this railway line so that it could have become a through line. It can become an important line because I understand from the report of the General Manager that about 15,500 passengers are transported along that line daily. I have no further criticism to offer on the building of this line and the delay in closing the account in this regard but I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister can tell us something more in this connection and give us the assurance that the Department of Bantu Administration and Development will not be permitted to play the role of dictator in the Cabinet over his own Department.</p>

<p>This is a very simple matter. The municipality concerned is responsible for the development of the Native township. The Railway Administration has to receive its information with regard to requirements from the municipality concerned. Well, the railway line has been completed and has been in operation for some years except for this last portion. The Alberton Municipality has now intimated that the development which would have to take place to justify the last section will not take place in the next ten or 15 years. It is unnecessary to keep the accounts open for ten or 15 years until the whole line is eventually completed. Because of this it has been decided to amend the law so that that section of the railway line which Parliament originally approved of will be removed from the Bill since it is not going to be built. When the time comes for that line to be extended, we will again come to Parliament with a new Construction Bill.</p>

<p>That is the general implication of this clause. If the hon. the Minister will explain it, I shall resume my seat. But as far as I can see a railway official will now have to pay more for the money which he gets from the Treasury. In other words, a higher rate of interest will have to be paid on railway loans. We know that the Treasury is demanding higher interest rates nowadays. I think we have to pay 5&#x215C; per cent on the American loan. The railway official has always obtained his loan at a rate of interest which has not been higher than the rate which the Treasury has had to pay for public loans. Since the rate of interest will now rise to 5 per cent and even higher it is also possible that a higher rate of interest will have to be paid on these housing loans. If I am wrong in this respect I would like to have an assurance from the hon. the Minister that the interest rates on building loans to railway officials will not be increased.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;If I am not mistaken&#x201D;, but then he is always mistaken. The staff will not be detrimentally affected. As things stand at present, the rate of interest is meddled with from year to year because the law provides that the staff must be charged the average rate of interest that the Treasury has to pay. When the average rate of interest is some decimal figure which cannot really be applied in practice, it is usually fixed at <i>&#x00BD; per</i> cent more or $ per cent less. All that we are now proposing is that instead of altering the rate of interest each year, it will now only be done once every five years. The rate of interest will then be determined in accordance with what has to be paid to the Treasury. The officials who already have loans will not be affected by this provision, even though they may only be paying 2 per cent. This is now being laid down for the next five years and it is based on the rate of interest paid to the Treasury, just as is the case to-day. It will apply to new loans.</p>

<p>This clause, in its wording, is practically the same to all intents and purposes, as the wording of the Act of 1960 except for the change of name of the Conciliation Board and the substitution of State President for Governor General. But there is one significant change in this clause in connection with which I should like an explanation from the hon. the Minister. I notice that the explanatory memorandum has nothing to say about it. It merely says that Clauses 14 to 17 of the Bill are self-explanatory. We know from past experience that when you get such a statement in an explanatory memorandum, it is necessary to take a closer look at the section itself. Sub-section (1) of this clause is precisely the same as Section 27 of the Act it is amending. Sub-section (2) is also the same except for the substitution of State President for Governor General. But in sub-section (3) there is a significant addition at the end of the clause. I want to draw the attention of the House and of the hon. the Minister to this. I quote from the original Act, Section 27, which is being amended. It reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_721-722" refersTo="page_0375"/>The Administration may, subject to the approval of the Governor General, make regulations not inconsistent with this section &#x2026;</block>

<p>In respect of three matters, Mr. Chairman, and they are&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; in respect of the constitution, the function and the procedure of the board.</block>

<p>But in the clause which we are now being asked to approve this is increased to four. It says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Administration may, subject to the approval of the State President, make regulations not inconsistent with this section in respect of the constitution, the function and the procedure of the board and the nomination of the members thereof.</block>

<p>Now as I understand the position the Conciliation Board will be nominated in terms of sub-section (1). It will consist of an equal number of representatives of the workers&#x2019; organizations and an equal number of representatives of the Administration. The one being nominated by the Administration and the other being nominated by the staff associations concerned. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister this question: How can the Administration lay down the regulations in regard to the manner in which the staff associations must nominate their representatives? As I understood the Minister, under the old system the staff associations had a procedure to be followed for the election of their representatives to the Conciliation Board. The procedure is now that these staff associations will give their nominees to the Minister. If this is going to be a board dealing with employment difficulties, such as conditions of service, they are going to make the nominations. What puzzles me is how the Administration ca make regulations which will be applicable to the staff associations in the nomination of their representatives to the Employment Advisory Board. It seems to be entirely inconsistent with the other provisions of the Bill which have already been approved by this committee. For example, as far as the Disciplinary Appeal Boards are concerned, provision is made in Clauses 12 and 13 that members of the staff associations must be representative on that Disciplinary Appeal Board of those servants whose appeals are being heard. Let us assume that a dispute arises in the artisan staff association. But if the Minister is going to deal with the nominees on the Employment Advisory Board it may well be that the representatives sitting on the Employment Advisory Board will not be representatives of the artisan staff association. It can happen in regard to any association; I am merely using the artisan staff association as an example. I would therefore like to have an explanation from the hon. the Minister as to why these words have been added.</p>

<p>I can also assure him that it is such an insignificant matter that I thought it quite unnecessary to go into it in detail. I want to correct the hon. member in regard to one statement that he made in connection with the present procedure of electing members to the Conciliation Board and the other boards. The staff associations are not concerned with that. The staff associations do not elect the members to these boards under the present provisions. But the staff as a whole, whether they are members or not of the staff organizations elect the members to represent the different groups on these boards. It has nothing to do with the staff organizations. But at the request of the staff organizations I decided to change the procedure. Instead of having the election by all members of the staff I am now allowing the staff associations to nominate members to represent those staff groups on this board. Obviously regulations are required in regard to the procedure to be adopted; not the procedure that must be followed by a particular staff organization; that is entirely a domestic matter and that is a matter in regard to which they alone are responsible. But regulations must be made as to when these members must be nominated. Regulations must be made that paid officials of staff organizations cannot be nominated. Of course, that is a principle which has never been accepted. A paid official is not a servant of the Administration. He is a servant of the staff organization. Consequently you cannot allow the paid officials of the staff organizations to become members of the Conciliation Board. But their chairman can, members of their executive can become members of the board. Some regulations must be made in regard to the nomination procedure without intruding on the jurisdiction, the functions or the powers of the staff associations as such. The staff associations know that; they know why this provision has been introduced and they are quite satisfied.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I raised the issue for this reason. It seems to me somewhat anomalous. This committee is virtually approving of new conciliatory procedure in the sense that we are accepting the principle of compulsory arbitration in the end. But when a dispute arises there are certain stages of discussion and this is one of the stages. In the case of disciplinary appeals the whole procedure is laid down. But now we come to such an important body as this, because this is an important body; this is the most important stage before the stage of compulsory arbitration is reached. It is at this stage that discussion will take place if there is to be any hope of averting further stages. I think the Minister will agree with me. Therefore it seems to me most important <span class="col_723-724" refersTo="page_0376"/>that when you accept a principle such as that contained in this Bill the set-up of this Employment Advisory Board should also be laid down in greater detail.

<p>The Minister says not necessarily, but I think so. I think that this stage is going to be far more important. That is why I feel that in such an important matter as this the Minister should be able to give the House and the country a broader outline of what he actually has in mind with the establishment, the functions and procedure of this most important body and the nomination of its members, particularly as far as the representatives of the staff associations are concerned.</p>

<p>I can assure the hon. member that there is no change in the procedure or the functions of the Conciliation Board. The only change that has taken place is that it has been renamed the Conditions of Employment Advisory Board&#x2014;at the request of the staff organizations. The only other change that is taking place is that the members are nominated by the staff associations instead of being elected by the staff. There is no other change. There are a large number of regulations in regard to the procedure and the functions of the Conciliation Board. Here I have them in my hand. These regulations have been in operation for many years. They are not new. I can give some of the headings: Interpretation of terms; Constitution of the Conciliation Board; Period of Office; Elected members to represent certain groups of servants; Method of conducting elections (Regulation No. 5). If there is a Conciliation Board, you require regulations to say when the Conciliation Board is to meet, what its functions will be, etc. Such regulations have been in operation for many years, and there is no change here.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 15,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 1, page 24, to omit &#x201C;if practicable&#x201D;, and in line 2, after &#x201C;Africa&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;or a person who is acceptable to both parties to the dispute&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This clause makes provision amongst other things for the establishment of a commission. It provides that the State President will be compelled under certain circumstances to appoint a commission. In my opinion it will be an important commission because it will not only be the most important facet of the conciliation machinery but will in effect be an arbitration commission and as such will be an extremely important cog in the conciliation machinery. I think that it was also for this reason that the hon. the Minister thought fit to make the chairman of the commission a Judge or an ex-Judge. I do not think that there will be objection to the appointment of a Judge or an ex-Judge either on the part of the staff associations or on the part of the Administration. He will be a person with the necessary status and one who is impartial. Unfortunately, the clause does not end there because it goes further and states &#x201C;if practicable &#x201D;. The position can of course arise where a Judge is not available and another person may perhaps have to be appointed who does not have the status of a Judge or ex-Judge and who may not also, according to public opinion, be as impartial as a Judge. I wonder therefore whether the hon. the Minister will not agree to our amending this sub-section in such a way that if a Judge or an ex-Judge cannot accept the chairmanship of such commission, a person will be appointed who will be acceptable to both parties concerned in the dispute. Such a provision can only improve the clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I am sorry but I cannot accept the amendment, and for very good reasons. I want to refer the hon. member to the principal Act because this is not a new provision. This provision has been in operation for the past 40 years. In Section 28 of the principal Act provision is also made for the appointment of such a commission by the State President under specified circumstances. The existing procedure is that if a serious dispute arises between the Administration and a large number of its servants, and if that dispute cannot be resolved and may perhaps lead to a serious dislocation of the service, the Minister must report the matter to the State President. Then the State President appoints a commission and the commission is entrusted with the task of investigating the dispute and making recommendations. Under the existing Act the commission will consist of the following (Section 28 (4)): &#x201C;Any commission appointed under this section shall consist of not less than three nor more than five persons (not being servants of the Administration) and one of the members of the commission, who shall be chairman, shall if practicable, be <span class="col_725-726" refersTo="page_0377"/>a Judge or ex-Judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa.&#x201D; That is the present position which has worked well for 50 years. But I have improved it. Under the existing provision, the State President appoints a chairman who has to be a Judge or ex-Judge, if practicable, and such commission shall consist of not less than three and not more than five members. But the whole matter is in the hands of the Administration. The Administration not only appoints the chairman but it can appoint all the other members if it so desires. In other words, all the other members may be members who are prejudiced in favour of the Administration&#x2019;s case. For example, you may have three members who are ex-general managers of Railways. There is no obligation whereby one or more of the members must be appointed by the staff associations, that is to say, by the people concerned in the dispute. I have improved this provision. Now one of the members must be appointed by the staff association or associations concerned in the dispute. One of the members is appointed by the Administration. We also have an impartial chairman. He must be impartial and so we provide that he will be a Judge or ex-Judge. But it can happen that a Judge or ex-Judge is not available. Then the State President&#x2014; who makes the appointment&#x2014;must have the right to appoint another impartial chairman. But if we must accept the fact that such person must be a person acceptable to the staff associations, for example, it may protract matters very much. There may for example be six staff associations concerned in the dispute and each one of those staff associations must first be approached to find out whether they are all in favour of Mr. X. They may perhaps say that they are satisfied with him but staff association B may perhaps not be satisfied with him and then another man has to be found. The third staff association may possibly say that it is satisfied with him but the fourth may say: &#x201C;No, I am not satisfied.&#x201D; So if the amendment is accepted it is possible that instead of having a serious dispute resolved quickly and the commission being able to start its inquiry immediately, protracted negotiations may have first to take place which may run into weeks and months. That will not be to the advantage of either the staff or the Administration and so I cannot accept the amendment moved by the hon. member.</p>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I find it difficult to follow the hon. Minister&#x2019;s reasoning in view of the fact that this clause introduces a completely new principle in respect of the railway conciliation machinery in that it introduces compulsory arbitration. Now the hon. the Minister will know that one of the factors in regard to compulsory arbitration under the Industrial Conciliation Act is that the parties to the dispute must agree so far as the chairman is concerned. So the argument put forward by the hon. the Minister in relation to the position having existed for 25 years, falls away for the reason that in the past such a commission&#x2019;s findings were not binding on the Administration at all. But they are now. A further point the hon. Minister has made is that in the past the Administration appointed all three members but now the Minister has taken the specific power to appoint one member&#x2014;that is to say one member will be nominated by each side to the dispute. Therefore the position of the chairman becomes of key importance, and where the amendment suggested by the hon. member for Maitland is important is that if it cannot be a Judge or ex-Judge, then whoever it may be, such a person should be at least acceptable to the parties to the dispute. A further point that the hon. Minister has made is that it might be essential to settle a dispute quickly and that there can be delay in getting agreement among the staff organizations as to who will be acceptable as chairman. Surely the Minister has forgotten that he has at present a committee &#x2026;</p>

<p>Well, now, should we not give them that power in the case here! <b>I</b> would put it to the hon. the Minister that if there is an issue that affects all of the staff associations and it is going to compulsory arbitration, then in the interest of all the staff associations surely they will come to a very quick decision as to whether a name of a person submitted by the Minister is acceptable or not&#x2014;only where such a person is not a Judge or ex-Judge. I feel that the proposed amendment is in the best interests of the men in view of the fact that compulsory arbitration is now being introduced, a totally different concept to the existing position that has been in existence for the past 25 years. The main difference is that under the old set-up it was merely a commission whose findings were not binding upon the Minister at all, whereas now we are introducing compulsory arbitration. We are dealing here with an important issue for the very reason that the hon. the Minister has given that this provides for one person to be nominated by the staff association (or staff associations if it affects more than one), and one to be nominated by the Administration, and under those conditions the least we can expect is that the Minister should agree that the chairman must be a person acceptable to both sides.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. the Minister in explaining this matter, particularly for having taken me back 50 years, but I am afraid that he has not yet removed my dissatisfaction in regard to this particular point. With all due respect it looks to me as though we have to deal here with another sort of commission. As the hon. the Minister <span class="col_727-728" refersTo="page_0378"/>said himself, the possibility may arise where one finds that a chairman is appointed and that the staff associations are not satisfied with him. Where one has to deal here with an arbitration commission which is actually taking the place of the right to strike, I feel that it is most essential for the chairman of this commission to be a man who will be impartial beyond all doubt. The hon. the Minister said that the State President would appoint an impartial person of this nature but the question is whether he will be impartial in the eyes of the workers. Is the hon. the Minister therefore not prepared, particularly with a view to the new status of the commission, to accept the amendment?</p>

<p>Apart from the good reasons which I have already given as to why I cannot accept the amendment. I just want to point out that the staff associations are satisfied with this provision and if they are satisfied I feel that that is of far greater importance than the fact that hon. members are dissatisfied. They are after all the people who are involved in this matter and not hon. members. They are the people who will suffer if anything goes wrong and after they discussed this matter thoroughly and expressed their satisfaction with it, why should I change it merely to give hon. members their way?</p>

<speech by="#russell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RUSSELL</person>:</from>

<p>This of course is the clause that gives the <i>quid pro quo</i> of compulsory arbitration for the prohibition of the strike (dealt with in the next clause). It is in connection with these two clauses that, during the second reading, we covered such a wide field of debate. Before letting this clause pass through the House, we want to explain that we, on this side, make no apology for having defended the principle of the workers&#x2019; right to strike. We wished to make doubly sure that, in agreeing to compulsory arbitration, the railwaymen were not cajoled but were persuaded. We know now that they agreed with open eyes. In surrendering the right to strike as is done in the next clause the artisan staff were prepared to take this <i>quid pro quo of</i> compulsory arbitration, and they gave up their strike right willingly. I am glad that the hon. the Minister&#x2014;he did not do so at first introduction, nor in the White Paper&#x2014;eventually went to such great lengths to tell us in his second reading reply of the patient and lengthy consultation which took place before these clauses were agreed to by the different staff associations. When he first mentioned these negotiations, he told us so little that we were justified when we suspected that he had not had thorough consultations with the staff associations. We know now that the matter was discussed for a period of nearly two years; that the separate Executive Committee of every staff association examined these clauses; that they saw the whole Bill and had a chance of putting forward their suggestions and objections to it; that they had the benefit of the legal adviser, Mr. Conradie, to assist them; and that finally the Federal Council was consulted and consented. We are now convinced that the men were fairly consulted. It is a pity that the explanation was so casual and cursory when the Minister introduced the Bill originally. The House may remember that I ended my speech during the second-reading debate by saying: &#x201C;If I can get the assurance from the hon. the Minister that the men, before they consented, were properly and thoroughly consulted over every detail of the Bill, I will be satisfied.&#x201D; Having eventually got that assurance, I am satisfied that the Minister&#x2019;s <i>quid pro quo was</i> not forced on them, that compulsory arbitration is what they want in place of the doubtful right to strike. Even the Artisan Staff Association is prepared to give up its right to strike in order to have compulsory arbitration. I understand that some of the strikes that were instituted were in order to ensure arbitration. This Minister had often refused, for reasons which did not seem to the men to be sufficient, to go to arbitration. He had refused to advise the Governor-General, or the State President, to set up a Commission of Arbitration. Now that arbitration is compulsory and arbitration is binding on the Administration, the railway men&#x2014;six out of seven of the staff organizations with enthusiasm&#x2014;have accepted these clauses. Therefore I can say that I am satisfied, as I indicated I would be if I got a proper and full explanation. I am only sorry it came so belatedly. It would have saved time and misunderstanding if it had been sooner. We regard our job here not to act as bloodhounds baying at the Minister&#x2019;s heels, but as watchdogs in the public&#x2019;s interests. We felt that we have fulfilled that necessary function. We had to make doubly sure that nobody, and certainly not the men affected by this legislation, could in any way be prejudiced.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">THOMPSON</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to come back to the amendment moved by the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman). The hon. the Minister, in replying to the point raised, said that we should not be concerned about it because in fact the staff had been consulted on this point, and had accepted the clause as it stands. We would be more convinced by that explanation if the hon. the Minister could tell us that the particular point was before the minds of the staff when they accepted the clause. In regard to the main point, as the hon. member for Wynberg has pointed out, we are now sure of the position; but, in regard to this matter, the staff may have been so pleased to have got the concession that one of their own people could be nominated that they did not concern themselves further with the question of the chairman. I therefore think that the point made by the hon. member for Maitland is a very good one, and that this Board would carry a good deal more support if in fact it had as chairman either a Judge or an ex-Judge, <span class="col_729-730" refersTo="page_0379"/>or, failing that, an agreed chairman, and we therefore do ask the hon. the Minister again to consider whether he cannot accept the amendment of the hon. member for Maitland.</p>

<p>As stated by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mr. Russell), after the Minister&#x2019;s explanation at the end of the second reading we know much more about the Bill. But, Mr. Chairman, when one looks at Clause 15 which replaces Section 28 (1) of the original Act, one wonders why the hon. the Minister put in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). I think the hon. the Minister will agree that before any matter is referred to the Conditions of Employment Advisory Board, it must have been decided on by a majority of the staff association or staff associations concerned. If he feels, should there be a deadlock after that, that insufficient numbers of the men in the service are affected, or that it does not affect the public interest to any great extent, why should he then, if they want the matter to go further, insist upon a petition to be signed by a majority of the members? I wonder whether the Minister can put me right, I am under the impression that before a matter can be discussed by the Conditions of Employment Advisory Board, there must have been a majority of the members to put forward the case. I don&#x2019;t think it could be a matter of two or three people deciding on it. There must have been a majority at that stage. Therefore I do not understand why (a) and (b) are necessary. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister that this seems to be a let-out clause. It does give him a breathing space. However, I want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider deleting (a) and (b), because I think he has got everything he needs. He has great confidence in the working of the new arbitration machinery and in the Conditions of Employment Advisory Board, but should they fail to agree in the end, then I suggest the matter should be reported to the State President, without going through the machinery of paragraphs (a) and (b). When you are dealing with industrial legislation, you cannot take up the case of a few people to bring this board together. There are other ways for them, such as going through their shop stewards, but&#x2014;I do not want to repeat myself&#x2014;a majority of the people must have come forward before he considers this matter, and before there is a dispute. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister can give us an explanation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has raised an important matter, and I did not deal with that point in my speeches during the second reading debate. The present provision in the principal Act provides that where one-fifth of the members of a particular group or grade submit a petition, then the State President <i>may</i> appoint a commission. He is under no obligation to appoint a commission. What I wanted to avoid is that insignificant matters, matters that really do not justify compulsory arbitration, should lead to the appointment of a commission and the coming into operation of this machinery. This machinery must only be utilized in the very last resort. Now what will happen is this: Any matter can be discussed by the conditions of Employment Advisory Board, where you have an equal number of members on behalf of the management and behalf of the staff. They can make recommendations to the Minister. If the matter is not settled there, the staff association has the right to approach the General-Manager and to discuss the matter with him. If they cannot get any satisfaction there, they approach the Minister, and it is only when it is a serious matter and a dispute results that this machinery should come into operation. Now a dispute will not result when there are 20 or 30 men out of 110,000 affected in regard to a particular matter. There are certain grades in the Railways consisting of about 10 or 12 men, and the matter may he quite insignificant. Such a matter does not justify the appointment of a commission. In a case where the matter has been discussed by the General Manager and the staff association and by the Minister and the staff association, and the Minister has decided not to agree to their request, but it is a small and insignificant matter, only affecting a very small number of men, then the Minister has the right to say: Well, I am not going to recommend the appointment of this commission; I regard the matter of very little importance or no importance at all. It might, however, happen that the staff association as such regards it as a matter of principle. I might regard it as insignificant, as a matter of small moment, as a matter affecting only a very small number of the staff, but the staff association as such might regard it as a matter of principle, an important matter, and they might want to insist upon the appointment of a commission and the coming into operation of this machinery. But then they must show me that not only the members of the executive but that the Staff association as a whole regards it as an important matter. That is why they must then circulate a petition to be signed by the members of that staff association, and if the majority of the members sign a petition asking for the appointment of a commission, a commission must be appointed. I do not want this machinery to become a farce and that it must be put into operation for small and insignificant matters. Only in the last resort when there is a serious difference of opinion, resulting in a dispute, between the Minister and the Administration and the staff, this machinery must be put into operation. This is one of the matters that was not only fully discussed with the members of the staff associations, but as the matter was originally worded, it was quite unacceptable to them, and then I suggested that they should make suggestions in an attempt to solve the problem, because they agree with me in principle that insignificant matters must not lead to the appointment of a commission. Only after putting our heads together and receiving suggestions from the staff associations, we came <span class="col_731-732" refersTo="page_0380"/>to this conclusion, as embodied in this particular clause, and after a very full discussion of the provision as it stands now, it was accepted by all the staff associations.</p>

<block name="quote">The Administration shall be obliged to give effect, as expeditiously as reasonably possible, to every recommendation of the commission subscribed to by at least two of its members.</block>

<p>The words the Minister should give some further information on are those following the word &#x201C;effect&#x201D;, viz., &#x201C;as expeditiously as reasonably possible &#x201D;. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that if a commission of this sort were to suggest that there should be an increase in payments to a section of the staff, and the Minister is faced with a similar request from other sections of the staff, the cost may be beyond the Minister&#x2019;s means at that time.

<p>I realize that also. It appears to me that the commission&#x2019;s powers will be greater than those of Parliament. It is a very important consideration. That is why I am asking whether there is any specific meaning to be attached to the words here. I know, I am not a legal man, but I do know that the courts have interpreted certain words in certain ways in a context of this sort. I believe that it might be a &#x201C;let-out&#x201D; for the Administration if the Administration were able to say that they are not in a position to give effect to the commission&#x2019;s recommendations for one or other reason, and if the clause were to read &#x201C;the Administration shall be obliged to give effect to every recommendation of the commission subscribed to by at least two of its members,&#x201D; that would be definite, and there could be no argument. But I do not quite like the words &#x201C;as expeditiously as reasonably possible &#x201D;. It sounds like a &#x201C;let-out&#x201D; as far as I am concerned.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_transport">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TRANSPORT</person>:</from>

<p>I think it would be more dangerous. The Minister would have more opportunity to delay a matter if that suggestion is accepted. He can then merely accept the recommendations without saying when they must be implemented. If these words &#x201C;as expeditiously as reasonably possible&#x201D; were to be deleted, it would mean that the Minister could accept a recommendation and only implement it in 12 months&#x2019; time, or even two years&#x2019; time, if he pleases. This was discussed with the Federal Council and the legal adviser. Suggestions were originally made that a definite time limit should be inserted, such as six months, but it was found to be quite impracticable to do that. One does not know what the recommendations might be, or whether the management will be in the position to make the necessary arrangements to implement them within a specified time. For instance, in regard to consolidation, it took months before the management was ready to apply it. It was after very full discussion that these words were inserted, and we were assured by the legal adviser that it meant that there could be no deliberate delay, but that it would be done as expeditiously as possible, and it was generally accepted that unless something unforeseen happens which makes it quite impossible to implement the recommendation, it must be done within the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Coming back to the point I made just now, I can see the Minister&#x2019;s point that small matters should not be treated as matters in dispute, but he knows that it is usually the small matters which cause most of the trouble. I take it that before a matter is brought before this board, the Executive of the associations concerned must have discussed it. I want to know whether an individual can bring a matter to this board, or must it go through the machinery of his association?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Then the position is that the association comes forward as an association representing the majority of members and therefore they have <i>a</i> complete mandate. Would not the Minister agree that that mandate is strong enough without its going to a petition? Because it does not happen outside the railway service. In commercial firms if there is a breakdown of negotiations with employees, there is nothing in the industrial machinery whereby the members of the union have to get a petition signed. But here where you have a staff association which has the full confidence of its members, and it comes forward with a proposition and a deadlock is <span class="col_733-734" refersTo="page_0381"/>reached, a dispute is declared and the management might decide that the matter is of such minor concern that it does not affect the general running of the railways and they decide not to inform the President. The men in turn have to go back and get a petition signed. I am inclined to think that this is a let-out clause. The Minister will know the difficulty there is in having a petition signed throughout the Railways. It is not easy, and if you delay a matter like this for months it causes dissension. I think the whole secret of industrial legislation is to nip any dispute in the bud. I would still like to appeal to the Minister to consider deleting (a) and (b), because I think he has everything that he requires.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eaton">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EATON</person>:</from>

<p>I move the following amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To add at the end of paragraph (a) of the proposed sub-section (2) &#x201C;and at least one person who is an annuitant of the New Fund or the Fund and who, together with his alternate shall be nominated by the staff associations in manner prescribed &#x201D;.</block>

<p>This will make it possible for an annuitant, i.e. a railway pensioner, who has been nominated, to serve on the Joint Superannuation Fund Board. This amendment, I believe, is something which the Committee should consider very carefully because there are over 12,000 pensioners in the Republic to-day, and judging by the amount of correspondence I receive it is quite clear that a lot of them feel very dissatisfied with their lot as pensioners. I believe it would be a good thing if they retained a direct link with the Superannuation Fund Board by way of a representative nominated to serve on that board.</p>

<p>There is another reason. The Minister will know that recently there has been considerable activity amongst the pensioners themselves to get an association formed which will enable them to have a channel of approach to the Minister, and I can think of nothing better than such an association having a spokesman on the joint board by way of an annuitant member. It may be that the Minister will not be satisfied with the amendment I moved, but that does not alter the principle. If the Minister is prepared to concede that it would be advisable that the pensioners should have representation on the board, then words could be introduced to give effect to it. But I think that until I hear what the Minister has to say, I would like my amendment to stand.</p>

<p>I have every sympathy with the pensioners, but I think there is a lot of misunderstanding with regard to their position. It must be remembered that when a servant becomes a member of the pension fund, not only on the Railways but outside also, he enters into a contract and he has no claim on either the insurance company or the Superannuation Fund after that contract has been completed. The contract is that a certain amount must be paid monthly by way of contribution by the member and at the end of the stipulated period he receives a certain amount as pension, but he has no further legitimate claim. I have every sympathy for the pensioners, and that is why the Government years ago gave them an extra allowance, and merely out of sympathy they have had their pensions increased from time to time when it was found by the Superannuation Board that the fund could bear the additional cost, but there was no obligation on the fund or on the Administration to increase the pensions.</p>

<p>Why I cannot accept the amendment is for the following reasons. First of all, by appointing a pensioner it will disturb the balance of the Board on which there are an equal number of members representing the Administration and the staff. If a pensioner is appointed, he will hold the balance of power if there is a deadlock and that is not advisable. Secondly, the pensioner has nothing to do with the day-to-day administration of the fund. He will only be there as an applicant for increased benefits to the pensioners. That will be his job. But another reason why I cannot accept the amendment is this, that the staff associations cannot nominate a pensioner because he is not a member of a staff association. Which staff association will nominate a pensioner? The hon. member will see that apart from the principle it will be entirely wrong and it will serve no purpose to bring a person from outside the Railway service to serve as a member of the Board and there are also practical difficulties which make it impossible.</p>

<p>The first objection the Minister has is that if this amendment is accepted, the pensioner will hold the balance of power. That is why I said that perhaps the Minister will not accept the amendment as moved. The reason he has given is quite a valid one, but if the Minister were prepared to accept the deletion of the word &#x201C;servants&#x201D; and introduce the word &#x201C;persons&#x201D; there is no reason why the Administration could not appoint an annuitant and let the staff associations do the same, and the balance of power will be retained. But what is of more concern to me is that the Minister has left the impression with the Committee that what happens to the fund has nothing at all to do with the pensioner members, because they are receiving a pension as the result of a contract. But I think I must remind the Minister that an alteration has been made to the fund for the benefit of pensioners in the past whenever there has been an increase in their pension. As the Minister knows, there was a dispute on the Joint Superannuation Fund Board as to whether there should have been a further <span class="col_735-736" refersTo="page_0382"/>10 per cent increase or not, and surely the pensioners themselves should have some say in issues of that sort. It would be interesting to have the reaction of the pensioners to a suggestion of that sort. The Minister may well find that the pensioners will be opposed to it because some of them are receiving high pensions and some very low pensions, and they may suggest a differential rate.</p>

<p>No, I want to give effect to the principle that it is human nature that those whose need is greatest should receive most. It appears to me that if machinery were established to make it possible for the viewpoint of the pensioner to be put to the Board when they are deliberating things of this sort, it will be a good thing. It is quite clear to me that the Minister is adamant about this, but I hope he will take this thought back to the staff associations so that if in future they ask him to do this, he will do it.</p>

<p>Eighth Order read: Second reading, &#x2014;Rural Coloured Areas Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>The object of this Bill is to consolidate existing legislation applicable to traditionally rural Coloured Areas and to amend it. This legislation centres around the old and unilingual Cape Mission Stations and Reserves Act of 1909 which has already repeatedly been amended. The many amendments and the fact that the Act appears in one language only have created a general and recognized need for consolidation, something which has already been raised in this House on numerous occasions. That is why this Bill embraces various Acts such as the Act of 1909, Act No. 12 of 1949, No. 35 of 1955, No. 32 of 1959, No. 64 of 1960 and Act No. 31 of 1961. In spite of the numerous amendments there are still defects and obsolete provisions. The effective development and administration of the areas require measures for both their material and spiritual rehabilitation. Hence the need for amendment. The object is to make one Act available in a language which can be understood; to make provision for better conditions in regard to property rights; the better utilization of land; to eliminate undesirable conditions and to promote the development of towns and farming communities.</p>

<p><span class="col_737-738" refersTo="page_0383"/>A large number of the clauses of the Bill are already in existence and I shall therefore not refer to them on this occasion. The bilingual character of these areas gives rise to special circumstances which call for special measures. Some areas are still State property. In the case of others the occupiers are already the owners. Furthermore you have rural areas on the one hand, areas which are potentially agricultural areas and which if they are properly developed and put to proper use, will provide a means of livelihood to a large section of the rural Coloured community. On the other hand, due to the gradual and recently accelerated congregation of the inhabitants, residential areas have developed which have more and more assumed the character of towns. These towns have to meet to an increasing extent the educational, cultural, social and other needs of those people. They are also to an increasing extent becoming the homes of a class of person who has grown away from agriculture and who makes his living by following a profession or a trade. This diversity of interests requires not only specialization in the development of these areas, but specialized knowledge as well. In the agricultural field the interests of the <i>bona fide</i> farmers must be given priority. In the case of the residential areas there has to be the necessary planning in conformity with modern standards, with due regard to health requirements so as to prevent them from degenerating into primitive towns where slum conditions prevail. The board of management is financially and otherwise not capable of doing this while administrative regulations lack the necessary authority. Another defect which is inherent in the existing system is the concept of joint ownership, a concept which deprives the individual of his initiative and hampers sound development.</p>

<p>The Bill therefore envisages a reorientation by providing for the following in Clauses 21 and 49&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) the planning of each area in conformity with local circumstances&#x2014;to lay out residential areas in accordance with recognized standards; to make the best use of the agricultural potential and to create a group of <i>bona fide</i> Coloured farmers; and to develop other possibilities such as afforestation; and</li>

<li>(2) the granting of property rights after planning has taken place in order to encourage individual initiative and pride. The said right to own property will be free from the present limitation to the effect that it can only be let, mortgaged or alienated with the approval of the Minister.</li>

</ol>

<p>In Clause 43 provision is made for the laying out of closer settlements in those areas where the land, if suitable, will be put to more intensive use.</p>

<p>Moreover provision is made in Clauses 33 to 36 for an alternative system of local taxation in accordance with the well known system of paying taxes according to the value of the property. Under the existing system taxes are levied per erf. In order to make the proposed development a reality it will be necessary to clear up unhealthy conditions where they exist and to re-adjust the rights of the inhabitants. In Clause 49, therefore, provision is made for rights to be taken away in unplanned areas where those rights do not fit into the picture of the proposed planning. That will, however, be subject to compensation either by means of exchange or cash payment. This arrangement is more or less in conformity with the principle which governs the re-planning of towns.</p>

<p>Clauses 6 and 7 contain further provisions for the clearing up of existing unhealthy conditions. A special procedure is laid down for the administration of estates in various circumstances. There are a few areas, one of which is Suurbraak, where, because estates have not been administered, landed property has not been transferred for four or more generations. In those cases it is hardly possible to determine who the rightful owners are and to pass transfer or it is practically impossible for the interested parties to take transfer on account of the high costs connected with it. According to the proposed procedure the rightful owners can in those special cases come into possession of their inheritance by means of a simplified and cheaper method. (Similar arrangements were authorized in 1906 by the Cape Parliament in respect of the Coloureds along the Kat River.)</p>

<p>The Bill further ensures that land which is earmarked for agricultural purposes will indeed be used for those purposes. Provision is therefore made in Clause 49 that the right to own State property in existing areas will be subject to the condition that the land is put to beneficial use. If a owner neglects his property the Minister can warn him and if he ignored that warning, the property can be sold to somebody else who will indeed put it to beneficial use. If it is sold, however, the purchase price is paid over to the owner.</p>

<p>Under the existing provisions peculiar problems are experience by the boards of management in collecting taxes. The existing procedure is that if anybody is more than six months in arrear with his taxes the moveable property of such a defaulter can be attached and sold. If he has no moveable property or too little to meet the tax and the costs his right can be cancelled and sold. Many of the occupiers are not as yet aware of their responsibility towards their boards. It has been cheap or easy to get land or a place to live. Consequently many of them do not mind if their rights are cancelled and sold. As a result the boards are rarely in a position of tackling anything in the interests of their areas due to the lack of funds. All the boards feel that this is a great defect. Five boards called a meeting of their own accord and decided unanimously that the non-payment of taxes should be a punishable offence. The other boards got to know about this and without exception asked for the same thing. In other words, this provision is really being inserted at the request of the boards <span class="col_739-740" refersTo="page_0384"/>themselves. Provision is consequently made in Clause 37 for the existing procedure to be substituted by that suggested by the boards of management.</p>

<p>Clause 51 contains a new principle in respect of minerals in certain areas. It is suspected that there are rich deposits of minerals and precious stones (diamonds) in certain of the areas which is State property, particularly in Namaqualand. The land and the mineral rights belong to the State. When property rights are granted as provided for in Clause 49, the occupiers will be surface owners who, in terms of the mining laws, will have the right to prospect for and mine minerals. A real danger exists that there will be a rush and that unhealthy conditions may develop. To ensure therefore that order is maintained and that the said mineral wealth is used in the interests of the country, it is provided that the State will reserve to itself its existing right to minerals of whatever nature. Despite the granting of property right the areas listed in the Second Schedule to the Bill or those which will be added from time to time, will for that purposes of the laws governing the prospecting for and the mining of minerals, as defined in the said Clause 51, be deemed to be unalienated State land. The occupiers of land in such areas are therefore given property rights, rights which they do not have to-day, without the possibility of endangering possible mineral deposits.</p>

<p>The most important principles of the Bill, except the one in regard to mineral rights, were submitted to the Coloured Affairs Board and they were all supported with interest. In the case of the provision regarding the collection of taxes it was felt that it was a departure from normal procedure, but in the particular circumstances the necessity for it was realized.</p>

<p>This Bill provides a proper basis for the development and rehabilitation of these areas and their people; it places them on the road ultimately to exist as full-fledged agricultural communities and authorities. This, Sir, is a short summary of the most important principles of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">D. E. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>We have listened to what the hon. Minister has had to say and we accept the importance of this measure which we have before us. As the hon. the Minister has said there are a number of measures on the Statute Book which are being repealed by this Bill&#x2014;very important measures. This matter is one that will be dealt with in the Committee Stage in far more detail than we are prepared to discuss it in the second reading debate, but I do want to raise just one point for the consideration of the Minister and that is in the clause which permits him to delegate his authority under this Bill entirely to a member of the Civil Service. A measure of this kind where virtually consolidation is taking place in regard to a lot of old laws, new provisions are being brought in and streamlining has taken place&#x2014;what I might call the new deal for the Coloured people that is envisaged by the hon. Minister (I think that is a fair way to put it)&#x2014;is something which in the opinion of this side of the House should be in the hands of the Minister. All of us have numerous problems associated with the Coloured folk of this country. The hon. the Minister has been a Court of Appeal in regard to many of these matters and we do not want a change. We know that it may place a tremendous burden on the shoulders of the hon. the Minister; he has a lot of other legislation which he has to administer in respect of Coloured people and Coloured Affairs. I want to say that it may well be that he has in mind the Secretary for Coloured Affairs as the person to whom he is going to delegate his authority. That is a man who as far as I know carries the full confidence of all the Coloured people and of the Whites of this country and that might be a most admirable choice. But, Sir, our laws must not stand on persons. The Minister is answerable to us here in Parliament and there is no possibility then that an official may be placed in a position of having to give evasive answers to precise questions that may be placed before him from time to time. The crisp points which will require solution are not for him to decide because he is an official. This point will be raised more strenuously at a later stage. I now wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>As hon. members know the Coloured Development Corporation came into being last year. This institution was established by Act 4 of 1962 with the specific task of encouraging and promoting the advancement of the Coloureds in the field of trade, industry and finance. The Coloured population has shown great interest in all aspects of development in these directions, amongst others also in mining and fishing. Individual Coloureds, as well as already existing Coloured companies, have approached the Corporation on various occasions in the latter regard, but unfortunately the Corporation has not been able to help.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that as Act 4 of 1962 now reads, the Corporation itself is not empowered to establish or assist companies for mining and fishing. According to legal opinion its power in this regard is limited to industry other than primary industry. Hon. members are aware that there is great interest in the mineral potential of the North-Western Cape particularly in the Coloured areas and also by the Coloureds themselves. Whereas this Corporation <span class="col_741-742" refersTo="page_0385"/>was established especially to promote the interests of the Coloured community in various directions in the field of economy, the Corporation finds itself tied by the narrow interpretation of the expression &#x201C;industry&#x201D; and it is not able to establish companies for the exploitation of minerals or semi-precious stones, or even to assist companies financially or otherwise.</p>

<p>The proposed expansion of its objects would not mean that the Corporation would receive any preferential treatment. On the contrary any application by the Corporation, or by a company established by it, would still have to compete on merit with any other applications for mining rights submitted in terms of the laws which may be applicable.</p>

<p>As regards expansion of its objects to include fishing, it is the experience of the Corporation that interested persons can not always be assisted by the Fisheries Development Corporation. The norm applied by the latter Corporation is often beyond the means of individual Coloured fishermen, who may be interested in such a project. It is by no means the intention that the Coloured Development Corporation must or would supersede the functions of the Fisheries Development Corporation, but rather that it should be supplementary as far as Coloureds are concerned. It was indeed in this spirit that the legislation in respect of the Coloured Development Corporation was passed. Only after adoption of the Bill it was discovered that by reason of the narrow interpretation given to the expression &#x201C;industry&#x201D;, the required power was not included in the scope of the Coloured Development Corporation&#x2019;s activities. No help can, therefore, be given to a Coloured company, which cannot be assisted by the Fisheries Development Corporation.</p>

<p>A White person usually has other sources of assistance available, but with the Coloured it is not always the case. As hon. members know, this Corporation is a special aid to assist the Coloured. I wish to emphasize that it does not replace existing institutions, but merely acts as a supplement. As far as the interest of the Fisheries Development Corporation is concerned, any such assistance, or consideration thereof would be given in closest collaboration with that body. I am also prepared in the Committee Stage, if necessary to amend the clauses to that effect.</p>

<p>We are prepared on this side of the House to give this Bill our support. We feel that it is closing a gap which exists in the present legislation so far as the Coloured people are concerned, to provide them with an opportunity of being put on the basis of fair competition with other sections of the community&#x2014;the White people&#x2014;and it is entirely in line with our own policy. We feel that every encouragement should be given to the Coloured folk, that they should be given an opportunity to lift themselves and that here and there they should be given a helping hand. This Bill will give them an opportunity to be assisted in the few fields which are mentioned here, that is to say, mining and fishing, and will enable them to come forward and play their part in the development in the economy of our country. We are willing to back this Bill because it is designed to help them; we believe that it will have a very beneficial effect so far as those members of the Coloured community are concerned who have the initiative and drive and who are willing to come forward and play their part and take their share of the burden and the responsibility. We are willing to help them in the future which lies for them to take and to use for the benefit of themselves and of our country.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>My colleagues and I wish to indicate that we give this measure our support. We feel that this is a step in the right direction in the sense that it extends the activities of the Corporation and will enable the Corporation to give help to those Coloured companies and persons who desire to engage in the further activities envisaged in this Bill.</p>

<p>The Bill itself has been drafted in very wide terms. It indicates that for the purposes of this Act mining and fishing will be additional activities in which this Corporation can engage in providing finance, and the Bill then goes on to say that it shall also be entitled for the purpose of this Act to lend its support in respect of any other activity which the State-President may by proclamation in the <i>Gazette</i> declare to be an industry for the purposes of this Act and that such industries shall then be regarded as industries for the purposes of this Act. There is one aspect of this matter that I want to raise with the Minister. I think he has already indicated this in his second reading speech this afternoon but I think we ought to get some clarification of the situation. A lot of Coloured people feel that they are entitled to receive&#x2014; and I am sure it is the wish of the Government that they should receive&#x2014;financial support from this Corporation when they seek to engage in industry and commerce, but the fear has been expressed by some of them that as the Act is now worded the time may come when the Corporation itself may become engaged in the operational side of particular industries. In other words, the fear is held by the Coloured people that this Corporation may invest its money in the acquisition of shares in a company and take over control of the company which will operate in the field of mining or fishing or any other industry without the Coloured people themselves taking an active part in the operational side. I am sure&#x2014;the hon. Minister has indicated by shaking his head&#x2014;that is not the Government&#x2019;s intention. I think I am putting the position correctly when I say that it is merely the Government&#x2019;s intention that this Corporation should give financial aid to any Coloured institution or company or person who desires to become engaged in mining or fishing operations if the Corporation is of the opinion that that financial aid is warranted. I am glad to hear from the Minister that that is the position, in addition to which I am also glad to hear from the Minister this afternoon that the Coloured companies that will receive this financial aid from the Corporation will have to operate on a competitive <span class="col_743-744" refersTo="page_0386"/>basis with other industries in the country. In those circumstances my colleagues and I support this Bill.</p>
