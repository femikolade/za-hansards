<heading>Distribution of Television Films</heading>

<p>The MINISTER OF INFORMATION replied to Question No. XI, by Mr. E. G. Malan, standing over from 24 April.</p>

<question by="#malan" to="#minister_of_information">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<p>(a) How many television productions were (i) manufactured and (ii) distributed by his Department outside the Republic since 14 June 1963 and (b) in what countries were the films shown.</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_information" to="#malan">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(a)

<ol>

<li>(i) 48.</li>

<li>(ii) 40.</li></ol></li>

<li>(b) Some of the films produced since 14 June 1963 have been televised together with films produced before 14 June. The Department is not always informed when departmental films are televised in countries where South Africa is not officially represented. Such was the case with some showings of television films on the Wallaby Rugby Tour of South Africa. These films were shown in Wales and Scotland by ITN (International Television News), and syndicated to 42 different stations throughout the world by ITN.</li>

</ol>

<p>On the basis of reports received from our Information Offices in 12 Western countries, the following showings are known to have taken place:</p>

<p><i>News Films:</i></p>

<p>U.S.A.: Rand Easter Show.</p>

<p><span class="col_5621-5622" refersTo="page_144"/>Portugal: Ceremony at Historical Post Office Tree at Mossel Bay.</p>

<p>West Germany: Rand Easter Show; Opening of Transkei Parliament; &#x201C;Sanders of the River&#x201D; short subject.</p>

<p>Britain: Wallaby Rugby Tour televised in Wales and Scotland and syndicated to stations throughout the world; &#x201C;Zulu&#x201D; short subject.</p>

<p>Australia: Wallaby news films televised by seven TV stations. (25 programmes provided.)</p>

<p>Belgium: Transkei news film.</p>

<p>Holland: Transkei news film.</p>

<p>France: Ostrich race televised by Tele Monte Carlo. Excerpts from Transkei news film.</p>

<p>Southern Rhodesia: Films on Transkei elections.</p>

<p><i>Documentary Films:</i></p>

<p>U.S.A.: Workshop of a Continent&#x2014;televised 79 times. S.A. Commonwealth&#x2014;televised 54 times. S.A. Frontier&#x2014;televised 30 times. The Young Country&#x2014;televised 68 times.</p>

<p>Southern Rhodesia: How to Vote.</p>

<p>Portugal: The Wild are Free.</p>

<p>Spain: Impressions of Another Land.</p>

<p>South African Mosaic.</p>

<p>Australia: Friendly Touch-down.</p>

<p>Canada: Pearl of the Paarl. South African Mosaic. The Young Country. Timeless Land (twice televised). Impressions of Another Land. Dr. Janse.</p>

<p>Excerpts of information films are sometimes used in television interviews in which our information attaches participate. So, for example, the Information Attache in Brussels used extracts from these films in a programme entitled &#x201C;Life in South Africa&#x201D;, which was televised in February 1964.</p>

<p>The picture of the Department&#x2019;s television activities will not be complete without reference to the assistance given to visiting television teams. This was provided in the case of Mr. Omer Grawet, of Belgium, who subsequently made three one-hour programmes on South Africa, and Messrs. Andre Demedts and Honorin of RTF, Paris. RTF has also used a selection of material provided by the Department.</p>

<p>No, but the functions and structure of the Engineering Division of the Post Office were examined departmentally last year. The report which was published on 30 December 1963 contained recommendations for considerable improvements in the salaries and promotion prospects of the professional and technical staff of the Post Office.

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(b) On 6 March 1963 a complaint was received from the S.A. Telecommunications Association that the revised promotion rule was not being applied by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in respect of certain ranks in the Engineering Division of that Department. The <span class="col_5623-5624" refersTo="page_145"/>Public Service Commission thereupon requested the Postmaster-General to report on the application of the rule in his Department and to furnish particulars of the grades which were being excluded from the benefits of the rule.<br/>The report, which was received by the Commission on 21 October 1963, revealed that the Department had encountered problems in applying the rule to certain grades, including postmen, in which rank to rank changes were regarded by the Department as transfers or appointments and not promotions in the strict sense of the word.<br/>The Commission has not received representations dealing with postmen only.</li>

<li>(2) As the rule referred to is of general application in the Public Service and similar problems are being encountered in other Departments, the Commission is investigating the matter with a view to the amplification of the rule to ensure its uniform application throughout the Public Service, including the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The investigation has reached an advanced stage.</li></ol></li>

<p>Due to the wide scope of the Commission&#x2019;s investigation the delay in finalizing the matter is unavoidable.</p>

<heading>GOVERNMENT&#x2019;S DECISIONS ON RECOMMENDATIONS OF COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO SOUTH WEST AFRICA AFFAIRS</heading>

<p>First Order read: Resumption of debate on Government&#x2019;s decisions on recommendations of Commission of Inquiry into South West Africa Affairs.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Prime Minister, adjourned on 6 May, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, there are quite a few loose points to which I first want to reply before I deal with the debate in general. I admit that many of these loose points were made purely as debating points but I feel that they should not be left in mid-air. The first is this: I said that our policy of separate development was not being transplanted from South Africa to South West Africa but that the policy of separate development was a natural development within South West Africa itself. The construction which was placed on that statement was that I had stated that there were no common features between separate homelands there and separate homelands here. The question was asked, for example, what difference there was. I want to point out that these remarks were entirely beside the point the point I made was that there was no question of transplanting our policy because separate homelands had come into being naturally in South West Africa and that we were simply going to build on the pattern of homelands which already existed there. In other words, this is not an arbitrary transplantation of an ideology from South Africa to South West Africa. We are simply building on a foundation which naturally exists there already. To attach this other interpretation to my statement therefore is not only wrong but also misleading, perhaps deliberately misleading so as to give other people the erroneous impression that we are advancing false arguments here in an attempt to distract attention from the fact that there are in fact separate homelands. Let me also add that in arguing as it did about the establishment of a northern territory, with a character of its own, a Black-dominated northern territory, the United Party actually announced its own Bantu homelands policy for South West Africa; it admitted that there were historic reasons for the existence of a Bantu community which ought to be able to govern itself. Secondly, in arguing as it did, the Opposition made another admission. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition practically destroyed his own argument that there can be no political independence or no political development leading towards independence, without economic viability. After all, the same problem that will exist in the other Bantu areas, the problem that they will not be able to become economically independent, also exists in the northern areas. The Opposition nevertheless accept the proposition that it should be possible for an independent area to come into being in the north, naturally on the same basis as the basis in which we believe, and that is that political independence and economic independence need not go hand in hand in the case of smaller entities, but on the basis that the politically independent area will be able to lean for assistance on a larger economic neighbouring community, of which it will be able to form a part. In other words, in accepting the proposition of an independent territory in the north they are really abandoning the basic ground on which they continually seek to attack the homelands policy.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#steyn">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Who said they would be independent? Not we.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#prime_minister">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>The argument which was advanced here was that the northern area should have its own Legislative Assembly; that the latter should be an independent body; that it should really control a federation of the various ethnic groups, and therefore the principle of self-determination will also have to be applied to it. In other words, it can become independent. I was under the impression that that is what the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) said, but if I was under the wrong impression then I ask the Opposition now whether it means that in addition to all the other things that they reject they also reject the principle of self-determination for such an area? Because if that is the case their policy becomes <span class="col_5625-5626" refersTo="page_146"/>even more unacceptable to the outside world than I am going to submit it is already. That disposes of the one debating point which was raised here in an attempt to confuse our references to a homelands policy of its own for South West Africa.</p>

<p>A second point which hon. members on the other side made was that I waited too long before announcing the attitude of the Government and that I could have avoided all the uncertainty which existed in the minds of hon. members on the other side and in the outside world if I had taken the opportunity in Windhoek of announcing what was subsequently announced in the White Paper. My reply to that is that a Government chooses its own time to make its decisions known, and that that time depends on the circumstances. I was fully aware of the problems when I spoke in Windhoek. I was even aware of the first intimation from the countries to which I have already referred. In other words, it was not as though I spoke there in ignorance of certain objections to which my attention was drawn later on. I was fully conscious of these objections when I spoke there. I deliberately and steadfastly adopted the attitude that I had come to South West Africa to hand over the report to them officially and to inform them what the basic trend of the report was in certain respects, and I did no more than that. I emphasized over and over again that I was not in a position to deal with any of the Government&#x2019;s decisions and that I did not wish to do so because the Government had not yet considered the matter and had taken no decisions yet. I also gave the reasons why the Government had come to no decision, and that is that the Government wanted to await the reactions of the various sections of the population of South West Africa: that the Government did not want to take decisions in advance and thus encroach upon the right of the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa to make up its own mind on matters in connection with which the initiative ought to come from the Legislative Assembly. In other words, it was not my wish and it was not within my power to take any decisions and indeed it would not have been right for the Government to take decisions and to announce those decisions at the meeting in Windhoek. These facts are all well known, and it was just another debating point therefore to say that in order to clear up confusion in the minds of others, we should have made an announcement earlier even if it amounted to a violation of the right of the public of South West Africa first to air their views before we came to any decision. I was not willing to do so and I think I was perfectly correct in refusing to do so.</p>

<p>A third debating point which has been made here is that in appointing a Commissioner-General we allegedly appointed him within the framework of the homelands policy, and that in those circumstances the appointment should really be cancelled. I want to make it clear again that, although the appointment of this Commissioner-General may be a useful appointment under the homelands policy, it is not an appointment which necessarily goes hand in hand with the homelands policy. It is true that, in discussing the homelands policy, the Odendaal Report recommends such an appointment, but the idea of appointing a Commissioner-General there is one which occurred to us a long time ago already. As a matter of fact, even before the Odendaal Commission was appointed, we had already negotiated with this same Prof. Bruwer and had asked him whether he would not be willing to go to the northern areas as Commissioner-General in view of the fact that he knew these areas well, since he had done research there, and since he knew the language well. In other words, long before the Odendaal Commission was appointed we tried to persuade him to accept such a post. The creation of this post has nothing to do with the Report of the Odendaal Commission therefore, although the Commission does recommend such an appointment. The idea to introduce a system of Commissioner-Generalships originated much earlier of course; it dates back to the days before 1959, when that plan was disclosed here in dealing with the Bantu Authorities Act. The reason for that was this: We, the Government, were continually being attacked on the ground that we had no contacts with the Bantu communities under our care; that there was not sufficient consultation with them. We tried in vain to convince the Opposition and others that the entire machinery of the Department of Bantu Administration and of the Department of Bantu Education was designed to ensure the closest contacts with these people. The argument which was advanced against that was that the official machinery was there for the purpose of giving instructions, and that, consequently, it was not consultative machinery, but administrative machinery and machinery for the purpose of giving instructions. In actual fact that is not true, because the way in which the service functions ensures that the officials are kept in the closest touch, not with the agitators, of whom we cannot take any notice, but with the leading persons in the Bantu community whose views we must take into account. We, nevertheless, realized that, in addition to the official Public Service machinery, a further means of consultation should be provided, through the medium of direct political representatives of the Government in the homelands of the various ethnic groups, and not only in the homelands of the ethnic groups, but also in the White areas in which the members of the ethnic groups come to work. That is why we have appointed in the homelands of the various ethnic groups in the Republic persons who are in direct touch with the Government and who are fully aware of the Government&#x2019;s policy, persons who, on the one hand, explain the Government&#x2019;s policy to the Bantu in the course of conversations with them&#x2014;they do not give instructions&#x2014;and, on the other hand, inform the Government of the <span class="col_5627-5628" refersTo="page_147"/>reactions of the Bantu communities. In other words, here we have a special form of creating close links between the Government and the Bantu communities. There is no reason at all therefore why such a person should not be appointed in the northern areas, in Ovamboland, whether the homelands policy is carried out there or not. This appointment was made with that specific object, and it is not going to be rescinded. All I need add to that is that I also stated at the time that if any homeland became an independent state, that is to say, when it reached the last stage of its development, the Commissioner-Generalship would assume a different character. The Commissioner-General would then no longer be the consultative link between the Government and these populations, but his post would be equivalent to that of a diplomat representing one country in another. As far as that is concerned, there is no reason either why I should depart from the attitude which I have adopted previously.</p>

<p>The point has also been made that there is a shortage of manpower and that because of that shortage it will not be possible to carry out the work referred to in the White Paper. When a similar point was made on one occasion in connection with health&#x2014;I think it was made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself&#x2014;I said by way of interjection, &#x201C;That is why there is the second group of recommendations.&#x201D; The second group consists of those recommendations about which administrative decisions will have to be taken from time to time as the work progresses. That point was then taken up and interpreted as meaning&#x2014;I want to quash this misrepresentation immediately&#x2014;that I had suggested that developmental plans along these lines were no more than bluff because such decisions would not be taken administratively because of the shortage of manpower. That was of course not what I meant at all. I meant that an ideal objective was stated in this report, e.g. in respect of health services. In view of the shortage of medical men in our country, and in fact throughout the world, even this would be a great ideal. One realizes that one cannot attain such an ideal immediately and that one may be handicapped by the lack of practical means, but one still aims at rendering the maximum service, and the administrative decisions one will have to take from time to time will have that object in view. One therefore does not say beforehand: I will not do this because I do not have the manpower. Because one sets this as the ideal, one tries to recruit or to train the necessary manpower, or one makes alternative plans. In connection with health services for the Bantu, I have for example already said before that the time had perhaps arrived to introduce a different form of training, a middle class training, as it exists in some countries of Europe, where under the guidance of a medical man, assisted by medical aides, who have not enjoyed quite the same level of training, greater services can be rendered than it would be possible to provide with a limited number of fully-trained medical men. In the thickly populated countries of Europe something like this already exists. In the sphere of dentistry, for example, in Germany, in addition to the dentists there are the dental mechanics who extract and fill teeth under the supervision of a more qualified person. If we want to cater for these enormous masses of Bantu in South Africa, particularly by means of their own trained people, such an intermediate stage of training will be necessary. I am just making the point that when one is faced with a shortage of manpower and one says: &#x201C;Yes, but in view of that I have left the decision in the hands of administrative organizations&#x201D;, that does not mean that one can abandon the attainment of one&#x2019;s ideal, but that in this way all possible measures can be applied to perform the task and to approach as nearly as possible to the attainment of the ideal. I do not like people to allege that we are busy with a bluff here when we are tackling the matter in all earnestness.</p>

<p>Then we again had the story about all the dangers. Now suddenly it is alleged to be dangerous for South Africa and for South West Africa if different Bantu homelands should develop here because they will fall under the control of communists. It is the same scaremongering that we had in regard to South Africa. Basutoland and Swaziland and Bechuanaland can be allowed to become independent, because that takes place under British control! Then homelands are not dangerous! Or if they are dangerous, that is just accepted by the Opposition. Then it must just be so! But if we promote development in areas which are equally entitled to their own development, the United Party says that those areas will be subjected to communist influence and that they will become dangerous. They never reply to the counter-argument we always put up against that, viz. that it would be a much greater danger to the world, for South Africa, for Africa and for the Whites, if those Bantu, who are supposed to be so susceptible to Communism, in fact become the dominant majority group in the whole of South Africa. Surely then the whole of South Africa will be the area which will become subject to those communist influences and interference from outside.</p>

<p>Now the same story is being told in connection with South West Africa. How valueless it is is particularly evident from the fact that the United Party is prepared to have a homeland north of the red line. They even want to make it big; they want to make it a federated area covering the Kaokoveld and the eastern Caprivi. But that will not be dangerous, in the sense of communist interference, because it is a Bantu homeland created by them and not by us! That shows how ridiculous all this scaremongering is, and I need not say more about it.</p>

<p><span class="col_5629-5630" refersTo="page_148"/>I want to point out further that throughout this debate the United Party was concerned with &#x201C;debunking&#x201D; the attempt to do something for South West Africa. They criticized or attacked every point. I am going to mention six or seven of these points to prove how they have tried to belittle and to water down every positive thing that we want to do there. Accordingly, they sarcastically posed the question: How will the development there be financed? Who will pay for it? Where is the money to come from? Can we find the money? I can reply to that quite easily by putting the counter question: If the United Party had been in power, would it have left South West Africa undeveloped? Would it have left it in the lurch? Would it have done nothing more there? If the United Party comes into power, will it exercise its guardianship or not? And if the reply is that of course development will take place and that the United Party will fully perform its guardianship obligations, then I in turn ask: How will they finance it? What financial resources have they? Will South Africa have to pay for it? In fact, they themselves gave the reply by saying that they were in favour of large-scale development there and that they were willing that the taxpayer in South Africa should help to pay for it. Why then arouse this suspicion and cast doubt on the possibility of our financing this sort of planning?</p>

<p>Secondly, they make an attack on the Kunene Scheme. On the one hand they ask why such a &#x201C;colossal plan&#x201D; is being proposed. Then they say it is impracticable and ask where we will get the manpower from, and where are the resources? They do not believe that it can be completed in five years. They do not ask whether Dr. Van Eck. who signed the report as the expert adviser, considers that it can be done. No, they must try to put some political substance into their arguments by directing all these insinuations at me. For the rest, they come along with the suggestion of generating a little electrical power in the south and a little in the north. And then they make the accusation that the details have not been worked out, etc. Let me say this in reply to all that: If they think that they can establish a unit in the northern areas and they begin by breaking down the basis on which that unit could have a moderate viability, i.e. both through agricultural progress and through having a source of revenue from the provision of electricity, if they do not grant that area this great scheme, then they can just forget about establishing that northern area. Then they undermine in advance their own proposition that one should try to give maximum viability to an area before making it politically independent.</p>

<p>They go further in their attempt to belittle everything. They say that we want to provide too many transport facilities. For example, we want to establish too many main airfields, 16 in number. If only the hon. members would study the report and see where those airfields will be established, they would see in the first place that they are not going to be Jan Smuts airfields; and secondly, in regard to the main airfields, that it is essential that widely separated places like Windhoek, Walvis Bay, Luderitzbucht and Runtu, in the far distant Okavango, should have airfields. In the same way an airfield will be necessary at the administrative centre in Ovamboland and at the place where the electricity scheme has to be developed. An airfield will also be necessary in the south, at Keetmanshoop. So hon. members may go through the list and ask themselves whether it is not reasonable to have an ordinary, suitable airfield at all these places where both passenger and freight aircraft can land. That is all that it is intended to provide there. That is ridiculed as if it is nonsensical. Too many transport facilities!</p>

<p>Further, they advance the argument: If the authorities buy the farms, who will look after those farms? As if one would just leave these farms to lie there and deteriorate! In the first place, these farms can all be let, perhaps to the people who sell them because they want to put an end to the uncertainty, but in the transitional period would still like to farm on those farms. Therefore until such time as the State utilizes those farms for any specific object, the State will of course look after them, as it has always done when it acquires land. Such, land is properly looked after. Then the Opposition attacks the appointment of an expert committee and the appointment of a liaison committee, as if it is not normal practice, when steps have to be taken in the economic sphere, the financial sphere or the administrative sphere, to have the matter thoroughly investigated by expert officials in order to work out the detail. Surely that is the normal practice. The Opposition does not want us to continue along those lines because they do not want the development of South West Africa to take place. The United Party also wants the liaison committee, which has to arrange matters in the transitional period, to be eliminated because they say that the Deputy Minister and the Administrator are there and they can arrange these things amongst themselves. It is quite possible that the Deputy Minister and the Administrator will both serve on the liaison committee. The point, however, is that when one is dealing with a plan of large-scale development&#x2014;even though we do not touch the matters in regard to which decisions cannot yet be made&#x2014;a large development plan in regard to which two authorities have to co-operate, it is obvious that the people in the two Administrations who have to deal with the matter must be brought into contact with one another. Instructions cannot simply be issued to them. Such a committee is a useful factor in sound organization. But that has to be belittled also!</p>

<p>The United Party should not now go and pose in South West Africa as a party which is sympathetic to the socio-economic development there. It should be seen as it really is, <span class="col_5631-5632" refersTo="page_149"/>as a party which tries to belittle everything in regard to a plan drawn up to do something great and good for a territory which has been entrusted to us.</p>

<p>A further point made by the Opposition is that the Department of Bantu Administration should be handed over to South West Africa, because that is supposed to be what the world demands. But do they have no knowledge of what happened in the past? In the first place, right from the beginning the duty was put on the Republic itself, on the guardian, to assume responsibility for the non-Whites. At that time it was considered so important that this responsibility was entrusted to the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Department. During the time when Dr. Malan was Prime Minister, he felt, <i>inter alia</i> as the result of overseas pressure, that the then Union Government should act more directly in that respect. He called me in and said that my Department of Native Affairs should take over the responsibility there, because the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Department could not keep the machinery going to carry on those activities, as the outside world desired. Therefore a closer link was then established between the guardian and the ward, viz. that the affairs of the non-Whites in South West Africa would no longer be handled by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s Department by means of messages sent to the Administrator, who really controlled non-White affairs, but they were directly handled by the Department of the Union Government which was the expert department here for that purpose. After that was done, however, we still received reproaches, <i>inter alia</i> from UNO, that the Central Government, the guardian itself, did not do enough in regard to those matters, but still allowed the South West Africa Administration to do too much. In spite of the fact that a Department in the Republic took the responsibility on itself, the accusation was still made that we did not do enough directly. When, for example, the Carpio Commission was here, one of the points of attack, not only by members of that commission but also by UNO officials who accompanied that commission, was that the Republican Government evidently did much for its own Bantu in the Republic, but that it should itself do more for the Bantu there and also for the other non-Whites: that it should take a greater share of the administration into its own hands. When I replied to that as Prime Minister I had already stated that we would make a more thorough investigation as to what we could do, <i>inter alia,</i> by the appointment of an expert committee of inquiry, it was readily accepted and it was said that they were very glad that we had adopted that course. That is the demand made by the outside world. But now hon. members opposite, in complete ignorance of such negotiations and information available to us, make these demands they have made.</p>

<p>The question was also put as to where the promised legislation was, if they sought to prove that our intentions were now different from those announced at the opening of Parliament in the Presidential Speech. The fact is that legislation has already been passed which is of importance to these plans set out in the White Paper and which we already then had in mind. Legislation was passed which was intended to make it possible for us, in connection with large schemes such as the Kunene Scheme, to make use of institutions, or affiliations of the institutions, existing in South Africa. It will probably be necessary to make use of the machinery available to the I.D.C. or to Escom in connection with those developments, both in regard to the financing and placing of loans either in the Republic of South Africa or abroad, and in regard to the expert detailed planning and implementation thereof, and thereafter possibly the control of the distribution and the sale of power. Therefore the promised legislation is there already. It is not necessary to ask me where it is. The prospect of more legislation being introduced if necessary has already been held out.</p>

<p>Then a point was made in regard to the shifting of populations. It is said that we are dealing here with a tremendous shifting of populations, that more than half of these people have to be removed. I want to say a few words about that. Firstly, the number of persons who may be concerned in such removals is not as great as was stated here. It is in fact a large number compared with the total non-White population of Southern South West Africa only, but in fact it will not be a very large-scale process. One of the undoubtedly good removals which we undertook here, viz. in the Republic itself, merely the shifting of a location, namely the removal from Sophia-town and Martindale to Meadowlands, which was undoubtedly a beneficial step in the interest of the Bantu, comprised more people than will be concerned in all the removals in South West. When the Bantu saw where they were going to, they were keen to go to Meadow-lands. Propaganda was made against it; the &#x201C;leave them in the veld&#x201D; story was later proved to be untrue. To-day those people are living there in excellent residential areas, supplied with all kinds of services, schools, recreational and other facilities. These people are glad that all the attempts made by the Opposition to prevent this scheme from succeeding and to sow suspicion have proved to be a total failure. The same will happen here. Nor is there any idea of trying to force these people to leave. In this case also it will be proved that people of one group want to live together. Population removals <i>per se</i> are not so bad. If a population removal leads to improved conditions, greater viability and more prosperity, then it is in fact a good thing. It should not be seen as an ugly form of forcing people to go to unsuitable places. It should be seen as the bringing together of people who like to live together, and who will accept the removal if they know that it will improve their position. Then there is also the following: When non-Whites live in a number of separate reserves, <span class="col_5633-5634" refersTo="page_150"/>and if some of the reserves become too small for them so that there is over-grazing and the water resources become exhausted and the position of these people becomes worse and worse, what is the guardian expected to do then? Is he expected to say that they must just remain there and die of hunger? Or does one expect the guardian to say: &#x201C;I must make a plan to improve your living conditions?&#x201D; And if the improvement of the living conditions can best be done by accommodating that community in one large area of its own, even though the people have to be removed from smaller, neglected areas, there is no harm in that. On the contrary, just bringing the whole community together will give rise to possibilities for the development of those people, to occupations they can fill, to professional services they can render to their own people, and the position of authority in which they will be placed. By bringing communities together, a need arises for professional people like doctors and teachers and shop managers, etc. If in addition there can still be urban development in the area of that community because it need no longer be spread out in small rural communities, the opportunities for and the position of these people will improve enormously. What is wrong with that? Therefore a population removal cannot be seen as an evil <i>per se.</i> Regard should be had to the end results of our objective. Everything contained in this report is directed to the development of much more viable communities in very good and large areas, and to the potential of urban development, perhaps with small industrial development in the beginning, so that the possibility of providing jobs of all kinds for the children who grow up there will increase. Large schools may even be established to train these children to render services to their own community. I therefore deprecate the fact that the impression is being created and disseminated that we are dealing here with a reckless removal of populations with a view to suppressing them, whereas we are dealing with an improvement of the conditions which will induce these people to live together happily and which will enable them to live there more prosperously and to have all kinds of opportunities which they would not have had if they lived in isolation.</p>

<p>Another point which was raised here is that there is supposed to have been a conflict of ideas on the part of the Commission of Inquiry in South West Africa. On the one hand Dr. Van Eck is supposed to have spoken about dealing with the territory as a whole, while on the other hand, in the other portions of the report, particularly in the political section, provision is made for a division of the territory. That is also a nonsensical argument, because what happened? All the members signed the report as a whole, and the allegation that each one was just responsible for his own portion of it is not true. Each one drafted his section of the report, but thereafter the Commission as a whole sat and discussed every letter and every sentence and every chapter of the whole report, jointly. They not only assumed joint responsibility by signing the whole report, instead of each one just signing his own section of it, but in fact they jointly went through this report over and over again and they all subscribed to the report as a whole. In addition, there is still this, that we continually say that there is a difference between political independence with the possibility of every person having his separate opportunities among his own people, and economic mutual dependence by which the various political units still get a joint viability. Therefore the idea of an economic unity with political separation is basic to our whole policy and basic to every word we have said in this debate. But still hon. members come to this House and say that there is a divergence of outlook between what is said in respect of the economic development and what is said in respect of the political development!</p>

<p>Another point which was made is that the process of the financial linking-up of South West Africa with South Africa was rejected by the Holloway Commission. In other words, eleven years ago that was not acceptable. That is so. But in the meantime conditions have changed radically. Therefore it is really irrelevant that a Commission in the circumstances prevailing 11 years ago (when there was no idea of these enormous plans which should really be implemented jointly) decided that there was no reason for a link-up. That has nothing to do with decisions which may be taken to-day when a financial linking-up is particularly necessary in order to have a joint effort for the implementation of something which is very great and which is of vital interest to both areas. Let there be no doubt that it is just as important to South Africa that South West should be prosperous and peaceful as it is to the people in South West. Our interests are inextricably bound up with one another. The Republic has as much interest in all the schemes for the great developments there, because it will benefit from them, both economically and politically. The fact that 11 years ago there was a Commission which adopted one standpoint, and that under different circumstances a different attitude is now being adopted in regard to this linking up, by ourselves and by the new Commission and by the population of South West Africa and by the Legislative Assembly of South West Africa, is not strange at all.</p>

<p>Reference was also made to my remarks in regard to Mr. Randall. If anyone had read the Hansard report of my explanation in regard to Mr. Randall&#x2019;s remarks, he would find nothing wrong in it. This attempt to arouse feelings by implying that I attacked a friend of South Africa, which can result in his becoming ill-disposed towards us, has no substance. It would be a deplorable state of affairs if every foreigner who says something good about South Africa thereby buys our silence when he says something against South Africa, or something wrong about South <span class="col_5635-5636" refersTo="page_151"/>Africa. I am very grateful for all the nice things he said and also for the article written by Mr. Randall, and I told him so personally. But at the same time that does not mean that when he tells me in an argument, &#x201C;But I do not agree with that&#x201D;, I must say, &#x201C;Because you were so friendly, I will just concede that point.&#x201D; No, then I argue with him and tell him where he is wrong, and he does not take it amiss. When, however, this gentleman does something in public which in my opinion is wrong and which can create the impression that he was deliberately sent here to influence the public to exert pressure on the Government, then I must say what I did. If I have to condemn something like that, even in public, then I must do so. Thereby one does not necessarily give offence to a friend. If the friend takes offence, he is not a true friend. Then he did not adopt his standpoint on principle, because it is not possible to force people away from what they have expressed as their own honest convictions merely by saying something which they do not like. Seeing that I have had to revert to this matter, let me add something else. The hon. member says that America adopts a certain attitude because it maintains the rule of law. Now I must say that this sort of argument makes no impression on me, because I look at what happens further away in the world. I remember that a short while ago there was a revolution in Zanzibar, and after that revolution the representatives of the great powers were ousted from that territory because those great powers did not immediately recognize the new rebel government. Presumably they did not want to do so in terms of the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D;. But what happened? Immediately afterwards, when the threats began to accumulate, they recognized that rebel government and their representatives went back to the country of that rebel government. Was it the &#x201C;rule of law&#x201D; which counted here, or was it the principle of international expediency? People are not impressed by that sort of argument. One has to do what is sensible and useful, and that is the yardstick by which Governments have to make their choice.</p>

<p>The proposition was then advanced that we were not applying the principle of self-determination. It was alleged that in spite of the wishes of those communities we were establishing separate areas for them. That is not true. What we are going to do is to create opportunities of development for those groups and to give them the right of self-determination in their own areas. We are giving them the opportunities; it is for them to make use of those opportunities. Indeed, as far as the northern areas are concerned we are creating an opportunity for the separate ethnic groups to govern themselves independently at some future date. As a matter of fact, that is the existing position in a slightly different form. But the United Party, in creating a northern federation, really wants to force the various ethnic groups into one society; it does not say that they can choose to form one entity. As far as I am concerned they are free to make that choice. If the groups which hitherto have refused to cooperate prefer that course, let them do so. There was a time, when I was Minister of Native Affairs, when the seven Ovambo tribes would not even co-operate with one another. When I tried to arrange a meeting to address five of the Ovambo tribes, they refused to meet on one farm because they wanted to maintain their own apartheid. Eventualy they were persuaded to come when a galvanized wire fence was put up which separated the areas in which the different groups were seated, and the Chief sat in front. For the purposes of meeting me it was accepted that each tribe would be sealed on its own land. That was how far they went in their willingness to co-operate&#x2014;and they were all Ovambos. But the United Party wants to force together the people of the Kaokoveld, who are not Ovambos, and the Okavangos, who are not Ovambos either, and the two sections of the Caprivi who are not Ovambos either. Furthermore, it is the United Party&#x2014;not we&#x2014;who are prepared to throw overboard the idea of self-determination. As far as I am concerned, if the different groups wish to come together of their own volition at some stage or other of their development, they are free to do so. But what we are promoting is what they have to-day and what they want to do. That is all we are doing. That is why it is not correct to suggest that we are throwing the idea of self-determination overboard.</p>

<p>Having said that, I now want to get away from what I called the loose debating points; there were others as well, but I have said enough to prove that the attacks made upon us here were without substance.</p>

<p>I want to look at the broader picture now, and I want to put this question, which is the basic question in the whole of my argument: What is the basic difference between the Government&#x2019;s policy and the United Party&#x2019;s policy with regard to the future development of South West, particularly in the political sphere? I want to use three yardsticks to test that basic difference. The first yardstick I want to use is the attitude adopted by the two Parties themselves; the second yardstick is the policy which the outside world wants us to apply, and the third yardstick is how we in this country view this matter, particularly having regard to the position of the Whites.</p>

<p>Let us first compare the attitude of the two Parties with regard to this problem. It is perfectly clear that the Government adopts the trusteeship principle; the Government accepts its position as trustee; it acts in the spirit of the mandate, and in accordance with that spirit it has taken certain obligations upon itself; it has taken upon itself the obligation to promote the well-being and the progress of those people. It has to do what it regards as being in the best interests of the inhabitants. It was appointed as trustee and its duty is not to ask what others want or how it can secure peace for itself with other states; the question which it has to ask itself basically is this: How can I <span class="col_5637-5638" refersTo="page_152"/>promote the best interests of the inhabitants? Our policy is based on our belief that whatever others may say, the only way in which we can test our policy and our actions is by asking ourselves whether we are honestly and sincerely doing what a Christian guardian can be expected to do for the peoples entrusted to his care.</p>

<p>As against this, what is the United Party&#x2019;s approach? The United Party&#x2019;s approach is this: &#x201C;How can you satisfy the outside world; how can you make sure that the outside world does not become annoyed with you?&#x201D; The Opposition does not ask. &#x201C;What is in the best interests of the inhabitants?&#x201D; but &#x201C;how can you satisfy other people in other countries?&#x201D; If foreigners want to use South West Africa as a football in international politics and if certain Africa States want to use South West Africa as the thin end of the wedge to cause discord between South Africa and the West, the only question which the United Party asks itself is how, in spite of that, it can ensure that South Africa does not get into trouble. In other words as against the basic concent that the duty of the trustee is to promote the well-being of the inhabitants, we have this opportunistic policy of the United Party, whose sole concern is not to benefit the inhabitants but to see how it can avoid trouble with countries in the outside world, even if they are countries which have selfish motives and which are prepared to make attacks upon South Africa to promote their own interests. I want to make it clear that the first big clash between the United Party and the Government is a clash between opportunism and principle, between the selfish search for prestige (for which they are prepared to sacrifice everything) and the Government&#x2019;s attitude of saving, &#x201C;Even if I have to fight for the interests of the inhabitants and even if it means hardship for me, I am nevertheless going to do for them what I as trustee think is right.&#x201D;</p>

<p>As I have said, there is a second angle from which I want to approach the basic difference between the two Parties, and that is the reaction of the outside world. In other words, what possibility is there of either of these policies satisfying the outside world in the long run? What are the chances of success of the two policies in this connection? And here I am not talking about immediate reactions because we all know what the immediate reactions are. I am talking about the long-term chances of succeeding in satisfying the outside world. The United Party labours under the illusion that their political measures will succeed in satisfying the outside world. I do not believe it for a moment. Basically the agitation in the outside world, as far as South West Africa is concerned, is based upon the principle of one man, one vote; let us make no mistake about that. It is true too that there are some Western nations who are asking that concessions be made and who say that they are not asking at this stage for one man, one vote. But the basic object of this whole agitation on the part of the Afro-Asiatic majority in UNO is &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;, and that also applies to South West Africa. That demand is not being met by the United Party, nor does the United Party support the further demand which is bound up with it and that is the demand that the majority must govern. Our attackers in the outside world say that South West Africa is the Black man&#x2019;s country. What is the United Party&#x2019;s offer?</p>

<p>The United Party offers to establish a northern area which it is satisfied will be governed on the basis of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;, because it accepts the northern area as a Black area under Black domination. The fact that it wishes to make it a federation means, of course, that it will be dominated by the Ovambo. The other minority groups there will have to come under the tyranny or the power of this one group which has never before exercised authority over them. But let us leave that aside. That is the first leg of its solution. Then we come to the second leg and that is the establishment of a southern area, which will also have its own legislative assembly. What is to be the position in that legislative assembly? That legislative assembly is to be under White domination. They are going to make sure by means of manipulation that that is the case. It is true that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) has a somewhat different approach which is much nearer to the principle of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D;. He argues this way: The Whites, together with the Basters and the Coloureds, form 50 per cent of the population and the remaining non-Whites will also constitute about 50 per cent; in other words, the guarantee for the Whites lies in the fact that there will be a 50-50 balance. He thinks that by conceding the principle of &#x201C;one man one vote&#x201D; in those circumstances the Whites will have an opportunity to make their influence felt sufficiently. I do not want to go into that at this stage; I shall come back to it later on. I am just pointing out that by means of manipulation a southern state will then come into being in which the White man will continue to rule.</p>

<p>But what is the third leg of their attitude? The third leg is that there is to be a federation between the northern area and the southern area. The federal government of the northern and southern areas will then be the dominant authority, and if, as the United Party says, the White man is to continue to retain the leadership in that federation as well, it will have to retain it by means of manipulation, by means of a Constitution which places the White man in a position of power in a federal government which represents a Black territory and a mixed territory, in which the White man already has a representation of 50 per cent only&#x2014;if it is as much as that&#x2014;and in which he has already obtained a degree of authority out of proportion to his numbers. Sir, I ask any person with common sense whether that is going to satisfy world opinion. On the principles of allowing justice to be done, is the United Party going to comply with the <span class="col_5639-5640" refersTo="page_153"/>demands which are continually being made by the outside world by adopting that method to maintain White supremacy over the whole of South West Africa? And let me also add this: The Opposition have attacked us here and they have said that we must not develop the homelands idea because when the Arden-Clarke proposal was rejected, the homelands idea was rejected by implication. But their own idea of a dividing line, a partition, between the northern and the southern areas is tied up much more closely than any other proposal that one can put forward with the proposition put forward by the Clarke Commission. In other words, in suggesting a separation between the north and the south, are the Opposition not going to come into conflict with the United Nations in the same way as the Arden-Clarke Commission did and in the same way that our policy, according to them, will be rejected by the United Nations? Will the plans put forward by the United Party put a stop to the agitation against South Africa? Here I want to call a witness to prove that it will not in fact put a stop to it. That witness sits in this House; I refer to the hon. member for Houghton (Mrs. Suzman) who has already attacked the United Party&#x2019;s plan in the course of her speech here. And if that happens here, will the same thing not happen in the outside world? Will the policy of the United Party not be attacked (just as our policy is attacked) on the ground that it does not go far enough and that it is not satisfactory? What the hon. member for Houghton said here is symbolic of the attacks that will be made upon the United Party&#x2019;s policy in the outside world and by certain sections of the public in this country. That is why I say that that test shows that in putting forward this policy the United Party is not offering a solution as far as the outside world is concerned. I repeat most emphatically that they will not succeed in practice, nor on the basis of any principle. With their proposal they do not comply with the principle which is laid down in the mandate that the trustee must serve the best interests of the inhabitants, nor do they satisfy the other principle and that is that they must also satisfy the people concerned. Even though their partition policy may satisfy the Ovambos, is it going to satisfy the Hereros or the Basters if they allow these groups to be swallowed up in the southern state which they propose to establish? These people are also striving for independence and for a share in the government of their own affairs; they do not want to become minority groups in a White dominated southern state. In other words, what the attitude of the United Party amounts to is that the numerically stronger ethnic groups will dominate the numerically weaker ethnic groups, or that Whites are going to rule over non-Whites. Neither of these alternatives will resolve the clash which is being instigated abroad, but in addition to that they fail to comply with the principle of trusteeship. Their policy will lead to majority government&#x2014;majority government by the Ovambos! I contend that as a result of that situation there will be so many clashes in South West Africa, as there have been in other parts of Africa, that the result will be an economic collapse, even before the advent of a Black dictatorship, which will certainly be the outcome, just as it has been elsewhere.</p>

<p>As against that let me state the Government&#x2019;s attitude. I contend that inevitably in time to come the Government&#x2019;s attitude will convince the outside world, and it will do so because it is based on various sound principles. The first is that no homelands will be brought into being by compulsion; the homelands which are there at the moment in embryonic form&#x2014;I readily admit that&#x2014;will be helped to grow in accordance with the principle of trusteeship. It may be a gradual development or an evolutionary one, but every group of the population is being led, according to the circumstances prevailing in the area, towards ever-increasing prosperity and independence. In other words, the trustee is doing its duty and we can talk with conviction in the outside world about the way in which we as trustees are carrying out our duties, not by using compulsion but by guiding the inhabitants of South West Africa in such a way that every group, however small it may be, will have its own chances and its own opportunities. After all, the basic principles of justice require that we should not allow the development of one imperialistic group but that each group should be able to enjoy its full rights: The Whites, the Ovambos, the Hereros, the Okavangos, the Namas, the Damaras and the Basters.</p>

<p>Then I come to a second point as far as Government policy is concerned. As I have already indicated, the picture painted here by the United Party of a compulsory shifting of population groups is a false one. These homelands will in fact be made available for their own political development. There will be more and more opportunities for them to occupy higher posts in their own homelands; they will have increased economic opportunities and they will have property rights, which is what the outside world demands. They will also have the right of self-determination. These are the demands which are being made by the outside world. The outside world demands emancipation, better opportunities and the right of self-determination; the trustee is expected to look after the nation under its care until it reaches that stage, and eventually there must be no domination of one group by another. Inherently the solution that we put forward satisfies all those demands which have been formulated in the council chambers of the world.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is the question of economic viability. That is not a prerequisite for political independence. It was not a prerequisite in any other part of Africa. In fact, it is said on the platforms of the world that countries prefer standing on their own feet, in spite of finding things difficult, to seeking economic independence in the first place, and we have also seen that happening. Most of the new <span class="col_5641-5642" refersTo="page_154"/>states of Africa live on what is given to them by the world states, and not on what they produce themselves. Therefore this Government acts according to the principle of regarding the development to political independence as being of paramount importance, but at the same time assisting them, as their guardian, to achieve economic independence and progress. We do in fact assure their viability, but that is not made a prerequisite for political independence. That is also in accordance with world demands.</p>

<p>Further, we have adopted the standpoint that there must be economic co-operation, but in addition we make provision in our policy for the possibility of political co-operation. However, we do not seek this by means of a federation in which there will be a dominant group and in which a majority group will rule a minority group. Our principle is that in the highest body there should be consultative body, that for political co-operation with one another there must be consultation in regard to common interests on an equal footing, as in a commonwealth. Therefore there is inherent in our policy the principle of developing the possibility for economic co-operation and the possibility for political co-operation, in accordance with what is being attempted in present-day Europe. After having said all this, it must be clear that this is not an inflexible policy. In fact, it is a policy which indicates a direction and formulates certain basic principles which allow much scope for movement. Therefore it is my standpoint that the positive features of the Government&#x2019;s policy are such that if the outside world can be prevailed upon to realize it&#x2014;and I do not despair of that at all&#x2014;they will be able to support it. Then we will have a chance of securing the racial peace which cannot be secured under the policy of domination of the United Party.</p>

<p>I therefore lay it down as a principle that we envisage the eventual right of self-determination for each of the smaller and larger racial groups in South West Africa. Secondly, we offer protection for every group in their development towards the highest functions within each group, including self-administration in all spheres. The report proves this very clearly, and the education envisaged is directed towards that object. Thirdly, and this ought to console the hon. member for Houghton, the limitations imposed on the freedoms of people (as we find practically over the whole world where anybody lives in the territory of somebody else) fall away as soon as everybody can enjoy his own freedom in his own territory. Even the type of rules which one applies to protect oneself in one&#x2019;s own territory, to which she objects, will then be seen in a more realistic and constructive light. Human rights will have more opportunity to develop to the full in terms of our policy when separation takes place and the nations exist alongside each other, than in terms of the United Party policy, according to which attempts will be made to maintain the position of the Whites for as long as possible in a mixed community, as they want to try to do. Therefore, in respect of human rights, we comply with international demands as well. In other words, the international criticism will still be there, but we will have adopted a clear standpoint based on principle. There is the possibility of convincing everybody who wants to think reasonably, except the communists or those who want to make the whole of Africa Black-dominated, that we are following a course which provides justice for everybody in the international sense.</p>

<p>Having said this, I want to make one admission. It is that although I do not believe that the United Party can succeed in convincing the outside world by means of its policy, there will be certain nations which may be prepared to accept the United Party and its policy because they think that, by using the United Party, they will be able to destroy both its policy and ours. In other words, I am not only saying that the policy of the United Party will not pass the international test, but I admit that there are some nations which will use the United Party and its policy to destroy South Africa and also South West as well as White domination.</p>

<p>Now I want to apply the test of the effect the policies of the two parties will have in this country. I first want to come back to the fact that the hon. member for Bezuidenhout said that the guarantee for White domination lies in the 50-50 ratio in the southern area. Remember that he included the Basters and the Coloureds with the Whites in order to get that 50-50 ratio, in the same way that he wants to add the Coloureds in South Africa to the Whites. Basically, therefore, the whole guarantee which he wants to give South West is that 50-50 ratio, calculated in that way. Then there must still be manipulation, viz. a form of constitution which will give the Whites the major say in a mixed assembly, because in the southern legislative assembly he gives representation to every racial group through their own members. Now the Whites must see to it that they are in the majority. How large this majority must be is not relevant now, but it will have to be reasonably large in order to maintain the position of the Whites. In addition, we will then have the Federation with the Black North. In that Federal Parliament the United Party must once again give a guarantee to the Whites. How can it do so? What guarantee is envisaged for the White people of South West in that Federal Parliament? But now I go a step further. He wants to federate that federation with the Federation of South Africa. In regard to the Federation of South Africa, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout quoted with approval Sir John Maud, who is alleged to have said that it would be a good thing to have a federation of South Africa, South West and the three Protectorates. That Federation of South Africa, seen in this light, is therefore already a mixed federation, and I already have doubts in regard to the authority which the Whites can exert in it. But now he wants to <span class="col_5643-5644" refersTo="page_155"/>federate that federation with the other federation in which he can also only keep the White man in control by manipulation. We are now to believe that in all this there are guarantees for the Whites both in the Republic and South West Africa! On the other hand, what guarantee is there in such a policy for the non-Whites of South West, because we are approaching the matter to-day from the point of view of everybody in South West Africa? Does it not mean that in that dominant federation, the Federation of South West Africa and South Africa, which in the final result will be controlled by the Black majority of both countries, the Ovambos, the Hereros, the small number of Basters, the Namas and the Damaras will all be oppressed? Surely this great Federation will be controlled by a clique holding the power, or by a democratic majority Government of Blacks, but the millions in the Republic will dominate the few hundred thousand non-Whites of South West also. What happens then to the principle of guardianship and the satisfaction of those people? There is no guarantee in the United Party plan for the Whites of South Africa or South West, nor is there any guarantee for the non-Whites of South West. They are doomed perpetually to be minority groups, some of them so small that they will have to disappear. Where is the protection in that policy now in terms of the mandate? No, I think I must recommend that the United Party take stock, and then they must admit that they are harbouring in their midst a liberal outlook, which implies one man, one vote, which goes as far as the Liberal Party desires, further even than the Progressive Party desires. Only the Liberal Party accepts Black domination in this way. If the Opposition, when they applauded the hon. member for Bezuidenhout, did not realize this, they must now ask themselves anew what will become of them if this idea is carried to its logical consequences. As against that I say that as far as the Government is concerned it passes the test of what is sound internal policy. All it envisages is a future for each group on its own, a future to which each group is entitled. In other words, the Whites, also the Whites of South West Africa will retain their authority, and each one of the groups, small or large, will have their own opportunities and their own authority. The policy of the Government, complies, therefore, with the requirements for the continued existence, and the right to exist, of each group, and does not mean the destruction of any Black group and not the destruction of the White group. This contrast also reveals the big difference between the United Party and the Government.</p>

<p>In conclusion: I have been asked that we should not vote on this motion because if we did the world would learn of our differences. While that request was made on behalf of the United Party I must say that I reject it completely. What else has this debate already done than precisely to reveal those differences? I should like the world to know what the differences are. Those differences only exist between the parties in Parliament. I also want the world to know that the White people of South Africa, and I believe most of the non-White people of South Africa, also those of South West Africa, will support the Government in this matter as I have set it out. The differences which have been revealed here are parliamentary differences and not national differences. In addition I want to ask this: If we refrain from voting on this motion will that hide the differences after the United Party have gone out of their way to emphasize those differences as sharply as I have proved by way of summing up.</p>

<p>What can be the result if we do not vote on this motion? The only result will be doubt as to whether we are going to carry out the positive suggestions. In other words, in that case there may be uncertainty amongst the Bantu and there may be uncertainty amongst the public of both states, and there may be uncertainty in the world outside as to whether we are prepared to continue with the big upliftment schemes, educational schemes and health schemes in South West Africa. I want to remove every vestige of doubt as to our determination to continue with the economic development and that is why I am asking this House for its confirmation of that. But apart from that, just think of this problem! If we do not vote there can be doubt as to whether we are prepared to adhere to our decision not to take any steps in regard to certain matters. In other words, what members of the Opposition said gave them much relief, namely, that there cannot be any doubt in the mind of the Court or in the minds of other litigants that it is not our intention to take any steps in regard to certain matters pending the decision of the Court, can also be doubted. Surely the acceptance of the motion before the House confirms the acceptance by the House of Assembly that we shall not take any steps in certain matters. There must not be shadow of doubt as to that. I cannot, therefore, help the United Party out of the stupid attitude they have adopted in this debate. By voting against the motion as the Leader of the Opposition has announced they will, the United Party will reveal itself as the Party which is not prepared to perform this large-scale economic and social upliftment work in South West Africa as our ward. Surely that is all the memorandum contains. The excuse that, because they do not approve of the broad direction we are following, the United Party is also forced to refuse to support these positive plans, is simply not good enough, because by saying what it has said&#x2014;and it did say it&#x2014;it can explain that it does not approve of the direction but is only voting for everything that is concrete in this motion, namely, the Kunene scheme, the provision of transport facilities, the acquisition of farms, educational and health measures etc. It refuses to vote for those. I cannot save it. Let South Africa and South West Africa and the world outside take cognizance of the stupidity of the Opposition.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>May I avail myself of the half-hour rule? Sir, the successful functioning of any Department will depend in great measure on the efficiency of its staff and the numbers of its staff. Looking through the Estimates for this year I am quite perturbed to see that there has been a gradual drop in the numbers of the staff in the various branches of the Department of Social Welfare. I find that in eight of the 13 sub-divisions of this Vote there is a shortage of personnel. In some cases there is a fairly big shortage and in other cases it is small. I think it is very important, bearing in mind the growing services which have to be provided by the Department, that these shortages should be eliminated. It is all very well for us on this side of the House to criticize these shortages, and we do bear in mind the fact that there is a shortage of staff throughout the Public Service, but with the growth of our population this Department particularly must go out of its way to recruit more people for the Department of Social Welfare.</p>

<p>Sir, social welfare is fortunate in the sense that the Department&#x2019;s workers can be supplemented and are being supplemented by voluntary workers. In no other branch of our Public Service do we have as many voluntary workers assisting the Government to perform this work as in the Department of Social Welfare. There are so many voluntary workers in so many of our towns and cities that it has almost become the function of the voluntary worker to take over these services with a subsidy from the Government, instead of the Government having full control and being helped by the voluntary workers. The work done by these voluntary organizations is very important and there is no time like the present for us to express our apreciation of the work done by them. The Minister has in past years told us what splendid work they do and we have always fully agreed with him. But these voluntary organizations cannot go on like this. I and other members on this side of the House will put forward ideas later on as to how we can supplement the staff that we have at the moment.</p>

<p>In the first place I feel that better use ought to be made of students who are studying sociology and medicine at our universities. In sociology and in medicine particularly I think the time has come for these students to do practical work in social welfare, and if they are going to do practical work, full use must be made of the material that we have available. If the hon. the Minister feels that he is short of field workers then he must try to get the universities interested in providing field workers from the ranks of students. Actually in the universities there are groups of people who band themselves together to do social welfare work. Here in Cape Town, in Shawco and in Cafda, you always find groups of university <span class="col_5647-5648" refersTo="page_157"/>students behind these organizations, always willing to help, and the same applies to other university towns. But this work must not be done on a haphazard basis, without control. Let me make myself perfectly clear: What I mean is that social welfare work should form part of the curriculum of university students. In the same way as a medical student goes into the wards in the hospitals and learns clinical work, so I feel that male and female students should be given the opportunity to do practical work, under supervision, for the Department of Social Welfare. It would do medical students a power of good if this was brought about because too many doctors who later work for the Department have never had the opportunity of doing this type of social welfare work. If the recruits for the Department were taken from the ranks of general practitioners who go from house to house in their ordinary daily work, then obviously you will get people with experience, but the hon. the Minister will agree with me that in the main the recruits come from the younger doctors or the younger social welfare workers who have not had an opportunity of doing practical work. I say therefore that we must go out of our way to find ways and means of attracting more people to the service. We cannot go on depending on the voluntary organization to provide these services for the Minister&#x2019;s Department. What these voluntary organizations are doing at present is absolutely remarkable. They do their work with great zeal and they are very anxious to expand their services, but in the course of a tour which I made recently in the Republic I found that there was not a single voluntary organization which had enough money to do its work properly. I found that they were not doing anything on a lavish scale; that they were providing the bare minimum, essential services. I found that none of the houses which they were using as their headquarters were elaborate structures, and in every case I found that apart from the supervisor they did not have a single full-time person in their employ. What happens is that voluntary workers come in to assist in the morning or in the afternoon; the ambulance services are provided on a voluntary basis to take cripple persons from the homes in which they are being looked after to their own homes. It is true that the Government pays these voluntary organizations a subsidy. Sir, we are a wealthy country and I feel that there should no longer be such a thing as street collections to raise money for these social welfare services. Why should a voluntary worker who has undertaken to do a particular type of work for a particular group of unfortunate people, still have to go to the public, cap in hand, asking for alms? Sir, those things should not happen in our country. We who boast of so much wealth, sit here in this House and listen to the Minister of Finance announce that he is going to give R750,000 to the aged out of a tremendous surplus! Sir, that money is gratefully accepted but it is not recurrent expenditure. This is merely a crumb for the aged from the rich man&#x2019;s table for this particular year. Sir, this is not nearly enough.</p>

<p>Sir, the Minister is trying to do his job properly but I feel that his hands are tied. He is not given enough money to do his work properly. I can imagine him at Cabinet meetings pleading, like the street collectors, for more money for these worthy causes. But I am going to suggest to him that he should be prepared not only to do this work but to investigate the possibility of linking up the medical services with social welfare services. If we could do that then perhaps we could get more people interested in social welfare. At the same time the various branches of social welfare, which are so intimately connected with health services, can then be linked up with health services. Sir, I said here a month or two ago that there was scarcely a single branch of the social welfare services that was not intimately linked up with health services. Take the cripples, the blind, the lame, the alcoholics, the cerebral palsied; they are all intimately connected with health services. In fact I cannot think of a single branch of social welfare work that is not intimately connected with health services, and for that reason I think the time has come when we should take away the health portfolio from the present Minister of Health and to hand it over to somebody else, somebody who is able to see that the type of work which the present Minister is doing is done properly. It is a little bit beyond him and it should be handed over to somebody more competent.</p>

<p>Sir, we find that in the welfare and probation section of the Minister&#x2019;s Department, the number of workers has fallen from 446 to 421. There are 25 fewer people working in that Department. I do not know whether the Minister has ever grumbled about this shortage of personnel. I can see no hope of his improving the position unless he is prepared, in addition to what I have suggested, to increase the salaries of these specialists doing this type of work. You cannot just take people from factories and from offices and ask them to do this sort of work. Each one of these people working for the Department of Social Services is a specialist in his own sphere and he should be paid accordingly. The Minister cannot simply take anybody for this type of work. Not enough graduates with a B.Sc. in sociology or social welfare work are coming forward, and when these people do qualify at universities they are offered such attractive salaries outside the Public Service that they naturally accept those posts. I say to the Minister, <span class="col_5649-5650" refersTo="page_158"/>therefore, that the salary scales must be reviewed again.</p>

<p>I want to pass on from this departmental difficulty that the Minister has to one or two other matters. I think more should be done to follow up the person who has been discharged from hospital. Very often a victim of a motorcar or road accident of some kind has to have medical attention after his discharge from hospital. Social welfare tries its best in many cases to follow up these cases but it is becoming more and more difficult to find voluntary workers who are prepared to look after these convalescents once they have been discharged from hospital. They are not sick in the sense that they still need medical treatment but they they do need welfare treatment. There is very often a shortage of food in the house of such a victim of a road accident. In many cases the wife has to go out to work to take the husband&#x2019;s place as breadwinner while he is convalescent. If the wife is knocked down, the husband can only continue to work if he can bring somebody into the home to look after the children. These children could, if proper arrangements could be made, be taken to a creche and looked after there, but then we come up against the transport difficulties, and it is here again that the voluntary social welfare worker comes along with an ambulance and takes the child from his home to the creche. I bring this point to the Minister&#x2019;s attention because I feel that more should be done by the State to help people who find themselves in this unfortunate position. I read in the <i>Argus</i> just a day or two ago a statement made by the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of Cape Town to the effect that he was absolutely shocked at the number of car-crash cripples needing attention. Sir, it is this sort of thing that is going to put an ever-increasing strain on the Minister&#x2019;s Department, because these cripples, in many cases, have to receive rehabilitation treatment, and during that period their homes are neglected. The Minister should undertake a full investigation to see what can be done to help these people to overcome their difficulties.</p>

<p>Sir, it was my intention to talk for a short while about the difficulties of the pensioner, but we have decided on this side of the House that we will rather raise this matter in another part of to-day&#x2019;s debate. There we will go into the question of pensions and of difficulties experienced by pensioners a little more carefully and in a little more detail. We want to discuss with the Minister the question of the means test. All of us on this side of the House, and I am sure hon. members opposite who are interested in this matter, will go out of their way to see whether we cannot do something to relieve the present stringent measures of the means test. Something has to be done. I shall not deal with that in further detail. One of the other members on this side will do so. But I can say that we are not at all satisfied, and the people outside this House are not satisfied, that the means test, as it exists to-day, is a fair measure. It has to be reviewed and altered. It is far too drastic and we must alter it drastically so that those people who are at present excluded from deriving the benefit of a pension, a benefit they should be getting, can come in and enjoy that little in their old age.</p>

<p>I said some time during this Session that those people who previously received a bonus plus the old-age pension were still in the same position as they were before, all old-age pensions were brought into line. To-day they are all on the same level. But I am sure the Minister will find that those people who were getting the bonus are in almost the same position as they were previously. They cannot come out on their pension; they have no other source of income. They are absolutely helpless. They depend entirely upon the amount of money that comes from the Minister and they have to use that for clothes, accommodation, food, etc. I suggested to the Minister that he should investigate the possibility of issuing food vouchers to those people on the days they get their pension, so that the money they spend on food to-day could be used for buying an essential article of clothing or something like that. It will enable them to buy a little more than the bare necessities. Mr. Chairman, when a person gets old, bread and tea and a little milk are not enough for him to live on. We all know that it happens, and they have to live on that. If they were issued with a food voucher they would be able to buy a little more, such as a little fruit. That is not asking a great deal but it becomes a treat to these people. The fruit we get in our own dining room, the fruit we regard as an everyday occurrence, becomes a banquet to them. It is simply out of the ordinary for them to have a plate with a pear and an apple and a bunch of grapes on it. That is something which only happens when they have a function or when they are taken on a day&#x2019;s outing. I say, Sir, if they could get a little treat like that it would do them the world of good. It is not asking much. How much would it cost? I want to ask that these people be given a food voucher for R2 every month. It is not going to amount to a large sum of money. And in this country I should not have to ask for this in Parliament. It should come voluntarily. It should not have to be brought to the notice of the Minister. Just think of the food that has gone to waste over the past few years, Sir, because there are not sufficient ways and means of preserving it. When I think of that I do not think we deserve the good things that have come to us because we have wasted too much. That wastage must stop, Sir. We have had a warning in the Northern Transvaal. We must take heed of that warning. We must learn from that lesson. Not a single piece of food, whether it be liquid or solid, must be wasted. Milk must not be thrown down drains. It must be converted into dried milk and preserved. Fruit must be canned; meat and fish must be frozen. Whatever we have in plenty has got to be preserved and given to those unfortunate people who have not the money to buy it. It <span class="col_5651-5652" refersTo="page_159"/>matters not whether they are White or non-White. They are entitled to get it when the time comes. I feel the pensioner&#x2019;s time has now come for him to receive something of this sort.</p>

<p>My time is running short and I promised not to go on too long with this matter. There are other matters in regard to which the hon. the Minister must start taking a hand in developing. I have mentioned the question of perhaps taking over the Department of Health. I go further: I think the Department of Housing should fall under the Minister of Social Welfare. How does housing fit in under the Minister of Coloured Affairs? Why should the Minister of Coloured Affairs have control over housing? He has enough on his fork as it is. He deals with Coloured education and all their affairs. Because the Coloured people need housing why should he be in charge of all housing? For that matter, the Bantu people need housing. Why is the Minister of Bantu Administration in charge of housing? I say housing is of such great importance to-day especially, the provision of housing for the aged and for those people who are coming into the country, people who are not yet settled and still need some social welfare help, that it is the duty of the Cabinet to see that the Minister of Social Welfare has that particular branch under his wing. Instead of there being an empire for the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, instead of there being an empire for the Minister of Coloured Affairs, I think Social Welfare, Pensions and Housing should fall under the Minister of Social Welfare.</p>

<p>I do not want an empire but I want an efficient Department so that there will not be any overlapping and so that we can overcome the difficulties which arise because of this separation. Why the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs is in charge of Health I do not know. Those are two totally different things, whereas Health and Social Welfare fit together. There will probably be a great deal to do; he will probably have to have an Under-Minister to help him. But I would much rather see that than what is happening at the moment. When we deal with the Minister of Health we shall again raise these shortcomings.</p>

<p>Finally I want to say to the hon. the Minister that we on this side of the House appreciate what has been done in the past year. We know his hands have been tied because he did not have enough money to give what he wanted to give. We want to pay tribute to his staff who have shown that they are efficient social welfare workers. They are not just officials but they are social welfare workers. Those of us who have had dealings with them must say that never on any occasions did they not go out of their way to please us. If there is a Department which deserves praise in this Government of ours it is the Department of Social Welfare. Not one of us on this side is not thoroughly pleased with the work that Department has done. It is a pleasure for me, Sir, to say to the Minister that we value the help those people have given us on this side of the House whenever possible. [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Having listened to what the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) said a moment ago I think we can associate ourselves with his concluding remarks and express our gratitude and sincere appreciation for the services this important Department renders to the State and to the community. In saying that we include the Minister and his staff, as well as those who render the field services. Those valuable services they render are well organized and we appreciate it greatly. The hon. member for Rosettenville said many things with which we cannot agree with him 100 per cent. He emphasized the fact that there was a shortage of necessary staff. He must realize that this is a Department which performs extremely specialized work. We do know there is a shortage of trained social workers. But that is not only the position in this field, but in all fields. That is also the position in the field that hon. member represents, namely, the medical field. There is a shortage in every field to-day. The development is so great that the universities cannot remain ahead in providing in the needs. But where he refers to the way in which the people are being trained I can tell him he is wrong if he thinks the universities do not provide the necessary facilities for the practical training of social workers. As a matter of fact, it is an integral part of their training that they should do practical work. All of us who are connected with welfare organizations know how those young students are placed in the care of specific organizations during their holidays so as to get practical training. Those organizations then have to submit a proper report to the university concerned. They have to state in that report how the student acted under certain circumstances, and so forth. As much as one would like to see medical students getting more of this training under their course it is naturally, from the nature of things, not possible for this Minister and his Department to dictate to them. That is a task that hon. member, who knows the medical profession, can perform. He would be making a great contribution to our social welfare services if he could persuade the medical schools to arrange their courses in such a way that more students could be active in this particular field. The community will certainly benefit by that.</p>

<p>The hon. member expressed his disappointment that voluntary social welfare organizations were so poorly housed and that they were handicapped in so many ways. I want to say this to the hon. member: I do not know which particular welfare organizations he has in mind. There are already between 2,000 and 3,000 registered voluntary welfare <span class="col_5653-5654" refersTo="page_160"/>organizations. But the main national welfare organizations, the National Council for Mental Health, the National Welfare Council, the National Council for Child Welfare and all those big councils say exactly the opposite to what the hon. member says. Only recently I read what the National Council for Mental Health said in their report, how they paid tribute to the Government for the funds that were made available to them, how they were finding it easier to make ends meet. We find therefore that the opposite is really true. They express their appreciation for what the Government is doing and for the funds which are made available to the welfare organizations to do the work.</p>

<p>I expected the hon. member to return to the question of pensions. This is the third occasion this year that we have discussed the question of pensions in this House. If we go into the record of this Government over the past 14 years there is hardly a year in which improvements have not been effected to pensions. That was done practically every year. At the same time attempts were made to relax the means test to an increasing extent. As far as pension concessions are concerned we can say this: When we consider what the pensioner gets to-day, and we consider the value of money and we consider what he got before this Government came into power and what the cost of living index figure was in those days, we can only say that the increased pensions, with due regard to the cost of living index figure, have meant that every pensioner is in a much better position to-day than he was under the Government of those days.</p>

<p>We realize that. The hon. member for Rosettenville suggests that a food voucher for R2 should be issued monthly to each pensioner. But that is not such a small item as he suggests. There are 138,000 pensioners. To make a further R2 available to them every month will mean over R3,000,000. That is why we say it is not such a small item. I am sure the Government would like to do very much more. We can suggest various ways in which improvements can be brought about. I want to mention one which I think is already enjoying the attention of the hon. the Minister. There is, for example, the question of the houses which some pensioners own. Say, for instance, a person bought a house ten years ago and paid R1,400 for it. With the appreciation of property values the value of that house may have doubled or trebled to-day although the house has actually deteriorated. We know that places the pensioner in a difficult position. But I know this Minister is considering that, because of the sympathetic way in which he attends to matters, and in view of the fact that he has already introduced a more simplified form of calculating pensions.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I should like to emphasize and it is this. To-day all those institutions which have anything to do with family life deplore the way family life has deteriorated. We had the family year. During the past week, for example, an important Church body expressed its concern. We also know that that is the one subject the hon. the Minister never gets tired of discussing in this House. We know that important legislation will be introduced next year in connection with voluntary welfare organizations and the Minister has indicated that in constituting the new National Welfare Council emphasis will be placed on family care. When we think of the increasing number of children who are committed and we think of the increasing number of divorces we realize that we are dealing with an outgrowth of society which can be fatal to the community. That is why we shall appreciate it if the Minister and his Department would continue to place the emphasis on family care. A great deal can be said about what the Department has already done over the past years, how it has devoted its attention to this matter, how it has tried, by means of proclaiming welfare organizations, to undertake the care of family life and how it has tried to promote family life in this country. We want to ask the Minister and his Department to place the emphasis to an increasing extent on that because, to the extent to which we have sound family life, to that extent do we keep the cells of the nation healthy and can we expect to have a sound nation. We appreciate what the Department has done and what it has already achieved in relieving distress and in caring for the poor. Finally I once again wish to express our gratitude for these special allowances which will be paid to all the pensioners this year, whereas they were only paid to the poorest of the poor last year and whereas many welfare organizations, many aged people and many of the old people&#x2019;s homes were embarrassed because those old people could not understand why, as they saw it, a distinction should be made between the one pensioner and the other.

<p>I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the plight of the retarded children in South Africa and the problems that beset those who have undertaken, voluntarily, to care for them. Perhaps it is a commentary on our approach to social welfare generally, certainly to the problem of the retarded child, that in our budget there is such a tremendous disparity between what is provided for the care of children generally and for the other, shall I say, less civilized needs of a civilized community. And this is the position at a time of great expansion in our economy&#x2014;I am not going to refer to the unexpected windfall about which the Minister of Finance told us a few days ago&#x2014;at a time when this country has a thriving economy, when we are assured every day that this is the most dynamic and most progressive economy in the world. It is a sad commentary that, whereas we are expanding tremendously many of our present services, we are doing <span class="col_5655-5656" refersTo="page_161"/>nothing of the sort when it comes to the care of children. Those who have any regard for the welfare, moral as well as material, of the community will be struck by the fact that in the Estimates of Expenditure from Loan Account for the year ending 31 March 1965 six and a half pages of these Estimates are taken up by the needs of the prisons and the Prisons Department, and only half a page by the needs of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions! This is merely one comparison.</p>

<p>Looking at the &#x201C;Revised Estimate of Total Cost&#x201D; in each case, you will find that the revised estimates of total costs, as far as prisons are concerned, is R13,358,620 whereas the revised estimate of total costs for social welfare and pensions is R789,250&#x2014;approximately l/20th of what is contemplated in regard to our Prisons Department. Quite apart from the detail&#x2014;his Department certainly has more detail than any other&#x2014;I have used this illustration merely to show the hon. Minister how faulty our approach is to this question of social welfare, under which I wish to discuss the welfare of the retarded child. To-day, apparently, we think of the needs of prisons as being 20 times greater than the needs, financially, of the children who need the help of the Government. I do not blame this Minister, Sir; it is a question of policy. But perhaps he could use this very argument to which I have drawn his attention in order to make sure that this imbalance between the Loan Account spending on prisons and the spending on our children is corrected in the near future instead of the annual assurance we have from this very kindly Minister that he is doing his best. He should use every lever, within the Cabinet and without, to make sure that this imbalance is corrected.</p>

<p>Dealing with the retarded child, we know that the Government, through the Department of Social Welfare, does provide some assistance. Provision is made under Vote 19 for R75,000 for non-State places of safety and detention, with which I am not particularly concerned here, and for an amount of R1,210,000 for children&#x2019;s homes. The question is whether we are in fact doing enough to help those people who have taken it upon themselves&#x2014;in most cases as a duty&#x2014;to look after the retarded children. Are we doing the right thing by them not only in regard to the quantum of money, but in regard to the way this money is spent? I think I should say to the hon. the Minister that many people who are interested in this matter and who speak with some authority&#x2014;even if the Minister doubts my authority&#x2014;believe that because no provision is made for the mentally retarded child below the 60 per cent I.Q., except in such mental institutions as Alexandria, Wit-rand and Waterfall at Howick &#x2026;</p>

<p>I can leave out the word &#x201C;retarded&#x201D;, if necessary. In so far as children&#x2019;s homes are concerned, Sir, there are children who have a special problem. It is a question of a certain lack of intelligence which becomes, in turn, the problem of those who care for them. I wish to make this point&#x2014;that in these particular institutions or homes, if it is a State-supported institution, the teacher must have attained a certain educational standard, to begin with. That creates a very real obstacle, because it does not follow that the teacher who has acquired the necessary educational standard has the right psychological outlook to be of the maximum assistance in that particular post. Then you also have the fact the good and suitable teacher can, in terms of the Public Service rules, be moved about, thereby doing great damage not only to the institution but to the child who has been cared for by that particular teacher. Furthermore, I want to draw the attention of the Minister to the fact that these places suffer from a lack of boarding facilities, which is a very serious matter as far as the children are concerned, and their parents. Other people have approached this question in this way&#x2014;and I for one support the view&#x2014;that greater stress should be laid on the continuity of teaching, because these children require attention and help not only during the normal school hours but day and night. I think the hon. the Minister knows that better than I do. This, therefore, makes it imperative&#x2014;not only desirable, but imperative&#x2014;that these children should be looked after in smaller units, almost in family units, of six to seven.</p>

<p>Sir, since you have entered the Chamber I have not said a word about retarded children. The hon.

One might say it is the work of a dedicated person rather than of the professional educationist or the professional child welfare specialist. This becomes very important if a certain separation can be achieved in these homes in terms of age groups. There is, for example, a special problem in regard to children of the ages from six to 12.</p>

Six to 12 years, that is the pre-puberty age, is a very different category from, say, the puberty age of 12 to 18 years, and then again those two categories differ very widely, in terms of the needs of the children within those groups, and the age group 18 to 21 or 23.

<p>I wish to associate myself with the tributes paid and congratulations extended to the Department by both sides of the House. I think the fortunate thing about this Department is that this matter has the sympathy of the Minister and the Secretary down to the whole machinery dealing with it. The matter I really wish to raise, and which I think does not perhaps receive sufficient attention in this Committee and in the country, is that we are inclined to pay tribute to a Department when we can measure its work in terms of rand and cents. I wish to emphasize, however, that this Department does work that you cannot measure in terms of rand and cents, work of which the country as such cannot in consequence get a true and complete picture. I wish to emphasize the work the Department does to save family life, particularly where it uses church welfare workers throughout the country. Last year I had the privilege of studying the annual report of what had been done in my own constituency, and I was pleasantly surprised when I read about the large number of families which were more or less broken up, but which were saved because of the tactful and considerate approach on the part of the welfare workers, both male and female. Many of those broken families were again brought together as families. I take it that what happens in my constituency happens throughout the whole of South Africa. That is why I cannot pay enough tribute to the work done by that section of the Department which co-operates with the Church as far as this type of work is concerned. They are doing a tremendously big job. When we continually say the welfare of society depends on the standard of family life, I think the work that Department does is of great significance and that we should give it all the credit it deserves. That is why I shall be pleased if, when practical suggestions are made in future, suggestions which are always well intended, we pay attention to them and if the Minister as well as the Secretary would pay attention to them. I do not wish to cast any reflection on anybody who controlled the Department in the past, but we shall undoubtedly produce very good results with the new machinery which has now been set in motion, nor do I think it can be greatly improved upon. Because that machinery operates so smoothly and because it complies with the high demands made on us by social welfare to-day, I again want to emphasize that we should not take rand and cents into account, but that we should place the emphasis on restoring family life. I wish to pay tribute to the Department and the church institutions which function under the Department. I hope the Secretary and the Minister will pay attention in particular to those well-intended suggestions, practical suggestions, given from time to time. I also wish to associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. member for Kimberley (South) (Dr. W. L. D. M. Venter) when he expressed the hope that those people who were academically and professionally probably as well trained as one could wish for, would get the necessary encouragement. I know it is the policy of the Department to encourage them and I know the Department has the best and the best-trained people in its service. I wish the Department everything of the best.</p>

<p>Yes, but the hon. member first spoke about a staff shortage and then he mentioned the question of the practical training of doctors, two matters which have no connection with one another at all. But I do think that all of us accept the fact that there is a shortage of staff. There is a certain pattern to be noticed as far as this Vote is concerned, and I think that we should devote some attention to it. I note that there has been an increase in the amount of the Vote, as of course has been the case as far as all Votes are concerned. In this case there is an increase of more than R3,000,000 as far as the total amount of the Vote is concerned. But there has been a decrease as far as subhead K, &#x201C;War Veterans&#x2019;, Old Age and Blind Persons&#x2019; Pensions and Disability Grants&#x201D;, is concerned. There is a decrease of R225,000 under that sub-head. As far as sub-head O is concerned, &#x201C;Aid to Indigent Persons and Related Subsidized Services&#x201D;, there is also a decrease from R224,000 to R179,000, while under sub-head P, &#x201C;Care of the Aged and Infirm&#x201D;, the amount has decreased from R841,000 to R781,000. We may ask, then, what is responsible for the general increase in the total amount of the Vote, and we find this in sub-head J, &#x201C;Contributions to Pension and Provident Funds&#x201D;, under which there is an increase <span class="col_5659-5660" refersTo="page_163"/>from R15,000,000 to R19,000,000. This is responsible for the fact that the total amount of the Vote has been increased by R3,000,000. This to my mind is not a good omen, particularly as I notice that there has been a decrease in the amount to be voted for old-age pensions and so forth, and I should like the hon. the Minister to give us an explanation in this regard. In spite of what hon. members opposite tell us, even the hon. member for Kimberley (South) had eventually to say something about the means test. He said that he was sure that the hon. the Minister was interested in this matter and that he would do something about it at some stage. We on this side of the House know of course that the hon. the Minister is sympathetically inclined in this regard and that he has the welfare of these people at heart. I think that he will agree with us that the time has come for something to be done in connection with the question of the means test. I think that in a previous debate the hon. the Minister mentioned the fact that he went overseas on a study tour in order to ascertain how old people were treated in other countries and how welfare services in other countries were administered. I should like to know whether the hon. the Minister is going to give us a report on his tour, whether he will report to us on his findings on that tour.</p>

<p>I shall be pleased if the hon. the Minister will give us his impression of what is being done there.</p>

<p>There are a number of matters that I want to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. One of them is that most of our old people, or at least a large number of them, live out their days in old-age homes. These homes have been set up by welfare organizations through the medium of loans which they have received from certain Departments. Those old people are well looked after. There is one matter that I want to mention in this connection and that is that most of them have no transport facilities. No motor-car or other means of transport is available to an old-age home of this nature. If an inmate of an old-age home falls ill, he has first to obtain a note from the magistrate before he can be given free medical attention. Once he has this note, the district medical officer will give him medical attention free of charge. How on earth is that old person who is ill in bed to visit the magistrate? I think that the hon. the Minister should arrange with the hon. the Minister of Health that the district medical officer can be called in without the necessity for a note from the magistrate. As things are now, that old person himself has to apply for that note; he has to go down to the magistrate&#x2019;s office and ask the magistrate for that note personally.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>I would like to refer briefly to a matter to which the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) referred, namely, the appreciation of the work of the staff of the Department, and to perhaps just pause for one moment and associate this side of the House, and I am sure members on the other side will do similarly, with the reference made to the passing of some well-known personages who at one time played their part very effectively and well in the building up of this Department. I refer to the names mentioned on page 6 of the report for the years 1959-62 and I think we should place on record our appreciation of the services rendered by men like Dr. van Sehalkwyk, Mr. de Ridder and Mr. van Heerden.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it is interesting to note that in the same report of the Department on page 21, dealing with homes for the aged, a certain policy is outlined to the effect that whilst the Department of Housing will continue to provide the capital loans that are necessary for the building of aged homes, future loans will only be granted in cases recommended by the Department. I think well might it be so because the demand for homes for the aged continues to grow apace. In recent years we have had a lot of reconstruction going on in some of the principal cities in our country, and the aged are the persons who have suffered most because they have been evacuated from homes which some of them have occupied for many years at very low rentals and they have been forced, unfortunately, to find other forms of accommodation. On the pension, which at the moment is only R27, it is of course impossible to obtain reasonable accommodation if an aged person is to live on his own and at the same time be able to have sufficient to provide his means of livelihood. So the urgency and the demand for homes for the aged continues to grow. In addition to that, we have the further problem that the number of the aged continues to grow. As a result of better medical care and better medical attention the longevity of our people is increasing and as a result the number of people over the age of 60 continues to grow year by year in appreciable numbers, and our responsibility towards these people continues to increase. Now there is one feature in regard to the building of aged homes to which I would like the Minister to particularly pay attention, and that is the necessity of providing some form of non-acute convalescent accommodation coupled with the building of an aged home. We know that there are non-acute hospitals in the country.</p>

<from><span class="col_5661-5662" refersTo="page_164"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to what is done in regard to non-acute hospitals, where a person who is chronically ill, who does not need detailed nursing, but just needs care, is taken in. Most of these places are far removed from the big towns where the preponderance of our aged persons find themselves, and it becomes a very difficult matter for a family to remain in constant contact with them. In one or two of the aged homes which have been built in recent days, provision has been made for what they call a &#x201C;convalescent section&#x201D;, which is virtually a non-acute hospital attached to the aged home, so that when a person enters an aged home, the principle that a person who enters need never leave is established. In other words, if the person were to get infirm owing to his age, if he were to get ill but remain in a chronic sickly condition, there should be beds provided at that aged home where the person can be accommodated and where a certain amount of nursing can be provided. Sir, in our welfare funds we provide for a subsidy of, I think, R10 per person per month towards the cost of this care, but I can tell the hon. the Minister&#x2014;he knows it himself because he is very interested in this work&#x2014;that one or two aged homes have provided 25 per cent beds for that purpose, that is to say if you have a home for 100 persons, you provide approximately 25 beds in what is called a convalescent section, but which virtually is a non-acute hospital. If that is done, it will give a great deal of comfort to the aged, and it will enable these old people to continue to remain in the environment in which they probably spent a fair number of years; they can be visited by their relatives, and they will get a great deal of comfort from the friendships which they have made over a period of time. This is a very important factor, because one of the greatest complaints of the aged in our country, as in any other country, is the complaint of loneliness. How much more is this aggravated when a person has to be taken say, for instance, from the Witwatersrand to Warmbath to a non-acute hospital, which is 100 miles virtually from the Witwatersrand. I do feel that if the hon. the Minister, taking advantage of his now over-all control of the provision of aged homes, would be able to establish a new principle in the building of aged homes, and that is that in addition to having the reasonably able-bodied person who can look after himself accommodated, that person should have the security that as the years go by and his infirmity grows, he can remain at that particular home, remain in his environment and need never have the fear that he or she will have to be removed a far distance away; that would be a blessing to many people.</p>

<p>I know that the hon. Minister of Finance in regard to the additional surplus which he found has allocated R750,000 towards aged homes, but I do believe that that is a meagre sum and virtually a pittance as against the demand that is growing. I think we are going to find considerable difficulties in our modern way of life if we expect aged persons to remain housed with their children. The modern tendency is that children, sad as it is, do try and shed that responsibility and it is a constant fear in the minds, particularly of the pensioners, that they are not certain what is going to happen to them. About four or five years ago we had approximately 90,000 aged pensioners who could become potential occupants of aged homes. At that time we only had aged homes throughout the country for approximately 2,730 persons, so that virtually we had hardly scratched the surface of the problem. I know that the Department has done everything in its power to encourage the establishment of homes for the aged and to provide subsidies for the purpose and also to provide accommodation for them with friends or families. I think, however, that we should look a little further and should be a little more ambitious with regard to the provision of this form of accommodation. I trust that in giving this matter thought the Minister will see whether he cannot bring about a principle whereby he can include, when building a home, provision for these non-acute facilities which will give that security which I think the aged want.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>I briefly want to raise a matter which I know is very close to the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s heart and which is also in the minds of other people who are interested in social welfare matters. This is in connection with the social welfare settlements for physically disabled persons and also for the aged. There are three of these settlements. One is at Ganspan near Kimberley, another is at Karatara between George and Knysna and the third, which has the attractive name of Sonop, is in the Brits constituency which I represent. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that at the beginning of 1962, after an inquiry had been made into these settlements and after certain experience had been gained by the Department and also as a result of practical considerations, it was decided to effect a classification of settlers. Before 1962 we had to deal with the old regime under which all settlers received a certain allowance and were subject to certain regulations; they were all dealt with in virtually the same way. Although those settlers were also to a large extent entitled to old-age pensions or maintenance allowances, or to disability allowances, they forfeited these pensions or allowances as soon as they were accommodated on the settlements and they were paid a settlement allowance, plus a certain allowance for their children. But, as I say, from the beginning of 1962 the hon. the Minister introduced a change in policy at the Ganspan settlement. That settlement was gradually converted into what we call a settler-lessee scheme. This scheme was also applied to Sonop in about the middle of 1962 and later still to Karatara. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that during the Budget debate I made representations on behalf of these people and asked the hon. the <span class="col_5663-5664" refersTo="page_165"/>Minister whether representations could not be made to the Treasury to ensure that settlers who did not receive the increased pension would receive the benefit of the increase which was granted in regard to social pensions. At present I think that a family on one of these settlements receives about R20 per month. The increase in the ordinary social pension was about R2.50 per month and the settlers felt rather dissatisfied because they did not receive this increase. We now have two classes of people on the same settlement&#x2014;the settler-lessees and the ordinary settlers. They feel that they have been discriminated against and there has been a certain amount of dissatisfaction, although they are always very grateful for what the hon. the Minister does for them. We know that the hon. the Minister is intensely interested in those settlers. He has chatted with the people there and we know that he is fully acquainted with the position there. We are very grateful that he introduced a change in policy to enable most of these settlers to become settler-lessees so that they could receive increased pensions. I just want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will be able to tell us whether these people will also be paid the increased pensions.</p>

<p>There is a second matter about which I feel very concerned and about which the settlers themselves are also disturbed. When I visited that settlement recently the settlers themselves and the Advisory Council drew my attention to the fact that a far smaller allowance was being paid in respect of the children of settlers than was the case in respect of those of the settler-lessees. A settler only receives R2 for every child of pre-schoolgoing age while the settler-lessee receives R6 for each such child. For a child attending junior school a settler receives R3 and the settler-lessee R8. If the child is attending high school, the allowance is R5 to the settler and R10 to the settler-lessee. I investigated the matter myself and found&#x2014;I do-not want to mention names&#x2014;that settler A had one child at high school and four children at junior school, for whom he received R17 per month, while settler-lessee B had one child at high school and three children at junior school, for whom he received R34 per month. This is happening on the same settlement where the children play together and attend the same schools. It is this difference in the allowances paid that is regarded by the settlers to be rather unfair. This fact does give rise to some measure of dissatisfaction. I want to mention a second case. Settler C has two children at high school for whom he receives R10 per month while settler-lessee D who also has two children at school receives R20 per month. The families live next to one another; the one family receives R10 and the other R20. The hon. the Minister may say that a distinction has been drawn between a settler and a settler-lessee. That is so and I admit that the change brought about in this regard has been to the good. But one feels that where one has to deal with chronic invalids, as is the case at Sonop, one has to be very careful. We did not know that it would have this effect. One does not want to create bad feelings between these people. [Interjection.] The hon. the Minister says that he has rectified one aspect of the matter and now the other aspect needs rectifying. I think that he should rectify both aspects and then everyone will be happy.</p>

<p>There are people on those settlements who became needy as the result of adverse circumstances and if we want to rehabilitate them we must not draw a distinction between their children. Is it not the thought of these settlements which makes us sympathetically disposed towards these people and which softens our hearts in their regard? Would it not be a most productive capital investment to improve the allowances payable in respect of these children? I am not criticizing the hon. the Minister and what I have to say must not be construed as such. The hon. the Minister has done a very great deal indeed. I do not want the Opposition to laugh at me and to say that I am criticizing the hon. the Minister. Even though we are dealing with a matter like social welfare the Opposition are still trying to make political capital out of it. The hon. the Minister has effected this great improvement but there is still a certain amount of dissatisfaction. I am trying to bring this matter to the attention of the hon. the Minister as sympathetically as I can. I ask him to make those increased pensions payable to those settlers as well and to give his attention to rectifying the great difference that exists between the children&#x2019;s allowances paid to settlers and those paid to settler-lessees. What is wrong with that? If hon. members opposite want to make this a political matter, I can refer them back to the old South African Party regime when the allowance was 12s. per child! But I do not want to do so. I am not talking politics now. [Interjections.] If we were to follow the policy of that party we would not have a Sonop (Sunrise) but a Sunset! Have hon. members of the Opposition no sympathy with these people at all? [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#wood">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WOOD</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to refer to sub-head N, the rehabilitation of alcoholics. I notice that under this sub-head an amount of R33,000 is allowed for in the Estimates, which exceeds by R13,000 the amount in the previous Estimates and is R6,000 more than the year before that. The question I should like to ask the Minister is this: Is this amount just to keep pace with the increasing needs, or is it to provide greater assistance for the organizations which are assisting in this question of alcoholism? In the Minister&#x2019;s second-reading speech on the Retreats and Rehabilitation Bill last year he made four points, and I wish to refer to the third point he made. He said the Bill envisages the certification, approval <span class="col_5665-5666" refersTo="page_166"/>and subsidization of private welfare organizations for the care and treatment of alcoholics in the community, as well as in institutions. Then the Minister went on to say that it appears clearly that alcoholism has assumed such proportions that it should be regarded as a serious national problem. This claim seems to have been substantiated by the liquor trade, because in recent statistics released by the trade the statement is made that the annual consumption of brandy in South Africa is now nearing the 5,000,000 gallon mark, and they still say that South Africans are among the hardest drinkers in the world. So there is need for the establishment of these centres, both State-operated and those run by private individuals, and the need seems to be growing, because the incidence of alcoholism is obviously increasing. If figures can prove anything, I wish to refer briefly to authentic figures concerning the under 17 age group of Whites in South Africa. These figures are rather startling, because in 1955 there were nine prosecutions resulting in seven convictions, and in 1962 there were 33 prosecutions resulting in 31 convictions. In regard to the Coloureds, the number of prosecutions and convictions was higher, but the actual incidence seemed to remain on a more stable basis. There again, taking the under 17 age group for Coloureds, in 1955 there were 101 prosecutions resulting in 96 convictions, and in 1962 there were 112 prosecutions resulting in 95 convictions. When we come to the age group of 17 to 20 years in regard to Whites, we find that in 1955 the prosecutions numbered 352 and these resulted in 334 convictions, but in 1962 there were 551 prosecutions resulting in 526 convictions. In regard to the Coloureds in this age group, the figures seem to show that the incidence was from four to seven times higher than the comparative figure for the Whites. As far as the Bantu are concerned, the figures show that the incidence declined slightly, and as far as the over 21&#x2019;s are concerned the over-all figure for all races shows that in 1962 there was a decline in the number of prosecutions and convictions in terms of the Liquor Act. But the fact still remains that in 1962 there were over 127,000 convictions for liquor offences, and of that number there were more than 67,000 convictions for drunkenness, which is more than half. I feel that I have shown that the incidence of this problem is increasing, but these figures are only part of the picture. They only represent the people who have been involved in breaking the law, but what about the people with no court record, who also contributed to the big thirst that makes South Africa one of the biggest spirit-drinking countries in the world? An overseas authority claims, as far as the consumption of alcohol is concerned, that of 70 alcohol drinkers, nine drink too much and three become alcoholics, and he claims that 10 per cent of social drinkers will become alcoholics. Section 12 of Act 86 of 1963, the Retreats and Rehabilitation Centres Act, gives power to the Minister to make grants out of moneys appropriated by Parliament for the purpose to any association approved by the Minister which has as its objects the prevention or combating of alcoholism and the treatment of alcoholics, and I should like to appeal seriously to the Minister to provide as much assistance as possible to the voluntary organizations which take under their charge the care and rehabilitation of alcoholics. Many of these centres owe much of their success to the fact that the voluntary workers who have been alcoholics themselves are prepared to devote a large part of their time and energy to helping their less fortunate colleagues, and it seems such a shame, as the hon. member for Rosettenville said, that these people should have to use their valuable time, when they render such a valuable service, to stand cap-in-hand asking for money. Their energies should not be diluted in that way, but should be confined solely to treating the people for whom they can do so much good. So I appeal for this assistance to the organizations who make use of such people because I believe the State organizations and institutions are not in the position to use that type of person, and this voluntary help is playing an increasingly important part in dealing with the big problem confronting us.</p>

<p>I am not in a position to speak on behalf of all these organizations, but I should like to take one specific case because I feel it is probably a typical example of many others. I refer to the Lulama Treatment Centre, and I say in all seriousness that the sponsors and staff of that centre live dangerously, due to financial uncertainty. They have to rely mainly on municipal and provincial subsidies and other financial assistance from members of the public. But the provincial grants are inadequate and as far as I know State grants are non-existent. The main difficulty with these organizations seems to be the subsidization by the State of services undertaken by qualified social workers, and as far as I know the S.A. National Council on Alcoholism is the only welfare organization with a national council which is not in receipt of social worker salary subsidies. At the annual general meeting of the Durban Society late last year it was reported that no salary subsidy is made from the Department of Social Welfare, and yet Lulama relies very heavily on voluntary services. There are seven general practitioners, one consultant psychiatrist, one part-time social worker, one physiotherapist and a panel of four clergymen engaged on the treatment and rehabilitation of cases, all on a voluntary basis. It seems to be established that alcoholism is a malady, and it seems to be a special problem even to the physicians themselves. I was interested to read a report by a Canadian medical practitioner, which stated that in a questionnaire sent to 1,500 doctors in Quebec, 853 replied, 97 per cent asked for information on the treatment of alcoholics and 88 per cent of those who replied said that present medical training was insufficient to prepare them for treating alcoholics. So it is a <span class="col_5667-5668" refersTo="page_167"/>specialized problem and I appeal to the Minister to give his most generous support and assistance to the people who are treating a disease which to-day is considered more damaging than cancer and tuberculosis combined.

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) mentioned a number of figures here but he used them so out of context that one cannot allow it to go unchallenged. He compares the figure for the whole Prisons Vote with the amount that is being made available for children by the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions, and he then contends that we as a country are doing 30 times more for our prisons than for our children! This is such a distortion that I cannot deprecate it strongly enough. It is rather like taking the estimates for the Johannesburg City Council and comparing the mayor&#x2019;s entertainment allowance with one single donation to a charitable institution and then saying that Johannesburg is spending more on its mayor&#x2019;s entertainment than on charity! That is precisely what the hon. member did here to-day. I think it is far-reaching for an hon. member to distort the position in this way. The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) who launched the attack, made just as mean and reprehensible an attack upon the person of the hon. the Minister.</p>

<p>I withdraw them but I regard the hon. member&#x2019;s conduct as extremely unfair and reprehensible. This Government has done more for war veterans and pensioners than any Government before it. I want to mention certain figures to bear this out. The cost of living has risen by 68.2 per cent since 1948 and over the same period pensions have increased by 170 per cent. In other words, the pensioner is better off to-day than he was in 1947. I do not say that we are doing enough. One can never do enough but I do want to emphasize that the Minister has been attacked here unnecessarily and unjustifiably.</p>

<p>The second point I want to mention is that for the first time in our history this Government made the Department a full-fledged Department under a separate Minister. Is this fact appreciated by the Opposition? No; on the contrary, they continue with their cruel attacks. Sir, I do not want to pursue this matter. I think I have dealt adequately with the Opposition. I want to bring a few points to the attention of the hon. the Minister and in doing so I want to mention one matter in particular. I think I speak on behalf of all of us here when I pay tribute to the extremely capable official who died during the recess. I refer to Mr. Chris Crouse, the Parliamentary Clerk of this Department, a man with whom all of us had to deal almost every day and a man who did most praiseworthy work. I feel that we should make special mention of this fact in this debate.</p>

<p>I want to bring two matters to the attention of the hon. the Minister. The first is the question of a usufructary interest in applying the means test. We frequently find that fixed property in an estate is bequeathed to the children, subject to a usufruct in favour of the survivor. That usufruct is counted against the survivor by the Department because it is regarded as income, which is assessed at 3 per cent of the market value of the property in the case of old-age pensioners and 2 per cent in the case of war veterans, plus the income from farming operations, minus the interest which still has to be paid on the bond. In other words, in practice the position is that that usufruct means simply that the pensioner has a haven to which he can return when he wants to. When a pensioner lives with his children in the city the cost of supporting him is not taken into account in applying the means test but if he happens to have the usufruct of a piece of land, whether it means anything to him in practice or not, in many cases it disqualifies him from receiving a pension. I feel that we have reached the stage where we should consider this matter purely on its merits. If a usufruct is of no real cash benefit to its owner, it ought not to count against him.</p>

<p>The other matter which I want to touch upon also relates to the means test. The means test is applied on a monthly basis; a monthly return has to be made. We find that there are many people who do seasonal work; they only work for six months of the year. In this building we have many pensioners who only work here for six months and for the remaining six months of the year they are without an income. The assistants at swimming baths also work in the summer only. If such a person&#x2019;s income is spread over the year, if his income is calculated on an annual basis, he can still qualify for a pension. But his income is calculated on a monthly basis for the six months during which he receives an income and this disqualifies him from receiving a pension. The result is that such a person prefers not to work because he loses his pension if he works. Is it not possible to spread the income earned by such persons over the full year?</p>

<p>Then I want to mention another matter, and this was really my main reason for rising <span class="col_5669-5670" refersTo="page_168"/>to speak. I refer to the group of people whom I want to call the forgotten war veterans who are adversely affected because the means test is applied to them. I hope hon. members will not be shocked but I refer to the rebels of the 1914-5 rebellion. In 1953 when we abolished the means test in respect of war veterans of the Anglo-Boer War, it was abolished not only in respect of the soldiers who fought for the Republics but also in respect of the solders who came to this country from Britain to fight against the Republics, if they settled here afterwards. The means test was abolished as far as they were concerned and they now receive the full war veteran&#x2019;s pension. The Government was prepared to forgive and to forget. The means test is not applied as strictly to war veterans of the First and Second World Wars as it is applied to ordinary old-age pensioners. But no concession of any kind has been made as far as the rebels are concerned. I do not want to defend the rebellion for a single moment, but I want to state most emphatically and clearly that those rebels were the predecessors of the Republic of to-day. Fifty years ago they wanted to achieve by military means what we have now achieved by constitutional means. The soldier who fought for the Government in the rebellion has been given relief as far as the means test is concerned; this also applies to soldiers who fought in other countries during that war. But the rebels who also fought for the ideals in which they believed, ideals which on the occasion of the referendum also appeared to be the ideals of the majority of our people, are being discriminated against inasmuch as the means test is being applied to them strictly. I feel that this is an injustice that must be rectified; that is why I call them the forgotten group of war veterans. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to come back to the subject of alcoholism, Sub-head N, in respect of which the amount has been increased this year from R20,000 to R33,000. I should like first of all to draw the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that last year I questioned whether the amount provided for under this sub-head would be sufficient. The hon. the Minister told me in reply to my question that it was contemplated that there would be a complete revision of the allocation of funds once the Bill which we were discussing at that time, the Retreats and Rehabilitation Centres Act of 1963, reached the Statute Book. The Minister himself said that when he embarked on the new scheme it was going to cost very much more than R20,000 a year. In the report of the inter-departmental committee on the treatment of alcoholics it is recommended that a sum of R400,000 should be provided for. I would therefore like to have some more information from the Minister as to whether he proposes to increase this allocation from R33,000 to R400,000 as recommended by his own inter-departmental committee.</p>

<p>Then I would like to touch on the maintenance grants to the dependants of alcoholics. Alcoholism, that is to say, compulsive drinking, has become one of the greatest threats in the modern world to-day. The vastness and the manifold aspects of the problem of alcoholism are undisputed. Alcoholism not only has an adverse effect on the health of the individual but also on the economy of the country. Sir, it is estimated that there are 900,000 alcoholics out of our White population of over 3,000,000 in South Africa. Only about 3 per cent of these are of the hobo type and some 97 per cent try to cope as best they can with the problem at the occupational and domestic level, and of those 97,000 just about 2,000 are treated annually at the various homes and agencies in the Republic. To a number of these unfortunate people alcohol is a mental and physical poison and medical opinion, as the hon. the Minister is aware, now regards alcoholism as an allergy disease. But, of course, it is not only the ruined physical and mental health of the alcoholic that gives one cause for concern; it is also the effect that it has on others. After all, the alcoholic does not live in a vacuum; there are others who are affected&#x2014;his friends, his doctor, his minister of religion sometimes, and of course, the unfortunate victims of his performance in driving a motor-car, but most of all it affects his family, and this places a heavy burden on the already overworked social services. Section 30 of the Retreats and Rehabilitation Centres Act which we passed here last year provides that allowances may be paid to inmates of these rehabilitation institutions in respect of any work performed by the alcoholics. A proportion of that allowance is also paid to the dependants of the alcoholic. Sir, through my work on the board of the Tara Hospital and also through association with Toc H which conducted an alcoholic retreat near Johannesburg, a retreat known as The Gables, for 12 years, I have come into contact with some of the misery and degradation and poverty of the dependants of these alcoholics. There are many families which have been hit hard by the fact that the breadwinner is an alcoholic, and often by the time an alcoholic is institutionalized in one of these retreats like The Gables, voluntarily or compulsorily, he is out of work and in debt and there is nothing left for the family to fall back on, with the result that the members of the family often become the responsibility of Social Welfare. The earnings of an alcoholic in such an institution are altogether inadequate to maintain his family. The mere fact that an alcoholic is institutionalized hampers his chances of rehabilitation when he knows that his family are trying to live on a pitifully small income. Sir, often these families live in poverty, and sometimes it means actual malnutrition and physical suffering and it more often means squalor and depression and bad health. I feel that the time has come when these maintenance allowances should be reviewed. The Act which we passed here last year will only be a success if we succeed in curing these alcoholics. Their <span class="col_5671-5672" refersTo="page_169"/>cure, however, can be retarded if they know that their families are not being well looked after outside. As the Minister knows, these maintenance grants are payable to the dependants where the alcoholic breadwinner is temporarily unable to maintain his family. Sir, I would like to quote a passage from a letter from one of our welfare organizations, which has this to say on the question of the rehabilitation of alcoholics&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is quite true that most families of persons committed to rehabilitation centres find themselves in financial distress because the alcoholic has usually, before he has been committed, squandered any savings he may have had, and inmates of an institution do not earn sufficient to make any contributions to their families. Any allowances they receive for doing specified jobs in the institution are only sufficient for their personal requirements.</block>

<p>As the Minister knows, a committed person is covered under Section 30 of the Act. His wife and children receive a very small allowance. The maximum that the dependants of a married man can receive is 22&#x00BD;c per day; his compulsory saving is 7&#x00BD;c per day; the cash payable to the inmate is 2&#x00BD;c per day, making a total daily allowance of 33&#x00BD;c. It appears from this table that the 22&#x00BD;c per day payable to the dependants of an inmate is held in trust. It is only paid out on the release of the inmate. During the inmate&#x2019;s detention in these places a maintenance grant is therefore payable to his dependants in terms of the Children&#x2019;s Act. The grant is based on the number of children and the income of the spouses. The maximum grant in respect of a mother is R12 per month; the maximum grant in respect of each of the first two children is R6 per month, and the maximum grant in respect of the third and every further child is R4 per month. The amount of means that a family may have without affecting the amount of the grant is R15 per month for every adult, man and wife, and for every child an additional R2.</p>

<p>Taking into consideration the additional grant of R2 per month in respect of a child in a primary school and R4 per month in respect of a child in high school, one arrives at a total figure of R42.68, and I challenge the hon. the Minister to tell this committee how a wife, with say, three children could exist on that figure, after making an allowance for just over R8 per month for rent, which represents one-fifth of the income. One welcomes the additional grants that were made last year in respect of children in primary schools and high schools, but I feel that the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department should initiate a complete review of these maintenance grants with a view to placing them on a much more realistic level than the present allowance.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>The record of this Government over the past 16 years proves that the interests of the pensioners are indeed close to its heart and that it is not indifferent towards the lot of the pensioners because during the past 16 years various improvements have been effected to the allowances paid to pensioners. During the past 16 years the pensions have been increased on no less than 16 occasions and on no less than nine occasions improvements have been made to the way in which the means test was applied. It was announced last year that a married civil pensioner would receive a minimum pension of R84 and that an unmarried pensioner would receive a minimum pension of R42. Over the past 16 years such a fantastic improvement has been effected that we can only express our sincere appreciation for it. In spite of these improvements, hon. members opposite often told us during this Session that the Government was not doing anything to improve the lot of the pensioners. I, therefore, think it is my duty to give a few figures to show how pensions have been improved since the Nationalist Party has come into power. In April 1947 the basic pension was only R10 per month. In April 1948 it was increased to R12. In 1951 it was increased to a total of R14, including a bonus of R2 per month. In 1952 the total pension including the bonus was increased to R16, in 1953 to R18, in 1954 to R19, including a bonus of R7. In April 1955 the pension was increased to R21, i.e. the basic pension was R12, with an additional amount of R7 and a bonus of R2. In 1959 the total figure was increased to R22, in 1960 to R23, in 1962 to R24.50. In 1963 an additional amount of R2.50 was paid to the poorest of the poor. That additional amount of R2.50 was also allocated to all other pensioners in 1964. The total pension an old-age pensioner draws to-day is therefore R27. But that is not all this Government does for the pensioners. A great many improvements have been effected in regard to the means test. In 1947 the maximum was R180; in 1948 it was increased to R240, in 1951 to R324. Apart from that there have been various relaxations in regard to the assets they can possess. Before April 1953 a person could have assets to the value of R1,600 without those being taken in account for the purposes of the means test. That amount was then increased to R2,400 in the case of married persons. But those assets over and above R2,400 were then calculated at 5 per cent and deducted from his pension. This is called the super levy and my plea is for this to be abolished. Since 1953 the earnings of people over the age of 70 were no longer taken into account for the purposes of the means test. In 1954 the means test was relaxed in the case of war veterans over the age of 70 years. His free income was increased from R180 to R500, in other words, R1,000 in the case of a married couple. In 1955 the means test was completely abolished in the case of war veterans of the Second War of Independence. In 1956 the age of dependant children was increased from 16 to 18 years. In 1959-60 the distinction that was made <span class="col_5673-5674" refersTo="page_170"/>earlier between pensioners living on the platteland and those living in towns and cities was done away with. All pensioners were placed on the same basis. In 1961 the residential qualifications were relaxed. At the same time a further concession was made as far as the means test was concerned in that where a couple owned a house and one partner died, the means test was applied as though both the husband and wife occupied that house. In 1963 a further improvement was effected as far as investments were concerned. Since 1963 the first R800 of any investment was calculated at 1&#x00BD; per cent and the balance at 2&#x00BD; per cent, irrespective of what that investment actually earned. The income of farmers is calculated at R144, and where people make donations to heirs R1,000 is deducted per annum as though the donor would have spent it. All these concessions were made during the past few years. But the biggest and the most important concession was made this year and that was in Connection with civil and railway pensioners. Mr. Chairman, I know of civil pensioners and railway pensioners who only received a little over R10 per month in 1949. To-day those same people receive R84 per month. If that is not a remarkable increase I do not know what one can regard as a remarkable increase. In spite of all the improvements that have been effected we have not had a single word of thanks from that side of the House. I think this is the fourth time pensions have been discussed, and not once did a single member opposite get up and express his gratitude to the Minister for these improvements. That only shows you, Sir, how completely hon. members opposite have lost touch with the electorate. They do not have their fingers on the pulse of the people outside; they do not know how the people feel in respect of this matter.</p>

<p>Yes, they are ungrateful. Mr. Chairman, before I sit down I just want to ask the hon. the Minister to consider seriously the abolition of the super levy which was introduced in 1930 when it was very difficult to calculate the exact income of pensioners. There are many cases to-day where the pensioner owns a property which he himself occupies. The value of that property has since greatly appreciated with the result that the owner of that property does not qualify for a pension because of the super levy. I want to ask the hon. the Minister to seriously consider abolishing this super levy. I think it will give very - great relief in the case of deserving people. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, we have listened with interest to the hon. member who has just resumed his seat, the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) (Mr. J. A. Schlebusch). I would like to remind that hon. member that on every occasion where a concession has been made to social, civil or other pensioners, we on this side of the House have always welcomed it. We have never said at any stage that nothing has been done by the present Government to improve the lot of the pensioner. What we have said, and quite rightly, is that the Government can do far more for the social pensioner. I think if the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) carefully analyses the position, if he bears in mind the enormous surplus which the Government has at its disposal, he will realize that very little indeed is being done by the Government to alleviate the plight of those persons who deserve relief. The hon. member read out a long list of increases which had been granted over the years, but he must bear in mind that there has been a considerable decrease in the purchasing power of the money that has been placed in the pockets of these social pensioners. I do not think there is a single member in this House who would dare to suggest that our present social pensions are adequate. Indeed, if I remember correctly the hon. the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions himself has pointed out that the social pension is not intended to be the sole means of support of the pensioner; it is a supplementary grant. In order to maintain anything like a decent standard of living the social pensioner has to find support from other sources. The plain fact of the matter is that they have to rely on charity from others to maintain a decent standard of living.</p>

<p>I wish to deal principally with the Minister&#x2019;s policy, with particular reference to the allocation of funds under item K, &#x201C;War pensions, old-age and blind persons&#x2019; pensions and disability grants&#x201D;. When we look at this Vote we find that out of the total of R84,000,000, over R40,000,000 is allocated to this particular sub-head. As far as the Minister&#x2019;s policy is concerned I should like to hear from him whether he has made every possible effort within the Cabinet to obtain a greater allocation of funds for the social pensioners for whom he is responsible. The Minister is responsible for the welfare of some 126,000 social pensioners. The Minister&#x2019;s Department has been stripped of all responsibility as far as pensioners belonging to other racial groups are concerned. The Minister&#x2019;s Department is only responsible for the welfare of White pensioners. Sir, it was stated in the Budget speech that R3,450,000 out of the surplus of R88,000,000 would be allocated to social pensioners. When we come to break down and to analyse those figures we find that of the 126,0 pensioners, some 84,000 pensioners have not received the special allowance, whereas some 42,500 social pensioners have received that allowance. In other words, approximately one-third of the total number of White social pensioners have received this special allowance. The increased amount, which merely represents the cost of this special allowance of R30 per annum or R2.50 per month, will therefore be R2,520,000. We know that the Minister of Finance has announced an additional surplus of R40,000,000, and that he anticipates an increase of <span class="col_5675-5676" refersTo="page_171"/>R18,000,000 in revenue, which means that altogether the Government has an additional R146,000,000 available. This increased expenditure of R2,500,000 on social pensions represents only 1.7 per cent of the total surplus; only 1.7 per cent of this huge surplus is being allocated towards the alleviation of the lot of the White social pensioner. We find on examining the position that only two-thirds of the social pensioners will receive this benefit. The neediest of the needy who were granted a special allowance last year are receiving nothing whatsoever out of this surplus. Sir, it has come as an acute disappointment to this side of the House to find that these people, who are in dire need, are getting nothing out of this surplus. The Government has set aside the sum of R750,000 out of this windfall of R58,000,000 for the provision of homes for the aged. We have no details of this amount and I do not propose therefore to pursue this matter. We do not know whether this amount is intended only for the White social pensioners or whether this is the amount to be spend in providing homes for the aged of all racial groups. However, this sum only represents 1.3 per cent of the total amount which is being made available from this additional surplus. I believe that the present position of our social pensioners warrants more attention from the hon. the Minister. The fact remains that the necessary funds are available. We are a young prosperous country with a buoyant economy. Surely we should find ways and means of spreading the present prosperity to those sections of the community who need assistance. I believe that the Government has lost a golden opportunity in not granting more assistance to our social pensioners this year, bearing in mind the huge surplus which it had at its disposal. If our social pensioners get no relief from the Government at a time of economic buoyancy, what hope have they of receiving further assistance in times of economic stringency? I believe that a country can be judged by the way in which it cares for the less fortunate and needy sections of the community. I believe that the older people who toiled hard throughout the years to build up this country should be treated with greater consideration now that the country is enjoying such great prosperity.</p>

<p>I believe that the hon. the Minister has lost another golden opportunity in not taking advantage of the big surplus to bring about further relief as far as the means test is concerned. I know that the Minister is anxious to make concessions where he can, and I believe that the Minister has a golden opportunity here to make further concessions. He has had the advantage of a trip overseas, and we hope that he will tell us in the course of this debate what his findings were abroad. We hope that he will be able to announce that the Government is prepared to afford greater relief to those persons who are in dire need of assistance. I believe that we have reached the stage where, as far as social welfare services and the care of our aged are concerned, we cannot embark upon a haphazard course of merely granting a small concession here and a small concession there, however much such concessions may be appreciated. I think we have reached the stage where the responsible Minister should give us a clear outline of his policy so that we can know where we stand.</p>

<p>As far as the means test is concerned I do not wish to weary the Committee by going into details, but when we examine the position we find that some ten or 11 years have elapsed since there has been any alteration in the amount permitted as free assets. When we look at the revaluations which have taken place in all the major municipalities, I believe that the figure of R2,400 which is permitted as free unencumbered assets should be raised to something like R3,000. I know that I will be challenged immediately to say how many people will be involved and what this will cost the country. I believe that the hon. the Minister must be courageous in this matter. We have reached the stage where courage is required from the hon. the Minister to make worthwhile concessions as far as the limit of free unencumbered assets is concerned. I think the figure should be increased from R2,400 to R3,000 for a married person or a single person who Wholly or partly occupies his own property. Then there is another aspect of the means test which causes a great deal of concern and heartache to those persons who just fail to qualify for a pension. We must remember that with the increases in bonuses which take place from time to time, the gap grows between those persons who just fail to qualify for a pension and those who just succeed in qualifying for the minimum pension. As we increase the bonus so the minimum pension is increased, and it will now be R16 per month. If a person qualifies for a basic pension of R1 per month he will now be able to qualify in fact for a pension of R16 per month because of the additional bonuses. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to express my appreciation for the positive spirit hon. members on both sides of the House have revealed in the discussion of this subject. I have often told hon. members that social welfare and pensions are matters which affect all of us. It affects many individuals whose welfare has been entrusted to us. When we approach it objectively we not only do ourselves a service but we do a service to those people whose interests we are trying to promote.</p>

<p>I shall not say much but I gave an undertaking that I would say something about my study trip overseas. The hon. member for Drakensberg (Mrs. S. M. van Niekerk) asked for that as well as the hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) and others. I wish to give a brief summary of my impressions. I just want to add that to implement those impressions will not be a matter of a few weeks or a month or two. They are delicate matters <span class="col_5677-5678" refersTo="page_172"/>of the utmost importance because they affect people. I had discussions with various Ministers of State, senior officials and people at the head of various social welfare projects of which there are a legion. On one occasion I had a long discussion one evening with an official who was at the head of a welfare organization in his country and again the following morning. I said to him: &#x201C;You and I must understand each other well. I want to know what system you follow, what your problems are, how you apply that system and what success you have had, but that is not all I want.&#x201D; Then he said: &#x201C;I shall show you a file.&#x201D; He sent for the file and after we had conversed for some time he said he understood me very well. He turned the file over and said: &#x201C;Mr. Serfontein, I realize now what you are looking for; you are looking for the person under that file and how the services affect those people.&#x201D; I told him that was exactly what I was looking for. That was why I visited institutions. I visited the places where those people lived. I was well received throughout. I want to say immediately that we can learn a great deal from them; we can learn a great deal from various countries in Europe, but I want to add that they too can learn a great deal from us. My approach was that we should learn from each other where possible. We all have problems and our problems are of a different nature. Our approach is the same, however, and that is to make our various nations as happy as possible. In many countries they have heard about our Children&#x2019;s Act and they asked me how it operated. They were very favourably impressed by it. They were also impressed by our field services and our whole organization which always enables us to get to that person underneath the file. Our organization is such that we know how the money is spent either by the State or by church organizations or by societies on financial assistance to those people. They were greatly impressed by that.</p>

<p>Where their approach to family and child care in general differs so fundamentally from our approach in South Africa I just want to dispose of that in a few words. Wherever I went I found the greatest measure of frankness. Something which impressed them was the fact that in our specific measures we placed the emphasis mainly on two things. The first is: What becomes of our children? Provision is made for that in the Children&#x2019;s Act and we were all in agreement as far as that was concerned. And the second is: What is our approach to those children? Which is the best place where you can do the best for that child? Our approach that our policy should be to concentrate on the family greatly impressed them. I want to state implicitly that it is easier for us to do so than it is for them in those war-devastated countries of Europe. They experienced a greater measure of family disruption in those European countries than those countries which were fortunate enough not to experience the realities of the war. They had to do much more reconstruction work. They had to give attention to the material things and consequently they could not give attention to those things to which we have already been giving our attention for a long time. Not only was family life disrupted to a great extent during the war years but they tell you frankly that they have not yet had the opportunity of giving the attention which they thought should be given and which we were giving in South Africa to the question of family life. A great statesman once said all politics were family politics. That is very true in the long run. All our activities in this House affect the people of the country in the long run and ultimately it affects that family structure. If anything goes wrong with the family structure things go wrong with us. I visited many children institutions. The children are well looked after in those. Let me give two examples. I spent a whole day in Germany in one of the Tagesheime. It is a wonderful institution; it is a neat building and well managed. The children are brought there early in the morning by their parents and fetched in the evenings. You find babies in the cradle and children who already go to school. We spent the whole day there and had a meal with them. That Tagesheim provides in a need but I told them that it was not a &#x201C;heim&#x201D;; that it was not the same as the family circle. At night that child only goes and sleeps with its parents in the flat. That flat is just a place to sleep. The Tagesheim is complementary; it provides temporarily in a need but it does not provide in the crucial need which has to be provided in if you wish to build up a nation which is convinced that by saving the family, it saves its children, and by saving its children it saves its own future. These things I have mentioned bring me to an announcement I wish to make. We are doing a great deal to-day but we shall definitely have to give attention to the care of our own children. Save what you have and build on that for the future. That was also what the Piek Committee recommended in their report. Hon. members are entitled to ask me what has happened to that report. We have referred it to the various Departments. The main point in the Piek Committee&#x2019;s report is that we should not pay family allowances because that would only be money we paid out without having any control over it. The kernel of the Piek Committee&#x2019;s report is&#x2014;and all educationists will agree with this&#x2014;that you should build the family circle and that you must save the child. If you save the child you ensure the future. The Piek Committee say in their report it is not a question of money but a question of human relations and human values. Mr. Chairman, the continued existence of any nation at any time in its existence depends on whether it places the highest value on that which is the most important, and whether it regards as most important that which outweighs everything else. And the one consideration which should outweigh everything else in the mind <span class="col_5679-5680" refersTo="page_173"/>of every person is how the children are being cared for. The Piek Committee recommended in their report that a board for the promotion of family life should be established. As I have said I have referred that report to the bodies concerned for consideration, educational bodies, the Administrations, social welfare organizations and so forth and have asked them to submit recommendations. I have also asked those Departments which are concerned in this matter to make recommendations. It was my intention to introduce legislation this Session but after the matter was discussed by the National Council of Social Welfare Organizations, a council representative of over 2,000 welfare organizations in the country, they sent their executive committee to me and they asked me please not to come forward with legislation this Session. They asked for an opportunity of submitting the matter to the regional boards and other bodies so that they could send in memoranda. That report is today in the hands of the National Council of Welfare Organizations and if there are no hitches we shall introduce legislation next year. It is hoped that the establishment of a board for the promotion of family life will flow from that. We shall have to correlate all the data in order to see what should be done. The fundamental fact remains, however, that any country in the world must ultimately turn its attention to the soundness of its family life and if it does not do so it will go under and disintegrate gradually.</p>

<p>I just want to say something in connection with the care of the aged and social pensions. In this connection I have already in various debates made certain announcements concerning my experiences overseas. I think I have already said that the matter has been thoroughly considered and placed before the Government. After deliberating the matter the Government wisely decided that it was impossible and ineffective for us in South Africa to introduce a contributory pensions scheme on a compulsory basis. I have already said that. We investigated the pension systems in overseas countries and how they approached the question of caring for their aged. As far as their pension schemes are concerned in some European countries they are contributory and in others not. I did not come across any two countries in Europe where they are in complete agreement. I did not come across one model scheme in Europe where they could tell me that it covered everything as far as pensions were concerned. They simply do not do that. I want to give a few examples of what I came across there.</p>

<p>I investigated this matter very thoroughly for about a week in England. There are two assistance schemes. The one is the National Security Scheme which is run on a contributory basis. The other is the National Assistance Scheme which is exclusively financed and controlled by the State. Everybody is compelled to contribute to the National Security Scheme. Then they have another system in England, which I think is a good system, called &#x201C;the flat rates system&#x201D;. The employee pays R1.06 per week, the employer pays 86 cents per week and the Government pays the rest. I want to give the case of a married pensioner. A married pensioner gets from R24 to R53 per month. That is the scale whereby it operates. In South Africa a married pensioner gets R32 to R54 per month. There is no real difference between the two scales, Mr. Chairman. They are practically the same and in England it is a contributory pension scheme. There the people say they are entitled to it because they have contributed towards their pension, but what they receive is not as wonderful and does not meet all their needs to the extent we sometimes think. I now want to mention something very important. I inquired very thoroughly into this matter, I spent a whole day with Lord Ilford the chairman of the National Assistance Board. He accompanied me on visits to a few institutions. This system has already been in operation for 16 years in England. As hon. members will know when you introduce such a system the State has to make considerable contributions initially because there is no money in the &#x201C;kitty&#x201D; to start with. Once the contributions start coming in it is only necessary for the State to supplement the amounts to be paid out. After 16 years 20 per cent of the people in England cannot make ends meet on their pensions and have to receive additional assistance from the National Assistance Board. That assistance comes from the State and it is granted not only subject to a means test but also subject to what they call a &#x201C;needs test&#x201D;. That is the National Assistance Scheme.</p>

<p>My officials and I spent a day at the Rijks Bank in Amsterdam, which is the institution which controls all those things. The manager of that bank and the Ministers of the two Departments concerned, namely, the Minister of Social Welfare and the Minister of Social Problems and National Health told me that scheme did not cover everything and that the local authorities always had to give assistance. The Dutch Treasury contributes approximately R100,000,000 per annum in the form of assistance, assistance which is subject to a means test. People pride themselves on their social security scheme; they say it is a wonderful system but it was introduced in circumstances which differed greatly from the circumstances in South Africa. Our position was very different from theirs after the war and is still very different. But they pay R100,000,000 in the form of financial assistance because large numbers of people do not contribute. When I asked them what they did in the case of those people who did not contribute they said: &#x201C;What can we do?&#x201D; When I asked them what they did in the case of a man who was healthy and fit to work but who did not work they said to me: In such a case we pay his contribution. But they added that they did not have people like that but you do find people like that in every country, Sir. The scheme is so ineffectively controlled that <span class="col_5681-5682" refersTo="page_174"/>when those people do not pay, those people who refuse to do anything about financing their own families, the State pays their contributions simply because the control is not water-tight.</p>

<p>I investigated the position in Germany. In Germany the State pays an amount which is equally divided between the Roman Catholic Church and the Evangelist Church. Those churches spend it as they like. There is simply no control. A great deal is done by the State as far as housing is concerned, but there is simply no control. You find the position in all countries that when the contributor is asked to contribute more he says: You can increase my contributions but then you must increase my pension. That leads to an increase in the wage structure which in turn has an effect on production costs which encourages inflation. That gives you a vicious circle. Once you have embarked along that road you simply cannot exercise any control.</p>

<p>After my investigations two aspects of the non-contributory scheme are, to my mind, very significant. I can well understand hon. members saying to me: We know you are doing your best; we appreciate it, but can you not make a change here or there? I appreciate that because I have always said, and I repeat it to-day, that this type of service to the less privileged section of the community is not static, it is a service which changes from time to time, a service which makes fresh demands when it changes, demands to which we have to adapt ourselves as they are made. But two fundamental principles are very clear to me. I shall be pleased if hon. members on both sides of the House would say to me: &#x201C;No, there we do not agree with you.&#x201D; The first principle to which I subscribe 100 per cent is this: People should be encouraged to make provision for their own old age as far as possible. We should not discourage that. The second principle is this that society as such should be trained and encouraged to continue to take an interest in the case of its fellow human beings; you cannot just simply shift people around; they move in the society. You have to keep their interest in and their love for that society alive. Something which struck me in particular in England and in various European countries was that they did not isolate their old people into a separate community. They keep their aged inside the community circle. I spent a whole day at Stephanage. That is one of the most wonderful institutions in England. There are children; the place is surrounded by factories&#x2014;you can practically call them border industries. It is about 28 miles outside London. They settle the old people within the community. That was one thine which struck me forcibly. Something else which struck me was the fact that they try to move the old people away from the thickly populated urban areas. I visited old people in an institution accompanied by Mr. W. Johnson. On the one side you have that part of London which has not yet been rebuilt after the war and the institution on the other side. I entered those flatlets and spoke to the old people. One old lady said to me: &#x201C;Mr. Serfontein, you know I have been living for 30 years in those ruins. I am very glad to have been able to live, for the past five years, in this lovely flatlet. I shall live here until I pass on.&#x201D; The tendency throughout the world is not to let the old people remain in the urban areas if it can be avoided.</p>

<p>On my return I was convinced that one of the first things we should try to do for our old people in South Africa was to provide better accommodation for them. I think we are well on the road to providing that improved accommodation. We can accommodate them in two different ways. We are investigating the position and hence this grant of R750,000 for the construction of more old people&#x2019;s homes. I want to make an appeal to hon. members of this House, particularly those who represent urban constituencies where you have had slum conditions, to encourage welfare and church organizations to come forward. I know there are difficulties, I come up against them daily. Those people know they can get a loan at 1/20th per cent for 40 years from the Department of Housing for the construction of old people&#x2019;s homes. But the difficulty is to find the land. Land prices have increased greatly, particularly in the urban areas. Hon. members who have looked for land know that is the position. Because we know what the difficulty is and because we wish to expedite matters we want to give the necessary impetus, by means of this R750,000, to people to go ahead with the construction of old people&#x2019;s homes, because there are long waiting lists in the existing ones in the urban areas. That accommodation must be provided. They can now get additional assistance. They can get it in the form of a single grant.</p>

<p>I am only dealing with Whites. It is not a loan; it is an out-and-out grant. Every application will of course be dealt with on its merits. But if the demand is there I do believe we shall succeed in expediting the establishment of old people&#x2019;s homes. The position is that the bonuses and the allowances and the pensions are increased every year. But the moment they are increased the lessor simply puts up the rent of that little room in the slum area. Those old people do not benefit by the increase. Their position remains the same. The rent is simply increased and next year we are told that the old people cannot make ends meet with their pensions; we must give more. By means of this R750,000 which is intended for the acquisition of land and furniture, we hope to give the necessary encouragement so that more old people&#x2019;s homes will be erected. In this connection I want to say that I have had long discussions with the Minister of Housing. We were in Europe to <span class="col_5683-5684" refersTo="page_175"/>gether and the discussions started there already. A great deal can be done by way of providing other accommodation. Where new communities are established, even where_ new housing schemes are tackled in an existing community, it will be ensured that a certain percentage of the houses will be on a sub-economic basis so that the old people will be able to afford to live there. Those houses will be reserved for them. Thirdly, I want to say this&#x2014;I have already referred to this in passing&#x2014;that we must meet those people who have already invested in a little home of their own. We are investigating the whole position and we want to make provision for those people who have to some extent made provision for themselves. We want to try to show appreciation of the fact that they have provided for themselves. We want to take that into account in the application of the means test. That is my reply to the question put by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) (Mr. van Rensburg). We are dealing with the matter. I want to warn hon. members that this is a very difficult matter to handle but I think it is essential that we carry it through. It will cost a great deal.</p>

<p>There was something else I saw in Europe which I should like to investigate further and which I want to mention here and that is the system of delayed pensions. It means that somebody is allowed to continue to work and is paid his pension at a later age. You have to provide him with some incentive to work longer and to draw his pension at a later age. You have to give him some encouragement so that he will not lose because he applies at a later stage. This system operates in various countries in Europe and I was quite impressed by it. I am also investigating that system.</p>

<p>I again want to assure hon. members that any suggestions from any side of the House will be welcome. If they can make suggestions to improve on what we are already doing, we shall be only too anxious to hear what hon. members have to say so that we can all help in providing the necessary service to our poor, to our pensioners, to those people who have to have welfare services.</p>

<p>Before I sit down I want to reply specifically to a few questions put to me and I shall do so in broad outline. I have already replied in broad outline to the hon. member for Umbilo. I just want to tell him that I know that, as in the past, he will never hesitate to come to my office at any time he wishes to discuss anything in connection with social welfare. Our door is always open and the hon. member avails himself of the opportunity of coming to my Department with his difficulties. The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) spoke about allowances to the families of alcoholics, alcoholics who enter institutions voluntarily or who are forced to go there. I may just mention that the Committee of Inquiry on Alcoholism has recommended that that should gradually be introduced over a number of years. Under sub-head M the amount for this year has been increased by R39,600 which shows that we are giving effect to that recommendation of the committee. That amount is gradually being increased. I understand that there are people who find themselves in a difficult position if a member of the family has to go to an institution either voluntarily or under force. But when the breadwinner finds himself in an institution either because he entered it voluntarily or because he was forced to go there you cannot expect the State to accept full responsibility for its dependants. I invite the hon. member for Johannesburg (North) and other hon. members to go to Magaliesoord. They will find that an experience. I go there every year and I inquire after the welfare of the inmates. I myself sign all the certificates of those who are discharged. I am told that many of them come back. Human nature being what it is I am inclined to think that if you look well after their wives and children they will easily come back. The better you look after their families the easier it will be for them to come back. They like Magaliesoord.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) raised the question of the income which is reckoned over six months. I can just tell him that the income is already reckoned at the average over the year. It is no longer reckoned at the average per month. As far as that is concerned, therefore, we are already complying with his request, perhaps even on a more favourable basis. The hon. member also spoke about the war veterans of the 1914 and 1915 Rebellion. I shall give attention to that. That is of course a matter that will have to be decided on at higher level but I have listened to the representations of the hon. member and I shall attend to them.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Berea) (Mr. Wood) referred to the increase of R50,000. I am informed that the increase is due to the <i>per capita</i> subsidy in respect of places of safety of the Rand Aid Association and the increased subsidies to clinics. Provision is also made for the Staanvas Hospital which was recently opened in Pretoria for alcoholics. I must admit that I was disturbed, although I knew more or less what the position was, to learn that because of alcoholism 120,000 cases of contraventions appeared before the courts.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) for his reference to former officials of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. The officials of the Department have an extremely difficult task and I wish to thank hon. members on both sides of the House very heartily for the testimonial they have given the Department, the head of the Department and the entire staff, for the wonderful work they are doing. I deal with them every day of my life. I know they often work overtime and I know they are doing their work to the best of their ability. I wish to state particularly that their doors are open to the public of South Africa particularly <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Members of Parliament <span class="col_5685-5686" refersTo="page_176"/>who represent the public. I just want to tell hon. members that it is true that people live longer these days. That was also my experience in Europe. I was told in France that people lived so long these days that it had become a problem on its own. They told me that had it not been for the war they would actually have had a surplus of young people. In addition, they told me, the old people lived so long that they reckoned it would take more or less 15 to 20 years before there would be an equal balance between the birth rate in the country and the death rate. There are many old people and to be quite honest it seemed to me that not only did it take the old people longer to grow old but that they grew younger. The hon. member referred to the R750,000. I have already dealt with that. The hon. member for Drakensberg is unfortunately not here but I have already dealt with the housing question she raised.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) spoke about mentally retarded children and he made a comparison between what we spent on social welfare and what we spent on prisons. I just want to point out to him that in 1958-9 this Department spent R60,000,000; in 1963-4 it spent R80,l 16,000 and that we are budgeting for R88,125,000 for 1964-5. From 1958 up to the present there has been an increase of R27,290,000, an increase of 45 per cent. That is a considerable increase. I have already dealt with the various matters raised by the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher). He again made an appeal in connection with the taking over of Departments. I can just tell him that his views about the question of linking Departments are, of course, his own personal views. He may raise the matter here and suggest that this Department should be linked with that Department etc. but that is hardly a subject for discussion under my Vote.</p>

<p>Sir, I think I have more or less replied to all the questions. If I have overlooked anything I can give hon. members the assurance that we go into the speeches again and if hon. members require any information I once again invite them to approach my Department at any time or to write to us. The heads of the regional offices which are squattered throughout the country are also always prepared to listen to anything concerning the welfare of the nation.</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>I am rather disappointed that the hon. Minister seems to have made up his mind that it is not practical to have instituted in South Africa a contributory pension scheme. He mentioned that he had investigated certain systems overseas, none of which he found suitable for adaptation in this country. I feel that it is not beyond the ingenuity of South Africa to devise a scheme whereby all persons will be able to claim a pension as a right, and not merely as a privilege. We on this side of the House have put forward on at least one occasion in the course of this Session the basis upon which such a scheme could be evolved, and I do hope that the hon. Minister in the policy statement that he has virtually made now has not turned his face completely against the possibility of introducing a scheme whereby we can bring about a far happier state of affairs for our people. Great Britain and other countries have a successful scheme, and there is the comprehensive scheme of social security in New Zealand, where the New Zealand Government from time to time have not altered the scheme to any great extent and they have found their scheme most practical and to the benefit of all concerned. Similarly a scheme in Sweden, which is partly contributory and partly carried by the State, has been a great success. I think it is possible for us to devise such a scheme in this country whereby all persons will be able to qualify for a pension. Sir, if you look at our present scheme, you will find that it is a much criticized scheme. We know that as far back as 1944 a Select Committee on Social Security also came to the conclusion that the means test was not a suitable scheme. Indeed in the <i>Vaderland</i> on 15 September 1962&#x2014;this is a translated copy of a leading article&#x2014;the following appeared&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the moral aspect of the matter is concerned, the means test certainly cannot be regarded as an encouragement to thrift. It places those people who throughout their lives have not spared a penny in a position where they can enjoy the full benefit of the old age pension, while the remainder find that the provision which they have tried to make for their old age works to their disadvantage.</block>

<p>They then go on to state&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Every community, and thus also the State, has a bounden duty towards its old people, who in their active years as taxpayers and workers have helped to build up the country, and the money which is necessary for their care must be found and freely devoted to them.</block>

<p>That is the point of view expressed by the <i>Vaderland,</i> a view which I think should receive careful consideration. The whole system of the means test discriminates against certain persons who have made provision for their old age. When the hon. Minister spoke just now he said that all persons should make provision for their old age.</p>

<p>Yes, Sir. I would like to say that a number of these people who have in their opinion made provision for their old age, find now that they have not made sufficient provision because of the decreasing purchasing power of money. I think of people who have taken out endowment policies, insurance policies &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#oldfield">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OLDFIELD</person>:</from>

<p>My point is that by having a means test we are not encouraging those people to make provision for their old age. That is exactly my complaint that this present system does not encourage that state of affairs. Look at the limits that are placed on a person when he applies for a pension. If you look at the free income for instance that is permitted, even though it has been increased from time to time, it stands at the present time at R180 per annum, and thereafter R12 per annum in excess of the R180 per annum is deducted from the basic pension, which means that when a person reaches the amount of R312 per annum from any source he is disqualified from obtaining a pension. And that, Sir, can hardly be described as a means of encouraging persons to make provision for their old age. They might have investments, they might have endowment policies and thereby receive an income in excess of R26 per month. Then they find that they are not entitled to claim any relief in the form of a social pension. A person who manages to just receive a pension will draw the minimum amount of R16 per month; the person who just fails draws nothing. In other words, persons who think they have made sufficient provision for their old age are being discriminated against. That is why I repeat the plea that I made last year that the hon. Minister should endeavour to raise that amount still further. I want to make the suggestion here this afternoon that the hon. Minister should consider raising that free income to R240 per annum before any deduction is made. If it is then based on the same basis, it would mean that a person could get up to R372 per annum before being disqualified from drawing any pension. That is one form of relief that could be given to them, and it would be one means by which persons could be encouraged to make some provision for their old age. If the hon. Minister does not wish to raise that amount, then I think he should find another system of applying this particular provision of the means test. For instance, the additional amount that is added to the basic pension, could that not be consolidated into the basic pension? The additional amount now stands at R84 per annum. If that additional amount was incorporated into the basic pension, it would then also bring in those persons who are now disqualified from a pension due to the fact that they are earning more than R312 per annum. I think an adjustment to this particular figure should receive the very careful consideration of the hon. the Minister. There is another point and that is in regard to the provision that is made by a person who buys a property and pays off that property over, say, a period of 30 years. It is an unencumbered property, there is no bond. He too is at a disadvantage because of the level that is placed of R2,400. When my time expired earlier, I mentioned that I believe that the hon. Minister should give his consideration to the possibility of increasing that to R3,000 in the case of a married person. And for a single person who is not wholly or partly occupying his property at present that level is R1,200 and that could be similarly increased to R1,500. Without going further into the details of the means test, I think we perhaps have now reached the stage where the Minister can give consideration to abolishing the means test for the world war veterans of World War I, from 1914-18. We know that the means test was abolished for those persons who served in the South African War, the 1899-1902 War. I see no reason why we should not at this stage take this into consideration and extend that same privilege to the persons of the First World War. I know there are certain provisions whereby the means test is more lenient for a war veteran over 70 years of age, but on going through the Estimates&#x2014;and I do not want to bore the Committee by quoting numerous figures&#x2014;for the last three years, looking at the amounts expended on the war veterans&#x2019; pensions, I find that it is steadily decreasing by approximately R500,000 per annum, and if we compare the 1963-4 figure with the expected figure for 1964-5, we see that same pattern. The amount will decrease as the years go by because naturally there will be fewer persons living who will be able to qualify for that pension. I feel that we have now reached the stage where the hon. Minister can consider the extension of that privilege which is allowed to the South Africa war veterans to also include those veterans of the First World War.</p>

<p>There is one other point which I would like to deal with and that is in regard to making the lives of the older folk just a little happier. I do not wish to repeat again and again what we have said several times in this House about paying them more in regard to their social pensions, but I believe that their lives can be a little happier in regard to the loneliness experienced by a large number of these aged folk. There are a certain number of these aged persons who are most loath to go into a home for the aged. They like their independence. It is for those persons, and perhaps also for those living in the homes for the aged, that some encouragement should be given to our welfare organizations, to our churches and our local authorities to establish clubs or community centres for the aged. [Time limit.]</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#visse">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VISSE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Umbilo (Mr. Oldfield) adopts the attitude that one should either abolish or relax the means test. I think that we are all in favour of that but we realize that it is almost impossible to do so. If the means test is abolished it will mean that every person above a certain age&#x2014;at present the age is 65 years for males and 60 years for females&#x2014;will receive a pension. My attitude, and I think the attitude of the Government, is that it is a privilege to receive <span class="col_5689-5690" refersTo="page_178"/>an old-age pension; it is not a right to which a person can lay claim. There is a Dutch saying to the effect that it is easier for a parent to support 12 children than for 12 children to support one parent. This discussion reminds me of that saying, which is perfectly true. Children have a duty to support their parents just as parents have a duty to support their children and bring them up. That is something which the Opposition overlook. They adopt the attitude that it is the duty of the State to support our old people and that children do not have to look after their parents. The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) advocated the building of what he called a non-acute hospital. He did not tell us exactly what he meant by it but I think we do have something of that kind in the Transvaal. It was brought into being when the United Party was in power in the provincial council. I refer to the institution at Warmbaths. The hon. member for Florida&#x2014;if I remember correctly&#x2014;said that about R10 per month was paid in respect of each inmate at that institution. The expression &#x201C;non-acute&#x201D; hospital indicates that it is a place for people who are not suffering from a disease but who simply cannot fend for themselves. Do hon. members know what the effect of that non-acute hospital at Warmbaths is? The children of the old people who are admitted to that institution are rich people. They have the influence to get their parents admitted to that institution for a month or two and they do this simply with the idea of getting rid of their parents so that they can go on holiday and enjoy themselves. They know that their parents will be well looked after at a very low tariff. That non-acute hospital at Warmbaths has got completely out of hand. I hope that the hon. the Minister will never consider setting up a similar institution again. The Opposition advocate the relaxation or abolition of the means test. I do not think they realize that if we relax the means test pensions will have to be paid to a larger number of people and that will cost the State more money. We would all like to see the means test relaxed but it would place an impossible burden upon the taxpayers. We have a large surplus at the moment and the Opposition have told us that we should use that money in order to give more assistance to the old people. But if we have a deficit next year and we then have to reduce the pension, can hon. members imagine what the position will be? There will be dissatisfaction and many of these pensioners will not be able to make ends meet on their reduced pension. I would prefer the State to continue to make the privilege available along the present lines.</p>

<p>Sir, I made a plea here for a certain group of persons a few years ago. The hon. member for Umbilo also referred to this matter. I refer to persons who save in order to acquire their own property and who are then precluded from receiving a pension as a result of the application of the means test. I want to make a plea for those people&#x2014;and there are numbers of them. We all have such people in our constituencies. I want to ask again whether something cannot be done to pay those people a pension. Let me make this suggestion. The property they own disqualifies them from receiving an old-age pension. Give them the right to pass a notarial bond in favour of the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions and let them then be paid that money which is drawn under the bond in monthly instalments. When those people die, that money will then be repaid to the State and the children will simply inherit less from their parents. Statistics have been compiled in regard to life expectancy and I feel that such a scheme can be based on those statistics. If, for example, a property is worth R6,000 and a person is 65 years old and he is expected to live another 15 years, the R6,000 would be divided by 15 to find out how much he will receive per annum. If he dies before the age of 80, the amount will simply be deducted from the bond. If he lives longer, it will be to his advantage but the ownership of the property will then vest in the State. If we do this it will not be necessary to make an amount of R750,000 available for the building of old-age homes because the State will then own these properties in which these old people can be accommodated. I would very much like the hon. the Minister to investigate this suggestion.</p>

<p>I want to mention another matter in passing. Last year the Department gave us the opportunity to visit Magaliesoord. I expected this matter to be raised by hon. members of the Opposition who spoke here about alcoholics. We had the opportunity of visiting Magaliesoord, an institution for the treatment of alcoholics, and I want to thank the hon. the Minister and the Department for what is being done there for these alcoholics. From 75 per cent to 80 per cent of those cases are fully rehabilitated after two or three years. The official at the head of that institution, Mr. Theron, runs the institution very efficiently. I want to mention his name specifically and say that the Department can be pleased that it has the services of a man of his calibre. I hope that more of those institutions will be established and that more money will be set aside for that purpose to safeguard all of us because it is quite possible that we may be injured in an accident, that we may be knocked down by a motor-car driven by a person who is under the influence of liquor. That work of rehabilitation will prevent accidents. It will also be of great assistance to many families and it will save the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department a great deal of money.

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>All that I want to say to the last speaker is that he has followed the line taken by most of us who want to improve things, but he must remember that our policy is not to remove the means test but to relax it until such time as we get a contributory pension scheme going.</p>

<p><span class="col_5691-5692" refersTo="page_179"/>I want to speak on certain aspects relating to military pensions. The war in Europe finished 19 years ago, and one would have thought that the struggle on behalf of military pensioners would have settled down to seeing that the amount of the pensions kept pace with the cost of living and the national standard of living. To a large extent this is true, but it is amazing what still has to be done. The last annual report of the South African Legion shows that in the five years from 1959 to 1963 they submitted 1,616 new applications for military pensions and lodged 809 appeals with the Medical Appeal Boards. Over the same period they obtained the following successes. Pensions awarded were 507, gratuities awarded were 112, and the number of pensions increased was 1,870. In addition, there were 1,591 appeals to the Pensions Appeal Board, of which the Legion handled over 95 per cent, and there were 303 appeals successful in greater or lesser degree. I give these figures to show how much alive this war pensions matter is, even after 18 years, and it shows how even at this late stage the effects of war service on health are still coming to light. At this stage I would like to pay a tribute to the Department in regard to their handling of these war pensions, a tribute which is very justly deserved.</p>

<p>Now, having said these nice things, it might be expected that I have no criticism of the Minister in his handling of war pensions, but I have. He is the only one who can deal with this matter. His fight is, of course, with the Minister of Finance, but I do suggest that the moment to stake his claim for his wards&#x2014;for they are his wards&#x2014;is now, in this era of great prosperity which has not, however, reached the pensioner. I want to deal with two matters in some detail. The first is the supplementation ceilings and the second is the ten-year time limit in the War Pensions Act.</p>

<p>In regard to these supplementation ceilings, I can do no better to explain what it means than to quote from a recent letter I received from the S.A. Legion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A supplementary pension is assessed by deducting the sum total of a man&#x2019;s basic pension and post-disablement earning capacity, or actual earnings, from his potential earning capacity, which the Legion contends is set at the very low figure of R900. Herewith an example:</block>

<table>

<tr>

<td><p></p></td>

<td><p>per annum</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Potential pre-disablement earning capacity</p></td>

<td><p>R900</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Basic pension for Europeans for 100% pensions</p></td>

<td><p>R400</p></td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td><p>Post-disablement earning capacity</p></td>

<td><p>R360</p></td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>That means that he will have R760 and the Pensions Department will give him a supplementary pension of R140 to bring the figure up to R900. The letter goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">We had hoped that the supplementation ceilings would be increased. To-day, as in 1942, the supplementation ceiling is R900, having regard to the man&#x2019;s basic pension plus supplementation. For the 100 per cent European pensioner, this means R400 basic pension and R500 supplementation. If, however, a volunteer is only a 60 per cent pensioner, then his basic pension is R240 and the supplementation, if he has a nil postdisablement earning capacity, can go up to R660, provided the two together do not exceed R900. The position of the Coloured and the Bantu is of course much better. They can get the maximum supplementation, plus basic pension, up to R900, and as you know, their basic pensions are R100 for the Bantu and R200 for the Coloured. The practical effect of the position as it is to-day is that we do not experience great difficulty in establishing a potential earning capacity of R900. The minimum wages paid to labourers, plus c.o.l.a., almost amount to this to-day. Where the thing works a little unfairly is that the postdisablement earning capacity is to-day assessed at inflated figures. Whereas in 1942 it might have been difficult for a man to earn, say, R60 per month, to-day people in sedentary employment such as liftmen can earn almost that.</block>

<p>The annual report of the Legion says this on this matter&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is gratifying to note that in regard to the Legion&#x2019;s request for increased supplementation ceilings, the Department confirmed that it was not necessary for the Legion to make further representation as this matter would be dealt with by the Department in due course.</block>

<p>We are very disappointed that it has not been dealt with this year, but I hope the Minister has decided to investigate this matter during the coming period because it is not fair.</p>

<p>Now, I want to revert to the ten-year time limit in the War Pensions Act. Under this provision any widow married later than ten years after the man&#x2019;s discharge and any child born after this ten-year period do not qualify for the allowances provided for those who were married or born before the lapse of this period of ten years from discharge. This provision has been removed from all other Commonwealth countries&#x2019; war pension Acts, and ours alone maintains this blot. Why should this be? The Legion has investigated the financial effects of its removal and it, together with the National War Fund, have traced 77 cases including 33 deceased volunteers affected by the 10-year limit. The number of dependants included in these cases was ten widows and 125 children who are not considered to be widows or children under the Pensions Act. Sir, I do not like saying this, <span class="col_5693-5694" refersTo="page_180"/>but to me this is inhuman. I cannot see the reason for not dealing with this matter. The reason cannot be the financial burden on the State, as it has been calculated by the Legion and the War Fund that if these ten widows and 125 children were brought within the purview of the Act and obtained the maximum benefits, the sum involved would not exceed R23,840 per annum, and that is a mere bagatelle. We have a tremendous surplus but we cannot look after these wives and children, and I say it is a shame.</p>

<p>Yes, but it is not much and no other country in the world still has this provision. If there is another reason for this attitude on the part of the Government, I hope the Minister will tell me. But I hope he will not say that death-bed marriages are the cause, because that is a matter which has been fully discussed in every country in the world, and it is perfectly simple to legislate in regard to death-bed marriages. I hope the Minister will tell us why he will not deal with this particular group of people who have such a justifiable claim on the country.</p>

<p>There is one other matter I wish to deal with in connection with war veterans&#x2019; pensions, and it is a matter the Minister should perhaps consider at the same time when he is dealing with the case of the 1914 rebels, because it is roughly on the same lines. The war veterans&#x2019; pension is after all only the old-age pension plus R8 a month, and at present South African servicemen who enlisted directly in Allied services during the 1939-45 War are not included in the definition of &#x201C;war veteran&#x201D;, as is the case with South African ex-servicemen who were seconded from the U.D.F. to Allied units. Secondly, the S.A. Legion has recently been advised that ex-servicemen who immigrate from Kenya, Tanganyika and the Congo are not now required to satisfy the normal residential qualifications when applying for war veterans&#x2019; pensions, provided they can adduce proof of their war service as set out in the definition of a war veteran in the Act. The Legion and every right-thinking person is behind the action of the Government in helping the men who come from those territories, but surely our own men who at the beginning of the war for some reason joined Allied armies direct&#x2014;naturally, mostly with the British forces&#x2014;should not be treated differently from these people who come here, and from our own people who were seconded to other forces. It is not just, and I hope the Minister will give this matter due consideration.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOORE</person>:</from>

<p>The subject I wish to discuss with the Minister is not one on which I wish him to reply now&#x2014;certainly not today, but it is one to which I should like him to give careful consideration. I feel that our system of accounting in pensions is outmoded. I refer especially to Item &#x201C;H&#x201D;, civil pensions. The total amount spent on pensions this year has been increased by R3,700,000, and of that amount R3,200,000 comes under one head, civil pensions. With the increase in the personnel of the Public Service and with increases in salaries, this amount will naturally increase. When I say our system is outmoded I mean that we should not say that a public servant will have a contributory pension scheme. His pension scheme should be non-contributory. Now I do not wish to have any confusion with the United Party policy, which is to have a contributory pension scheme for every citizen. I am speaking now of the State&#x2019;s own employees. It seems quite absurd to say to a public servant: Your salary will be R1,000 per annum, but of this amount 5 per cent will be deducted to be paid into a pension fund. The State will pay in another 5 per cent and the money will be invested. What do they do in other developed countries? The Minister has been overseas and I presume he is familiar with their systems. In any developed country the system is this: You tell the man not that his salary is R1,000 per annum, but that his salary is R950 per annum. The State guarantees him a pension according to the length of his service. Let me give a simpler example. Take the sailor or the soldier or the policeman or the airman. Why should we trouble these men with the amount that is deducted from their pay to be paid into a pension fund? The obvious thing to say to a sailor is: If you serve the State for 25 years, your pension will be assured. Then we shall delete from our lists of accountancy and our submission of accounts in this House the amounts in the pension fund. It is not necessary. We take money off and pay it into a fund and pay it out to the man later; and we need a big staff to do it. It is unnecessary. I make this plea to the Minister that in consultation with the Minister of Finance he should consider whether the time has not arrived to reform our whole system. Now, when would be the best time to reform it? I am now speaking of the timing and not the actual introduction of the system. The time would naturally be when the Government decides that it will raise the pay of public servants. That has to be done from time to time because we have depreciation of our currency. When it is found necessary to increase the salaries of public servants, that will be the time to say they can retain their present salary and the Government will now become responsible for the pension fund. They will be guaranteed a pension, and probably even their widows.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish to say that I am not suggesting anything revolutionary or novel. The servants of Parliament are on that system already. We passed the Bill this year for another group of public servants who are on a similar basis, the Judges of the Supreme Court. They do not have a pension fund either. They are told that when the time of their retirement <span class="col_5695-5696" refersTo="page_181"/>comes, they will get their pensions. I submit this scheme to the Minister for his favourable consideration, but I do not expect a reply now.</p>

<p>I just want to reply to a few of the points raised. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) asked about the supplementary pension scheme. I have taken a note of what he said and I give the assurance that it will be investigated. As far as the ten-year limitation is concerned, as the hon. member knows we have discussed that in Parliament over and over and I have given the reasons. Whether those reasons are accepted or not, all I can say is that the position in South Africa is still better than in other countries. These proposals require legislation and therefore we cannot really discuss it.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Brits (Mr. J. E. Potgieter) asked me about the granting of additional special pensions to the settlers at Sonop. He wanted to know why the settlers did not get it whereas the social pensioners did. That has already been granted. The settlers will receive it. In regard to the other matter raised by him I can only say that that is a matter that will have to be considered very carefully. You are not only dealing with the position at Brits but with the position at other places as well. There is a difference in that the settlers at Brits enjoy privileges which the tenant settler does not enjoy. They enjoy extraordinary privileges as settlers and that accounts for the difference in the allowance for children. In any case I shall again go into the matter thoroughly and see what can be done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Prinshof (Mr. Visse) asked what we could do in the case of a person who had disposed of his property. I have already said that we were considering that aspect in its entirety and that we shall consider ways and means to make concessions in this connection. The hon. member also made a specific suggestion. We have made a note of that although we are already doing something in this regard. I think I have now more or less replied to everything, Sir.</p>

<p>During the second-reading debate on this Bill the hon. the Deputy Minister made it quite clear that this Bill was intended to make provision for distributing electricity to South West Africa through Escom. I want to give two extracts from the Minister&#x2019;s speech. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On the basis of this legal opinion and with a view to the possible setting up of power stations, etc., in South West Africa, which is envisaged by the Electricity Amendment Bill, it is clear that no benefit from the setting up of such power stations, etc., will accrue to any industry in South Africa, and for this reason it is now being proposed that the principal Act be amended in this respect that South West Africa be regarded as being part of the Republic for the purposes of the principal Act and accordingly for the I.D.C. to do anything &#x2026;</block>

<p>Sir, we agree with that, and therefore we cannot accept the substitution in paragraph (h) of the words &#x201C;in any country or territory&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;outside the Union&#x201D; when the Bill is intended to make provision for the extension of electricity facilities to South West Africa.

<p>I want to support everything that the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) has said. The Minister tried in the second-reading debate to make great play of the fact that the hon. member for Kensington and I did not know the difference between &#x201C;South West Africa&#x201D; and &#x201C;countries outside the Union&#x201D;. There is no question about it that under this Clause 3 the I.D.C. can operate in any country outside the Republic. Our big complaint is, as has happened before, that industries have been started outside the Republic which finally were operating in direct competition with industries in the Republic. That is what we object to. We feel that this should be limited to South West Africa. The hon. member for Kensington has made many speeches here on the subject of a certain woollen company. We believe that this power should be granted in Section 3 in respect of South West Africa only; that we should not be left in the air, with the I.D.C. having the right, without reference to his House and without any parliamentary control, to assist industries in any other country anywhere in the world; it could be the Protectorates when they become independent, it could be Southern Rhodesia or any of the states to the north of us. We will then be told that the Minister has no authority to prevent the I.D.C. from assisting businesses in these other areas. That is why this amendment has been put forward.</p>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<p>Paragraph (h) of Section 4 of Act 22 of 1940 provides that the I.D.C. will have the right to have the corporation registered outside the Union. It has had that right since 1940. When the 1940 Act was introduced, when the United Party was in power, it specifically gave the I.D.C. the right to have itself registered as a company beyond the borders of the Union. The Government thought it necessary at the time to include such a provision in the Act. We are now asked to limit it to the Union and South West Africa. This right of registration which was given to the I.D.C. in 1940 will be radically curtailed. A drastic curtailment of that right is being suggested here. It was stated clearly during the second-reading debate why it was considered necessary to amend paragraph (h) by substituting the words &#x201C;in any country or territory&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;outside the Union&#x201D;, because although South West Africa is regarded as part of the Union for certain purposes, as far as registration is concerned South West Africa has its own company registration ordinance and we have our own. Separate registration therefore applies in South West and that will continue to be the position in spite of the law. Reference has been made to a company which operates in the Federation and which is registered there. The hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) has referred to a matter which has been raised in the past by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore). I take it the company to which the hon. member for Benoni has referred is &#x201C;Fine Wool Products&#x201D;. I can only say that I have a note here from the I.D.C. reading &#x201C;Fine Wool Products has no manufacturing activities in Rhodesia&#x201D;. That statement is therefore not correct. I still maintain that if we were to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Kensington it would amount to a drastic curtailment of the right of registration which has existed since 1940 and I can consequently not accept the amendment.</p>

<p>When the Escom Bill was under consideration this Session, a similar explanation was given on that occasion, namely, that authority was required to extend its operations to South West Africa. We have been brought under that impression in the case of two Bills. I cannot understand why the hon. the Deputy Minister should insist that we must say &#x201C;in any other country&#x201D;, when we objected to &#x201C;any other country&#x201D; where a subsidiary, Fine Wool Products, was established in Southern Rhodesia. They were able to compete with South African exporters. Here we have an industry wholly owned by the Government, the I.D.C., operating in Southern Rhodesia and competing with private enterprise in South Africa. I simply cannot understand why the Deputy Minister cannot accept &#x201C;South West Africa&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;any other country&#x201D;.</p>

<p>The position is very clear to me. The I.D.C. has had this right to register itself anywhere else since 1940. Why this curtailment of the power of the I.D.C.? The hon. member wants it to be clearly stated that South West Africa is also included. As the Act read the I.D.C. could register there but it is necessary to put it this way because it says in a previous section that for certain purposes South West Africa is regarded as part of the Union. The one is unrelated to the other. What the hon. member has suggested is a drastic curtailment and has nothing whatsoever to do with South West itself. It also applies to the activities of the I.D.C. outside <span class="col_5699-5700" refersTo="page_183"/>the borders of the Union. It amounts to a curtailment of a right the I.D.C. has had since 1940.</p>

<p><b>House in Committee:</b></p>

<p>On Clause 1,</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I would like to question this amendment because it has some features which I feel the hon. the Minister did not cover in his second-reading speech. When this Act was introduced into the House in 1962, the hon. the Minister of Economic Affairs said on the occasion of its introduction that the Inventions Development Corporation was a body established by public funds and that its duty was to make inventions available to people, not to make too much profit out of those inventions but that the Inventions Development Corporation should always receive a fair amount of such profits. When the Inventions Development Corporation was launched, it was launched with a capital of R200,000, of which R50,000 was taken up by the C.S.I.R. The hon. the Minister said in his second-reading speech that so as not to place the Inventions Development Corporation in any preferential position it would be subject to income-tax and to all the provisions of the Companies Act. According to the current report of the C.S.I.R., the 1963 report, page 34, the Inventions Development Corporation has had a successful year in some respects; that it had patent policies resulting in the establishment of new companies&#x2014;which is all to the good&#x2014;but in considering this amendment we must bear in mind the fact that the report of the C.S.I.R. paints a very gloomy financial picture of the Inventions Development Corporation. According to the balance sheet, instead of a profit there is a loss of R278. While some profits may perhaps be made in the future, it appears that it is necessary to extend financial relief to the Corporation at this stage. Is that the motivation behind this amendment? It was pointed out at the time when the Bill which is now an Act was debated in 1962 that the Corporation was liable under Section 12 (which this amendment covers) and Section 16 of the Act for precisely the same taxes as any other company and that any payment made to the C.S.I.R. shall be construed as the payment of a dividend, presumably so as to avoid payment of the undistributed profits tax. The amendment proposed here by the hon. the Minister will substitute for &#x201C;the payment of a dividend&#x201D; the words, &#x201C;any payment to the C.S.I.R. will be used by the research council for research purposes&#x201D;. Sir, while one feels that the purpose of the laboratories and the staff of the C.S.I.R. is to provide research facilities to the State and also to private enterprise against proper payment, I would like to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to explain to this Committee how he expects to get any money at all from this corporation, with its deficit of R278, for C.S.I.R. research, or is this word &#x201C;research&#x201D; being inserted instead of &#x201C;dividend&#x201D; purely for the purposes of tax phraseology? I understand that the reciprocity of this particular clause with the other ones is due to overseas taxation and not to any taxation that the Inventions Development Corporation would have to pay in South Africa, because presumably there would be no tax to pay since it showed a loss of R278.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) has referred to the insertion of the words &#x201C;be used by the research council for research purposes&#x201D;. The reason for that is to make it quite clear for overseas purposes that, as far as taxation is concerned, the object is not to make a profit but that any profit can be used for research purposes. This amendment is being effected so as to give the same facilities as those granted to similar companies overseas. The object is to remove any doubt and to state it clearly that any profit that may be made will not be used for the purpose of paying dividends but for research purposes. The hon. member also referred to the loss of R278. In the same report of the Council for Scientific Industrial Research they say the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">While your Board believes that the Corporation&#x2019;s direct expenditure in terms of administration, litigation and patenting costs can, on average, be met from royalty income, some form of financial assistance will be required to cover essential investment on development work to take inventions to the stage where industry can consider their manufacture. In view of the situation outlined above it is considered that the logical course of such financial support should be with the State.</block>

<p>Then the chairman says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5701-5702" refersTo="page_184"/>During the period 8 August 1962 to 20 February 1963 one invention was licensed to a South African firm, and since February a further two inventions have been licensed. These licence agreements, however, will not materially affect the Corporation&#x2019;s financial position.</block>

<p>In fact one of these patents has been sold overseas and it is expected to provide this company with a reasonable income after 1965. It is possible, therefore, that it may nevertheless be subject to taxation at that stage. It takes time sometimes before these royalties or other income from patents start coming in. We must therefore be a little patient before we shall have an income which will really be worthwhile.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned I was discussing the composition of the Mines Safety Committee. My view is that we should give representation on this mines safety committee for the 400,000 Bantu workers who are employed in the mining industry. I feel that representation should be given to the Bantu through a White representative on this committee, a representative who will specially look after the interests and the welfare of the Bantu workers in the mines. I am of the opinion that this would serve as a very useful and satisfactory bridge for the Bantu workers in their relationship with the mining industry. In the event of an accident these people will feel that they have somebody to whom they can make direct representation, to whom they can express their views as to the cause of the accident, and to whom they can put forward ideas with regard to means of safety that should be employed underground to prevent fatalities. Sir, it is for that reason that I move the amendment standing in my name&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 4, page 5, after &#x201C;mines&#x201D; to add and one of whom shall be nominated specially to represent the interests of the Bantu workers employed at mines.</block>

<p>The effect of this amendment will be that one of the representatives of the employees on the mine shall be nominated specially to represent the interests of the Bantu workers employed in the mines. I do not think this amendment presents any practical difficulties from the Minister&#x2019;s point of view. I think it can quite suitably be incorporated in Clause 3 and, as I have said, it will certainly serve a very useful purpose; it will give confidence to the Bantu workers and it will establish a very useful liaison.</p>

<p>Sir, under the same clause, I want to plead with the hon. the Deputy Minister once again to give representation both to the Underground Officials&#x2019; Association and to the Mine Surface Officials&#x2019; Association. These are two separate bodies. One represents the interests of the underground officials, and the other represents the interests of the surface officials. The representation of the daily-paid workers <i>vis-&#x00E1;-vis</i> the underground and surface officials&#x2019; associations is in the proportion of 55 per cent daily-paid workers to 45 per cent officials. In view of this proportion of employment, I feel that the Minister should give representation to one representative from the Underground Officials&#x2019; Association and one from the Mine Surface Officials&#x2019; Association. I think such representation would establish a very useful bridge between the officials and the underground workers and will lead to confidence in the mining industry as such. While on this question of mine safety, I would like the hon. the Deputy Minister to give consideration to the amendment standing in my name to the effect that &#x201C;a medical officer nominated by the Secretary for Health&#x201D; should be allowed to serve on this mine safety committee. Sir, in my opinion a medical man is absolutely necessary on this Mine Safety Committee, not only from the point of view of the physical health of the underground workers but also to study such factors as pollution of water, pollution of air and the many other problems that do arise in underground mining. I want to say that the substitution of a medical officer of health for the deputy Government mining engineer, as provided for in this clause, would be useful for another purpose as well; I think it is an anomaly to have both the Government mining engineer and his deputy serving on the same committee. One can envisage a clash of opinion, a clash of personalities, on a committee like this where you have the deputy Government mining engineer possibly disagreeing with his superior&#x2014;the Government mining engineer&#x2014;on questions of safety. It is for that reason that I think the hon. the Deputy Minister would be well advised to delete &#x201C;deputy Government mining engineer&#x201D; and to substitute &#x201C;medical officer of health.&#x201D; I think with all due respect that it would be better to have on this mine <span class="col_5703-5704" refersTo="page_185"/>safety committee a medical officer of health nominated by the Secretary for Health.</p>

<p>Sir, I have some difficulty in understanding the reason for the appointment of a committee of experts with specialized knowledge to assist the Government mining engineer. You are going to have the analogous position of the Government mining engineer being advised by a mine safety committee, who in turn will be advised by a panel of experts with specialized knowledge, and then under the next clause, Clause 4, we have another special committee who will advise all these other committees in the event of the closure of a mine or in the event of accidents or fatalities. I anticipate the danger here that the Government mining engineer is going to find himself merely in the role of a figurehead, because in the end, if an accident takes place on a mine, who is going to accept the responsibility? Each one of these committees will try to pin the responsibility on to somebody else. The hon. the Deputy Minister will remember that the Marais Commission, which went into the question of safety on the mines, recommended that the Government mining engineer should have more authority and personal responsibility in order to be able to act quickly and to make his own decisions. I am concerned about the machinery that we are establishing here with all these advisory committees and panels of specialists, with special committees who in turn will advise them; I am afraid that we are going to have a very unsatisfactory position developing if nobody knows just who has to accept direct and personal responsibility in the event of an accident. It is for that reason that I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to accept these two amendments standing in my name, and also to give us some indication as to what would take place, with these various specialized committees, if you should have an accident similar to the one that took place at Coalbrook. Who then is going to accept the responsibility and to whom will the Minister look for some authoritative statement? Sir, I do hope that the hon. the Deputy Minister will advise us on these matters. Will he also tell us what would constitute a quorum; who would lay down the procedure to be followed by these advisory committees and panels of experts and the special committee? When would they meet; what would be the intervals between the meetings? Finally, I should like to get the Minister&#x2019;s views whether he does not see a danger&#x2014;with this whole series of committees&#x2014;that the Government mining engineer may find that he has no direct responsibility in his very important and responsible position. I therefore move my amendments&#x2014;</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to support the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog). I said in my second-reading speech that I thought it was absolutely essential for a medical officer to be on this mines safety committee. I cannot imagine any mines safety organization functioning without the help of a medical officer. The various mining companies employ medical officers who are experts in this particular branch of work. It would be very easy to nominate a very efficient and helpful person to serve on this committee. Sir, it is not only from the point of view of accidents that it is necessary to have a medical officer on this committee. I wonder whether the hon. the Deputy Minister has considered how necessary it is for a panel of experts to give expert advice on the conditions prevailing in the asbestos mines. People do not realize to what risks they are subjecting themselves in following this occupation. We have pointed out before that the chances of a person working in an asbestos mine contracting carcinoma of the lung or of other parts of the body are very great. I think the time has come, when we talk about safety on the mines, when we should go a stage further than to think simply of accidents which take place through falls of rock, or accidents that take place on the surface through the mishandling or the breakdown of machinery. We must go further and think about the dangers of exposure to gas, to silica, to asbestos fibres, to coal dust and so on. For that reason I think it is quite obvious that the amendment put forward by the hon. member for Springs is an absolutely essential amendment. Furthermore, there is the question of liaison between the research worker and this mines safety committee. I think here again the medical officer can be the link between these two groups of people. With regard to the question of the deputy Government mining engineer being on this committee in addition to the Government mining engineer, I agree with the hon. member for Springs that it is unnecessary for the deputy Government mining engineer to serve on this committee. The hon. the Minister has already made provision for an alternate member on the committee. Surely the deputy Government mining engineer should be the alternate to the Government mining engineer. That would leave an opening for the medical officer. I think we must take these things into consideration. As far as a representative for the Bantu workers is concerned I am sure the hon. the Deputy Minister cannot object to that. He may have difficulty in deciding who would be the best person to represent the Bantu. But in that regard he has the recruiting agencies, the welfare officers on the mines, with whom he can discuss this matter, and I think a very good choice can be made from the very excellent people who act as public <span class="col_5705-5706" refersTo="page_186"/>relation officers for the Bantu who work on the mines. With those few words I again want to ask the hon. the Deputy Minister please to accept the amendment moved by the hon. member for Springs. It can only do this committee a power of good.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I move the amendment as printed&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 33, page 5, after &#x201C;appointed&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;on such conditions of service and&#x201D;; and in line 46, after &#x201C;Engineer&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;and at such remuneration as he may determine in consultation with the Minister of Finance&#x201D;.</block>

<p>As the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) has said the officials know a great deal about mine safety. I wish to point out, however, that this committee to be established is not a technical committee. Nor is it presented as a committee that will consist of technically highly trained people. The object of this committee is to deal with objections which may come in from all quarters. Underground conditions form only one of the aspects this committee will be concerned with. When technical problems present themselves it will be possible for this committee to call in the best technical assistance on that particular subject. There is nothing to prevent that. As a matter of fact I expect them to call in technical assistance often. The committee is a platform where interested parties can discuss their problems. Its constitution was decided upon after very thorough discussions with all interested parties. We feel that to change it will only create fresh problems. It was felt that the necessary balance would be established if the Government mining engineer acted as chairman assisted by three representatives as suggested here.</p>

<p>The workers do not always regard the officials as people whose interests are identical with those of the underground workers. They rather regard the surface officials as representing the mine owners. That is unfortunately the position. As I have said, after this matter was raised by the hon. member on a previous occasion, it was referred back but it was felt that we should leave the position as it was. The parties agreed to that. If we were to change its composition it would lead to a long discussion and it would probably not be mutually acceptable.</p>

<p>The hon. member also asked that one of the members should represent the Bantu workers. As far as safety on the mines is concerned, the workers regard themselves as representing all the workers. They do not differentiate between the White workers and the Bantu workers. Where it is a question of safety it is the safety of everybody. They do not think it is necessary to make special provision. It would be extremely difficult to say that one particular member should represent the Bantu workers on the mine because safety affects everybody, not only the White workers. There is not one type of safety for the Bantu and another type for the White workers. Seeing that their interests are identical, therefore, I think as the committee is constituted at the moment, the interests of the Bantu will also be looked after.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the mine safety committee and that somebody with a special knowledge of health conditions should serve on it. This amendment was proposed in the Other Place. I undertook there that I would refer it back to the mine trade unions and the mine owners for discussion. That has been done. The Government mining engineer has gone into this question of having a medical man as one of the members, but after consultation with the Chamber of Mines and the mine trade unions they recommended against it. The Government mining engineer and the mine trade unions and the mine owners not only regard the appointment of a medical man on the committee as redundant but also as undesirable. The representatives of the mine owners and the trade unions on the committee will not be appointed on the strength of their technical qualifications. The mine trade unions in particular think that no professional man should serve on the committee, a committee which is really intended to be a body representative of the Government, the mine owners and the mineworkers, to keep a general watch over conditions and anything which in the opinion of the committee is unsatisfactory from a safety and health point of view. Any problem that arises can then be referred to experts in that particular field. The committee must serve as a forum where matters of policy flowing from dissatisfaction about safety and health conditions can be discussed. In that way the committee can assist in maintaining a good relationship between the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s inspection division, the mineworkers and the mine management and thus also exercise control over safety and health conditions.</p>

<p>It will be extremely difficult to select one medical man to cover this whole field of occupational diseases on the mine, because the field that has to be covered is tremendously big. The Peter Allan Commission of 1949 already pointed out how wide that field was. Not only do you have occupational diseases but there are others as well. You have the question of the affect of artificial ventilation, temperature, dampness, mine dust, water in the mine, radiation, fumes from explosives, the amount of work done, depth, etc., the prevention of heart complaints, deforming joint infection, bone infection, skin infection, kidney complaints, chronic respiratory complaints and other diseases. It will indeed be a difficult task to appoint one medical man on this committee to cover this wide field. The suggested mine safety committee is not intended to be a research body. The pneumoconiosis <span class="col_5707-5708" refersTo="page_187"/>research unit under the C.S.I.R. was established for that purpose. This unit attends not only to pneumoconiosis but also to other mine diseases and the whole complexity of factors as they exist in the mines and which have an affect on the health of the mine-worker. This mine safety committee will be at liberty to consult any medical or other professional person at any time on questions of mine safety and health. Whether such professional persons are members of this panel of experts or not makes no difference. They can call in any assistance to help them in this connection. Where it is the opinion of the parties we have consulted, after this matter was raised in the Other Place when the Bill was introduced, that they do not want a medical man, I think we should abide by that.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to refer in particular to the last point raised by the hon. the Deputy Minister, i.e., that section of the amendment which deals with the appointment of one member who is a medical man as moved from this side of the House. I could see the hon. Minister&#x2019;s argument if the wording of this clause was different. I would like to draw his attention to the fact that under sub-section (a) of the new 2<i>bis</i> the duties are laid down and it says &#x201C;to advise the Government mining engineer on the supervision to be exercised over mines in terms of Section 2 or on any thing or practice which affects or is likely to affect the safety or health of persons employed at mines&#x201D;. I agree entirely that with regard to the question of safety this is a broad-based committee. I must say, however, that in regard to the important question of health, if this committee is to advise on subjects of health, there should be a medical man on the committee and the committee should not merely be dependent on the gathering of evidence or opinions from other persons. I believe if you want to establish a committee who can effectively advise on matters of health there should be a medical man on it. I do hope the hon. the Deputy Minister will be prepared to reconsider the views he has expressed. This is called a Mine Safety Committee. It is really a Committee of Mine Safety and Health. That is clearly its responsibility. I really believe it cannot do its job effectively in respect of the second leg of its terms of reference, namely, health, unless it has a medical man as a member. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>We all feel very strongly about the general question of health. Ample provision has already been made as far as health services are concerned. As I have already said, we have the mine doctor himself, there is the Pneumoconiosis Research Unit, there is the South African Medical Research Institute, the Bureau of Doctors, the Minister&#x2019;s medical advisers and the Pneumoconiosis Risk Committee whose members include one doctor. I am trying to show that the question of health covers a very wide field and that it would be impossible for one doctor to cover the entire field. We have had the opportunity to discuss this matter fully with these people and it is their express wish not to have a doctor on the committee; I am sorry therefore that I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>Amendments proposed by Mr. Taurog put and negatived and amendments proposed by the Deputy Minister of Mines put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 4,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>This clause deals with the powers of the inspectors in the event of the closure of any mine as well as with &#x201C;anything or practice calculated to cause bodily injury or anything injurious to the health of any underground worker or anything which may cause damage to property&#x201D;. I think the hon. the Deputy Minister will admit that these are very wide and very important powers that we are giving to an officer of the Department of Mines. The closure of a mine is a very serious matter indeed, and consequently I should like to ask the hon. the Minister whether he is aware that in terms of the wording of this clause, the power to close down a mine is being given to &#x201C;any&#x201D; inspector. In Clause 4 (2) (a) it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">When any such inspector finds at any mine or works that anything or practice &#x2026; is calculated to cause bodily injury to, or be injurious to the health of any person &#x2026; he shall give notice &#x2026; and such notice may include an order suspending operations at a mine or works or part of a mine or works.</block>

<p>I do not think it could have been the intention that these extensive powers be given to &#x201C;any inspector&#x201D;. &#x201C;Any inspector&#x201D; in terms of the definitions in the principal Act means among others &#x201C;an assistant inspector&#x201D;. Now, this is a very, very junior inspector, whose salary grade runs from R2,850 and R3,120. Accordingly I should like to urge the Minister not to give these extensive powers to such a junior inspector in the Department of the Government mining engineer. I should like here to remind the hon. the Deputy Minister what happened as a result of the closure of a mine at Witbank a number of years ago and which was referred to by the Marais Commission. At that time a junior official, but senior to an assistant inspector, ordered the closure of one of the coal mines, unjustifiably as events later proved. This resulted in a loss to the mining company concerned of about R250,000 per day. Therefore I am worried if <span class="col_5709-5710" refersTo="page_188"/>it is the Minister&#x2019;s actual intention to give these wide powers to a junior official. Consequently I should like these powers to be limited to at least a chief inspector or deputy inspector. That will have the effect of giving the mining industry and the people associated therewith, more confidence than will be the case if the clause, as it now stands, goes through. There is a very serious shortage of staff in the Department of the Government mining engineer through our inability to attract to that Department suitably qualified men. Now we are going to have the situation where an official earning a salary of R2,850 per annum will have the power to order the suspension of the workings of a mine. I think, we should agree to this only with the greatest reluctance.</p>

<p>I should also like to refer to the special commission referred to in Clause 4 (3). Now, what is going to happen in the event of one of these junior officials recommending the suspension of operations at a mine? At the moment the Government mining engineer has the final say in any such appeal. I agree that he should have the final say on whether a mine should suspend operations or not. It is proposed now, however, to give that power to a special commission to be appointed by the Minister. Once again I feel that we are taking away other important powers of a highly specialized and knowledgeable Government mining engineer to give it to a special commission in order to enable it to investigate any appeals. There will of necessity always be a serious time lag with regard to the appointment of such a special commission, whereas at the moment the Government mining engineer can investigate any matter straightaway without any financial loss to the industry concerned and all that which goes with the suspension of operations at a mine. If I may be allowed to make a suggestion to the hon. the Deputy Minister, I should like to suggest that in order to overcome the <i>hiatus</i> between the decision to close a mine and the time before this special committee is appointed, the Minister should agree that two members of his Mine Safety Committee with the necessary technical and specialized background should be permanently appointed to constitute such a special committee for the investigation of such matters referred to it by any inspector of mines where there are unsatisfactory conditions existing in mines, or where there is to be a suspension of operations. That would be more practical than the method suggested in this clause with its attendant delays in the appointment and constitution of such a special committee.</p>

<p>I should like to know the hon. the Deputy Minister&#x2019;s reaction to this suggestion which, I must assure him, has been put forward by people with a lot of knowledge of the mining industry as such. These two factors, i.e., the power given to a junior inspector to suspend operations at a mine, and the time lag which must necessary follow the suspension and the hearing of an appeal, will lead to serious trouble in the future. Once again I should like to emphasize that the authority of the Government mining engineer in this respect should be restored. It should not be whittled away as is being done in this clause.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I think we can come to an agreement on this matter. The words in this clause which we do not like are those appearing in Clause 4 (2) (a), namely&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and such notice may include an order suspending operations at a mine or works or part of a mine or works.</block>

<p>If these words were deleted, it would mean that any inspector would have the power to point out to the management of a mine what was wrong in its mine. After that the inspector would be obliged to report the matter to the inspector of mines. So I think that if these words were deleted, we would meet the objection of the hon. member for Springs. Could the hon. the Deputy Minister give this suggestion his favourable consideration?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>Hon. members have referred to the wide powers which have been given to inspectors, particularly in regard to the closing of a mine. But none of them has referred to the right of appeal to the Government Mining Engineer. In this connection Clause 4 (4) reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Due notice of appeal shall suspend the operation on any notice given under subsection (2), unless the Government Mining Engineer, or any other officer deputed thereto by him, if of the opinion that any delay in giving effect to such notice would be immediately dangerous, directs that effect be given to such notice forthwith.</block>

<p>There is authority therefore to act immediately. On the one hand there is the power which is given to inspectors to close mines but, on the other hand, an inspector must, in terms of sub-section (2) (b), submit a copy of such notice to the Government Mining Engineer so that the latter will be aware of the circumstances. Although the order may be issued by a junior official, he is, after all, the person who has made the investigation and who is therefore able to judge whether any dangers exist at a particular stage. If he regards those dangers as being of such a nature that the mine, or a portion of it, should be closed, he can order accordingly. As I have already indicated, there is the right of appeal to the Government Mining Engineer. If such appeal is lodged, the order for the closing of the mine is immediately suspended and will remain valid until such time as the Government Minine Engineer orders otherwise. The danger that the closing of a mine may result in unnecessary loss therefore does not exist because <span class="col_5711-5712" refersTo="page_189"/>the necessary provision is made for an appeal to the Government mining engineer. I just want to point out that this was recommended by the Marais Commission after the commission had inquired into the Coalbrook disaster. Paragraph 116 of the report of that commission reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The innovations introduced by the proposed amendment of the Act would be as follows: (a) All appeals would be to a commission (continued to be called &#x201C;Special Commission&#x201D;) and no longer to the Government mining engineer or someone designated by him; (b) notice of appeal would, as is now the case in England but has never been in this country, normally at once suspend the order issued by the Inspector; but (c) cases are conceivable where the immediate execution of the order would be imperative in the interests of safety. In such a case the inspector would have authority to order immediate execution, whether an appeal is noted or not. Before doing so, however, the inspector would be required to direct his mind to the question whether the carrying out of his order, despite the notice of appeal, would have far-reaching effects on the mine and/or the national welfare. If he is of the opinion that serious consequences would flow from the execution of his order, he is obliged to refer the proposed notice to the Government mining engineer, who would have the power, under the new sub-section (4), to require the immediate enforcement of the proposed order, despite any notice of appeal and despite the serious consequences the order will or may entail. The Government mining engineer may, of course, decide that the danger apprehended by the inspector is not so immediate that the matter cannot follow the normal course, that is that the order be automatically suspended pending the result of the appeal proceedings.</block>

<p>Hon. members will note therefore that this recommendation has been taken over word for word.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs also referred to the permanent committee. We are quite prepared to give effect to the recommendation that a permanent committee of this nature should be established. Indeed, I can appreciate the necessity for having a committee of this nature which will then be able to give immediate attention to any matter that may be referred to it.</p>

<p>Clause put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 6,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>This clause deals with inquiries into accidents on mines. Here again we have the following strange wording in subsection (4), i.e.&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where any organization of workers at any mine or works, or the head of a State Department &#x2026; submits a request &#x2026; for an inquiry.</block>

<p>Can the hon. the Deputy Minister indicate what type of investigation the head of a State Department, other than the Government mining engineer or one of his inspectors, can ask for? Here again we have the introduction of outside persons into a highly technical division, where one does not want to see unwarranted interference in the efficient operation of the Government mining engineer&#x2019;s department. This is an aspect with which the Marais Commission also deals. I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister once again what type of investigation the head of a Government Department can call for other than investigations called for by the Government mining engineer? I raised this matter on a previous clause, but then the hon. the Deputy Minister did not reply on this point. For the sake of the record, he should indicate to us what he has in mind. He should clarify the obscurity which surrounds this provision as it now reads.</p>

<p>I am at the same time pleased to see in this clause that the unfavourable practice which existed in the past&#x2014;in terms of which a report was submitted direct to the Minister thereby ignoring the Government mining engineer completely&#x2014;is now going to be stopped. The previous practice led to a great deal of unsatisfactory features, as was pointed out in the report of the Marais Commission. What is more, it was <i>ultra vires</i> the law at the time that the Minister should have been able to get reports and complaints direct from inspectors of mines, i.e. over the head of the Government mining engineer. As I said, I am pleased to see that this unsatisfactory feature is now going to be eliminated. With that I hope there will no longer be any political interference with the working of the Government engineer&#x2019;s department by any Minister of Mines or other person directly connected with politics. Therefore I should like to commend the hon. the Deputy Minister for having accepted this very important and vitally necessary recommendation of the Marais Commission on this point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I just want to point out why provision has been made for this right to be given also to the <span class="col_5713-5714" refersTo="page_190"/>head of a Department. The Department which is referred to here is the Department of Bantu Administration and Development and the reason for this provision is that no trade unions exist through which the Bantu can operate. That is why this provision is being made for the right to be given to the head of a Department. The hon. member said that he hoped that this would not lead to political interference. I want to point out that the Marais Commission found that the reason why the mineworkers approached the Minister was because they could get no satisfaction from the inspector in terms of paragraph (11), nor from the then Government mining engineer. It was only after they had gone that far and had got no satisfaction that they approached the Minister. This was the finding of the Marais Commission. That was when the Minister intervened and when the Minister intervened the strike was called off. It was therefore a very serious situation. There was no political interference; they approached the Minister because they were unable to get satisfaction. We can also refer to paragraphs (14) and (15) which point out that certain requests were refused and that the unrest and friction continued to increase. The trade union ceased to have anything to do not only with the Government mining engineer but with the district inspector under whose inspectorate the gas mine fell. In December 1959, an inquiry was requested and once again this request was complied with by the Minister. This proves that a dangerous situation had arisen. The relationship between the mining trade unions and the chief mining inspector was not what it should have been. This matter was rectified at a later stage, as the commission also discovered. It is wrong therefore to suggest that the intervention of the Minister of Mines at the time was based purely on political grounds. It was because of the unhappy relationship between the mining trade unions and the Government mining engineer that it unfortunately became necessary for the Minister to intervene at that stage.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>In this clause I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to the remarks I made about allowing rescue workers to overdo the work they perform during an emergency. Once again I want to ask him if he will please make sure that regulations are made, so that no rescue worker shall be allowed to work for more than four hours at a stretch, after he has been on shift for eight hours. I do not know whether that is clear, but the clause says that no person shall work more than two consecutive shifts underground, except in an emergency. After that I would suggest that the Minister makes sure that no person works for more than four hours in any 12 hours to do rescue operations. The dangers are far too great to the rescue workers.</p>

What does &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D; mean? Does it mean within 100 yards of the main shaft. or three miles? I particularly want to know because it has been the practice of mines to erect married and single quarters and recreation halls within the vicinity of mine workings, but we do not have a definition of &#x201C;vicinity&#x201D;. I should like to know whether the Minister is going to lay down a radius within which none of this type of building may be erected.

<p>The hon. member wants to know what the distances must be. He spoke about three miles but I do not think he was serious in saying that. The position is that it will differ from mine to mine. It depends upon the depth of the mine. This provision is being inserted mainly because of the cave-in at the Premier Mine, which showed that it was necessary to impose these restrictions in the case of open mines. It will depend upon the depth of the mine and upon the nature of the rock.</p>

<block name="quote">In line 26, after &#x201C;voter&#x201D; to add &#x201C;and cancel the original ballot paper issued&#x201D;.</block>

<p>This is of a technical nature. When a postal vote has been issued to a person, and there is a possibility that that postal vote will not return to him again, the voter will then have the right to go to the returning officer and to declare that he did not receive the postal vote. Then the returning officer will have the right to issue a new postal vote to him. The Bill as it stands at present, unfortunately does not make provision for dealing with the original ballot paper, and this amendment merely states that the original ballot paper must then be regarded as cancelled.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. member is quite correct when he says that this merely clarifies the position. In my opinion this amendment is unnecessary in view of the provisions of Clause 19, for in that clause provision is made to ensure that a voter will not be able to change his vote. The hon. member will recall that Clause 19 deals with the position when there are two declarations of identity and two applications, and then the returning officer must consider the application that arrives first; and in sub-sections (a) and (b), if he has satisfied himself that both are those of the same voter, he then deals with the one bearing the earlier date, and that is then the lawful one. But if they differ, he deals in terms of sub-section (b) with the declaration of identity in accordance with the provisions of Section 56<i>ter.</i> If we were to make this amendment, the cancelled ballot paper could not be tested here to ascertain whether the voter had changed his vote. I think this will open a door so that political parties will again have an opportunity, after a voter has voted, to go to that voter and try to persuade him to vote differently from the way he voted in the first instance. It is our object to eliminate this very malpractice. We think sufficient provision has been made in Clause 19 for cancelling one of the ballot papers he sent in. I think the hon. member will appreciate my explanation and I hope he will withdraw his amendment.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I appreciate the argument of the hon. the Minister in connection with the possibility of the political parties trying to persuade the person to change his vote after he has already voted, but as I see the matter, this provision is not aimed at the person who <span class="col_5717-5718" refersTo="page_192"/>has voted already, but at the person who has asked in his application that his ballot paper should be sent to Cape Town for instance, but who in the meantime may have changed his mind and gone to Durban instead of Cape Town. He arrives in Durban and he may go to any presiding officer and request that a new ballot paper be issued in his name, if the first ballot paper has already been forwarded to Cape Town. In that case he has not voted on his original ballot paper; he then votes on the new one, but the original one still remains an unused valid ballot paper; it is not cancelled, I quite agree with the hon. the Minister that where a person has already voted, he may not cancel that vote and vote a second time; that is a different matter. If he has voted already, if he has already used his original ballot paper, he cannot apply again, because he may not vote a second time in any event. Once he has voted, the law provides that if he votes a second time on a second ballot paper issued in his name, he commits an offence. When applying for a new ballot paper he will probably have to state in his application&#x2014;I am assuming that this will be provided by regulation&#x2014;that he has not voted yet. But then another person may go and vote on his original ballot paper; he can then go and apply, provided of course he can identity himself, and that is admittedly a protection. But we are possibly leaving the door open to malpractices here and we do not know what may happen in a case where a postal vote has been issued to persons with the same name. I do not know either, e.g., when the picture on the identity card of the hon. the Minister was taken, but there are few people whose appearance to-day resembles a photograph taken years ago. [Interjections.] I am not referring to myself, but a person&#x2019;s appearance may change in course of time, and in that event it is possible that a person may be able to abuse an issued ballot paper. This amendment merely proposes that when the new ballot paper is issued to a person who has not yet voted, the original should be cancelled, for in terms of Clause 19 the first issue counts; when two votes are returned, the first one counts, and if the genuine voter has voted on the second one, the first ballot paper is still counted. Clause 19 (2) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where a returning officer has received two covering envelopes from the same voter he shall &#x2026; (a) deal with the declaration of identity bearing the earliest date.</block>

<p>This means that if the actual person has voted on the second issue, but his signature has been realistically forged on the original one and that second person has succeeded in proving his identity to the presiding officer, then this original one still counts, notwithstanding the fact that the real voter has voted on a second one. I really do feel that the hon. the Minister ought to give a little more attention to this matter. I quite agree, in view of the reasons he has given, that we should not insist upon the amendment if the position in fact were as he has stated, but that is not the position; the danger is just the reverse; the danger is that somebody may misuse unused votes. There is another possibility, too, and that is that the original ballot paper, even if it is not used, may lie around and not be returned to the presiding officer or the electoral officer before the election is over. Who can say what has been taken out of that envelope in the meantime? The ballot paper itself or the declaration of identity could easily be removed from that spare cover, as it becomes now, and it may be abused. It is an offence, admittedly, but surely it is better to prevent the offence than just to hope it will not take place. So I hope the hon. the Minister will reconsider this matter.</p>

<p>I do not think the hon. the Minister should accept this amendment. It may certainly have the effect the hon. the Minister is afraid of. It will bring about what we have had in former years, namely that if a voter signed an application with an Opposition party then we would go to him and then he would sign a new application and then he writes over the form of application: &#x201C;I hereby cancel my previous application.&#x201D; It was just another way of trying to get the man&#x2019;s vote on your side. I believe that we shall in any event have many of these cases, but if we were to make it still easier for people, we shall have an endless stream of people who have had their applications dealt with by a certain political party, and who have cast their votes, but just because an Opposition party thinks that the people may have voted wrongly, or not for the party to which they really belong, they go along and they take the people to a neighbouring returning officer to apply for a second ballot paper there. It will put an endless amount of administrative work upon the shoulders of returning officers and it will increase the number of postal votes enormously. I do not think the hon. the Minister ought to accept this amendment.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) is, of course, completely wrong. If he wants to argue as he has just argued then he must move for the deletion of the provision for the issue of the new ballot paper, because this is not a new application; the person has already applied, and this clause provides that he can ask that the ballot paper for which he has already applied be sent to a different address. It is not a new application. If the hon. member wants to prevent the evil to which he has just referred, then he must delete this provision entirely and say that having once applied the person cannot apply for a ballot paper to be sent to a new address. But the provision is here; we weighed up the position very carefully and we decided that there were in fact many occasions where one would be justified in reissuing a ballot paper; for example, where the ballot paper has been delayed through the post or where a person has had to move to a different address through sudden illness or for some other reason. There are many of these grounds which would justify <span class="col_5719-5720" refersTo="page_193"/>the request for the ballot paper to be sent to a new address or for a new ballot paper to be issued if the original ballot has already been sent out. If the original ballot has not gone out then naturally it would be sent to the new address. If it has already gone out then a new ballot paper will be forwarded to the new address. We accept that that provision is necessary. Having accepted that position, all we are now asking is that there should not be two ballot papers in circulation for the same person in the same election. That is the sole purpose of our amendment. It is not to enable people to change the original address but to deal with an emergency situation and to prevent exploitation. We find that provision is made that the returning officer must be satisfied that a ballot paper issued in respect of an absent voter has not been or will not be returned to him within the prescribed period after the date of issue thereof; the voter submits to him in person during his working hours a further application to vote as an absent voter; the voter must come to the returning officer and explain the situation to him, and the presiding officer must be satisfied. If you have to go through that whole procedure then I cannot see how on earth political parties are going to persuade people to go and apply in person and think that they are going to gain any advantage by doing so. There is no advantage to be gained because they will be voting in front of the returning officer and they will be appearing in person. That is all we are trying to deal with here. If I am wrong I hope the Minister will correct me, but as I read the clause the voter goes along and applies in person for a reissue but his original ballot paper is still valid until the count. We are asking that the original ballot paper upon which he has not voted should be cancelled.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I think the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) is really concerned with two matters here. As regards the one matter, he conceded that there is a possibility that political parties may, after an application has been lodged, again try to persuade the voters; the hon. member conceded that in his first speech. As regards the second point, the hon. member has once again used the same arguments he used before. That point is covered by Clause 12, which has already been passed by us. Clause 12 deals with &#x201C;Documents to be sent or delivered in respect of absent voter&#x201D;. The hon. member will find that in (4), (5), (6) and (7) the whole procedure is set forth as to how, eventually, there may be a cancellation of the one document so that there will not be two of them in circulation, as the hon. member put it here. Adequate provision is made for that. Take the case he mentioned first, namely the case of a voter who has given an address in Johannesburg, and who now suddenly moves to Durban. Such a voter may himself telegraphically cancel a ballot paper already issued, and apply for another. The hon. member has, however, raised a few new points and I shall undertake to reconsider the matter and if necessary I will move an amendment in the Other Place to meet the hon. member&#x2019;s arguments, but at this moment I am absolutely convinced that we are not opening the door to abuse.</p>

<p>I move these two amendments and I propose to deal with them separately. With regard to the amendment which appears in the name of the hon. member for Yeoville, the hon. the Minister has confirmed the principle in his second-reading speech and in his reply that the parties are to act as watchdogs (&#x201C;Wag-honde&#x201D;) in respect of postal voting. We are moving this amendment with the object of ensuring that where a vote is cast before one of these special polling officers and official witnesses, the party shall have the opportunity to be present and to oversee that activity. There is another provision, but it appears to us that the provision made elsewhere does not cover the particular position in terms of (2). The presiding officer must advise the authorized representative of the issue, but we want to make it quite clear that the polling officer must also invite the representatives of the candidates to accompany him. I do not know whether I need to argue this further. Does the Minister wish to hear further argument?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the accepted principle was put in the first place to the commission and accepted by the commission in regard to the need for the political parties to play the role <span class="col_5721-5722" refersTo="page_194"/>of watchdogs so as to obviate abuses. That principle is established throughout this Act. As we understood the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech, that principle was to be incorporated into the procedure when voting under 56<i>sex,</i> but as I read the clause it has not in fact been incorporated. It applies in other circumstances; it applies, for instance, to the issuing of ballot papers where the parties are represented, but here we have a person who is coming to vote; a polling officer has been appointed, an official witness is appointed; it is merely a question of a telephone call and in most cases that is done in any case. The candidates, if they wish, may then attend. We are not saying that they must be present; we are saying that they must be invited to attend and give them the opportunity to do so. I will leave the matter there until I have heard the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply. I move on then to the first amendment. Here we have the position that any presiding officer for absent voters who has received an envolope containing ballot documents, can merely say, &#x201C;I am unwilling to act&#x201D;, and the magistrate to whom he makes that statement must then appoint another presiding officer for absent voters to administer that vote. Let us assume that a justice of the peace, for example, says, &#x201C;Ek gaan nie hier die Nat-stem administreer nie; ek is &#x2019;n Sap&#x201D;. All he has to do is to say that he is unwilling to handle that vote; he need not give any reason for his refusal. [Interjection.] It may be a United Party J.P. or it may be a Nationalist J.P.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>There is no provision that he must give a reason for his refusal. The clause merely provides, &#x201C;Who is unwilling to do it&#x201D;. We accept that if he cannot do it he should be excused from performing this duty, but we do not accept unwillingness as a reason for refusing to carry out his responsibilities. After all, he does not have to move out of his office; the voter has to come to him; the voter must go to the presiding officer during normal office hours. There is no reason whatsoever why a presiding officer, who can advance no valid reason for his refusal, should be excused from carrying out this responsibility. Our amendment would ensure that he may notify a magistrate of his refusal and the magistrate, if he is satisfied that the reasons advanced are valid, may then excuse him. That means that he must argue his case for refusing to accept the responsibility. We leave it in the discretion of the magistrate to decide whether his reasons are valid or not. We feel, particularly since we have presiding officers who are not subject to the discipline of the State, that that protection should be inserted so that if a person who is acting as a presiding officer receives a ballot paper he will be obliged to carry out the duties attached thereto unless he has a good reason for refusing to do so. I shall be grateful to hear the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s view in regard to those two points.</p>

<p>Sir, while I am on my feet we have no amendment in this regard but on page 17, in the English text, the office hours are referred to as being &#x201C;from 8 o&#x2019;clock in the forenoon to 6 o&#x2019;clock in the afternoon of any day&#x201D; during which a person who cannot attend before a presiding officer may then ask for this special provision to apply. Government offices are normally open from 8 or 8.30 a.m. to 4 or 4.30 p.m. or at the latest 5 p.m. We v/ould like to know why provision is being made here for the hours from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. because it may well be that a person cannot make that declaration during those hours. He may be working from 8 o&#x2019;clock to 5 o&#x2019;clock; there is a presiding officer available from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. but he cannot make use of this provision because his working hours coincide with the working hours of the presiding officer, hours which are in fact shorter than those specified in this clause. We should be grateful if the hon. the Minister will elucidate that position.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>To begin with the last point raised by the hon. member, I just wish to say that we have fixed the hours in this way for the very reason that public servants who normally work until 5 p.m. will be able to act as presiding officers to assist voters. The hon. member knows, of course, that a police station may be visited at any time, even at one o&#x2019;clock in the night. Provision is made here for longer hours for these presiding officers, but the hon. member also knows that provision will be made for the payment of additional allowances to these people. Whereas the ordinary public servant works eight hours a day, provision is made here for a working day of ten hours.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Will the offices be open until 6 o&#x2019;clock?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, they will be open. Then I come to the two amendments proposed by the hon. member. In the first place he proposed on behalf of the hon. member for Yeoville that the agents should be invited to accompany the polling officer, together with the witness. That amendment is not acceptable to me, and I shall tell the hon. member why it is not acceptable. This amendment proposed by him places the onus on the polling officer and the official witness to contact the political parties and to notify them: &#x201C;We are going now and we invite you to accompany us.&#x201D; It amounts to that. If the hon. member will look at Section 56<i>sept</i> (1) (c) he will see that it is already provided that the presiding officer &#x201C;shall advise the authorized representative of every political party referred to in sub-section (1) of Section 56<i>sex</i> of the delivery of the voter&#x2019;s envelope and the name and address of the polling officer&#x201D;. Under sub-section (1) the presiding officer goes so far as to notify the political parties that he has referred an application from So-and-So, a person residing at such-and-such an address, and that he has <span class="col_5723-5724" refersTo="page_195"/>sent him a voter&#x2019;s envelope together with the requisite documents. If this amendment is accepted, the onus is immediately placed on the polling officer to get in touch with the office of the political party. Hon. members know what frequently goes on in an electoral office; there are always a lot of people in the office; the telephone rings incessantly; a young lady answers the telephone; she quickly notes down the particulars but she has hardly done so when somebody else comes along, and she forgets the first message taken by her on the telephone. Then the political parties allege that that polling officer never notified them. No, if this amendment is accepted there will be a continuous stream of complaints, mainly perhaps as a result of the organizational difficulties prevailing in such an electoral office. I feel this way about the matter, and I feel very strongly about it; The political parties have been notified of the name and address of the person, and it is now for the political parties to contact the voter in question and to tell him, particularly if it possibly means a vote for those political parties: &#x201C;We want to accompany you when the polling officer comes along to take your vote; at what time did you tell him you were going to vote, and on what day?&#x201D; The other political party is then welcome to do the same thing. If we adopt this procedure we shall place the onus where it belongs. We are already assisting the political parties tremendously, but I think if we were to go as far as the hon. member now proposes, we would eventually be making only retired people of those who expect the State to do everything for them, and even then they would still have an opportunity of saying that they never received the message. That is what I am afraid of; I am afraid there will then be the charge that you have not been notified because the polling officer is a United Party or a Nationalist supporter. I think the hon. member will appreciate this difficulty if he has regard for a moment to what goes on in an electoral office, particularly during the last few days; the telephone rings incessantly and that polling officer, with his witness, will find it difficult to contact the political parties by telephone. He must not fetch only one vote; there are a large number of votes and he first has to notify the political parties, because the law enjoins him to do so. I regret I am unable to accept the amendment.</p>

<p>The second amendment amounts to this; that all the people we have mentioned in Clause 1 who may possibly become presiding officers, should be obliged to act as presiding officers unless they are unable to do so; they have to give reasons why they are unable to do so. Now, among these persons there are justices of the peace too. I would have had no objection if all of them were only public servants, but there are justices of the peace amongst these people too who, because of the position they occupy, perhaps as employees, cannot act, and in whose case it is not desirable that they should have to divulge their reasons. The justice of the peace may be a businessman; it may be that as a businessman he may be known to a certain section of the electorate as a member of this or that political party; it may be that he as presiding officer may have to handle mainly the votes of members of a certain political party. People will then say at once: &#x201C;There the cat is out of the bag; he is a United Party man&#x201D; or &#x201C;He is a Nationalist&#x201D;. The person may be a farmer, and as a farmer he might say that it is impossible for him to go and sit in an office for 21 days from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; that his work and his circumstances do not permit him to do so.</p>

<p>We do not think it is necessary for him to give reasons as the hon. member proposes. We think we should leave the person at liberty to say: &#x201C;I am not willing&#x201D; or &#x201C;I cannot&#x201D;. When he says that, we say: All right, then you do not do it, because we want willing people. As regards the officials, there is no danger that they will refuse, as it is a duty imposed upon them by the law. I regret that I shall not be able to accept this amendment either.</p>

<p>I should like to ask the hon. the Minister to give some consideration to the amendment of the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw). The hon. member&#x2019;s proposal to omit &#x201C;who is unwilling or is of the opinion that he is unable&#x201D; is obviously wrong. The inability of the presiding officer may very well lie in his subjective state. The examples quoted by the hon. the Minister are good examples, such, e.g., as the justice of the peace who for business reasons does not wish to involve himself in the matter. But to prevent justices of the peace from just refusing point blank makes me think that he should be able to give the magistrate good reasons, and the magistrate, who is then satisfied that the reasons are well-founded, then gives the vote to another presiding officer. The fact remains that we are imposing a serious duty upon this whole broad list of presiding officers referred to in the Bill. I should be very sorry if we were to create the position that a presiding officer could summarily say &#x201C;I am not prepared to handle this vote. I hand it to the magistrate and he must look for another presiding officer&#x201D;. I think there is a good deal of merit in the suggestion that the magistrate should be satisfied that the unwillingness of the presiding officer is based on a sound reason. I do not wish to press the Minister for a decision on the matter now, but I shall be glad if he will gives his serious consideration to this matter and perhaps introduce an amendment in the Other Place.</p>

He can perhaps put it this way that if the parties apply to be present they should have the right to be present. But the right to be present when the returning officer and his witness go to that person to record his vote should not be taken away. The hon. the Minister said the voter would know exactly when the returning officer and the witness would come to him but I think the hon. the Minister is wrong. I think the party should be allowed to go to that voter and if that voter is in the condition in which a voter usually is when he has to vote at home or in the hospital he will not be in a position to inform the party and not one of the parties will know when the voting is to take place. I think the hon. the Minister should reconsider this. It is an important principle. The parties should be able to be present. That is the type of problem that can rouse suspicions and I do not think the hon. the Minister should push it aside so lightly.</p>

<p>I just want to deal with what the hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S. Steyn) has said. I want to point out that this has no reference to public servants. We have a Public Service Act and public servants are compelled to subject themselves to it. If an obligation is imposed on him in another Act he has to carry it out. He has no choice. He cannot say he is not prepared to do that work. This only refers to justices of the peace. All the other officials were discussed with my colleagues and all of them have legislation under which they have to do it. I cannot force a private person if he has good reasons. Why should I compel him to advance good reasons? Why should I do that? He can only declare himself as being unwilling. That was the category which hon. members opposite were against. In other words, that is the group of persons whose numbers can dwindle if they declare themselves unwilling to act as presiding officer or, as the hon. member has said, if they were of the opinion that they were unable, to act as such an officer. A public servant may perhaps say: &#x201C;I do not regard myself as able to do it; I do not see my way clear to do it,&#x201D; or &#x201C;I have so much work to do that I cannot attend to more members of the public&#x201D;. Let me give an example. It may be the station-master of Johannesburg who is very busy. He may say: &#x201C;Humanly speaking it is simply impossible for me to do so.&#x201D; There are other categories of persons on that station who can be approached. In such a case one would be reasonable and try to have regard to somebody else&#x2019;s difficulties. But it is not a question of a public servant declaring himself unwilling. He has to do it; the law provides that.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) again raised the question of giving notice. I am sympathetic towards that idea. I know that is how it works in practice but I really do not see my way clear to provide for that in the law. I give this undertaking that in his instructions to electoral officers the chief electoral officer can tell them that as far as practically possible they should make it a rule to inform political parties that that person will vote at such-and-such a time at such-and-such an address. I think we can make that concession but to insert it in the law as an obligation will simply cause an endless amount of trouble to the offices because of the facts I have already mentioned, namely, that it will simply not be possible for the electoral officer to contact the busy party offices.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>There is another matter which is not quite clear to me and which I shall be glad if the hon. the Minister would clarify. It appears from the provisions of the Act that in future we shall really be dealing with two types of immobile voters. The one is the immobile absent voter who is indeed mobile but who cannot go to a polling station due to the nature of his work. Then we have the <i>bona fide</i> immobile absent voter. That is the person who is an invalid, the person who is physically in such a state that you cannot bring him to the polling station. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will not consider making provision for these people, by way of regulation, so that they, instead of applying for a postal vote, can authorize the presiding officer in their application form to vote on their behalf for candidate So-and-So. They should be allowed to mention the name of the candidate. In other words, a vote by proxy. [Interjections.] Yes, I know it is a new idea. But I can tell you, Mr. Chairman&#x2014;and my colleagues will agree with me&#x2014;how complicated and difficult the position becomes when you come to a person who sits in a rocking chair and who cannot sign his name. That person can nominate somebody&#x2014;a young boy or girl or a member of the family&#x2014;to sign the application form for a postal vote on his or her behalf. That second person then has to declare his identity. That person then takes the application form to the presiding officer or posts it and ultimately the postal vote is issued. When the public servant who can in future act as a presiding officer goes to that person that youngster who signed on the voter&#x2019;s behalf is perhaps at work. That presiding officer then has to go to his place of employment because the two people have to be brought together&#x2014;the immobile voter and the person who signed the application form on his behalf. The public servant must bring those two people together. Take the case of a blind person who goes and votes at the polling station. That person records an open vote. He gives instructions to the presiding officer and the voting chamber is cleared.</p>

<p>I again want to raise the question of the presiding officer who may perhaps be unwilling. The hon. the Minister will remember that justices of the peace were brought in especially because there may be huge areas where there may only be a few people who can act as presiding officers. I envisage the position, particularly in the Cape Province, where there will be one justice of the peace to serve a huge area and he decides not to take charge of the voting. He then has to inform the magistrate that he is unwilling and the magistrate has to appoint somebody else. The first-mentioned presiding officer must then send the documents to the second one so that he can have the vote recorded. I have an idea the election will be over by that time, particularly when I think of a constituency like Namaqualand. It all depends on the circumstances in which the presiding officer refuses. He may refuse under the most awkward circumstances which may mean that the voter will perhaps not be able to record his vote on election day. If the hon. the Minister can give us the assurance that that will not happen I shall be glad.</p>

<p>I just want to draw the attention of the hon. member to the fact that it does not mean that a presiding officer can do the work for a certain period and then suddenly refuse to carry on. He gets appointed as a presiding officer and he can refuse to accept the appointment. Once he does the work he must have very good reasons not to continue. He must become ill or he may be involved in an accident. And there is provision for that. In that case the State must specially send another presiding officer there. This concerns his appointment.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, it says here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Powers of magistrate in respect of certain voters&#x2019; envelopes: If a voter&#x2019;s envelope is received by a presiding officer for absent voters who is unwilling or is of the opinion that he is unable to act as such &#x2026; he shall without delay give notice accordingly to a magistrate.</block>

<p>When a presiding officer is functioning he is a presiding officer and he cannot in the meantime summarily refuse to act. Then the magistrate can send an envelope to any person referred to in Clause 1 as being a presiding officer. It is not necessary for him to appoint <span class="col_5729-5730" refersTo="page_198"/>him; he is appointed in the Act. He is not officially appointed; he has already been appointed. The person says: No, I am not going to do it; nor am I even going to do this one vote. He returns the envelope. We give the assurance that a public servant cannot do anything like that. The only person who can refuse is a justice of the peace. We say it is just as well that the magistrate can determine which justices of the peace are willing to do the work under those circumstances and then he has to see to it that they do it. I do not envisage the difficulties hon. members do Let me put it this way: We are actually busy formulating an Electoral Act, an Electoral Act which we want to make as watertight as possible. I have taken due note of the objections. Give us an opportunity to ascertain what we have to do to ensure that it is water-tight and we shall rectify the position in the Other Place, always in co-operation with hon. members of the Opposition.

<p>Provided further that where the presiding officer for absent votes has submitted a statement to the effect that he has satisfied himself that due to operation, illness or deterioration in a voter&#x2019;s health he was unable to sign his normal signature as recorded on his original application, such signature shall be acceptable.</p>

<p>The object of this, as the hon. the Minister will know, is to overcome a difficulty. On many occasions a person applies for a ballot paper, particularly on the ground of illness or on account of old-age debility, but by the time they come to cast their vote, their health has deteriorated to such an extent that they are unable to sign in the same form in which they signed initially. There is often an argument about the difference in the signature. This amendment of mine provides that a presiding officer may attach a declaration made by himself to the declaration of identity after satisfying himself as to the facts connected with the position. I hope this will be acceptable to the hon. the Minister.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I am sorry but I am scared of this amendment. I am afraid it will open the door to abuses. When the returning officer takes a vote the voter signs another form. The returning officer has not got the original application form with him. He does not know how the voter signed originally; he does not know whether the signature has deteriorated or whether it is not the same signature. The two signatures are only compared the day the forms are opened. The returning officer is not in a position to give a certificate to the effect that the health of the person has deteriorated to such an extent that it has affected his signature. He may have been present when the voter signed the application form, but he is not a doctor. He cannot issue a medical certificate. The doctor who attends the voter first has to say: Look this person&#x2019;s health has deteriorated to such an extent that his signature is different from what it used to be, sufficient provision is made in the law&#x2014;that where there is any doubt to condone it the day the votes are counted. I am not worried about that. Those are exceptional cases. The game is not worth the candle to make special provision for the case where a person signs differently on account of a deterioration in his health. Let me give an example of the type of abuse which can take place. It is very easy for somebody to sign an application form on behalf of his old uncle or aunt. He imitates the signature as closely as possible. The day the uncle or aunt has to vote the signature is different. I want to exclude this possibility. Then I also honestly think that a person whose health has deteriorated to such an extent that there is an obvious difference in his signature is no longer interested in what happens to the country, although his vote may be of some value to the party. We really think we should not open further doors and make more concessions. We should rather cover all loopholes.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the hon. the Minister that we should be careful and not open the door to abuses. But there are cases, over and above those mentioned by the hon. the Minister, where a person has to undergo an operation, for example, or where something <span class="col_5731-5732" refersTo="page_199"/>happens to his hand. He signed his application form in the ordinary way but in the meantime something happens to him and when he has to record his vote his signature is different. I speak from experience because there is a big hospital in my constituency and we deal with between 300 and 500 postal votes in that hospital every election. There are not only a few of these cases; there are tons of them. I myself was in a position where I had to lie for weeks with my hand in mid-air. I could not sign anything. I wonder whether in such a case the Minister cannot provide that where a person originally signed an ordinary EF33 he can subsequently make a declaration to have it changed to an EF33A. An oath has to be taken. Although he originally signed the form, he should be able to reapply on a 33A form at a later stage if something has happened in the meantime to prevent him from signing that declaration himself.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>In Section 93 we are dealing with returning officers and presiding officers, and we have added &#x201C;polling officers&#x201D;, but we have not added &#x201C;presiding officers for absent voters&#x201D;. That is the second part of the amendment with which I am dealing now.</p>

<p>Now I want to come to the first part of the amendment, the question of intimidation or otherwise in a polling station. Section 114 does not cover this position as the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) seems to think. It makes it an offence under certain circumstances to try to influence a voter, to exercise undue influence. But to prove &#x201C;undue influence&#x201D; is a very difficult thing indeed! It is a person &#x201C;who directly or indirectly by himself or any other person makes use or threatens to make use of force, violence or restraint, who inflicts or threatens to inflict any injury, damage, harm or loss upon or against, or does or threatens to do anything to the disadvantage of any person in order to induce or compel that person to refrain from voting, or on account of that person having voted or refrained from voting at any station &#x2026;&#x201D; Here you have got an offence only to prevent a person by threat or by violence from voting. That is a question of refraining from voting, but we want to make it an offence to intimidate in any way, inside a polling station or during the casting of a postal vote. There are other provisions and there are regulations, but there have been cases, serious cases, where persons within a polling station, and certainly where postal ballots have been cast, have used influence upon a voter, directly or indirectly, to try to persuade him or her to vote, and we believe that that is a serious offence. It is not covered by the Act, and since we are recognizing the sanctity of the vote, and we are making a polling officer subject to this clause, we feel that we should take it further than that, and that we should make all presiding officers subject to these restrictions and at the same time make a provision that the presiding officer shall not exercise undue influences.</p>

<from><span class="col_5733-5734" refersTo="page_200"/>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think there is much objection to the points raised by the hon. member for Durban (Point), but it is a question here of proper legislation. In Clause 27 we are concerned with one thing only and that is forgery; we are not dealing here with fraud. The section in the Electoral Act dealing with fraud is Section 114, as the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) has already said. Section 93 deals with fraud in connection with ballot papers, with the forging of ballot papers&#x2014;with people who forge or counterfeit or fraudulently destroy any ballot paper or the official mark on any ballot paper. Section 93 is now being amended here by substituting another subsection for sub-section (1), and it is being amended with the specific object of combating fraud. But the hon. member now comes along with his amendment which deals with undue influence, a matter which falls under Section 114. It is fraud &#x201C;to try, by means of threats and intimidation or otherwise, to try to influence a voter to vote for a particular candidate or political party&#x201D;; that is what the amendment of the hon. member envisages. But that falls under Section 114, as the hon. member will see if he reads the section. Section 114 of the Act is not being amended in this Bill because we feel that it covers everything proposed here by the hon. member. But in any event I would not be able to accept his amendment here. It would be very poor draftmanship to insert this amendment in Section 93 when it actually deals with undue influence by means of threats, etc. It is something which does not belong to Section 93; it belongs to Section 114. If the hon. member had come along before the second reading and said that we should also amend Section 114 by adding these things, there might have been an opportunity to do so, but I do not think the hon. member should insist on our passing such badly drafted legislation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I agree that Section 93 deals more with fraud than with undue influence but I do not agree with the hon. the Minister that Section 114 covers the position, because Section 114 only relates to persons who try to force somebody to vote or not to vote. The English text reads, &#x201C;In order to induce or compel that person to vote or refrain from voting, or on account of that person having voted or refrained from voting at an election &#x2026; is guilty of an offence&#x201D;.

I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he does not agree that it is essential to bring about such an amendment, even if we do it under Section 114. We consider it absolutely essential to treat this as a very serious offence, and to say so in the most explicit terms.

<p>As far as the other amendment is concerned, I think the hon. member has suddenly once again looked at Section 114.

However, I shall make assurance doubly sure because I am in complete agreement that there should not be any threats that will intimidate or influence voters.

<p>On Revenue Vote No. 20.&#x2014;&#x201C;Interior&#x201D;, R1,880,000,</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>There is perhaps one ray of light as far as this Vote is concerned and that is that the hon. the Minister is one of the few Ministers who is asking for less money under his Vote than last year, namely R1,880,000 whereas he asked for R2,236,000 last year. I hope that large amounts will not be asked for in future Supplementary Estimates and that it will not be necessary, in this case at least, for the poor taxpayer to carry a heavier burden.</p>

<p>I wish to raise a few matters concerning the Publications Control Board. One thing which strikes you immediately when you look at this Vote, Sir, is that the publications Control Board cost more than twice as much to run this year than the old Censor Board. This Publications Control Board is costing us R55,000 this year while the old Censor Board only cost us R25,000. The chairman of the Censor Board received R3,000 and the chairman of this Publications Control Board receives R6,900 per annum, more than twice as much. I very much doubt whether this board was more than twice as efficient as the old board; and whether it gave greater satisfaction than the old board. We are asked to vote R10,000 this year for temporary assistants whereas it was only R6,000 in the past. That indicates that this board wants to and is interfering to a greater extent with censorship in South Africa.</p>

<p>I think we were all surprised last year when we saw the names of the people who were appointed to the Publications Control Board. We knew who the chairman would be and at that stage already we expressed our concern in that regard. But it was not only this side of the House who expressed concern. Concern was expressed throughout the country by prominent writers and complaints were also aired in newspapers and bodies supporting the Government in regard to certain aspects of the composition of the Publications Control Board.</p>

<p>Let me deal with a few of those aspects. Firstly, of the 11 members appointed no fewer than nine are Afrikaans speaking and two are English speaking. In other words, in a country where you have two major language groups divided roughly into 60 per cent against 40 per cent, there is nearly a 85/15 per cent division between the Afrikaans-speaking and the English-speaking section on this particular board. I make no apologies for objecting to that. I am Afrikaans speaking, but as an Afrikaans-speaking South African I believe the Afrikaner should treat his English-speaking fellow citizen on an equal footing and that was not done in the case of the appointments to this board to which only two English-speaking and nine Afrikaans-speaking persons were appointed.</p>

<p>Are they all bilingual?</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>I accept that they are all bilingual. Here we have a peculiar new yardstick, Sir. In other words, as long as a person is bilingual and he is Afrikaans speaking, he can be appointed in preference to an <span class="col_5737-5738" refersTo="page_202"/>English-speaking person even though that English-speaking person is also bilingual! I fully understand why that hon. member is satisfied with the board, because there is another complaint about it and that is the lack of balance between university representation from the north and the south on this board. For example, two lecturers from Potchefstroom and two from Pretoria were appointed to this board and only one from Stellenbosch and one from the Cape Town University. We realize that the Government considers the Cape Province to be of very little importance, but has the Cape Province&#x2019;s importance dropped to half that of the Transvaal where appointments of this nature have to be made? I represent a Transvaal constituency and am proud of it, but I believe that the provinces should be treated on an equal footing and they were not treated in that way as far as the appointments to this board were concerned.</p>

<p>You now want to exploit provincialism.</p>

<speech by="#malan">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>No, I want to avoid provincialism, and I want to prevent twice as many from the north as from the south being appointed. I do not even know whether any appointment has been made to that particular board from the Free State or Natal. But that is not all. When we look at the names, we have every reason to say that at least six of the 11, or rather six of the 10 members, because the other one is a woman, are associated with the Broederbond, that secret organization. [Laughter.] We know of the secret instruction that has been issued that when the Broederbond is mentioned in this House, there must be laughter. It is clear that that organization&#x2019;s influence in the Publication Control Board is far too strong.</p>

<p>We should like to learn from the hon. the Minister how many instances there have been since the establishment of this board, where ferreters, to call them that, have lodged complaints with the board in connection with publications in South Africa. I am convinced that a great many of the complaints were of a petty nature. I should like to know how many there were and how many were ignored, and to what extent a witch hunt of this nature did perhaps succeed. I think many of the complaints raised last year by prominent writers and artists in South Africa about this Publications Control Board have proved to be well-founded. I know the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker) said that most of the 130 writers and 55 artists who objected to the legislation last year by way of a petition were of lesser importance, but we also know that a very prominent young lady, a writer, Ingrid Jonker, said her father&#x2019;s allegation was ludicrous. I think what Professor Rob Antonissen said last year has indeed proved true. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I think this board is extremely dangerous for the simple reason that it opens the door to abuse, even worse abuse than undesirable literature. To give one example: Will members of the proposed Censor Board always be competent to judge what is undesirable and what is not? Will they always be competent to judge what is art and what is not? Or will artistic values not be taken into account? It amounts to this that the opinions of a few people will be held out to the entire nation as the holy Gospel. Is that healthy? Any nation must know what is happening around it. This law makes that impossible.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, before the board was appointed and I am convinced that had those writers seen the names of the people to be appointed they would have been shocked to realize how few real writers and real artists would be appointed to the board. You can go through the names, Sir. There are professors, there is a magistrate, there is a former inspector of schools, there is a music teacher, there is a former chief magistrate, etc. but only one or two of them have contributed anything worth mentioning to the literature or culture of South Africa and in saying that I am perhaps very generous. I want to go so far as to say that this board does not even keep the Minister fully informed as to its activities. Earlier this year I put a question to the Minister. I asked whether the board had placed any ban on films dealing with evolution and his reply was &#x201C;no&#x201D;, but in a supplementary question I pointed out that the Publications Control Board had indeed, a few weeks previously, published a statement in the <i>Government Gazette</i> that certain educational films were exempt, except those dealing with evolution. There are other similar cases. This board does not meet the needs the Minister hoped it would. [Time limit.]</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>The speech of the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) deserves to go down in the annals of Parliament as a new low in the field of what passes for criticism. I also want to remind the hon. member that the odium of an attack of this nature upon the hon. the Minister clings not only to the person of the hon. member&#x2014;I know he is used to making this sort of odious attack; it does not worry him and he is quite happy acting in this way&#x2014;but also to the whole of the United Party. Not only has he shamed himself but he has shamed the whole of the United Party as such. What was his criticism? He said that a Publications Board had been appointed to maintain a certain moral standard in South Africa as far as local and foreign publications were concerned. He <span class="col_5739-5740" refersTo="page_203"/>was able to express no criticism whatsoever of the success that the board has achieved in its task of maintaining the moral standard which it is necessary for the board to maintain. He did not try to give one single example to show that the board has allowed publications which should have been condemned to come into the country or has condemned publications which should have been passed. What was his criticism? In the first place he criticized the chairman of the board. Let me say, not only on behalf of this side of the House but on behalf of the whole of South Africa and on behalf of the vast majority of those people from all branches of the arts who protested against the setting up of the Publications Board before the board was established, that the chairman of the board is a person who is completely acceptable to South Africa and her writers. Some of the leading lights amongst the 130 people who lodged that objection declared after Professor Dekker had been appointed that they were reassured and satisfied in regard to the operations of the board. Now that the board has been functioning for a year, those writers have re-affirmed the fact that they have full confidence in it.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>I am speaking now of eminent figures like N. P. van Wyk Louw, D. J. Opperman and other leading writers. I am not speaking now of the obscure sweepings of the side streets to whom the hon. member referred. I am speaking of people with a high moral authority in South Africa, people who acclaim the appointment of the chairman.</p>

<p>The hon. member also made an inane attack upon the question of the composition of the board on a provincial basis. He said that there were more Transvaal members on the board than there were Cape members. Has this country really not progressed any further than this petty approach of trying to arrange all matters on a provincial basis? Are there no practical considerations in this matter, considerations to which that party gives no thought whatsoever, through the medium of their thoughtless mouthpiece, such as the fact that certain work has to be done in Pretoria and certain other work has to be done in Cape Town and that the administrative seat of the board will from the nature of the case have an effect upon the question of the persons who will be prepared to serve on the board? Does the hon. member know who the people in the southern provinces were who were asked to serve on the board, people who for geographical reasons could not accept appointment? He must not talk such nonsense here.</p>

<p>But the hon. member then made the most ludicrous statement of all when he said that the northern universities had been given preference. If this party could be accused of being pupils of the Oaktown University, there would perhaps be some ground for that complaint. But the hon. member for Orange Grove has actually accused this party of having given preference to the northern universities. Obviously this is again as a result of the purely geographical consideration of where the work must be done. We want to congratulate the hon. the Minister most heartily indeed on the appointment of his Publications Board as far as the geographical distribution of its members and their qualifications are concerned. We want to make it known that the board&#x2019;s first year of operations has been a highly successful one, not only because the United Party has been unable to attack it in any way&#x2014;that party does not have the power or the insight to be able to attack anything. We want to declare that the work of the Publications Board has been a gigantic success because no accusations have been made against it from any artistic circles in South Africa on the grounds of a wrong decision on its part. We are grateful that the board has pursued its difficult task with circumspection. We say that no attack of any importance has been made against the board in connection with film censorship, although certain remarks have been made in this regard in the Press on a few occasions. <i>I</i> noticed that on each occasion when initially critical reports were published in regard to a decision of the board, the film critics of the newspapers concerned all agreed at a later stage that those films had been quite rightly passed. In other words the public, the experts and the creative section of the community who have dealings with the Publications Board have had no criticism to offer of the work of the board during the past year. They have expressed appreciation for the work that has been done and we appreciate the work of the hon. the Minister in this connection. We are so pleased that the United Party has to content itself with petty criticism passed by a petty member.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Kempton Park (Mr. F. S.

Does he remember the names of some of these people?</p>

</speech>

<p>I did not refer to all of them as such.</p>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Then we must refer to Hansard again as usual! If this had been glossed over and nobody had said another word about it, that would have been exactly what the hon. member said, but now I draw attention to it and I ask particularly that the Afrikaans Press should publish his exact words, referring to these 130 people who made representations, being in some cases outstanding artists and authors and creative workers, some of whom have lent lustre to this country, and to Afrikaans&#x2014;he referred to them as being &#x201C;opskraapsels en uitwerpsels uit die systrate&#x201D;&#x2026;[Interjection.] I think that for a gentleman who has been referred to as a potential candidate for Cabinet honours, this is a horrifying statement to make. I have the privilege of knowing at least a dozen of these &#x201C;opskraapsels en uitwerpsels uit die systrate&#x201D; personally, and I leave it to them to deal some day with the hon. member for Kempton Park.</p>

<p>But let me deal with some of the activities, or perhaps lack of activities, of the Publications Control Board. Recently, I asked certain questions of the Minister of the Interior and I received certain replies. I asked whether any conditions or restrictions are imposed in regard to the age of the persons excluded from admission at performances of films at cinemas and drive-in theatres, and if so, what conditions and restrictions, and how and by whom are they enforced. The reply received was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Board does not consider films in relation to their exhibition in drive-in theatres or otherwise. All conditions and restrictions imposed on any film applies to the exhibition of such film wherever it is shown. The usual age conditions imposed are those excluding persons between the ages of four to 12, four to 16, four to 18 or four to 21, as the case may be. The onus of observing these conditions rests with the exhibitor and can be enforced by the police who receive a copy of all conditions or restrictions imposed by the board.</block>

<p>Therefore, since I was referred on 17 April to the police, I addressed a question to the hon. the Minister of Justice&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(1) What steps are taken by the S.A. Police to enforce the conditions or restrictions imposed by the Board of Censors or the Publications Control Board in regard to the age of persons excluded from admission to performances of films when these films are shown at drive-in theatres?</block>

<p>The answer to that section of the question was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">On receipt of particulars of conditions and restrictions imposed, such particulars are immediately published in the <i>S.A. Police Gazette</i> for the information of members of the force, and drive-in theatres, as well as other cinemas, are visited regularly by the police in order to ascertain whether the conditions and restrictions are being complied with.</block>

<p>Fair enough. The second question was&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">How many prosecutions for the non-observance of such conditions or restrictions were instituted against (a) drive-in theatres and (b) conventional cinemas during each year since 1960?</block>

<p>The answer to that was that in 1960 in respect of drive-in theatres there were no prosecutions, and for the years 1961, 1962 and 1963 there were also nil. So for four years running the drive-in theatres of South Africa are given a pair of white gloves each! In regard to the conventional cinemas during each year since 1960, in 1960 there was one prosecution and conviction, and none in 1961, 1962 or 1963. In other words, between the drive-ins and the cinemas, during the past four years, and throughout the country, there has been one prosecution! When I asked the Minister of Justice to make a statement in regard to the matter, he said: &#x201C;The above particulars are self-explanatory.&#x201D; But are they? A few days ago, I went through one newspaper at random, and by looking at the advertisements I soon discovered why the Minister of Justice says the explanation is &#x201C;self-explanatory&#x201D; and why the Minister of the Interior seems to be very reluctant to make a statement in regard to the enforcement of the regulations. I would remind him that when we were debating certain aspects of the Publications Bill last year in regard to films, the Minister insisted that he had to have certain powers because he said the morals of the people were entrusted to him&#x2014;that ran like a thread through his <span class="col_5743-5744" refersTo="page_205"/>entire argument&#x2014;and some of the things that this Act was going to take care of was to ensure that &#x201C;no person shall exhibit in public or in any place any film which has not been approved by the board, and when the board approves such film it may append such conditions as to any persons or group of persons belonging to a particular group or race&#x201D;, and it deals with the question of age groups in regard to certain films. Then there is a long list of things which must determine the rejection of a film&#x2014;if it hurts religious susceptibilities or is contrary to the public interest or is indecent or obscene or offensive&#x2014;my time will not permit me to read the long list of evils with which this board can deal. But if you take a look at the advertisements in a newspaper, as I did a few days ago, this is what you find. A film called &#x201C;Irma la Duce&#x201D; is advertised, and everybody knows that its theme is based on prostitution. I am not concerned with whether prostitution is right or wrong, but the board says it is wrong. It is based on prostitution and it is shown at a drive-in, and in the advertisement they say: &#x201C;A story of passion, bloodshed, desire and death, everything in fact that makes life worth living.&#x201D; And then they say: &#x201C;To-night is the night for a drive-in.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Another drive-in showed another film to which a certificate is attached that it cannot be shown to persons between the ages of 4 and 12, and although there is this qualification about no children between 4 and 12 being admitted, it starts its advertisement by saying: &#x201C;Children under ten years free.&#x201D; Can you, Sir, explain to me how anyone who runs a drive-in can say that this film has been banned by the board in so far that it cannot be shown to children between the ages of 4 and 12, and can also say that children up to ten years will be allowed in free? We all know that the drive-ins are full of motor-cars laden with children under the age of 12 who see this kind of film. Here is a drive-in advertising a film called &#x201C;Showdown&#x201D;, and the advertisement says: &#x201C;For action-lovers&#x2014;gun-hot with evil&#x201D;. If you are under four, it does not matter if you see evil! &#x201C;Stormy with hate.

When &#x201C;Tarawa Beach Head&#x201D; is shown at the drive-in, it has below the title of the film in the smallest possible type, &#x201C;No Persons 4-12&#x201D;, but in the same newspaper, when it is advertised to be shown at a cinema in Muizenberg, there is no reference at all to any limitation on age.

<p>The hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) is one of the most pathetic figures. I want to voice my strongest objection to the methods he uses to blame and vilify honourable people.

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I do not know to which &#x201C;some&#x201D; he is referring now. The hon. member will recollect that there were also doubtful names amongst them, but that one of the objectors was no less a person than Professor N. P. van Wyk Louw, and great play was made of the fact that a man like Professor N. P. van Wyk Louw objected to the establishment of this board. Now the hon. member in this speech of his&#x2014;I know that the Chairman will call me to order if I really give it the name it deserves&#x2014;tried to blame and vilify Professor Louw and others to such an extent&#x2014;nobody in the country will of course take any notice of it, knowing whence it comes&#x2014;but I am compelled to tell the truth. In an open letter to the <i>Burger,</i> Professor N. P. van Wyk Louw said the following on 22 October in regard to the appointment of this board, and he was the man who spoke on behalf of the objectors, or the majority of them, the people who together with this side of the House want to combat pornography. I will not read the whole letter, but, <i>inter alia,</i> he says the following (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Perhaps we (the objectors) should also make a little experiment in regard to assessing our motives. Everyone can search his own heart for the reason for his objection. Was it opposition to every form of the control of literature, even the vilest, or against control by a board which perhaps now or later may consist of unexpert people, or the fear of a totalitarian equalization of all literature, as in Russia, or whatever other motives there may be, <i>inter alia,</i> that of obtaining a little facile publicity? Those who are opposed to all limitations placed on pornography, those who would like to have our country flooded with all kinds of vile publications from the whole of the world, those who want to upset our difficult balance by causing even more confusion, plus those to whom the names of prominent South African academicians are more unfamiliar than those of suburbs and slums of London, all of them have already said what they wanted to say about this board.</block>

<p>That is one of the hon. members to whom Professor Louw referred. He has said his say in regard to this board. He knows more about other things than about who the prominent academicians in this country are&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5745-5746" refersTo="page_206"/>Alas, we will always, or for a long time still, have such people among us, like the poor.</block>

<p>Yes, and alas, as long as there is a United Party, and alas, as long as there is still a place like Orange Grove, we will, alas, still have such an hon. member here, unless the voters of Orange Grove do wake up from their slumbers. Now Professor Louw says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as I personally am concerned, I feel that the responsible Minister should be congratulated on his choice of a chairman for the board and both, the Minister and the chairman, should probably be congratulated on the choice of the board itself. I am referring here only to those who are known to me, mainly the academicians, but they particularly have to deal with literature. I at least know that they, whether they bear Afrikaans or English surnames, are able to judge works in English and in Afrikaans, and in many more languages than the two official ones, against a wide background of world culture; that they can distinguish between pornography and literature or other graphic art forms which go beyond the ordinary sitting-room style of conversation or behaviour&#x2014;and in many sitting-rooms one finds very unusual conversation and behaviour. With the present board I think that our English-South African and our Afrikaans and Bantu literatures will be able to continue unhampered.</block>

<p>What has the hon. member done here? As the hon. member for Kempton Park has already pointed out, what difference does it make how many Afrikaans names and English names there are? In regard to the equal treatment of Afrikaans and English, the hon. member is living in a mediaeval era, where he wants to ascertain whether a Malan is Afrikaans- or English-speaking, and whether a Taylor is Afrikaans- or English-speaking, and if he does that he is lost. It is provided there that these academicians must be able, as Professor Louw put it, to judge any literature against the background of a wide world culture and to ascertain whether it is pornography or whether it is good for the country. But now the hon. member comes along with his petty arguments and asks how many of these people come from the northern universities, how many from the southern universities, how many have Afrikaans names, and how many come from Potchefstroom University of which the Minister is the Chancellor?</p>

<p>Even if all of them had come from Potchefstroom, I would still have had the courage to appoint them if necessary. The hon. member is adopting a petty attitude, which only he can adopt. He cannot do otherwise. We must forgive him. We have the poor with us and we have him with us, and he will never change. But I just want to say that I commend this letter to the hon. member, I want to ask him further whether he can mention the names of any objectors&#x2014;referred to in the letter written by W. A. de Klerk and a lady whose name I have forgotten&#x2014;who are still dissatisfied with the composition of this board. Seeing that he has made an attempt to besmirch these people, I challenge him now to have the courage to get up and tell me which of these 130 objectors who at the time objected to this board still object to it, except perhaps on doubtful grounds like those on which he himself objects to it. In so far as this board is concerned, I leave the matter there. I am quite happy and satisfied with these prominent figures in our country. I think they have succeeded in the first place in instilling the confidence that whatever is art will see the light of day, but not pornography. If the public perhaps does not agree with me, then I just want to remind hon. members of what I said when I introduced that Act. I said that the best judge would always be the public. They give the judgment; they lodge objections, and the legislator and the members of the board must take note of the objections coming from the public. If the public is not satisfied with any literature, then the court is there to decide; the opportunity is given to go even up to the Appeal Court. If a book is published and the public is not satisfied with it, they can have recourse to the courts. Eventually the courts will lay down yardsticks for us. Let us not try to discredit the members of the board in the eyes of the public.</p>

<p>The hon. member also raised the question of costs. He knows as well as I do that formerly we only had censorship of foreign material; only imported literature was censored by the old Censor Board. Here we now also have censorship of domestic literature. We now make great demands of the members of the new board, and they cost us more than the old board cost us. We need the services of these people and the costs are fully justified. Just let me give a brief summary of what they have already done. They started operating on 1 November last year. I opened the first sitting of the board. Since then I have obtained the following statistics, because I expected these allegations to be made here: They received 871 publications. Of those 871 they approved 403; they rejected 363 and 105 are still under discussion; 48 weekly and monthly publications have been banned from the country permanently. These publications are not just lightly banned because perhaps there is a picture of a nude girl on the front page. They are judged according to their content. Of these 48, 33 were cheap publications consisting solely of photographs of nude women, without any written articles. I have the names of those publications here, but I <span class="col_5747-5748" refersTo="page_207"/>would rather not mention them. Hon. members who are interested can find the names in the various <i>Government Gazettes.</i> I am just giving a summary. Thirteen of these publications are cheap sensational periodicals which mainly contain sex and murder stories, <i>inter alia, Action for Men, For Men Only, Heatwave, Paris Nights, Daring Romances, Police Detective,</i> etc. Two of those are periodicals containing communist propaganda aimed against the policy of this Government and the interests of this country. Among the periodicals banned there is also <i>Assegai</i> and <i>Ebony.</i> Then I come to the manuscripts of proposed publications submitted to the board: One was approved; nothing was rejected, and two are under discussion. Then there is resubmission of publications to the new board: There were five which had previously been rejected; in the case of two the prohibition was reaffirmed by the new board, and in the case of three the prohibition was suspended by the new board. Thus far there have been no appeals against any of the decisions of the board. Up to now only three scripts for the purposes of public entertainment have been submitted to the board. One of those was rejected because there was intermingling of White and non-White persons; one was approved subject to certain passages being deleted before being exhibited in public, and one is still under discussion. I am just giving this short summary to give hon. members an approximate idea of the work already done by this board. Hon. members should recollect that this board was appointed on 1 November only and really started functioning only as from the beginning of this year. I can give the House the assurance that this board, consisting of these prominent persons, does not just swallow anything; they make a thorough study of everything submitted to them before coming to a decision. I am impressed with the volume of work the board has already performed in the short period of its existence. The hon. member for Orange Grove made sneering remarks about certain members of this board, prominent members, who are not academicians. [Interjection.] The hon. member now objects only to the highly educated people. That is the result if one has uneducated people in Parliament; they simply object to all education.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member is apologizing. In so far as the censoring of films is concerned, there will always be a difference of opinion because tastes differ. What I am saying here now is also my reply to the hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel). I did not see the films mentioned here by the hon. member. I was shocked to hear what the hon. member said. On the one hand it is provided that children from four to 12 years of age may not see a certain film, but on the other hand one finds that all children under the age of ten are admitted free to drive-in cinemas. I must say that I was shocked, but I do not want to shirk any of my responsibilities. I think notice should be taken of all complaints submitted in regard to films which are harmful to good morals. I also think that the members of the Censor Board should be guided by what is said in this House, whether it is said by a member of the Opposition or by a member of the Government. They should take note of it. They must build up certain yardsticks, and they must take note of the fact that there are certain things the public does not like. One continually sees letters in the newspapers in which people complain about one or other film. I think one should encourage people to write such letters, so that we can see what the public likes or does not like. I do not want to evade my responsibility, but when once my board has decided that children of a certain age group may not see a certain film, that is the end of the matter as far as I am concerned; it then becomes a matter for the police, and I think the hon. member should raise this matter under the Vote of the Minister of Justice. I can only apply the restrictions which the Act allows me to apply. My board has certain powers under the Act and they in fact make use of those powers. They decide that certain films should not be shown to children under 18 years, and in other cases they perhaps determine that a film should not be shown to children under the age of 12 years. In other cases again they determine that certain sections should be excised. I cannot exceed the powers granted to me by the Act.</p>

<p>I want to take this opportunity to say in the first place that in so far as this Publications Board is concerned, the amount voted for it is not excessive; that the persons serving on it are recognized experts, and that hon. members who make themselves guilty of accusing this body or any of its members of inefficiency and lack of expert knowledge should be very careful, because there are no facts to support such an accusation. I am not going to take any further notice of criticism which is not based on facts, but if any hon. member can point his finger to a member of the board and say: &#x201C;That individual is inefficient and I ask you to dismiss him,&#x201D; then I will go into the matter. It is their privilege to do so and I will then institute the necessary investigation.</p>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to raise the question of classifications in terms of the population register, which is relevant to this Vote, on page 90 of the Estimates. I am concerned with the Minister&#x2019;s policy under this Vote. Sir, on 13 March I asked the hon. the Minister a question. I asked him what was the total number of adults still to be classified in terms of the Population Registration Act and how many of them were borderline cases as between White and Coloured and as between Coloured and Bantu. The Minister&#x2019;s reply was <span class="col_5749-5750" refersTo="page_208"/>extraordinary, to say the least of it. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There are no reliable statistics to indicate how many South African citizens and permanent residents there are in the Republic. There is a continuous stream of persons coming and leaving and it is not possible at any stage to give a reasonable estimate.</block>

<p>Well, if that reply is to be taken at face value then I suggest it is a very serious admission of administrative inefficiency. Are we seriously to believe that there is no means available to this Government &#x201C;at any stage&#x201D;&#x2014;to use the Minister&#x2019;s words&#x2014;&#x201C;of estimating&#x201D; or &#x201C;indicating how many South African citizens and permanent residents there are in the Republic at any one time&#x201D;? With great respect, Sir, I just do not believe it. Surely the hon. the Minister could have given me a reply based on the figures of the 1960 census because they have been available to us all for a very long time. The truth of the matter is that this information is readily available when it suits the hon. the Minister to divulge it. He told this House in 1962, of his own volition, that he still had to issue identity cards to 40,000 Whites, to 111,000 Coloureds and 108,000 Asiatics. If he had the answer then&#x2014;clearly he has it now. The first half of the Minister&#x2019;s reply suggested that neither he nor his Department took this question seriously, and I take exception to that. Sir, if you examine the second half of the question, what do you find? I asked the hon. the Minister how many White, Coloured and Bantu persons had asked to be reclassified since receiving their identity cards, to which the Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">No statistics are kept of persons applying for reclassification but only of persons who lodge formal objections against their classification.</block>

<p>Well, Sir, I wonder if the hon. the Minister can explain precisely what the difference is. If a person lodges a formal objection against his classification in one race group, then by implication, by a necessary process of logic, he wishes to be classified in another. I would like to ask, through you, Sir, what kind of answer the hon. the Minister thinks he has given to these questions? I think he underestimates the intelligence of hon. members on this side of the House if he gives us meaningless explanations of this kind in reply to perfectly valid and <i>bona fide</i> questions. Sir, the only serious attempt made to reply to my question was contained in the last paragraph in which the hon. the Minister said that for my information he would like to mention that no White persons had lodged objections but that the Department had received objections from 947 persons classified as Coloured and 2,986 classified as Bantu. Of course, no one in South Africa to-day objects to being classified as White. We are a privileged caste&#x2014;that goes without saying. But what about the 947 persons classified as Coloured who have objected to that classification? They are hardly likely to be seeking reclassification as Bantu, and they, I suggest, represent the hard core of border-line cases under this Act, I doubt if that figure of 947 represents anything like the sum total of these unfortunate and bewildered people, many of whom have suddenly come to realize the appalling consequences to them of the administration of this Act. Sir, the important thing is this: Now that the majority of the South African population has been issued with population identity cards, the Government itself forced into making what can only be described as arbitrary final decisions on the classification of those hundreds of unfortunate people who are neither one thing nor the other. We knew quite well that it would come to this in the end. Sir, I would like to ask the hon. the Minister a question: Could he tell us what his Department intends to do about applications for reclassification or objections to classification received too late by his Department in terms of Section 11 of the Act? Hon. members know that Section 11, as amended in 1962, states that anyone who considers himself aggrieved by his classification can object to it within 30 days or within such longer period, not exceeding one year, as the Minister may allow. Sir, there must be hundreds of these objections lying in the files of the Department at the present time. There must be many hundreds of others who received their identity cards perhaps a year, or two years, ago and whose objections to their classification have come in too late. I am dealing with a whole mail basket full of them at the present time. I would like to ask the Minister if he is prepared to tell us whether he is prepared to give these people an extension of time; whether he is prepared to consider each case on its merits and to give an administrative decision. If that is the case, on what considerations will his decision be based, or is the answer to all those classified, whose objections have been lodged too late, going to be a flat refusal to reconsider the matter irrespective of the personal circumstances of the people concerned? I wonder if the hon. the Minister will be kind enough to tell us what his policy is in that regard. Will the Appeal Board still handle these cases, and have they still a right of appeal to the courts of law? As the hon. the Minister knows any such right of appeal to the courts of law hinges upon a decision by the Appeal Board itself. I do think that the hon. the Minister owes some kind of answer to many of these unfortunate people who have been living in nerve-wracking circumstances and in a state of suspense for a very long time.</p>

<p>Now I want to raise another point in this regard: An increasing number of letters which I have received recently from the Department on behalf of many of these people, referring to aggrieved persons objecting to their classification under the Act, cite the information given in the 1951 population census as evidence of the race group to which these people <span class="col_5751-5752" refersTo="page_209"/>belong. Sir, perhaps it might be as well to remind the hon. the Minister&#x2014;because the years go by so quickly&#x2014;that the 1950 Population Registration Act was promulgated on 22 June 1950, and that the census was held in 1951, less than a year later. I would like to ask the hon. the Minister how he thinks the vast majority of the people in South Africa could possibly have been aware at that stage of all that was at stake. When they completed those census forms in 1951, with the assistance of an enumerator in most cases, how could they possibly have known, particularly the 947 to whom I have referred, that the hitherto peaceful pattern of their lives was likely to be destroyed? The information given by many of them at the time of the 1951 census may have been correct. There are many difficult cases; the hon. the Minister knows all about it. We know that where one party in a marriage was White and the other was mixed or Coloured, they may very well have decided themselves to put down their race as &#x201C;White&#x201D; or &#x201C;Mixed&#x201D; or &#x201C;Coloured&#x201D; on the census form, and we know also that many of these people, simple people, may very well have been influenced, as I have no doubt they were, by the enumerators when it came to the question of their race grouping at that time.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The matter raised by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) is a very tricky one. There were many hundreds of these cases which had to be investigated by the Department. There were many hundreds of people who thought that they had been wrongly classified and therefore demanded a reclassification. The Department has handled this matter in a very circumspect and praiseworthy manner right from the start. My experience&#x2014;and I represent a constituency which also had its slum areas, which also had mixed residential areas resulting in the fact that I had to deal with many borderline cases&#x2014;has been that these cases have been dealt with by the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department with the greatest circumspection and sympathy. None of the people who asked for my assistance had any complaints to make about the way in which they had been treated by the Department. On the contrary, they had nothing but the highest praise for the courtesy and the helpfulness of the officials of the Department. I sincerely hope that the hon. member for Wynberg is not trying to cast any blame upon those officials. A very large number of these cases have been dealt with and disposed of by the Department over the years. The ever-dwindling number which now remains consists of the most difficult cases. The smaller their number becomes the more difficult are the cases. The most difficult of the difficult cases are those which the Department now has to deal with and I want to urge the Department not to act hastily. These cases are thoroughly investigated to ensure that justice will be done to all sections of the public. I want to make an appeal to hon. members who have to deal with people who have appealed against their classification or who have asked to be reclassified not to aggravate the task of the Department any further by encouraging these people to be difficult. There have been cases in which I have been approached by persons who have obviously been Coloured and when I have been convinced of the fact after having investigated all the circumstances, that these people have been quite correctly classified as Coloureds. These people argue that they voted previously as Whites and that their names appeared on the Voters&#x2019; Roll at Observatory or Woodstock or Mowbray, but these are people who ought not to be on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, as I have realized over the years. There are people who approach one and say: &#x201C;I am employed at a factory as a White man where both White and non-White workers are employed.&#x201D; There are other people who approach one and say: &#x201C;I was educated at a sectarian private school where I received my education amongst Whites.&#x201D; But, Mr. Chairman, these reasons are not sufficient to have those people declared to be White. Many of the people to whom the hon. member for Wynberg referred are people who ought to be satisfied with their classification. They are unable to make out any case at all for reclassification. As I say, my experience has been that the Department treats these people very sympathetically indeed. There are many difficult cases and the Department is trying to treat all these people fairly. Let me tell the hon. member for Wynberg that in my opinion the Department has never put a foot wrong in my constituency when it has had to deal with these difficult cases. We must not encourage Coloureds who are obviously Coloureds and who try to get away from their own race for their own reasons, often for political reasons. We had too much to do in the past with non-Whites who &#x201C;tried for White&#x201D;, who tried to desert their own people and who wanted to be classified as Whites because they had nothing but contempt for their own people, because they were not prepared to assist in uplifting their own people. They tried to be classified as Whites. If these people are classified as Whites they will discover that they are not happy. We have had cases where people have thought that once they had been classified as White they would find heaven on earth. After they have been classified as White, those people have returned to the Department and have said: &#x201C;We are unhappy; reclassify us as Coloureds, which we really are.&#x201D; We have many difficult cases amongst the Coloureds here in the Western Cape but the Department is trying to deal with this very difficult task in a very tactful manner. It is incumbent upon us as members of this House not to make the duties of these officials any more difficult than they are.</p>

<p>I think the hon. member who has just sat down has himself given all the evidence that one needs of the difficulties that this race classification Act provides, especially here in the Cape especially between the White group and the Coloured <span class="col_5753-5754" refersTo="page_210"/>group. It is there that all the human tragedies occur. When the hon. member talks about people who try to flee from their own race group, people who &#x201C;try for White&#x201D;, as he put it, he must appreciate that there are these difficulties; he must appreciate that these people try to be classified as White for one reason. They never tried for White before because it did not affect them; it did not mean anything, but to-day it means a matter of livelihood or non-livelihood.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>No, it is not nonsense. Sir, before I go any further I want to agree with the hon. member that the members of the Minister&#x2019;s Department have been very sympathetic in dealing with these cases. I have people in my own constituency who have worked as White, and if they are classified as Coloured people they lose their job, they lose their livelihood; they lose their status; their family loses its status, its normal way of life, has to adopt another way of life and live on a smaller salary. That is what race classification means. The hon. member must not talk about people escaping from their own race group and flying into other race groups, because many of these people have always been regarded and accepted as White people, and now suddenly out of the blue comes a thunderbolt into their lives. They have hanging over their heads a sword of Damocles. If they are classified as Coloured, when they have been regarded all along as White, it is virtually the end of their lives. I endorse the hon. member&#x2019;s statement that these cases are dealt with sympathetically. The hon. member lives in the Cape and in the Cape there are more of these problems than anywhere else. We also have these problems in Natal, however, and the other provinces have the same problem. As the late Mr. Justice Fagan said of other legislation and of these people at the time, &#x201C;The legislature had wisely refrained from drawing a dividing line where the Creator had blurred it&#x201D;. Sir, that is the problem of the hon. the Minister and of his Department and of the machinery that he set up here. He is trying to draw a dividing line where the Creator had blurred it. The hon. the Minister knows as well as I do that there are cases where brothers and sisters are differently classified under this Act and, Sir, with it go all the human tragedies that follow a race classification. I know the Minister took the power in 1962, under the amending Act of that year, to appoint certain members of the public service to investigate any matters that required investigation under this Act. What happens often is that people are told to go and see the local representative. He has a look at them and then he tells them to bring their families along. The family is then paraded before that representative for him to look at so that he can decide whether in appearance they are White or not. It is an indignity to anyone, Sir, to be subjected to anything like that. I asked the hon. the Minister on a previous occasion what qualifications those persons had to assess whether a person was White or Coloured. I appreciate the fact that this is a difficult problem but if someone is accepted as a White person surely society&#x2019;s judgment should not have the stamp of the judgment of an unqualified official in this regard put on to it.</p>

<p>There is another matter I want to raise with the hon. the Minister and that is the question of appeals. In terms of the Act the person aggrieved by a decision may appeal to the Appeal Board. There have been many cases where the aggrieved persons have objected and where their appeals have gone to the Appeal Board. It is quite clear, and the courts have so held, that you do not have to exhaust your remedies under the Population Registration Act&#x2014;in other words, you do not have to go right through to the Appeal Board&#x2014;before you go to Court. What has happened is that the Appeal Board has sometimes taken years to consider an application. This happened a long time ago. The hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention was then drawn to it but it is still happening to-day. I am referring to the Population Register Appeal Board, Sir, under the Act. This Appeal Board sometimes takes years to decide on a case. That was obviously not the intention of the hon. the Minister. Any statutory appeal board is intended to give quick and cheap relief to the persons concerned. But exactly the opposite is happening in this case. It takes long enough to get a case heard in court these days but you can go to court and get an order on the turn. I have done it myself for my constituents. But you have to wait years for the board to decide on an objection to a race classification. One must remember what happens in the meantime to these people. The children cannot go to school because they have not got a race classification card. The parents may be suspended from work because they have not got a race classification card. These are the human tragedies this system brings about. They must know quickly one way or the other. The hon. the Minister must either have a permanent board or he must make some other arrangements in regard to appeals. I shall leave the question of the Population Register at that.</p>

<p>I want to deal with the question of passports. In the Commonwealth Relations Amendment Act it is provided that the Minister may deprive a person of his South African citizenship where he has made use of his citizenship of another country, i.e. where he has a dual citizenship. The hon. the Minister has not indicated what those acts are. One which springs readily to mind is the act of travelling <span class="col_5755-5756" refersTo="page_211"/>on another passport. A number of South African citizens have a British passport by virtue of their birth. If they do travel on that passport it is not clear whether they will be deprived of their South African citizenship. I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether he will make it clear that this will happen in all cases or whether it will not happen in all cases. Because at the moment people are being told by the immigration authorities that they run the risk of losing their citizenship. When they travel to London on a British passport they are advised to change it there for a South African passport. My point is that there is no clarity and I hope the hon. the Minister will clear up the position. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, when my time expired I was talking about the 1951 census returns and the reliance the Minister places upon that information. Perhaps the hon. the Minister will remember that when the Minister of the Interior introduced the Bill originally in 1950 it was the late General Smuts himself who pointed out that enumerators in any census were not trained for the purpose of distinguishing whether a person was White, Coloured or Bantu. He pointed out that most of them were ordinary people subject to their own political prejudices and their own points of view; that they were mainly concerned with the mechanics of the thing. May I say, with respect, that if they were the judges of race grouping in any of these cases they can hardly be said to have been impartial. That is why I asked, by way of a question to the Minister, how much reliance he and his Department in fact placed upon this information. If your family is divided, if your family is half-White, or half-mixed or half-Coloured, what do you put on any census form? How could the people foresee in those days the mass of apartheid legislation that was to be passed in the next few years which would so vitally affect their lives?</p>

<p>I have letters here from the Department to prove the validity of what I say, to prove that in some cases the Population Registrar relies almost exclusively on the information given in the 1951 census, information which, I think I have already proved, may be entirely unreliable. Here I have a letter written in July last year and I want to read one sentence from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In this connection I have to inform you that during the 1951 population census enumeration you declared your race as Coloured and as your classification, for purposes of the Act, as amended, should agree with your enumeration in 1951 an identity card on which your race is described as Coloured is being forwarded to you under separate cover.</block>

<p>In other words, the sole reason given in that letter was the 1951 census. The next letter gives as evidence against an application for re-classification the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;During the 1951 population census you were enumerated &#x2026;&#x201D;</block>

<p>Not even declared, but &#x201C;enumerated&#x201D; as a Coloured person. Then they quote Mr. Justice Snyman&#x2019;s 1960 judgment in support of that decision. I have so many of these letters, Sir. I shall be only too happy to show them to the hon. the Minister. I should like to know from him whether information given on a 1951 census form amounts to a statement freely and voluntarily given in terms of the amended definition of a White person in the 1962 amending Act. I should like to know whether that constitutes a free and voluntary statement. If it does then various complications arise because the Census Act of 1957 prohibits the use of any information in any register or any record (which would of course include information given to enumerators) as evidence in a court of law. In other words, if evidence given during a census, voluntarily or otherwise, is not admissible as evidence in a court of law, how can it be admissible as evidence for the Population Register?</p>

<p>The last question I want to raise is this question of divided families. I want to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied with his legislation in terms of which one party to a marriage can be classified as White and the other as Coloured? I have two letters from the Department confirming that in the one case the wife was classified as White, the husband as Coloured and in the other case the husband as White and the wife as Coloured. In the case of the one family the group areas inspectors visited the couple last year and the district generally and after investigation declared the area White. What is this family to do? They have three children aged 14, 7 and 3. As the law stands at the moment are those parents not liable to be charged under the Mixed Marriages Act as a result of their classification by the Population Registrar? Under whose classification are they to decide where they are going to live? Is the mother&#x2019;s name to appear on the Voters&#x2019; Roll and the father&#x2019;s not? She is a qualified European nurse. Has she to forfeit her job and in how many instances has the Department issued a Coloured card to one member of the family and a White card to another member? Members on this side of the House warned the hon. the Minister that this would happen when the Act was introduced. In terms of the 1962 definition of a White person any person claiming to be White must be able to prove that he has totally severed his association with the Coloured community and has established himself completely in the White community. In this respect the Department frequently quotes the judgment of Mr. Justice de Vos Hugo given in the Griqualand West Local Division of the Supreme Court in April 1962. To which community can such a couple claim to belong? The children of one of these couples are already deeply unhappy at school; must they now face the agonizing choice of acknowledging one parent and rejecting <span class="col_5757-5758" refersTo="page_212"/>the other when they come to reach the age of 16 years and have to apply for identity cards themselves? If they decide to line up with their mother, to try for White, as the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) says, are they expected, in terms of the judgment of Mr. Justice de Vos Hugo, to reject their father because he is Coloured? Mr. Chairman, we have got down to the bones of this Act; we have got down to the real hard core of the problem. We want to know from the hon. the Minister how he is going to solve these problems.</p>

<p>I want to know whether the hon. the Minister can give us answers to these fundamental questions. I shall be very happy indeed if he can. Firstly, where the one parent is held by his Department to be White and the other as Coloured, is he likely to have them charged under the Mixed Marriages Act after 20 years of marriage? Will he leave their classification as it is? Will he say it is irrevocable and that nothing can be done? Is he to leave those families to break themselves up in unhappiness and bitterness and strife because that is already happening&#x2014;in case the hon. the Minister does not know it? Is he to classify some of the children of these marriages as White and the others as Coloured when they reach the age of 16 so that you will have a situation where brothers and sisters will be forced to sever their connections with their parents in terms of the judgment I have referred to, or will the Minister exercise his humanity&#x2014;when I say &#x201C;humanity&#x201D; the hon. Minister will know in what sense I mean it&#x2014;and give these people the benefit of the doubt? And will he tell us whether he is prepared to consider an extension of time to those people who objected to their classification, but whose applications came in too late in terms of Section 11 of the Act?</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I have so many of these cases. The hon. the Minister is no doubt tired of receiving letters from me about them but we should be very glad to have some kind of a reply. I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that he realizes that he holds the potential happiness or unhappiness of hundreds of these families in his hands as a result of the administration of this Act.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>I want to refer to the compilation of the Voters&#x2019; Roll and the general registration which took place last year, particularly to the compilation of the roll affecting Coloured voters. My reason for doing so, is that we shall have a delimitation in a year&#x2019;s time and this delimitation will be decided according to the number of voters appearing on the roll. I wonder whether the hon. the Minister is aware of the fact&#x2014;I am sure he is&#x2014;that a very bad job was done of the compilation of the roll as far as the Coloured voters were concerned, under the Separate Representation of Voters&#x2019; Act. There was no compulsion on the Coloured man to register. The enumerators called and asked: Where is So and So. They were told: He is away. And his name simply came off the roll. No inquiries were made, except in very few instances, as to whether or not people resided in those premises who qualified for registration in terms of the law. Various speakers in this House have made political capital out of the fact that the number of voters on the Coloured Voters&#x2019; Roll has declined steadily. But that is due to the bad job that was done. It is also very difficult for a Coloured person to register. The rules are irksome and the regulations are so tight that many of them neglect to register. As the hon. the Minister knows the Voters&#x2019; Roll in 1963 dropped to 9,795 from 23,435 for the four seats in the Cape Province over a period of five years. That surely cannot be a satisfactory state of affairs. It is said by the Coloured community that it is possibly, the Government&#x2019;s intention to let their numbers gradually dwindle by taking no interest in them, so that eventually the seats for the Coloured Representatives in Parliament will fall away by default. I, of course, do not subscribe to that. The difficulty is that a Coloured person must occupy a house of a given value, earn a wage of a given amount and be in continuous employment or be a diamond digger. As you know, Sir, his application form must be signed in the presence of a competent witness, who must belong to a specified group of people. I think the time has arrived for the hon. the Minister to look with great care into the spending of public money on the compilation of a Voters&#x2019; Roll as poor as the one which was compiled in September last year. I want to ask the Minister to give some consideration to having another registration. Because of the fact that we have parallel Voters&#x2019; Rolls for Coloureds and Whites many enumerators were quite disinterested in the Coloureds. I do not know what method was used in the selection of the enumerators but whatever method was used, the men selected were not really people competent to do the job. The result is that we have the existing state of affairs.</p>

<p>One other point I should like to make is this. The Government saw fit, when registering people in the Transkei, to have such a simple form, that it is almost too simple to be true. It can be said that that was a different type of election and that that was a different type of voters list. I have no doubt that a very simple form will be evolved for the new Coloured Representative Council we have recently agreed to in this House. I cannot understand why the form for the Coloured man is made so difficult. The Coloured people think&#x2014;and no amount of persuasion will make them think otherwise&#x2014;that the intention is eventually to get them off the roll altogether. The hon. the Minister must have had complaints brought to his notice. If he has not, I am bringing them now. There is a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst the Coloured community at the way that roll was compiled.</p>

<p>I also want to deal with the difficulty the Coloured man experiences if he happens to be blind. There is a special form for a White <span class="col_5759-5760" refersTo="page_213"/>blind voter which a person authorized by the applicant may sign on his behalf and register him as a voter. I have a case of a Coloured person who was on the roll. He became blind under unfortunate circumstances. The only way in which he can register is to struggle in his blindness to write his name, his occupation, his address and the date in the presence of a competent witness. I am not going to ask whether you have tried that, Sir, because you will find it impossible. He could not complete the form and his name was taken off. I am not talking about those people who want to register for the first time. I am talking about those who are on the roll and become afflicted by blindness. Why this differentiation between the White blind voter and the Coloured blind voter when they wish to register?</p>

<p>These are matters which exercise the minds of the Coloured community. I do appeal to the hon. the Minister to give serious consideration to looking at the Coloured Voters&#x2019; Roll again and getting his Department to make some effort to ensure that the roll is redone, or added to, by the State, and not leave it to the interested parties to see to it, that the thousands of people who should be on the roll, but who are not, get on it. I shall leave the Voters&#x2019; Roll on that note.</p>

<p>I would like to refer just briefly to the remarks of the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotze) on classifications. I am not going to go into the pros and cons. That has been very ably done by the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor). I do think the hon. the Minister should know of the indignity, the sadness and sorrow which are inflicted upon people in this country because of the classification of what are called border-line cases. I often wonder, Sir&#x2014;and I say this quite kindly&#x2014;how much time did hon. members in the Government party spend, before they were born, figuring out that they would not be born Black.</p>

Nevertheless I think the time has come when this whole process of classifying border-line cases should be tempered with a little of the milk of human kindness. The people need it; they need it badly.

<p>I forgive the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) from the bottom of my heart. I forgive her because she is such a newcomer to this House. She spoke about the population register, a matter which has been discussed by other members since 1950. Although she has had so little experience in this House she nevertheless went so far as to take this opportunity to make a speech here which really did not become her, a speech in which she posed as the great champion of the reclassification movement, in spite of the fact that my Department has investigated every case with the utmost care. I want to thank the hon. members for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell) and Karoo (Mr. Eden) very heartily indeed for having assured my Department of their support. The hon. member for Wynberg gave the impression that my Department was in reality most unsympathetic in dealing with these cases.</p>

<p>I say that the hon. member gave that impression. She delivered a tirade on all the misery that has been caused and she spoke about all the questions that we could not answer. I shall come back to each individual matter. If the hon. member had been a member of this House in 1962 when the new definition was discussed, and when we gave so many assurances in regard to the manner in which we approached these cases and the way in which we wanted to be of assistance, she would not have criticized the Population Registration Act of 1950 and the 1951 census in the way in which she did. She is not satisfied that the court and the Department should make use of that information. Section 3 of the Population Registration Act clearly states&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The particulars required for the compilation of the register in respect of the population of the Union as at the fixed date shall be extracted by the Director from the forms and returns received by him under the Census Act, 1910, in connection with the census taken on the fixed date and from such other records as may be available to the Director.</block>

<p>I know that the hon. member knows it but she is being obstinate. I know that the hon. member can raise any matter at all in terms of the rules governing debate but because only I and my Department can make use of the information obtained for the purposes of classification, as prescribed by law, this is not the time to make representations for the amendment of the law. That can be done at some other time. We cannot discuss and criticize existing laws at this stage. The criticism that I enjoy receiving is the type of criticism expressed by the hon. member for Durban (North). He lodged a definite objection and I shall give him a full reply. Criticism of the action taken by my Department under a certain Act or the Administration by my Department of that Act is criticism that is not permissible. I cannot reply to it because it is really not relevant. I may not reply to it. Those are provisions of the existing Act.</p>

<p><span class="col_5761-5762" refersTo="page_214"/>I shall try to resolve a few of the difficulties of the hon. member. As far as the people affected by Section 11 are concerned I want to assure the hon. member that we shall consider every case on its merits. I think that she has already had experience of this fact because she is well known to us as a correspondent. We try to stretch the provision of the Act as far as possible. We have never told people that the only reason why their applications could not be reconsidered was the fact that they had applied too late. We give them two reasons. The one is that they applied late and the other is that we have no reason to believe that a reclassification will be successful because they have already made previous applications and no new information has been submitted. The hon. member must bear this in mind. The hon. member objected to the fact that we would not make an estimate, that we could not reply to her one question. She objected to the way in which the question was answered. If a question is answered in this way I think she should come to my office or discuss the matter with the Secretary. We will then be able to give the hon. member the facts. We have often tried to make estimates but it is extremely difficult to do so. The Act provides that the State President shall proclaim the date with effect from which identity cards will have to be carried. That is the only way. So many factors influence an estimate; people die and people move; they change their addresses. In this connection I just want to tell the hon. member about some of our problems. I have here the latest report of the Department. During the period 1 January 1964, to 31 March 1964 we received 42 applications for reclassification, 28 from Coloured to White, five from Asiatic to White, Malay or Coloured and nine from Bantu to Coloured. Up to 31 March 1964 altogether 3,940 objections were received, including the 42 I have just mentioned. I want to tell the hon. member what our problem is. Our first difficulty is the objections that are dealt with by the Race Classification Board. In 231 cases the board amended the classification of the Population Registration. Forty-seven classifications of the Population Registrar were ratified by the board. There are eight applications that have still to be considered by the board. Let me just tell the hon. member for Durban (North) that seven of these applications are from persons who have been classified as Chinese and one from a person who has been classified as an Indian. Three fall in the Coloured/White group. The hon. member for Wynberg wanted to know how many cases there are. She says that we cannot give her the figures. I am now giving her this information in regard to the number of applications that have been received. Let us see what has happened in regard to these objections. I mentioned the total of 3,940 objections. Of this number 2,663 cases have been disposed of and a further 302 cases are under consideration. We are dealing now with a population of 16,000,000. Just think of the inflated idea which the hon. member for Wynberg has and the impression she has created! Listening to her, one would say that the whole country was in a state of uncertainty. She said that these people are on the point of a nervous breakdown; there are so many of them who cannot go on any longer as the result of the negligence of this Department and this Minister who is not acting in the right way! I say that there are 302 cases under consideration. Let us look now at the other side of the picture. There were 686 cases of people who objected but who did not reply to correspondence&#x2014;perhaps they were put up to it, I do not know&#x2014;or who withdrew their objections or who died before finality was reached. This number therefore is more than twice the figure of 302 cases which are still under consideration. My objection to the hon. member for Wynberg is that an uninformed person listening to her speech would really think that there was a terrible state of uncertainty in our country and that a very large number of people were affected. We have to deal with people who are not well informed and with whom it is difficult to correspond. Not all of them have people acting for them; some of them do the work themselves. I want to give the House the true facts. In this regard I want in passing to reply to one point raised by the hon. member for Durban (North) who spoke about the long postponement of appeals. In 1962 when the definition of &#x201C;White&#x201D; was changed, I made it very clear that it was my intention on the classification of a person as a White person to use as my only yardstick the amended definition adopted by this House in 1962. I am not discussing the merits of the case now. The hon. member for Wynberg spoke about the merits of the case but my actions are governed entirely by the definition. That definition was approved by this House; it is the law of our country. We cannot make laws one day and then break those laws again the next. In my speech at the time I said that we would act on this definition. A difference of opinion arose amongst lawyers during the recess of last year. There are persons who contend and who are of the opinion that people who were classified as Coloureds by the Secretary for the Interior before the definition was amended should, when they object to the classification and submit that they are White, have their objections considered in the light of the old definition of a White person. One group of lawyers expressed that opinion. They said that people who objected to their classification before the definition was amended should be dealt with in terms of the old definition. There were other lawyers&#x2014;whom I consider to be correct, but who am I to judge&#x2014;who adopted the attitude that if there was any doubt at all, the definition of 1962 should be the decisive factor. In most cases and from the nature of things the setting up of these <i>ad hoc</i> boards for hearing these appeals takes up a great deal of time. This was one of the reasons I gave the hon. member. But this difference of opinion that arose between the two legal schools of thought caused so much doubt that it aggravated <span class="col_5763-5764" refersTo="page_215"/>matters. I hope shortly, within a few weeks, to arrive at a definite solution in regard to this matter and to have certainty in regard to our line of action. I hope too that what will have to be done will be clear from our existing legislation. But if there is the slightest doubt at all, I shall introduce amending legislation to ensure that the application of the definition of 1962, the definition of a White person, is placed beyond all doubt&#x2014;that it is that definition of 1962 which must be applied.</p>

<p>I have already said that up to 31 December last year there were only 12 persons who had applied for re-classification and whose applications had still to be considered by appeal boards. Of these 12 cases there are seven cases of persons of Chinese descent who want to be classified as Whites; there is one case of a person who is classified as an Indian at the moment and who wants to be classified as a White person and there are three cases of persons classified as Coloureds who want to be classified as Whites. These are the people who have appealed. It was the hon. member for Durban (North) who said that these appeals took so long to be heard. I hope that we will have clarity in this regard but if any further doubts exist I shall introduce the necessary amending legislation, during the present Session before Parliament is prorogued, to remove all doubt as to the validity of the 1962 definition. I hope that the hon. member is satisfied with my explanation in this regard.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (North) also mentioned the question of passports. As far as the question of passports is concerned I have issued the instruction&#x2014;I hope that we all love and take a pride in our country and that we shall therefore comply with the instruction&#x2014;that when a person also possesses the passport of a foreign country&#x2014;not necessarily a British passport&#x2014;we require that person to use his South African passport&#x2014;without his being unreasonably compelled to do so, particularly when the economic survival of such person is affected thereby. If he does not use his South African passport when he should make use of it I have the power under the Act to deprive him of that passport. But this is not done until such a person has been given a clear warning. Indeed, the hon. member also mentioned this fact. I insist that apart from the usual warning issued by an official, a letter should also be addressed to such person and that, where at all possible, such person should acknowledge in writing the receipt of such warning. I may just tell the hon. member that in all cases where people have approached us after having been sent this notice and have put their case to us and have explained that they have, for example to travel in certain African countries&#x2014;except Ghana where they have to sign a certain document&#x2014;for business reasons, that they have to visit countries which are not well disposed towards us, we have met them as far as possible. The other day I dealt with the case of a young lady who wanted to visit certain countries for the purpose of further study, countries which are not very well disposed towards us and which do not recognize our passports, countries like India. I gave her the right to make use of the passport of another country. But the people who are deprived of their South African passports are those who simply tell us that they value their British or German passports, or any other passport, far more than they value their South African passport. In other words, they as much as tell us that we can take their South African passports. They are people who do not intend returning to our country for various reasons. I do not think any hon. member will object when I say that people who attach so little value to the citizenship of our country, who despise it to such an extent that they do not want to make use of the passport and travel documents of our country, must suffer the consequences. I shall continue to act in this way because I think that it is in the interests of the country that we make use of the travel documents of our own country instead of making use of the passport of a foreign country for our own convenience&#x2014;perhaps in order to pass through Customs more easily or for some other reason.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg is very concerned about what happens in the case of a father who is White and a mother who is Coloured. She asks whether we will prosecute such cases under the Mixed Marriages Act. It is not our task to prosecute; that is the task of the Department of Justice. I have nothing to do with the Mixed Marriages Act. I only have to deal with classifications. But I do want to say that I am in full agreement with the hon. member that cases in which members of the same family are classified differently are sad and pathetic and that we must try to assist these people as sympathetically as possible. That is why we give them all the help we can. That position cannot remain as it is. I agree with the hon. member that we shall have to condone many of these cases. Indeed, we have already done so and I hope that we shall continue to act just as fairly in the future because we cannot allow those people to suffer.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to tell the hon. member for Karoo in connection with the registration of Coloured voters that we cannot compel the Coloureds to register. There is this difference: One can compel a White man to register but one cannot compel a Coloured man to register. The application forms are obtainable everywhere but the Department is not responsible for the registration of these people as voters. Whoever applies for registration is in terms of the provisions of the Act either registered or omitted, although there is no deliberate omission. I do think that the Coloured Representatives should tighten up their organization somewhat and help these people to register. That is what the Whites are doing to-day. They are going from house to house to assist people to register. The Coloured Representatives will have to <span class="col_5765-5766" refersTo="page_216"/>do their share in this connection particularly as the Coloured people are often less well-informed in regard to these matters.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the hon. the Minister has indicated that he will apply the passport laws with as much flexibility as possible. However, the Minister has not yet made the position clear in regard to those people who might travel with a British passport. As the Minister has indicated, there are some countries in which it is not advantageous&#x2014;for instance when you want to do business there&#x2014;to have a South African passport because you will probably not get further than the airfield. I know of South Africans who had to travel either to or through India on a South African passport with the result that they were separated from the other passengers and placed in an hotel either at the airport or somewhere else. But be that as it may. What the hon. the Minister is doing here is to provide, for business purposes, for what I might describe as a second-class citizen&#x2014;to use words which are not my own. Such a citizen can use whatever passport he pleases. But I, speaking for myself, cannot get a British passport &#x2026;</p>

<p>Precisely. You know, Sir, all people are equal, but some are more equal than others and these in this case are those entitled to a foreign passport because their parents were born somewhere else or for whatever reason. What I want to ask the hon. the Minister is whether he can make it clear to people who travel on a British passport&#x2026;and here I want to say that there are a lot of people who had a British passport before the Commonwealth Relations Act was passed in 1962 and who still have such passports which they are entitled to use.

<p>I know it is in the discretion of the hon. the Minister but my point is that a person does not know beforehand whether or not the Minister is going to exercise his discretion in that person&#x2019;s favour. This is my difficulty. In other words, if a person travels on a British passport while he is entitled to travel on a South African passport, he does not know as things are now whether he will be deprived of his citizenship or not. Let me give the hon. the Minister an illustration of what can happen by referring to a recent case. Someone who, if you take account of the dictum: &#x201C;Ignorance of the law is no excuse&#x201D;, should have known better but in fact did not know what the law was in terms of the Commonwealth Relations Act of 1962, left Durban on a British passport. She had this passport for years. When she left Durban, the immigration authorities warned her to be careful as to what was happening in terms of the existing law and that she might be deprived of her South African citizenship. She was also advised that upon arrival in Britain she should go to South Africa House and exchange her passport for a South African passport. The reason for telling her that was because it was too late at that stage for any steps to be taken in this country. As I understand the law I agree that is what she should have done. But that traveller might say that she kept her British passport because she thought she might possibly travel through Ghana, or step off at Accra to do some sightseeing. I request the hon. the Minister to make it clear to people that if they do travel on British passports when they could instead have used their South African passports, they will then run the risk of losing their South African citizenship.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I have a much easier way out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The difficulty is that people do not realize what is happening. They think they can travel on foreign passports instead of on their South African passports without any danger. They really think they can only lose their South African citizenship if they commit some sort of hostile act towards South Africa. The point I am trying to make is that they do not know whether the fact that they travel in this way does in fact constitute such a hostile act, an act which the hon. the Minister described as being inimical to a person&#x2019;s South African citizenship. I understand the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s attitude to be that travelling under the aforementioned circumstances is not consistent with being a good South African citizen. If that is in fact so, let the hon. the Minister warn everyone that that is the <i>de facto</i> position. Otherwise people are in ignorance. If the Minister <span class="col_5767-5768" refersTo="page_217"/>makes the position clear then there will not be any doubt. What might happen is that a person leaves the country with a British passport and half-way obtains a South African passport. Now, is the fact that he travelled on a British passport on the forward journey going to count against him? In other words, when they land in South Africa on a South African passport, will action be taken against him on that account? You see, Sir, there are these difficulties and I hope the hon. the Minister will clear up the position.</p>

<p>Now I want to come back for a moment to the Population Registration Act. I do not think the hon. the Minister was quite fair in his reaction to the point raised by the hon. member for Wynberg. That hon. member wanted to know what the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s policy was in relation to certain things that were happening. She mentioned, for instance, the case of a wife and husband differently classified.</p>

<p>But I am sure the hon. the Minister thought the hon. member for Wynberg was having a dig at the Department and its officials. I am also quite sure that the hon. member did not intend that and I hope the Minister will take her remarks as they were intended. The Minister has, after all, said that he liked to hear of these difficulties so that he can sort them out. The hon. member for Wynberg is, as the Minister pointed out, a new member and she is coming across this sort of thing for the first time and it is refreshing to see what sort of reaction this does have. I think it is a good thing for a new member to remind us of something which some of us are taking for granted. Now, what is the hon. the Minister going to do about these people? I had to deal with a case the other day of a woman who was pregnant. She had already had a child by the same person and was expecting a second by the same person. However, she had a Coloured classification card and consequently they could not get married. What does one tell them now except that she must get her classification card changed? The test was so different in terms of the definition of 1962. As that stood, <i>prima facie,</i> she was in difficulty about getting her classification card. I must say that I advised them that the only thing they could do to get out of the terrible predicament they were in, was to get married because in terms of the Mixed Marriages Act they were entitled to get married.</p>

<p>Now, this is the ridiculous situation we are in. What I want to tell the hon. the Minister&#x2014;and this, I think, is also what the hon. member for Wynberg wanted to tell him&#x2014;is that where we get such a situation where in terms of the Mixed Marriages Act they are entitled to get married while in terms of the Population Registration Act the woman is not entitled to a White registration card, will the hon. the Minister in all cases like that exercise his discretion in favour of the <i>status quo,</i> in this case of the marriage and of the classification of the people concerned as Whites?

<p>I want to reassure the hon. member as far as the use of passports is concerned. My policy in regard to the use of dual passports is that if a person wants to make use of a British passport&#x2014;as an example&#x2014;such person ought to write in advance to the Department and inform the Department that it is that person&#x2019;s intention to use his British passport. He must explain to the Department why he feels that it is necessary for him to use a British passport. If he does this the Department will let him know whether it will be in order for him to use that passport or whether, if he does make use of a British passport, he will be running the risk of losing his South African citizenship. This is clear enough and I think that everyone should be urged to follow this procedure. My Department does not know who the people are who are still in possession of foreign passports until, of course, they use those passports.</p>

<p>As far as the second matter which the hon. member raised is concerned, I must say that I cannot answer in regard to individual cases like the &#x201C;hard case&#x201D; which the hon. member mentioned. I must know the facts and the background to the matter before I can reply to him. The hon. member told us about a pregnant woman who already has a child and who has been classified as a Coloured. I do not have all the facts of and the background to this matter. I want to ask hon. members please to refer individual cases of this nature to the Department so that they can be properly investigated. In this connection I think that there are numbers of hon. members opposite who can testify to the thorough way in which every case is investigated and to the fact that a full explanation is given of the reasons why a request can or cannot be complied with.</p>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I think everyone will admit that the consideration which is given to special cases by the Minister and his Department is almost always very sympathetic indeed. I have certainly never had any occasion where I have had anything but the most courteous and sympathetic response when any individual case is taken up. I think it is one of the tragedies of this country, this Alice in Crazyland world in which we have to live&#x2014;pigeonholing people, cutting up family trees and sending one branch down this river and the other branch down the other river&#x2014;and that one should have to appeal to sympathy. But the laws are there and it is reaching the stage where the lives of families, and the generations to follow them, have their whole future course determined by the sympathy or otherwise of the person who deals with that particular case, and it depends on whether the <span class="col_5769-5770" refersTo="page_218"/>person wakes up in a good or a bad mood, and that can be the deciding factor which determines the whole future not only of one or two people but of generations. I am prepared to say that the sympathy is nearly always there, but it is tragic that this should be the situation and that the Minister who is responsible for administering this complex task should find himself year after year coming before this House and faced with the need to deal with these problems. I believe the Minister should go to the Cabinet and say: These are the things which crop up year after year in the administration of this legislation, and for heaven&#x2019;s sake let us try and sort it out and get down to a civilized basis which will make it unnecessary to have to appeal to the Minister. But I do not want to get involved in this field of the Minister&#x2019;s responsibility, except perhaps to mention that the person entering South Africa strikes it even before he gets into the country. If you travel around and compare the ridiculous form that you have to fill in when you enter South Africa with the simple procedure on entering almost any other country&#x2014;certainly any that I went to&#x2014;the traveller begins to wonder straight away what he is coming into. If you go to England or France or the United States, there is a simple card which only asks you what your name is, where you will be staying and what your business is. But if you come into South Africa you have to give your pedigree and there is a lengthy form on which you have to fill in a whole host of questions, and the Customs Department adds to the paper work, and you almost need a private secretary to fill in the forms required to enter South Africa. It is typical of the approach we have to life that we have to do everything in this longwinded and complicated hed tape way. Surely this is an administrative matter. What on earth is the use of half the junk that has to be filled in on the form when you enter the country? And that applies not only to visitors, but also to South African citizens born and bred here, a person who has left the country on a passport issued by that Minister. His departure and his return have been authorized. He has all the details in the stud book. He is registered in the Population Register. He is classified as a White man, but he has to fill it all in again when he comes back to his own country. I hope this is one aspect of the rigidity and red tape administration which could be simplified in the interests of South Africa and our good name.</p>

<p>I want to raise one or two other matters with the Minister. The first is to ask the Minister whether he will give us a specific reply at this stage as to whether we are to have a delimitation of the constituencies in 1965, or if not, on what date. There is a provincial election which has to take place towards the end of this year or the beginning of next year. The parliamentary elections can, at the latest, be held in October 1966. It would be awkward to have a delimitation at this stage, in 1964. But the last delimitation was in August 1957, and in the meantime population changes have been taking place. We have the position to-day where some constituencies have double the number of voters that others have, and the Minister is in a dilemma. If he has a delimitation now, Members of Parliament will sit in this House for another two and a half years representing constituencies which no longer exist. If he has it next year after the provincial election, we will have provincial councillors representing constituencies which no longer exist. If you have it after the general election you will have the same thing for Members of Parliament. That is why I ask the Minister whether he has come to a decision on the matter because it seems clear that it is inevitable that you will have either provincial councillors or Members of Parliament representing non-existent seats for a portion of their period of office, and if that is so it would seem that this, being the higher body, should have the new constituencies, and it would be quite unreasonable to delay the delimitation to 1967, the latest possible date to which it can be delayed, and to have the situation applying for nearly five years where some members of this House would be representing hardly anyone at all, while others would represent more than the number of voters they should represent. That is the position which I asked the Minister to clarify. But there is another problem which I hope the Minister may be able to deal with immediately, and that is the re-aligning of polling district boundaries. The electoral officers have the power to change polling districts, but it seems that some directive should be given, and I would ask the Minister to give that directive. There are polling districts in existence to-day which are quite ridiculous, with from two to five voters. There are others which, due to the building of new roads, have become equally ridiculous. In an election which has taken place this week there is one polling district where voters must travel through three other polling districts to get to their own polling station. It is a simple matter and it is not controversial. It does not affect the constituencies, nor the over-all pattern, and I would ask the Minister to consider issuing an instruction to all electoral officers to call for recommendations from the political parties in their areas and to initiate the action which is necessary to clear up that position.</p>

<p>The next point, associated with the electoral procedure, is in connection with the new registration forms for voters, the new RVI&#x2019;s which people have to fill in. The first point I wish to raise is the question on that form in regard to citizenship. [Time limit.]</p>

<speech by="#badenhorst">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BADENHORST</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down raised a few interesting matters here but in doing so he also revealed his ignorance. As far as the delimitation of polling districts is concerned the hon. member ought to know that the parties were given the opportunity before the last general <span class="col_5771-5772" refersTo="page_219"/>election to make recommendations in this regard and it is certainly not the fault of the hon. the Minister if the hon. member&#x2019;s party did not co-operate. I do not want this afternoon to criticize the recent registration of voters but I am sure the hon. the Minister will forgive me if I air one or two complaints. When he introduced the Electoral Laws Amendment Bill the hon. the Minister expressed the hope that every voter would be registered. He also expressed his concern over the fact that all voters were not registered. I must say to my sorrow this afternoon&#x2014;and I want to prove it&#x2014;that at the last general registration of voters it looked as though there had been a general disenfranchisement of voters&#x2014;at least in some parts of the country. I just want to mention a few figures to show what happened in the Port Elizabeth-Uitenhage complex.</p>

<p>No fewer than 10,000 voters have disappeared from the Voters&#x2019; Roll since the supplementary registration in 1961. In 1961 there were 86,651 voters registered in the five constituencies concerned. Now, after the general registration, there are 76,418 voters. This loss of 10,000 voters is made up as follows: There are 2,329 fewer voters on the Voters&#x2019; Roll in Port Elizabeth (Central); 2,220 fewer in Port Elizabeth (North); 1,353 fewer in Port Elizabeth (South), 2,174 fewer in Port Elizabeth (West) and 1,127 fewer in the Uitenhage constituency [Interjection.] I do not rejoice in it like my hon. friends here to my right. On the contrary, I am worried about it. It is not my intention to accuse the hon. the Minister or his officials in this regard. I attribute this to the poor system of registration. I want to mention what happened in the Uitenhage constituency, for example.</p>

<p>No fewer than 191 applications for registration were rejected at Uitenhage and the reason for rejection was practically the same in every case, and that is: &#x201C;Application form not signed by witness,&#x201D; or &#x201C;application form not signed by applicant&#x201D;. This is what happens when the people appointed to do this work have no knowledge of the work at all and in many cases do not have the necessary sense of responsibility to do this work properly. I want to mention one example. In one of my polling districts, Bethalsdorp, there were 118 voters on the roll before the general registration. After they had been re-registered, and after the names of others had been added to the list, there were only 66 on the list. It may be contended that there was no expansion in this area. Let us accept that there was no expansion to speak of but after all the population did increase. In 1961 there were columns of advertisements offering houses for sale or to rent whereas to-day there are columns of advertisements inserted by people who are looking for houses. In other words, the houses which were unoccupied at the time are now occupied, so the number of voters must have increased. But there is also another factor. I have made a survey of the new houses that have been built in my constituency; 461 new houses have been built during this period and if we assume that three registered voters are accommodated in each of these houses it means that there should be an additional 1,400 voters there. But in the result there were 1,100 fewer voters after the registration! It seems to me therefore that in a constituency like Uitenhage between 2,500 and 3,000 voters have been disenfranchised instead of being registered as voters. It disturbs one to think that the State spends money to have people registered. At the same time, under the Electoral Act, people can be prosecuted if they do not register. We are pleased that the State does not prosecute them but that is the state of affairs that we have to-day.</p>

<p>The solution to this matter is very simple. If the hon. the Minister and his Department decide to remunerate the enumerators, the people who undertake the registration, on a <i>per capita</i> basis&#x2014;20 cents or 25 cents per voter or whatever the case may be&#x2014;we will find in the first place that these people will do very much better work. But there is something else we need in order to be assured of good work and that is that the people who undertake the registration ought to account for every house in the town. That is not done. After all, it is easy to obtain information from the municipality as to which premises are occupied and which are not occupied.</p>

<p>I only have these few suggestions to make. If the hon. the Minister did not have so little money at his disposal I would ask him to consider the question of having this registration done over again.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to complete the point I was raising with the Minister in regard to the registration cards, firstly in regard to the question on that form as to citizenship. This is an extremely misleading question. It asks whether you have at any time given up your South African citizenship. Out of the rejected applications a very large percentage are rejected because of that question and the answer given to it, to the effect that people have given up South African citizenship. They are people who have gone to live in Rhodesia temporarily, or in other territories where, because they had the vote, they assumed that they had given up South African citizenship. But they are South Africans and they have never lost their South African citizenship; they have come back retaining it. Yet thousands of applications are rejected on the ground of citizenship. It is probably one of the biggest causes for refusing registration. I would appeal to the Minister firstly to change the wording of that question so that it merely reads: &#x201C;Are you a South African citizen? If you have previously held any other citizenship, by what right do you now claim South African citizenship?&#x201D; If it were worded in the positive sense, in other words, if you had any other nationality at any time and you consider yourself to be a South African now, by what right do you claim that, then people would understand it. But as it is now, they merely get <span class="col_5773-5774" refersTo="page_220"/>a form to say: &#x201C;You are not registered because you are not a South African citizen.&#x201D; When a person gets that, what action can he take? He can only fill in a new card and where they said &#x201C;Yes&#x201D; last time they fill in &#x201C;No&#x201D; this time. There is no other practical step they can take to get back on to the roll. I am sure it is not the intention to victimize people or to take them off the roll wholesale, but that is the effect of it.</p>

<p>Another weakness on that form is that people living in townships where there is no postal service give their plot or street number, which is quite useless in so far as the organization of the political parties is concerned. I would ask that consideration be given to this question being worded in such a way that it reads that if this is not the postal address they must also state the postal address. There are a number of small townships in the outskirts of the major cities where they have streets and they have numbers, but there are no post office facilities. There is no way of contacting those people except by going from door to door. In the event of a query, of their not being in the Voters&#x2019; Roll, or being transferred, you cannot write them a letter. You have to go there to see them individually, and usually they are people who are not there during the day, and it becomes a very difficult problem. Therefore I ask that consideration be given to that aspect.</p>

<p>The third point is this. I think that in this year 1964 we could please have proper English on the RVI&#x2019;s. It is really shocking and it makes your hair curl, to see &#x201C;acquired&#x201D; spelt &#x201C;aqired&#x201D;. It is just a little thing, but I think it should receive attention.</p>

<p>The next point I wish to raise is the one which was also raised by the hon. member for Uitenhage (Mr. Badenhorst). I agree with him that the registration is sadly lacking in results. There were doubts expressed about the procedure and the Minister met those doubts last year to the extent of agreeing that a supplementary roll would be brought into effect before an election was held on the new Voter&#x2019;s Roll, but even that supplementary roll has not filled all the gaps, and I think something will have to be done by the Minister to ensure that the next general registration is done on a very different basis. I remember the assurances we were given, about the wonderful new system where you would have a leader in charge of an area who would check on each of his people, and it was said to be foolproof, but unfortunately it was not and something will have to be done. We cannot have another registration just prior to an election which will have the same results as this one. The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) pointed out what the position was in regard to the Coloured voters in respect of this general registration, and that a large number of people were disfranchised thereby. Without going into details, I would merely appeal to the Minister to give this matter his urgent attention. I think we will have to find quite a different method to ensure a proper registration next time. Perhaps the trouble lies in the miserable pay these people receive, the R20 which was paid to the enumerators. If there were a better incentive, it might perhaps help the position. But something has to be done to see that more conscientious people do the work and that the results are better controlled, to ensure that we do not have the gaps we have in this registration. I do not want to take the matter any further, but I bring these few administrative matters to the Minister&#x2019;s attention in the hope that he will be able to deal with them.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">E. G. MALAN</person>:</from>

<p>This afternoon the Minister, when I spoke on the publications Board, saw fit to make a lengthy personal attack on me on account of certain things I had said about the board itself. I challenge the Minister to tell me where I even mentioned the name of a single member of that board and where I made a personal attack on any one of them. I made three statements in regard to them. The first was that there were a large number of Broederbonders on the board. If that is an underhand attack, it is for the Minister to say so. I said, secondly, that there was provincialism in the appointments, and thirdly, that there was not a fair proportion between the Afrikaans and the English members on the board. However, there is another matter I wish to raise.</p>

<p>This afternoon, after 13 long years, we at last have the bomb of the report of the Press Commission laid on the Table. The summary we have is incomplete, I admit, and it is probably difficult at this stage to form a comprehensive opinion of the details of the report. So we do not know whether this is an atomic bomb, a fizz, a water-pistol or a dud. However, certain things are reasonably clear from the report itself. It appears that this Press Commission which has sat for 13 years has not yet had the opportunity of actually dealing with the contents of the South African Press. I refer to the paragraph on page 2, which says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The third portion of the Press Report was designed to deal with the contents of the South African Press. In view of the large amount of work involved and the considerable length of time which would be involved effectively to complete this portion, the commission felt that it should be relieved of the obligation to report upon this matter.</block>

<p>So one wonders what this commission has been doing for the past 13 years. When one looks at the 130 pages, one thing which strikes one is that the Press Commission feels that the majority of the reports sent overseas by the representatives of newspapers abroad and of news agencies are either unsatisfactory or bad or very bad. In fact, there is a very wide field of attack on all these different agencies.</p>

<p>Of SAPA the report says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5775-5776" refersTo="page_221"/>SAPA&#x2019;s reporting of the political and racial scene shows a lack of insight into South African affairs. The political problems were virtually never reported against the historical background or in relation to the linguistic or racial reality in South Africa, and the Government&#x2019;s policy was either not reported or insufficiently reported.</block>

<p>Later on a further attack is made, or let me rather say, a statement made. I do not wish to regard these as attacks, but rather as statements. It is said that in SAPA&#x2019;s reporting as a whole during the 1960 period there was a lack of balance and perspective. Associated Press, a huge world-wide agency, comes in for further comment. The commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The selection of the racial and political news sent by the full-time correspondents and by the stringers was classified as bad and very bad and was so biased that it amounted to a distortion of the South African racial and political scene.</block>

<p>The United Press is attacked in similar terms. I believe that about 80 per cent of the reporting of United Press was regarded as bad. The Agence France-Presse comes in for a similar attack, and nearly all other reports which went over to Britain and to the U.S.A. are condemned in this report. In fact, I do not think there is a single outstanding newspaper in the world which does not come in for criticism in this report. Among the papers criticized are the <i>New York Post,</i> the <i>London Times</i> and the <i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>It is interesting to see the comments under the heading of &#x201C;Garbled and Dishonest&#x201D; which are made in regard to the <i>New York Times.</i> Commenting on the reporting done for the <i>New York Times</i> during this period, the commission states that the <i>New York Times</i> received from its representatives a garbled and dishonest report upon the South African political and racial scene&#x2014;and so it goes on. The point is that we have during the past years been hearing of the possibility of steps being taken against the Press. We have heard threats over the S.A.B.C. as to what would happen when this report was published. Now the report has been published and we have it before us in an abbreviated form. It is quite natural that there has been a great deal of curiosity throughout the country as to what steps the Government is going to take in this connection. On one side there may have been joy; on the part of a great many people, I am sure, there has been alarm and uncertainty and dismay as to what will be the outcome of this Press Report.</p>

<p>There is one main recommendation in it&#x2014;in fact there is only one recommendation in it as far as I can see&#x2014;and that is that the Government should bring in a law to set up a Press Council, which will then take over much of the work done by the present Press Board of Reference and exercise discipline over and possibly control and advise the Press in South Africa. With these important recommendations in this report and with the suggestion that a board should be set up consisting of journalists and editors, representatives of the public and even of the Government and the Opposition, it is essential that the Minister should let the House and the country know as soon as possible, even possibly this evening, first of all whether he accepts the recommendations contained in this report; If so, which of these recommendations does he regard as important and does he primarily accept; secondly, does he intend introducing legislation this year in regard to this matter and can he give us a general outline of that legislation; thirdly, when can we expect such legislation; fourthly, is he contemplating any other steps in connection with the Press in South Africa and can he tell us what those steps are going to be; fifthly, can he tell us whether there is a possibility&#x2014;I hope there is&#x2014;of also bringing the S.A. Broadcasting Corporation under this particular Press Council. I believe that having regard to the great interest shown in the Press report, having regard to the fact that it has covered almost the whole of the world&#x2019;s Press&#x2014;newspapers in France, in Germany, in Holland, in America and in Britain&#x2014;the whole world is probably waiting to hear what the hon. the Minister intends to do in regard to this report. I am sure that he will be studying it most assiduously and that the uncertainty which exists at the moment in the minds of the people who are concerned about the freedom of the Press in South Africa, will be removed as soon as possible, and that we shall soon hear from the hon. the Minister.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I want to reply immediately to the questions put to me by the hon. member who has just sat down. He asked five questions but it is not necessary to give five replies. His questions can be answered quite briefly. This report was Tabled precisely 4&#x00BC; hours ago. In order to avoid any suggestion of leakage even none of my colleagues was given a copy of the report. The Press received the report 4&#x00BC; hours ago. It is a voluminous report consisting of 14 volumes, together with annexures. It is almost <span class="col_5777-5778" refersTo="page_222"/>impossible for one person to handle it. For example, I could not carry it to the Table myself. It is an important report; it has taken years to draw up the report and the Government is certainly not going to allow itself to be rushed by the Opposition. It is not going to allow the Opposition to dictate to it when it should take its decision and what that decision should be. Nor does the Government at this moment share the fear of the Opposition that there is any degree of uncertainty in the minds of the public as to the intentions of the Government. I can perhaps go so far as to express the personal opinion that I do not think the Government will be able to introduce legislation during the present Session; that is to say, if it does decide to introduce legislation. This is not such a simple matter; there will be a great deal of work connected with legislation of this kind. This report will have to be studied. I just want to make it clear that we will not allow ourselves to be hurried by anybody because, after all, the responsibility for taking a decision in this regard rests upon our shoulders.</p>

<p>While I am on my feet I also want to reply to a few other matters that have been raised here. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) advanced a number of good arguments to which I want to reply. As far as the delimitation of polling districts is concerned, the hon. member for Uitenhage (Mr. Badenhorst) and other hon. members have pointed out that every political party and all members of the House of Assembly are always at liberty to inform the Department that in their opinion the polling districts in the constituencies which they represent were wrongly demarcated. Before a delimitation takes place the Department investigates, surveys and divides the polling districts into blocks, and these proposals are then submitted to the Delimitation Commission. The difficulty is that representations in this regard are always received too late. Hon. members should make representations about their polling districts while the delimitation is in progress. Let every constituency put forward its suggestions now; let every political party do so. All the political parties are free to raise the matter at any time and attention will be given to it.</p>

<p>The hon. member referred to the entry form and complained about the long series of questions which have to be answered. I can give him the assurance that a very simplified form is with the printers at the moment; his main objection to that form will therefore disappear. There are, of course, certain questions which will have to remain because that information is required by other bodies.</p>

<p>The hon. member wants to know when the next delimitation is going to take place. Unless the Act is amended, the next delimitation, as hon. members know, must take place before 1967. The Government has not yet decided when that delimitation should take place. The Government may perhaps decide to amend the Act in order to postpone the delimitation; I merely mention this as a possibility. I can give the hon. member no definite information in regard to the date of the next delimitation.</p>

<p>The hon. member need not worry about that. The Act provides that there shall be a delimitation at least once every 10 years. I can only tell the hon. member that if the Act is not amended a delimitation will take place before that period expires. He must contain his curiosity for a while. I have admitted that the registration was badly done. The hon. members for Durban (Point) and Uitenhage complained about this. That will always be the case. Even if we were to double the remuneration we would still not be able to hire the necessary people to do this work in view of the shortage of manpower. The political parties must help. But the position is really not as bad as hon. members have suggested. We had a general registration in 1958 and another one in 1963. Let me compare the figures for the two registrations. In the Transvaal 726,000 people were registered in 1958 and 829,000 people were registered in 1963. In the Cape, 553,000 people were registered in 1958 and 576,000 in 1963. That was an improvement. In the Orange Free State, 154,000 were registered in 1958 and 155,000 in 1963. In Natal, 168,000 were registered in 1958 and 195,000 in 1963. In South West Africa, 34,000 were registered in 1958 and 35,500 in 1963. The grand total for 1963 was 1,792,702 and for 1958, 1,628,885. I am not boasting when I mention these figures; I just want to remove the wrong impression that was given that this work was done very badly. It may have been done badly in the Port Elizabeth complex but that was not the case generally. Hon. members must also remember that a great deal of dead wood is removed after five years; some people have died in the meantime and others have moved but their names are still on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. That is why one has a general registration. On the other hand, those of us who have had experience of registration work know how difficult it is to find certain people at home. I refer to flat-dwellers and people like commercial travellers who move around. They have to sign the forms themselves. The forms are left at their homes but are never returned. That is why I feel that it is in the interests of the parties themselves to register their own supporters. A few additional registrations are always made in this way. The hon. member had a great deal to say about the RP1 form. I was shocked to see how poor the English was. From the nature of things one is not always able to give attention to all these minor matters. I want to assure the hon. member that I appreciate the remarks that he made. We shall go into all of them. We shall amend the RP1 form where necessary in order to make it clearer because our idea is not to keep people off the roll but to register them.</p>

<from><span class="col_5779-5780" refersTo="page_223"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Minister, having castigated the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) gave me &#x201C;the soft answer that turneth away wrath&#x201D;, which I appreciate&#x2014;but it was not an answer to my question. It is not sufficient, I submit to the hon. the Minister, to say to me that in regard to the matter I raised about the type of films which are shown regardless of restrictions as to age groups at Drive-Ins, for example, I should address myself to the Minister of Justice. I submit it is not enough for the hon. the Minister to tell me that once he and the Publications Control Board have assessed a film as to the categories of persons who may not see that film, he and the board are no longer concerned with the matter, and that if there is anything wrong with the way in which the law is carried out, I should address myself to the hon. the Minister of Justice. He places me in a very difficult position. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that his relationship with the hon. the Minister of Justice is better than mine. I do not claim the existence of any friendship between the Minister of Justice and myself, nor do I happen to be in the Cabinet. The implementation of a law involves Cabinet responsibility, and the Publications and Entertainments Act is a law which the Minister told us last year was of the utmost importance in order to save what was left of the morals of the people of South Africa, as one hon. member on that side put it, and in order to ensure that South Africa&#x2019;s growing children and youth would not be contaminated by the moral turpitude which would otherwise be spread throughout the country unless we had the Publications and Entertainments Act, and unless we had the Publications Control Board! Now we find that the hon. the Minister&#x2014;very clumsily&#x2014;side-steps me by saying: &#x201C;I am shocked by what you have told the Committee this afternoon about the way children are allowed to see practically any film, but it is not my business and not that of the board&#x201D;. I want to remind him that provision is made in the same Act for very severe penalties to be visited on those who do not comply with it. There is imprisonment as well as a fine. There is provision for a heavy fine even for the first offence. I think it goes up to R2,000 plus imprisonment for six months for the second offence, and so on. The fact of the matter is that the people concerned with cinemas and drive-ins, perhaps more particularly drive-ins, ignore this law completely. I want to give the hon. the Minister one example why he cannot be heard to say this is the concern of the Minister of Justice; after all the portfolio which he graces happens to have under its control the implementation of this Act and the activities of the board which was set up under that Act.</p>

<p>The example I want to give is the film to which I have referred before, &#x201C;Showdown&#x201D;. I spoke to Mr. van Wyk, the Deputy-Chairman, of the Publications Control Board on the telephone on the 6th of this month. He very courteously gave me the information I sought. I gave him the name of the film and asked him what certificate the board issued in respect of it. He said, a C certificate. That means that only Natives are excluded from audiences that may see it. I want to ask the hon. the Minister a question. Does that mean that children of any age may see this particular film? When you see an advertisement which is headed: &#x201C;Children under 10 free&#x201D;&#x2014;that is the case in respect of all films shown at Drive-ins&#x2014;and when the film &#x201C;Showdown&#x201D; is described as being &#x201C;for action-lovers, gun-hot with evil, stormy with hate, blasted with lawless men revealing the true historic facts of the West&#x2019;s most shocking chain-gang-goal, where men are trapped like wild animals&#x201D;, does the hon. the Minister suggest that if this is in fact the contents of the film, the Publications Control Board should have passed it so that it be shown to children of all ages, and that, to add insult to injury, for nothing!? They can see this type of film for nothing, whereas I and others have struggled with the hon. the Minister for years to provide cultural amenities for our youth in the form of music, ballet, theatre, opera, etc., and to provide the necessary finance for it. Yet now, through the non-operation of the Act, children are allowed to see &#x201C;free&#x201D; entertainment of this sort! Who is the custodian of the public morals&#x2014;the hon. the Minister or I? Why does he put me in a position of having to go to the Minister of Justice to inform him that his colleague, the hon. the Minister of the Interior, has a board, called the Publications Control Board, which passes films described like this with a C certificate, which means that all children can see it? Furthermore, that they take no notice of the fact that certain people are under a legal obligation to ensure that children are not admitted at all to certain films, and that they go even beyond that and advertise that children will be admitted free of charge! Why is this only my business? All of a sudden I have been appointed as custodian of the public morals! The Minister asks me to go to his colleague, the Minister of Justice, and make representations. Obviously, Sir, I cannot be placed in such a position, while the hon. Minister goes scot-free.</p>

<p>On these grounds, I want to appeal again to the hon. the Minister. It is not a question whether he or I wish to see a particular film, but it is a question of whether this law is necessary; it is a question of whether it is being implemented; and of whether he, as Minister, will now take the necessary steps to see that it is implemented. Let me give the hon. the Minister another example which might be brought to his attention any day from now. There is a certain film which has already started the circuit, as they call it, although it has not yet reached the drive-ins. But it is coming&#x2014;I can promise anybody interested or concerned that it will be coming! This is a film called &#x201C;Beach Party&#x201D;. In the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 14 March 1964 this &#x201C;Party&#x201D; is being advertised as follows &#x2026;</p>

<p>No. What is more, I cannot afford to go and see all these films. But I can tell the hon. the Minister what, apparently with the permission of the Publications Control Board and with the blessing of the Minister, is coming&#x2026;with the approval of the Minister, I say, unless he takes certain steps about the matter. Now, this film was advertised as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Teenagers, one and all! Roll up for the greatest fun-filled show of the century!</block>

<p>So, point No. 1 is that you have here a direct appeal to the teenagers, to the youngsters, in other words, of this country. Point No. 2, then it says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Ten thousand kids meet on 5,000 beach blankets!</block>

<p>That, Sir, means two to one blanket. Anybody can work that out! Point No. 3&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The inside story of what goes on when the sun has gone down, the moon has come up and the water is too cold for surfing!</block>

<p>Point No. 4: if there is any doubt about the nature of this film, then read what is said in the panel&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">What is more, this is Ava. Her idea of a vacation is two weeks in Boys&#x2019; Town!</block>

<p>Then the dates of release at the various cinemas are given and right at the bottom it says, quite proudly: &#x201C;A Ster Film release&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Now, what I want to tell the hon. the Minister is that we must make up our minds and say either that there is censorship, or that we have no censorship of films whatsoever&#x2026;that is the position in some other countries. I am not prepared to say now whether I support either the one or the other standpoint. There are, however, countries where there is no censorship of films whatsoever. In certain states in the United States of America, for instance, there is no censorship in this connection, whatsoever. There you can take a baby of one year or a boy of 13 to the most vicious type of sexual film, in which every type of sexual perversion is being illustrated quite openly. Now, either we have this situation in South Africa, too, or we have the situation which we were led to believe was going to be created by the passing of the Publications and Entertainments Act last year, and by the establishment of this very expensive board&#x2014;namely, a situation in which the board would be capable of enforcing its decisions, decisions which would always be on the side of the protection of the morals of the people, especially the young people of South Africa. In all honesty, we cannot have a situation which is in between these two situations. I have only given the Minister a few examples of the type of film that is being advertised nowadays. I cannot give him details of all the films that are even on this very day being advertised all over South Africa. But judging from those few examples I have quoted, there is something peculiar about the approach of the board to this question, about the approach of the Government and the Department of Justice to this matter&#x2014;because not a single infringement has been noted in four years at drive-ins&#x2014;and that despite the fact that policemen and other authorized persons are entitled to enter free of charge! Despite all these legal provisions, apparently nothing, in the eyes of the Government, is necessary to be done about the situation we have to-day.</p>

<speech by="#radford">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to a group of people who have suffered an unfortunate hardship through having lost their vote. There are, particularly in the coastal areas of Natal, a large number of people who for years have voted on the Common Roll. They were on the Common Roll because they were accepted as Whites. Their children went on the whole to White schools and lived in White areas. In Natal there are two separate groups of Coloured people. There is, in the first instance, the ordinary Coloured group who is very similar to the Coloureds of the Cape but with the exception that those in Natal do not speak Afrikaans but English being as they are a cross between non-Whites and Englishmen. In this group fall the family of John Dunn for instance and those groups in the northern areas around Dannhauser and elsewhere. They live more or less in groups consisting of single families. Then there is a second group of Coloureds in Natal who either came from Mauritius or from the island of Reunion or are the descendants of the people who came from these islands.</p>

<p>At one time there were a large number of these people employed on the Railways. During the time of the Natal Government the senior civil engineer came from Mauritius. He, knowing the reliability of his people, invited more of them to come over and join him to build the Natal railways. Others again came over on account of the sugar industry. There are many of them employed in that industry to-day, working side by side with their White colleagues and living in White areas. But a fairly high proportion of these people has since been classified as Coloureds. As long as they were regarded as Whites, they were on the Common Roll and when the Coloureds in the Cape were taken off the Common Roll, the Coloureds in Natal were left on that roll.</p>

<p><i>Publication of Recommendations of Select Committee</i></p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>My attention was drawn this morning to articles which appeared in certain newspapers yesterday and which published the recommendations of the Select Committee on the subject of the Motor Vehicle Insurance Amendment Bill before the report of the committee had been published. This was clearly a contravention of Standing <span class="col_5793-5794" refersTo="page_230"/>Order No. 185 which provides that the proceedings of, the evidence taken by, or the report of any select committee, or a summary of such proceedings, evidence or report, shall not be published by any member of such committee, or by any other person, until the report of such committee has been printed by order of this House.</p>

<p>The members who supplied the information on which the articles were based have informed me that as the report of the select committee was presented yesterday they were under the impression that the provisions of Standing Order No. 185 no longer applied. They now realized their error and apologized to me and to the House for their action.</p>

<p>The parliamentary reporters of the newspapers concerned were under the same impression and have also apologized for publishing the articles.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances I feel that no further action need be taken but I should like to emphasize, as Mr. Speaker Jansen did in 1935, that the report of a select committee does not become public property when it is presented to the House but only when it has been printed and made available to members.</p>

<heading>PNEUMOCONIOSIS COMPENSATION AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Pneumoconiosis Compensation Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>In my reply to the debate on the second reading of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act in this House in 1962 I gave the assurance that if defects were found in the Act I would be prepared to remedy them. The Act has now been in operation for 17 months and during that time technical oversights of a minor nature have been discovered in the practical application of the Act. The object of this Bill is to remedy those technical oversights.</p>

<p>I expect some hon. members in this House to allege that the 1962 Act was too hastily steamrollered through the House and that they expected me to come back. I just want to say to those hon. members that, except in one case, no change is suggested in this Bill which affects any principle. The amendments that are suggested are mostly purely and simply intended to ensure that certain beneficiaries will retain the rights they had under previous legislation or that they will also benefit by the increased payments.</p>

<p>In this connection I also wish to direct hon. members&#x2019; attention to the fact that over the past months there have been discussions between the Chamber of Mines and the mine trade unions with a view to the introduction of a completely new system of pneumoconiosis compensation. I as Minister of Mines was officially informed of a broad agreement arrived at between these two groups, the Chamber of Mines and the mine trade unions. I have not had an opportunity of meeting these people again, although they advised me at the outset of their plans. I hope to meet the mine trade unions and the Chamber of Mines towards the end of this week, when they will give me the details of the agreement they have entered into. Hon. members will realize, therefore, that because of the possibilities that await us, if we should accept those suggestions, it would be inadvisable at this stage to effect any changes to the principles of the Pneumoconiosis Compensation Act of 1962. I may also inform hon. members that I have consulted the mine trade unions and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union jointly in regard to this legislation to ascertain whether they were of the opinion that this legislation should be kept back until more comprehensive legislation could be introduced. Both of them replied that they agreed with the legislation and that we should continue with it.</p>

<p>As hon. members know, we have had a series of laws since 1911 in connection with pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis compensation. In each one of those Acts kinds of benefits and categories of beneficiaries were created and by now it has become a highly involved business, when new legislation is drafted, to ensure that the existing rights of each category of beneficiaries are carried forward. It is often only when the wording of certain provisions in the law are analysed in finer detail in their practical application that it is discovered that the rights of individual exceptional beneficiaries are not sufficiently protected. That has already happened in the past and it has again happened now. That can hardly be avoided. Those are the sort of technical problems and omissions which will probably never be discovered in this House no matter how much time is devoted to the legislation.</p>

<p>I just want to mention a few matters that are being put right. Under previous legislation a few widowed mothers of deceased mineworkers received pensions on the ground that they were dependent on their sons and that on the death of those mineworkers they did not leave any other dependants. The 1962 Act provides for those pensions to continue to be paid to them, but a minor amendment is necessary in order to be able to pay them the increased widow&#x2019;s pension as well. There are six such cases. Then there are five cases of orphans over the age of 18 years who received pensions because of permanent physical disability. In their cases too a minor amendment is necessary to enable them to enjoy the benefit of the increased pensions.</p>

<p>Under the 1946 Act an increased pension was granted to approximately 46 orphans under 18 years of age because they did not <span class="col_5795-5796" refersTo="page_231"/>have any other source of income or anybody to look after them. An amendment is necessary, however, in order to be able to continue to pay the increased pension to them (at most double the basic pension), otherwise it will only be possible to pay them the basic pension.</p>

<p>Hon. members will see, therefore, that only exceptional cases demand special attention and that they are exceptions to the general rule. They were only discovered when the pensions were adjusted in each individual case and when I tell hon. members that approximately 15,000 adjustments had to be made they will realize how difficult it is to make provision to cover every individual case.</p>

<p>Then there is an amendment which empowers us to give the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions the right to pay an allowance to those beneficiaries who, as a result of the increased pneumoconiosis pension they received, would have had to sacrifice their old-age and other social pensions, an allowance which will ensure that their total income (i.e. pneumoconiosis pension plus old-age pension) is not less than they received before. As hon. members know, old-age and disability pensions are subject to a means test. The increase in the pneumoconiosis pension, which is taken into account for the purposes of the means test, would in some cases have meant that those other pensions would have fallen away and those persons would actually have been prejudiced by the increase in the pneumoconiosis pension. In those cases the full pneumoconiosis pension is paid to-day and it is supplemented by an allowance from the Department of Social Welfare and Pensions. Taken together, this ensures that they still receive the amount they received previously.</p>

<p>Provision is also made for the payment of a special grant to the widow or dependant children of deceased mineworkers who received a pension in respect of tuberculosis before their death. In such a case the widow and the children are not entitled to a pension and the general Pneumoconiosis Compensation Board is now authorized to make special grants in deserving cases. I wish to make it clear that it was not the intention in the original Act that the persons concerned in any of the cases I have mentioned should not benefit by the increased payments under the new Act. They were purely technical oversights when the legislation was drafted and in the meantime adjustments were made administratively in expectation of these amendments.</p>

<p>Except for a few other minor amendments of an administrative nature, <i>inter alia,</i> the calculation of funds for compensation to Bantu and the accounting between the general Pneumoconiosis Compensation Board and the Department of Bantu Administration and Development; to prevent the possibility of more than one pension being paid to the same person under the Act; and to facilitate the collection of outstanding debts from some smaller mines, there is only one other amendment of importance which calls for an explanation.</p>

<p>At the moment the law places a total prohibition on people who have been found to suffer from tuberculosis from working in any dusty atmosphere. If a person has once been found to suffer from tuberculosis he is never again allowed to work in a dusty atmosphere. This provision has been in operation since 1912 and since then it has been inserted in every Act. This is somewhat of a contentious matter and there is a measure of difference of opinion amongst doctors on the question of whether cured tuberculosis sufferers, under proper supervision, should be allowed to work in a dusty atmosphere. What is well known&#x2014;and all are agreed on this&#x2014;is that there is a dangerous relationship between silica dust and tuberculosis, and dominant medical opinion throughout the world is that it is indeed most undesirable and even dangerous to expose tuberculosis sufferers, even after they have undergone what can be regarded as a complete cure, without any restriction, to dust and the strenuous demands of underground conditions. That remains a fact and at this stage I am not prepared to relax the policy in this regard. But this is also a question, however, where each case must be considered on its merits. There are cases, particularly where the tuberculosis was discovered at a very early stage, where the treatment was very effective and where the persons will not suffer any harm by being slightly exposed to dust. I particularly have in mind people who work above ground but whose work demands that they occasionally go underground for short periods at a time to do inspection work or to perform a special task. For example, there are mine managers, assistant mine managers and certain technicians who have to go underground twice or three times per month at the most and then only for a few hours at a time.</p>

<p>The existing restriction hits these people very hard and it hits the mining industry equally hard. Very often it is the efficient and experienced officials and workers of the mining industry who are thus prevented from going underground. It is felt that the Bureau should be given limited discretion in such cases in order to allow persons, who have been effectively cured, to go underground for limited periods. Clause 2 of the Bill provides for this but the number of periods they will be allowed to work underground are limited to three, 64 hours at the most, i.e. eight shifts over any 30-day period.</p>

<p>I just want to say that this concession on the part of the medical men is recommended and welcomed. On the one hand it will give great relief to certain workers and also to the industry, and on the other hand it will enable the doctors, by way of an experiment, to try to find an answer to the contentious question of whether tuberculosis sufferers, after effective treatment, should be allowed to continue to work in a dusty atmosphere. I want to give the assurance, however, that this matter <span class="col_5797-5798" refersTo="page_232"/>will be handled with the utmost care. The Bureau will co-operate with such centres as the Springkell Sanatorium and others where these people are treated, to ensure that such persons will continually be under strict medical supervision, and if there is the slightest indication that it affects them adversely the concession will immediately be withdrawn in individual cases according to circumstances. Nor shall I hesitate to have it deleted from the Act if it appears that the concession is dangerous.</p>

<p>I want to repeat that at this stage, in view of medical advice, I am not prepared to relax the general principle that tuberculosis sufferers should not be allowed to work in a dusty atmosphere unrestricted. By way of an experiment, however, I am prepared to make this limited concession so that the doctors, in their discretion, may meet deserving cases where they are convinced that short periods in a dusty atmosphere will not do any harm.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to say that all the amendments suggested in the Bill have been approved by the General Pneumoconiosis Compensation Board, i.e. by the employers and the employees. Most of the amendments were requested or recommended by the board.</p>

<speech by="#tucker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TUCKER</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House welcome this Bill. All of us in this House appreciate just what an important part mining plays in this country of ours and what a very important part has been played by the original discoverers of the various reefs and outcrops, the entrepreneurs, those who preceded them, the scientists and the technicians. All of us are very conscious of the fact that in this process of the development of our mining industry, particularly our gold-mining industry and certain other forms of mining, many of our citizens and others who have come to this country have had their health damaged, in many cases beyond repair. Those people have always enjoyed the utmost sympathy of both sides of the House, whatever Government has been in power. Sir, we recognize the contribution made by these people, and when we find that things have gone wrong it is only right that the law should be amended. Leaving aside for the moment the last very important matter to which the hon. the Minister has referred affecting the right of persons who have had tuberculosis to work underground, I would like to say that we believe it is right that this Bill should pass the second reading. We welcome most of these provisions which do represent an improvement. But I am very glad that the hon. the Minister did refer to certain criticism which was put forward at the time when the original measure was before this House. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister indicated that the nature of the amendment before the House showed that that criticism was not justified. Sir, that criticism that this was rushed legislation and that legislation of this sort should not be rushed has been abundantly justified by what has happened since the passing of the original measure. We were asked to pass that Bill at short notice; we recognized that it was an important measure, but we reserved to ourselves the right to criticism, as we did at that time, the way in which this measure was brought before this House. Sir, a measure of this sort, if it is at all possible&#x2014;and the Government should make it possible&#x2014;should be introduced into this House and referred to a select committee so that all the various provision can be carefully examined.</p>

<p>Sir, in discussing the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Vote last year I referred to this matter in quite strong language and said that it had been found that there were errors in this measure. The hon. the Minister knows that it was necessary for him to give certain directives which to a certain extent put matters right. Now we have before us a large number of very important amendments which experience has shown should have been incorporated in the original measure. The criticism of this side of the House of the way in which the original measure was put through has been abundantly justified. In saying that I want to make it perfectly clear that we welcome this Bill because we see in it a further step in the right direction. It is, as the hon. the Minister has quite fairly said, filling gaps which existed in the original legislation, gaps which were not spotted at the time. I think the hon. the Minister will agree that neither members on that side nor on this side who take an interest in this subject really have the opportunity of fully fulfilling their functions as Members of Parliament in respect of this legislation in the difficult circumstances which existed. I know that the hon. the Minister himself had to go overseas on very important business but, Sir, I would like to express the hope that the hon. the Minister will bring to the attention of the hon. the Prime Minister the fact that it is essential that in respect of legislation of this sort, which is of a purely technical character, where there is no desire on the part of the Opposition to spend an unduly long time in debating the matter and where the sole aim of both sides is to get the most effective measure on the Statute Book, members of this House should be given the opportunity of playing their full part. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will lay those remarks before his colleague. They are abundantly justified by what has happened in respect of this very important matter.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not wish to traverse the provisions of the Bill in detail. There are very many clauses here which make provision for benefits which persons are already receiving and which are being validated by this Bill. We accept that, Sir, and we will deal with this more fully in the Committee Stage. Perhaps they will be dealt with by other hon. members also in the course of this debate. There are some matters, however, to which I would like to make particular reference. The first of these is the matter on which the hon. the Minister himself spent some time, and that is the very important subject which is dealt with in Clause <span class="col_5799-5800" refersTo="page_233"/>2 of this Bill and which deals with the cases of persons who have suffered from tuberculosis or from pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis. I want to say that we on this side of the House have had the advantage of discussing in our committee with two very distinguished members of the medical profession who sit on this side of the House, one of whom has had immense experience of pneumoconiosis through his practice. The other, while not resident on the Rand, has immense technical knowledge of this subject and is regarded, as the hon. the Minister knows, as an expert on this subject. While we are happy and prepared to agree to pass the provision which makes it possible for a person who has been found to be suffering from tuberculosis or pneumoconiosis but has been cured or the disease rendered non-infectious, to work underground once again under controlled conditions, it is only right that I should say that we have grave reservations. We believe that this is a matter which must be watched very carefully indeed. I throw out the suggestion that to make assurance doubly sure that the permission given can be withdrawn, an amendment should perhaps be moved at the Committee Stage to make it quite clear that any permission granted in terms of this section can be withdrawn by the issuing authority at any time. I believe that that would be a reasonable safeguard. Apart from the difficulties mentioned by the hon. the Minister, I believe there is a great deal to be said for making this experiment&#x2014;and it must be regarded as such&#x2014;obviously this is a provision which does not only affect the ordinary miner, with whom we have the greatest sympathy, but it may well apply to persons who are very distinguished in the medical field and in the technical field, who really cannot make a contribution commensurate with their training unless they have the opportunity of going underground. I have in mind, for instance, some of the senior executives on the mines. They themselves can, of course, contract these diseases. I do stress that we believe that this is a matter which will have to be watched very carefully. Until recently, in the light of modern medical knowledge and modern remedies, the medical profession as a whole has been absolutely opposed to a provision of this sort. We will support this provision but we feel it is right that a warning note should be sounded and that there should be the very closest contacts maintained with all cases where such permission is granted. We feel that they should perhaps be examined more often because, as we all know, if these persons again contract tuberculosis it is possible that they may be able to infect other workers with whom they come into contact. However, the hon. the Minister himself has issued a warning note and I am glad he did so. In spite of the warning note which I have sounded on behalf of this side of the House, and I am sure that some of my medical friends here will add to that warning&#x2014;we feel that we can nevertheless support this provision, but we do hope that the most careful watch will be kept to find out whether in fact the hopes of scientists that this problem has been overcome have been fully realized.</p>

<p>I do not propose to go into the details of the clauses at this stage but I would like to say that I am very glad that the oversights in the legislation of 1962 are now being rectified and that nobody has been prejudiced because the gaps in the law have been discovered and the persons concerned have in effect been paid the amounts to which they would have been entitled if the law had been framed correctly. I hope the Minister will be able to give us the assurance that that has been done in every case. We are very glad to see that two errors are being rectified. Sir, we cannot ever regard legislation of this sort as the final word. One knows that with the advance of medical science there will undoubtedly be further discoveries, and it is possible that as the years go on, if this legislation remains, we will find that it is necessary to make further amendments from time to time.</p>

<p>Finally I wish to refer to another matter raised by the hon. the Minister, namely, the question of the possibility of suggestions being made after consultations between employee and employer of a new approach to this whole question. I have seen references in various technical magazines and publications and I have heard of the discussions which have been going on. We would all welcome it if this very difficult question of pneumoconiosis could be dealt with in the way in which we have learnt under our modern system of industrial democracy with ever so many of the problems which have been so difficult in the past year. If acceptable provisions&#x2014;obviously they will have to be carefully examined not only by the Government but by this side of the House and by the interests involved&#x2014;could be devised it would be a very good thing. If such a system could be evolved it would obviously have to come before this House. I shall not give any final judgment on the matter. This is something which is still under discussion. South Africa can be proud of the fact that in this great mining industry of ours, a mining industry in which in the past there were very grave difficulties between the employers and the employees, the feelings between the employers and employees have improved to the extent they have. It is important that that should be the position in this the greatest of our industries, the industry on which the progress of this country has been so largely based. I understand that in an important matter of this sort there has been considerable progress made in the discussions. Most important of all, I believe, there has been the best of understanding between the two sides in the examination of the possibilities to evolve some such system.</p>

I can assure the hon. the Minister that it will also be watched very closely by those of us on this side of the House who take an interest in this important matter.

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just spoken has said that they welcome this Bill. That, of course, makes the task of the hon. the Minister easier. As explained by the hon. the Minister this is not a Bill which affects any principles. It is preeminently a measure which is aimed at ironing out certain difficulties which have arisen in the administration of the existing miner&#x2019;s phthisis laws. Nobody can object to that and that is also the reason why the hon. the Minister is able to say that all bodies have informed him that he can go ahead with this measure. This is not a measure over which there need be any quibbling or quarrelling.</p>

<p>Like the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker) I also wish to express a hope in this connection, but the hope I wish to express is on a completely different plane from his. I think I can say that they are as far apart as the South Pole is from the North Pole. His is the South Pole and mine is the North Pole. I know it is not necessary for me to try to soften the Minister&#x2019;s heart. I know he feels like most of us feel in this House, i.e. sympathetic towards this matter. No worker in this country gets more sympathy than the mineworker. He always gets that. I trust therefore, Mr. Speaker, that you will allow me to tell you how sensitive I am as far as this matter is concerned. I do not want to say I am allergic to it, because that is not a pretty word; that means contagious and we are to-day dealing with a contagious disease. I am very sensitive as far as this matter is concerned. Sir, and I trust, therefore, that you will allow me to tell the Minister what I am hoping for. I have no doubt but that in the long run the Government and the powers that be will be well disposed towards this matter. Once again we are dealing with a measure of which the Minister could rightly say it was an agreed measure. But I wish to remind the hon. the Minister, both sides of the House and everybody concerned in the matter, that over the past 30 years this is the umpteenth measure dealing with miner&#x2019;s phthisis, silicosis and pneumoconiosis that has been before this House. Every one of them, except the measure which dealt with chest complaints, was an agreed measure. Those agreed measures were the results of negotiations between the mine owners and the employers. They used to come to the Minister and say: &#x201C;This is what we have agreed upon. In other words, this is something good; just put the stamp of legislation on it and everything will be right.&#x201D; But has it ever struck you, Sir, that the one agreed measure after the other has always been a failure? They failed because the people who worked in the mines did not place their trust and hope in those two bodies which had come to an agreement, but in this House. And this House cannot evade its responsibility when we are dealing with the health not only of one section but of the entire nation. Then it is no longer a question of something that must be agreed upon between the employer and the employee but it becomes a national question in connection with which this House cannot and may not evade its responsibility. I know every member will agree with me on that. Where these agreed measures have always disappointed us in the past I would like to add this that I am the last person who will to-day try to wreck the broad agreement which the Minister says may be arrived at. Here I agree with the hon. the Minister and the previous speaker: Let us give them an opportunity of coming forward for the umpteenth time with an agreed measure between themselves. But do not let us ever again in future, when it comes to defining a disease and laying down the scales of compensation, depend on a so-called agreed measure. Experience over the past 30 years justifies me and every hon. member in this House to say that the time has indeed arrived that this House should no longer hide behind agreed measures but that that question should once and for all be investigated by a competent commission, by people who are competent to make recommendations to the Minister, recommendations which he can then submit to this House and refer to a select committee so that we can come forward with something which everybody, outside and inside this House, can accept with joy. I do not think anybody can find fault with that. Before I am interrupted and told that there have already been commissions and commissions and commissions I want to say that the commission I have in mind must investigate matters which have never yet in the whole history of our mining industry been investigated. Mr. Speaker, you will remember that we had the Allan Commission. They did an excellent job of work. After that we had the Beyers Commission which submitted an excellent report. But all that only dealt with the activities of the bureau as such.<span class="col_5803-5804" refersTo="page_235"/>But the extent to which miner&#x2019;s phthisis affects the health of the nation has never yet been investigated.</p>

<p>I am talking about tuberculosis. That person only becomes a danger when he suffers from tuberculosis in which case it becomes a question of the health of the nation. Then it is no longer a question which only affects the industry. I want to ask the Minister, without trying to soften his heart, to have the matter investigated at the highest possible level, not only as far as the Whites are concerned but also as far as the Bantu are concerned. It is very easy to remove a large number of Bantu when they are potential sufferers. I pin my hope on the Minister that he will, in the first instance, appoint such a commission, a commission that will determine to what extent tuberculosis, which includes pneumoconiosis to-day, affects the health of the nation. I want to ask that the Department of Health should also be concerned in it and I also want to ask that the Department of Health be concerned in it because the Government has already accepted a high degree of responsibility in that it makes a considerable contribution towards the compensation paid to miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferers. I am referring to that &#x00A3;8,000,000&#x2014;not rand.</p>

<p>I said a moment ago that that measure which dealt with chest complaints was not an agreed measure. That was the best measure of them all, except that the benefit scales were completely inadequate. However, those in power did not stop nagging and nagging from both sides until they eventually also persuaded the employees&#x2019; organizations to make representations to the Government to change the law. That makes me so extremely sensitive to and extraordinarily wary of this agreed measure. Where I view this matter from a health point of view, and if my words are falling on sympathetic ears, which I hope is the case, I trust the question of compensation will also be taken into account. If those benefits are investigated I hope the much discussed subject of the mineworkers&#x2019; pensions will also be discussed. All that should be included in the terms of reference of such a commission. The results of this broad agreement to which the hon. the Minister has referred can then be gone into by such a commission. They can determine to what extent those results comply with the demands we all hope will be complied with, i.e. a miner&#x2019;s phthisis Act which makes provision for proper compensation, compensation we need not be ashamed of. Mr. Speaker, I speak with the minimum amount of insistence to-day. When you compare the pensions paid by other organizations, such as the Railways, for example, with the pensions paid to mineworkers, the latter compares very unfavourably. We must not forget that we are dealing here with a person whose health has been ruined. In most cases he is still in the prime of life but his health is finished. As against that when the railway worker goes on pension he is still a healthy person. He is a person who does not affect the health of the nation as such; nor does he affect the health of his family. This is not the appropriate time&#x2014;I hope I shall get an opportunity at a later stage&#x2014;to point out that authorities have expressed the opinion&#x2014;this is not my opinion&#x2014;that the high incidence of miner&#x2019;s phthisis can be considerably reduced in two ways. The first is to exert sufficient presure on the mine authorities to comply with Regulation 58 (2) (b), i.e. to provide 30 cubic feet of fresh air to every mineworker every minute. The second is that the compensation must be of such a nature that the mine authorities will realize that it will pay them better to comply with that regulation and have fewer cases of miner&#x2019;s phthisis sufferers than not to supply the required quantity of fresh air, in contravention of the law. The third is very important and is one which a large number of mineworkers are hoping for. What I am about to say I am saying on the authority of Dr. Irvin. It stands in black and white in the report of the 1929 Commission. In those days we still spoke about the ten-year system. He was asked what the effect would be on miner&#x2019;s phthisis if a mineworker could be removed from underground immediately after ten years&#x2019; service. His reply was that if you did that the cases of miner&#x2019;s phthisis would be reduced to nine out of 1,000 where it is 1,000 out of 1,000 to-day. I know conditions have been greatly improved underground. We all realize that. We are not arguing about that. I say we must look after the health of the nation. That is number one. Secondly, we must look after the interests of the mineworker by removing him from underground at a given moment&#x2014;I am not saying after 10 or 12 years; that must also be investigated. If we do that we shall prevent a large number of mineworkers ever contracting miner&#x2019;s phthisis. In view of that I wish to say something to-day. There are people who simply cannot believe it but up to the present nobody has yet spent a lifetime on a mine&#x2014;i.e. that he has worked on a mine, say, from the age of 21 till he retires&#x2014;without contracting miner&#x2019;s phthisis. I know many people do not agree with me but I ask them to give me the name and the number of a single person who has worked his whole life on a mine without contracting miner&#x2019;s phthisis. I am not saying this to irritate anybody, but I mention it to show how serious the position is. It is serious because it affects the nation as a whole. But it is not so serious that we have to throw up our hands and say there is nothing we can do about it. We can do something about it, Mr. Speaker. We can do something about it by following the two methods I have mentioned. The one is the limited period underground. You cannot remove all of them, because, as the hon. member for Germiston (District) has said, there are people who have concentrated on the mines, people who will not change their career on the mines for anything <span class="col_5805-5806" refersTo="page_236"/>in the world. He is pre-eminently a professional man in mining. You cannot interfere with that man. But you can see to is that the great majority leave the mining industry at a certain stage. If we do that we shall be saving many people from this dreaded disease.</p>

<p>I do not want to quarrel with the Minister. He and I are good friends. I do not expect him to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; to-day to the hope I have expressed here. I realize what I have suggested is something big. All I ask is that he will go into the matter and that he will, at a later stage, see his way clear, after all possible negotiations have taken place, and after he has gathered practical suggestions from the mining industry as such and the employees as such, to appoint such a commission. I just want to add that I shall support the Minister but the condition I impose is the fulfilment of the hope I have expressed.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Krugersdorp (Mr. M. J. van den Berg) has today spoken in a strain similar to that in which members of the Opposition spoke in 1962 when the original Bill was introduced. You will remember, Sir, that when we queried whether this was really an agreed measure, the hon. member for Krugersdorp asked the Minister for the deletion of a certain clause. This was what he said (Hansard, Col. 6784)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I cannot move it because this is an agreed measure.</block>

<p>I now want to pointedly ask the hon. the Minister: Was this Act really an agreed measure? Because within a matter of three months of the passing of that Bill, the then Secretary of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, Mr. Ellis, said the following in the <i>Mynwerker&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">There are quite a number of clauses in the new Bill with which I do not agree.</block>

<p>He said that neither the workers&#x2019; organizations nor the employers&#x2019; organization saw the final draft. In the Annual Report of the Chamber of Mines for 1963 the then president said</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the concern which the Gold Producers&#x2019; Committee felt at the time of the passing of the new Act, it (the Chamber of Mines) decided to send a mission overseas. The mission which visited Europe in September 1962 reported that it was satisfied that the basis of assessment now laid down in our Act was medically unsound and did not have the support of the leading authorities in Europe.</block>

<p>If these were the comments of employers and employees, why were we given the assurance that this was an agreed measure? And if it was an agreed measure, it is surely the height of absurdity for the hon. the Minister to come to this House&#x2014;20 months after the passing of the original Bill&#x2014;and introduce an amending Bill with over 30 amendments, some of which are of a very important nature. It is all very well for the hon. the Minister to say that those amendments are only of an administrative nature. That may be, but then you must realize that five or six of these amendments affect compensation payable to widows and dependants of miners; provisions that were negligently left out completely from the 1962 Act. Those people were the sufferers. I want to remind the hon. the Minister of what he said in 1962 when he introduced that Bill. He said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Bill is the result of lengthy research. It is based on the best that science can offer. I believe that it will benefit the mining industry, the workers and the owners, and that it will certainly be one of the most modern pieces of legislation of its kind in the world.</block>

<p>If that was the position, why was it necessary immediately thereafter for his Department and for the Chamber of Mines, on their own initiative, to send missions overseas to investigate the basis of certification and the basis of compensation. I think the hon. member for Krugersdorp feels unhappy when he says we have still not arrived at the most satisfactory manner of compensating miners who suffer from this dreaded disease. What has been the result of this legislation? We appealed to the hon. the Minister to give us time to study it in order to ascertain its practical implications. We asked that it be referred to a select committee. All these requests were turned down. But within a matter of months there were protest meetings all along the Witwatersrand, in the Western Transvaal and in the Free State, strongly objecting to the basis of certification and the basis of compensation. The hon. the Minister knows that motions of no confidence were passed in him at these meetings.</p>

<speech by="#taurog">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAUROG</person>:</from>

<p>At Carletonvillle, and the Western Reef. The hon. the Minister has correspondence in that regard, correspondence criticizing and condemning this unsatisfactory legislation. If the hon. member wants further confirmation of this contention, then what about the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union themselves? They passed a motion of no confidence in their then secretary for having accepted that legislation. Sir, you know what subsequently happened.</p>

<p>In 18 years we have found it necessary to pass four Bills to provide an equitable formula to compensate miners who develop pneumoconiosis as a result of working in the mines, and in each Bill, as the hon. member for Krugersdorp has quite correctly said, not only has the form of compensation been <span class="col_5807-5808" refersTo="page_237"/>changed but also the definition, from the health point of view, which entitles a miner to compensation. The standard for compensation has shifted from making an assessment entirely on a man&#x2019;s capacity to work; it appears now to acknowledge that if he loses some of his faculties, but can still work, he is entitled to compensation. The 1962 Act, however, is so involved, so complicated and so difficult to understand, that it was quite understandable that no rank and file miner really knows what he is entitled to under the present Act. What is making it still more difficult in the administration of the law is that the doctors are finding it so difficult to carry out the terms and the exact definitions and requirements of the legislation. Individual doctors previously have varied in their prognosis of the effect of pneumoconiosis. Now they are given the added burden of having to define accurately the &#x201C;percentage liability&#x201D; by which the cardial respiratory functions have been impaired. In this respect, I say that the present working of the Act has failed lamentably. You cannot eliminate the clinical physicians in this matter, and to suggest, as we do in this Bill, that you can depend on mechanical instruments to assess the car-dial respiratory disability of a person. It is the height of absurdity! The hon. Minister knows that that opinion has been expressed by experts overseas, who said that this machine that is being used in terms of the 1962 Act is not used anywhere else overseas.</p>

<p>Sir, how do you get over defining just what is the difference in the margin between 18 per cent and 20 per cent damage to a person&#x2019;s cardial respiratory functions? The margin is so slender, but nevertheless it is vital to the miner, and vital to the mining industry. What do we find in practice? If the doctor is sympathetic to the individual, he can throw the whole actuarial assessment out on which the whole pneumoconiosis liability of the mines has been estimated. If he is conservative, he might be accused of favouring the employers. Therefore we have now reached the situation where I feel the hon. the Minister must admit that there has to be some new method, or some new approach to this whole question of pneumoconiosis legislation. I am pleased that a Government member such as the hon. member for Krugersdorp feels the same way. A new pattern of legislation, both as affecting compensation and as affecting certification of miners, must be evolved.</p>

<p>I feel that the approach has to be on a more personal level amongst other matters, e.g. between the panel doctor and the patient visiting the Mine Certification Bureau. When you are prepared to accept the more personal and direct contact of the panel doctor in whom the miner can confide, I think you will get a more satisfactory situation in the mining industry in that respect. I would like to ask the hon. Minister when replying to clear up one misconception which is causing a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst miners.</p>

<p>This discontent is really snow-balling, and has led to dissatisfaction in what is otherwise a very quiet and a very contented pool; the mining industry as such. We must see that that state of affairs is not disturbed. The hon. Minister issued a directive to the Miners&#x2019; Certification Bureau to the effect that all first stage sufferers under the 1956 Act-&#x2014;that is those who received a lump-sum payment&#x2014;would be entitled to a pension. That is not incorporated in the 1962 Act or validated in this Bill, as far as I know. The hon. the Minister made a statement in this House to say that no such directive had been issued, and this is causing all the confusion among first stage pensioners. However, on page 7 of a brochure issued by the Miners&#x2019; Medical Bureau it says as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Anybody awarded a pension in terms of a former Act will continue to receive that pension. Miners who were in terms of Acts classified as persons suffering from pneumoconiosis in the first stage and did consequently not receive a pension, will now receive a pension under the present Act.</block>

<p>If that is correct, then the statement that the hon. the Minister made in May 1963 is inconsistent. I would like the hon. Minister, in order to clarify the position once and for all, to let us know just what is the actual fact: Is a first stage pensioner under the 1956 Act who received a lump-sum payment entitled to a pension in terms of the 1962 Act?</p>

<p>During the second-reading debate in 1962 the hon. the Minister said that the effect of the Act would be that certain financial changes introduced by the new Act would bring relief to the marginal mines. We accepted that statement with satisfaction, because we are aware how absolutely necessary it is that assistance should be given to marginal mines. But what has been the practical effect of the Act? The practical result has been an increase in the costs of the marginal mines, and not, as the hon. the Minister said, that it would bring relief to these mines! The Chamber of Mines as such, as the hon. Minister well knows, had to step into the breach and evolve a new method of apportionment of annual levies in order to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> Alternatively, we would have had a tremendous increase in the working costs of marginal mines.</p>

<p>My colleague, the hon. member for Germiston (District), has quite correctly said that all the mistakes that have been made and all the discontent that exists was certainly not the fault of the mining industry, or the miners as such. They have been innocent victims, in so far as the hon. Minister and his Department are concerned. When they advised the Minister and the Department not to go ahead in this hasty fashion with this pattern of legislation, the Minister and his Department nevertheless went ahead. They were not prepared&#x2014;that is the accusation I level against the hon. Minister and his Department&#x2014;to <span class="col_5809-5810" refersTo="page_238"/>listen to more mature judgment and more mature experience, but allowed themselves to be influenced by certain persons, possibly outside the Department, to go ahead with this form of legislation.</p>

<p>I now wish to deal with the representations that have been made by the Mine Workers&#x2019; Union to the hon. the Minister and his Department that in terms of this Act, the Certification Bureau should be transferred from the Department of Mines to the Department of Health. It is a plea that the hon. members for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) and Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) have been making for years in this House. I am very pleased to see that at this stage they are receiving support from such an authoritative body as the Mine Workers&#x2019; Union. The Pneumoconiosis Act should not come under the control of the Mines Department; it belongs more properly and more effectively under the Department of Health. Will the hon. Minister explain to us, in his reply, why he is not acceding to their request? Why does he not allow this bureau to be taken out of his control and to be placed under the Department where I think naturally it belongs? I hope it is not for the reason that I suspect, but I would be pleased to know from the hon. the Minister what really is his motive for refusing this transfer. I would like to tell the hon. Minister that if he would only agree to this transfer, it would remove a lot of suspicion that exists in the mind of mineworkers when they go up for examination. Whether that suspicion is justified or not I am not in a position to say, but I want the hon. Minister to know that from personal experience and personal contact with these miners, I can say that they have the suspicion that the dice is loaded against them the minute they go into that room to be examined. I think it would be a healthier state, both from the Government point of view and from that of the miners, if the hon. Minister would change his mind, would reconsider his decision and allow the examination of miners to be done by the Department of Health.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister in his second-reading speech made reference to the concession that is now being made to the children of miners over the age of 21, who in terms of this amending Bill will now be allowed to continue at universities if their studies have not been completed by the time they reach that age. I would like to commend the hon. the Minister on accepting the suggestion that came from this side of the House in 1962, when we drew attention to the possibility that a student may not have finished his course when he reaches the age of 21, and in terms of the Pneumoconiosis Act of 1962 his bursary or scholarship would not continue after reaching that age. I think it is something that will be viewed with much satisfaction by miners and their dependants.</p>

<p>I would like to draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to one further defect in the administration of this legislation, which in practice has had a number of unsatisfactory results. I refer to the fact that when a mineworker is no longer allowed to work in a mine as a result of his suffering from phthisis in the second or third stage, his subscriptions to the miners&#x2019; benefit societies automatically cease, and with the limited pensions that these miners get, and the fact that more often than not they forget to pay their subscription. We find that when they do get ill and are confined to hospital for medical treatment, they have to pay those costs out of their own pocket. Certain cases have been brought to my notice where pneumoconiosis sufferers and tuberculotic sufferers found it very, very difficult indeed to pay those monthly fees. I would like to recommend to the hon. the Minister that legislation be introduced whereby any miner who is put off on pension is automatically retained as a member of the miners&#x2019; benefit society and that he gets all the benefits accruing to a member in the ordinary course of events. It may sound a trivial matter, but in its application and in its effect as far as the dependants of miners are concerned, it is an important aspect in the miner&#x2019;s financial position.</p>

<p>I have not dealt in any detail with the basis of compensation, and the amount of compensation paid to pensioners in terms of the 1962 Act or the &#x00A1;Bill before us. I want to remind the hon. the Minister that when we on this side of the House accepted the Bill in 1962, we said that we saw a number of satisfactory and commendable features as far as the technical, medical and the administrative side of the Act was concerned. We deliberately said that we stopped at that stage; we were not prepared to accept the limited financial benefits that were made available to pneumoconiosis sufferers in terms of the 1962 Act. We were not satisfied that the basis on which the hon. the Minister had gone ahead with the pensions was satisfactory. I repeat that we are still not satisfied, and that it is not possible with better administration, to allow greater compensation to the pneumoconiosis sufferers. I hope that, as legislation unfolds in the next year or two, we will be proved correct in our supposition that without affecting the costs of mining at all it is still possible to give these pensioners a better pension than that suggested by the Minister under this Bill. If the hon. Minister wants further proof of that, I need only refer him to the Rhodesian legislation of 1962, where the basis of payment of compensation to miners in that small country of Southern Rhodesia is far more satisfactory than the hon. Minister has seen fit to give to the miners in South Africa.</p>

<p>We are not going to criticize the omissions that are now being rectified by this Bill. We are not going to criticize the clauses that were inadvertently left out, because all of them are of benefit to either the widows or the dependants of phthisis sufferers. But we do say that the Minister should have been more circumspect and more careful and should have been less hasty in introducing the 1962 legislation. I hope that this will be <span class="col_5811-5812" refersTo="page_239"/>the last time that we have hasty legislation of this nature forced on to the House, without reference to a select committee as requested by the Opposition.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog) has made some remarks here which I do not think should go unanswered and which cannot be permitted to pass unchallenged. The hon. member also asked the hon. the Minister a question, namely whether the 1962 legislation was in fact an agreed measure or not. Now I should like to refer the hon. member to the Minister&#x2019;s speech in 1962, when towards the end of his speech he said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In conclusion I should just like to say that this measure is introduced as an agreed measure between my Department, the mining industry and the mining trade unions.</block>

<p>Now it is true that the hon. member for Springs referred to certain qutotations in the <i>Mynwerker,</i> the official organ of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, quotations from statements by the late Mr. Ellis. I should like to say, in passing, to the Department of Mines, to the Chamber of Mines and to the mineworkers&#x2019; trade unions that surely there is a moral code in connection with an agreed measure, and I think it is necessary that we should take cognizance of it and that we should accept and acknowledge and respect that moral code of being morally bound. The hon. member for Germiston (District), who spoke immediately after the hon. the Minister, in those days expressed his regret, and I agreed with him, that there was so little time to study that voluminous and intricate piece of legislation of 1962. I also had my misgivings that so little time was available. But the hon. member for Germiston (District) also said in his speech: &#x201C;Although it is an agreed measure, we deplore the fact that there is so little time.&#x201D; I have no doubt, therefore, that it was an agreed measure. I know the Department of Mines accepted it, and that they respected the code of being morally bound. However, subsequently there were incidents unfortunately where responsible persons were not prepared to accept responsibility for the agreed nature of this Bill, and I should like to express my regret about that to-day. That is the reason why I say that there is a moral code for people who enter into an agreement with one another, and that is a sense of honour, of being morally bound.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs has made two statements here of which I am not aware, and I think the hon. member owes it to this House and to the Minister and to the memory of the late Mr. Ellis to produce proof and evidence to bear out his statement in this House this afternoon, that on two occasions motions of no confidence in the Minister of Mines were adopted. The one instance mentioned by him was Carletonville, but I shall be glad if the hon. member will mention the other to me.</p>

<p>The hon. member made these statements without producing any proof. I do not think these are accusations one should just leave up in the air, and I trust the hon. member will be given an opportunity to produce the proof of where the motion of no confidence in the Minister of Mines was adopted and where a motion of no confidence in the late Mr. Ellis, the former general secretary of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, was adopted. I am not aware of it. We do know that at every election during recent years the mineworkers adopted a motion of no confidence in the United Party and its policy.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">G. P. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Here is the evidence in this Chamber, viz. the fact that the Opposition is sitting there and we are sitting here. Here is the proof, namely, that the mineworkers&#x2019; constituencies, where the mineworkers reside, are to-day represented by Nationalists. That is the evidence. Or is the hon. member not aware that the National Party is governing and that its majority is coming from the cities to an increasing extent, and that the Nationalist voting power is derived to an increasing extent from the mineworkers?</p>

<p>I really do wish to welcome the attitude revealed here by the hon. member for Germiston (District). I am very pleased with what the hon. member said, but apparently he was not speaking for his whole party, and in any event he did not speak for the hon. member for Springs. I had also hoped and trusted that we would not try to score political points when discussing the welfare of the mineworkers. I had hoped that we would not drag this House into it politically, and to use the words used by the hon. member for Germiston (District), I also hope that we shall seek only the best for these people whose lot is affected when we discuss legislation of this nature in this House.</p>

<p>It is true that the Act of 1962 was the product of very intensive research and study. It was a great piece of legislation. But when we have regard to the fact that since 1911, when for the first time legislation was introduced here dealing with pneumoconiosis and silicosis and tuberculosis among mineworkers, to-day is the nineteenth occasion on which this House is being asked to discuss legislation here affecting the lot of those people, then it becomes clear to us what an involved matter this is. The hon. the Minister, in his introductory speech in 1962, said that although the legislation of 1962 was the product of intensive study and research, the mining industry is a live industry and that changes will probably be called for on numerous occasions, and the Minister said that he would not hesitate to make changes when greater benefits <span class="col_5813-5814" refersTo="page_240"/>can be given to people who are affected by this legislation. Talking about greater benefits, it is very easy for the hon. member for Springs, sitting over there as a backbencher in the Opposition, to come here and say popular things, statements that are popular outside, when he does not have the responsibility to apply these things. But I should like to say this to the hon. member, that he should go along and settle this matter with the employers, the mine owners. The Minister of Mines is not Father Christmas strutting around here and arbitrarily dishing out greater benefits in an extravagant manner.</p>

<p>If it is necessary, we shall amend this Act from time to time.</p>

<p>Now I should like to deal with a few matters raised by the hon. member for Germiston (District). Broadly we welcome the contents of this amendment Bill before the House, particularly as more favourable pensions are being granted to widows and orphans and others. I shall say no more about that. But I should also like to ask the hon. the Minister that as regards Clause 2 we should watch this matter very carefully. As a representative of a constituency containing mineworkers and mining interests, I should like to say that I shall certainly not hesitate for one moment to urge the hon. the Minister in this House to delete this provison from the Act if this provision is abused. I know the hon. the Minister too said this in his introductory speech, and I am mentioning it merely to emphasize it once again, and I am mentioning it to notify the employers as well as the employees. We know it is not in the best interests of the person for him to go underground again too often and to work under dusty conditions again. But I am prepared also to give this provision in this Bill an opportunity to prove itself, and because it is a medical recommendation I do not wish to quarrel with it, but if it is going to be abused, and if the restrictions are not observed strictly, we shall definitely ask that an amendment be made.</p>

<p>In conclusion I should like to tell the hon. the Minister that we are very grateful to see that although we know that negotiations between the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and the Chambers of Mines are taking place at the present time, we are not interfering there. We want to give them an opportunity to complete their negotiations, and I trust we shall get a report from them too. But I am not going to bind myself in advance to those negotiations taking place at present. Until such time as I shall have seen the contents of the report, I am not going to express an opinion. I am glad also to learn from the Minister that he, the Minister, has received an assurance from the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union that they are satisfied with the provisions of this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I have been listening to the hon. member for Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg), waiting to hear whether he would say something constructive to which I could reply, but he used most of his time making a political tirade and accusing this side of the House of various things which do not amount to much, but I should just like to draw his attention to something that he said in the debate in 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is a very popular plea and one which I would very much like to support, to ask that certification should take place at 65 per cent in respect of the last stage instead of 75 per cent, as far as the ability to breathe is concerned.</block>

<p>Well, 65 per cent was the figure we asked for on this side, which should be the limit of disability, and the hon. member for Wolmaransstad, in Col. 6793, supported us, but when it came to the vote he voted against his own contention. Anyway, I am not going to spend more time on the hon. member. I want to come to some of the important aspects of this Bill before us to-day.</p>

<p>Like the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog), I must say that a Bill like this, coming so soon after the original Act, and which contains 30 amendments, is a very important piece of legislation. I cannot accept the way the Minister disposed of it by saying that all it consists of is a few technical alterations to make the Act work a little more smoothly. It is far more important than that. There are some very important amendments in this Bill, as was pointed out by the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker). It is not a minor technical matter when the question of tuberculosis is being introduced into a Bill of this sort. If we pass the Bill as it stands today, it will mean that any person who has <span class="col_5815-5816" refersTo="page_241"/>tuberculosis, or who has pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis, and who undergoes an examination and is found to be non-infectious, may then apply to be allowed to go for 64 hours a month underground and in a dusty atmosphere. Firstly, we must make it quite clear that it has never been established that tuberculosis can be cured. The experts are very doubtful about it. The Minister knows that. There are conflicting opinions, but because there are conflicting opinions doubt exists, and the person who should always get the benefit of the doubt is the sufferer. Why should a mineworker, whether he be a humble miner or a mine manager, want to go back underground to work in a dusty atmosphere, knowing full well the risks that he takes? Obviously because the compensation he is getting because of his illness cannot keep him in anything like the comfort he was used to when he was working; and that applies to the humble miner and to the mine captain and to the mine manager. The compensation the miner is getting for his disability is not commensurate with the damage done to his body. If the man was involved in an accident on the road and had one or both lungs seriously damaged, what compensation would he get from the third party insurance? Can you compare that compensation with that which a man receives after 20 years underground? The basis of this piece of legislation to-day does not consist of anything more than to show up the failure to compensate sufficiently the man who is suffering from a disease brought on by his occupation. To-day we were supplied with the report of the Pneumoconiosis Commissioner, and I want to read from Chapter III of this report, and I should like the Minister to take note of what I am saying. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Pensions awarded after medical examination in terms of the 1962 Act: Of the 1,609 cases of miners on the register at 30 September 1962, to whom previously only one-sum benefits without pensions were awarded, it was found upon medical examination since 1 October 1962 to 31 March 1963 that 767 miners qualified for pensions, whilst 203 miners who were already in receipt of pensions qualified for higher pensions. Up to the end of October 1963 these numbers increased to 1,264 and 420 respectively. In addition, 267 miners who were not previously certified were found by 31 March 1963 to be suffering from pneumoconiosis or pneumoconiosis with tuberculosis.</block>

<p>That is a terrible thing to happen. In that short space of time we find 267 miners suffering from a condition which includes tuberculosis. It goes to show that previously we were missing a lot of cases, and it also shows that underground workers lay themselves open to tuberculous infection more easily than other people because their lungs are already somewhat damaged by pneumoconiosis. If we are going to allow those people who suffer from pneumoconiosis to go underground for a long period, their chances of getting tuberculosis are great. But in the case of a man who has already got tuberculosis, whose disease is supposed to have been arrested or &#x201C;cured&#x201D;, his chances of getting tuberculosis are infinitely greater. We are going to subject these people to the risk of reinfection, at least of his lungs, with tuberculosis. If the Minister allows that man to go underground and to get tuberculosis actively again, what compensation will he get? Will he get compensation on the same basis as he has at the moment? Will this person still be taken out as soon as it becomes active again, and given the same degree of compensation that he had previously? Because the onus now is on the Minister, and no longer on the worker. The Minister is going to allow him to go down. And there is nothing in this Bill which lays down any degree of special investigation before the applicant who has had tuberculosis may be allowed to go down again. Would it not have been better if this question was left to experts, and if the Minister had inserted a clause whereby no miner would be allowed to go underground unless an independent body of medical men said it was not a risk for him to go underground? But here, because a certain group of people find it necessary to go back to work again, the Minister is going to allow them to take the risk of being re-infected with one of the most infectious diseases that we know. This country is to-day fighting a battle against tuberculosis and it is spending millions of rand in doing so. The solution is not in allowing the man to go underground again to make up for his loss of earnings. The solution lies in finding work for the unfortunate individual in a non-dusty atmosphere. That is what the Minister has to do. He has to find work for these people, and if he cannot, the compensation paid to these people suffering from these two diseases must be such that they can continue to live comfortably; because these are not just retired men who retire on reaching the age limit. These are sick people who are being put out of work and they cannot live on the amount of money they are receiving, because of the extra attention they so often require. I know it will involve a lot of money to compensate them adequately, but these people have earned a lot of money for our country. The whole of our economy depends on them, and as was said earlier this afternoon, compare their pensions with the pensions of other people, and see how little relatively they are getting. When a man, in addition to the work he has done, finds that he is incapacitated through an illness brought on by his work, he surely merits a far better pension than he is getting. That is one aspect of the matter.</p>

<p>Another aspect I want to deal with is in connection with Clause 6, where we find that functions and organs are being discussed. The present method of determining a man&#x2019;s capacity to do his work properly depends on his cardio-respiratory functions, and the word &#x201C;function&#x201D; has taken the place of &#x201C;organs&#x201D; <span class="col_5817-5818" refersTo="page_242"/>throughout the Bill. I am somewhat perturbed about this and I want the Minister to consider whether or not he does not think &#x201C;organs or functions&#x201D; should not be the phrase used instead of &#x201C;functions&#x201D; only. I say this because during a man&#x2019;s lifetime it can be determined by &#x201C;machines&#x201D;, as the hon. member for Springs has said, what his functions are. He may fail to measure up to a certain standard of functioning, but when a man dies you cannot measure his functions any more, and the only way that you can determine whether or not he has any degree of pneumoconiosis is by examining his organs. I want to make sure that right throughout &#x201C;functions or organs&#x201D; should be used. I want to make perfectly sure that when a miner dies and his widow suspects that he might have had pneumoconiosis, although he was never certified as having it, she will have the right to prove through his organs that he had it. I am not certain that this Bill covers that eventuality. I am not certain that the Minister throughout the Act has seen to it that the post-mortem findings should be as important as the live findings.</p>

<p>Now, if it is going to become a trend to allow an underground worker to go back into the mine after he has been cured of tuberculosis, what is going to be the position of a man who is suffering from tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis and who is in the third stage or the 75 per cent stage of pneumoconiosis, and also has tuberculosis in addition which is said to have been cured? Is the Minister going to allow these people to go underground? I see no such provision here and it is a very important provision because the two late stages of pneumoconiosis invariably go hand in hand with tuberculosis. You will very rarely find a man suffering in the 20 per cent category of pneumoconiosis and also suffering at that stage from tuberculosis. It may be possible, but it is invariably the late stage of pneumoconiosis that is found to be associated with tuberculosis. Here again, I should like to know what the feeling of the Minister is. Is he going to debar the late stage pneumoconiotic from going underground if his tuberculosis has been cured? Or will the Act prevent a man from going underground? That is the important thing to decide.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_den_berg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. VAN DEN BERG</person>:</from>

<p>Is it possible to be cured after the third stage?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#fisher">

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FISHER</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think so. My own feeling is that once a man has pneumoconiosis plus tuberculosis, his chances of recovery are nil. The best we can hope for is that it will be arrested, but it will always be there, either in an active or in a latent form, and his chances of being cured, from the experience I have had, are very slender. I have discussed this matter with some very eminent authorities and their opinions vary, but I think they are all agreed on one thing, that no man should be allowed to go underground until an independent body of medical men, outside the board, has examined him. The board may still be biased, but if a man wants to go underground and he has had tuberculosis and wants to go underground again, an independent examination should be made by medical men who have nothing to do with the bureau. If they give their sanction he should be allowed to go underground, but he should be examined regularly every month, and sputum tests must be taken from him throughout the period he is working, otherwise he will not only be a danger to himself, but to all those who work with him.</p>

<p>I want to deal for a short moment with the question of the handing over of pneumoconiosis to the Department of Health. It is a big step, but it is one which may become very necessary. If the question is arising of the gold producers or the Transvaal Chamber of Mines and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union taking over this question of pneumoconiosis, then I think at the same time we have to hand the matter over to the Department of Health. It is for them to keep an eye on it. It is a health matter and I think they will be able to do it very efficiently. But the fault I find is that the people who go up for examination are invariably dissatisfied with the examinations they receive and with the findings. I do not know how much the Minister knows about their dissatisfaction, but I know a great deal about it. I have yet to find a single mineworker asking to be allowed to go back underground. I do not know how many people have applied to the Minister to be allowed to go underground when they have tuberculosis, but I am sure no mineworker has applied. It may have come from one or two of the officials or specialized workers on the imines. But the mineworkers dread going down once they have been told that they are suffering from the second or third stage of pneumoconiosis. Would the Minister allow a mineworker to go back into a dusty atmosphere if he has had tuberculosis? Surely the easiest thing would be for him to employ him in a different job. I have asked the Minister in this House over and over again that once the mineworker has been found to be suffering from pneumoconiosis above 50 per cent&#x2014;that is the old third stage&#x2014;he should be taken out of the mine for at least three hours a day and given alternative work. I keep on asking that, and it is a simple matter to do because the mines themselves are looking for men. They cannot employ enough apprentices. Why cannot these people start then to learn alternative jobs, so that when they leave the mines because of their disability they will have something else to do on the surface? What can a mineworker do to-day when he leaves the mine? What makes him go back underground? It is the fact that he has not been trained to do any other work. But if you train them as electricians and plumbers and carpenters, they can find jobs on the surface. Again, I ask the Minister to consider that very carefully, and to see whether we cannot get the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and the Chamber of Mines to come together and see whether it is <span class="col_5819-5820" refersTo="page_243"/>not possible to employ these people on the surface by teaching them an alternative job.</p>

<p>The other matters I wish to raise I can deal with under the various clauses when we come to the Committee Stage, and I will not keep the House any longer. I sincerely hope that this is not going to be the end of legislation in favour of the mineworker. I hope that soon we will be able to come together, both sides of the House, and discuss the future and the health of the mineworkers again, but we cannot do it in this slapdash manner. If a new Act is going to be introduced, then both sides must come together and discuss it in a calm atmosphere to see whether we cannot once and for all pass legislation that will help the mineworker to know that he has permanent security and that he and his family will be looked after by the industry and by the Government.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>I do not think it is fair that one Opposition speaker after another should rise to attack the Minister and say: &#x201C;We told you you would come along with amendments.&#x201D; If we may take the hon. members back to last year, they will recall that the Minister told them very emphatically that this was an agreed measure, and that the various interests concerned with the legislation were anxious that the legislation should be placed on the Statute Book as soon as possible. The Minister also said that if it appeared necessary for amendments to be introduced, he would not hesitate to come to this House with those amendments. Surely the Minister was not being indifferent! He had very important commitments to meet when he had to go and represent this country overseas. But now hon. members are accusing him of that. And it is not true that some people have suffered financial loss. The pensions of all those people have been adjusted and not one of them has suffered financial loss. Now the Minister is merely validating the position. I think it was very unfair to say that. I shall not quarrel with the hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) on how much a man should receive if his lungs have been impaired. I think we are all agreed that such a person should be paid the maximum within our financial means. I sincerely hope that as negotiations are now in progress between the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and the Chamber of Mines, a compromise will be effected to the mutual benefit of the mineworkers as well as the Chamber of Mines, and that this political controversy we have here annually, when we recriminate one another and ask whether we are now paying these people the proper pension, and whether they are receiving the compensation they are entitled to, will come to an end. For we are making a political pawn of the mineworker in this House, and they most certainly do not deserve that. [Interjection.] This happens at every election. That hon. member knows as well as I do that we will award the maximum pensions, but the award should be within the means at our disposal. I should like to ask, as the hon. member for Wolmaransstad put it: Is the Chamber of Mines prepared to pay the mineworkers the pensions the Opposition desire to award? Who made the colossal profits referred to? Was it the taxpayer, or was it the mineowner? That is why I say that this matter is being made a political football, and I hope and trust that these negotiations now in progress will result in benefits for the mineworker, and that he will no longer be used as a political pawn, for he deserves much more.</p>

<p>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to one or two matters. Under the 1956 legislation there was a provision that a person was entitled, whether he was in the first, second, third or fourth stage, to an attendant&#x2019;s allowance as long as his doctor certified that he really was ill and was entitled to it. In the 1962 Act we consolidated the attendant&#x2019;s allowance with the pension in the third stage, and by doing so we deprived the mineworker of a right. I should like to plead with the Minister very strongly that we should restore to the mineworker this right he had. In my constituency I have several instances of mineworkers who are in the first or the second stage and are sickly now, but who are not entitled to an attendant&#x2019;s allowance, because it has been taken away by Section 88 of Act No. 64 of 1962, which makes no provision for new cases.</p>

<p>Next I should like to inform the Minister that as regards the reviewing authority, there is much dissatisfaction among the mineworkers. The mineworker feels he is not being treated properly in this regard. As the mineworker has to apply in writing within 60 days if he wishes to have his case reviewed. I feel it is the duty of the reviewing authority to bring that mineworker before the board again, but they should not rely only on the written data they have before them; this causes great dissatisfaction among the mineworkers. Then I should like also to refer to a speech made by the hon. the Minister in this House where he said that aid would be given for the training of the dependants of the mineworker. In the brochure which has been issued, it is stated clearly: &#x201C;The general council therefore can now also give assistance in connection with training at a college or a university.&#x201D; That is printed in this brochure, and last year the hon. the Minister also said so here in the course of his speech. When a parent applies for assistance for the training of his child, then the Pneumoconiosis Compensation General Council adopts the attitude that it is not prepared to consider an application for financial aid in respect of any student, unless that student takes a course or courses at a university closely associated with mining. There are so many ex-mineworkers who are suffering from pneumoconiosis and who do not have sons, but who have daughters who would like to be trained at training colleges and I do feel that assistance should also be given to those children. I should like to urge the hon. the Minister to <span class="col_5821-5822" refersTo="page_244"/>give his attention to this matter. It is a matter about which the mineworker feels very unhappy. When all is said and done, we last year increased the amount available for scholarships for the training of these children from R50,000 to R100,000.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we welcome the amendments made in this Bill. I am thankful too that there are negotiations in progress in connection with this pneumoconiosis legislation. There is one thing we cannot argue away, and that is that the mineworker is not feeling very happy about this legislation, and I hope and trust that the negotiations in progress between the Minister, the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union and the Chamber of Mines will culminate in an honourable solution which will be to the advantage of the mineworkers as well as the Chamber of Mines. Mining is one of our most important industries, and we are grateful that it has been kept on such a sound basis throughout all these years.</p>

<from>Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RADFORD</person>:</from>

<p>In the days when the Minister of Mines was Dr. van Rhyn, I pointed out as a member of the 1955 Oosthuizen Commission on Tuberculosis and Pneumoconiosis that the medical side of this Department should be handed over to the Department of Health. The fact that the hon. the Minister now comes forward with this measure convinces me that I was correct in adopting that attitude. The Minister comes forward with this measure without the slightest evidence and without any possibility of producing evidence that anybody has been cured of tuberculosis of the lungs. We as doctors know well that &#x201C;cure&#x201D; is not a word that we use in relation to tuberculosis of the lungs; we may speak and we do speak of arresting the disease, which means that for the moment it is held under control. It is not and it has not been uncommon in the past for a so-called arrested disease to recur after 50 or 60 years. That brings me to the point that this so-called cure is entirely the result of the new drugs. The so-called arrested rate is now much higher than it used to be. It is much more common to find people being allowed out of the sanatorium. In some parts of Europe they are using tuberculosis sanatoriums for other purposes because the number of tuberculosis sufferers has fallen, chiefly because of the introduction of the new drugs. It was not uncommon formerly, and it may still be common, to find tuberculosis recurring in people after an alleged cure over 60 years ago. Sufficient time has not yet elapsed to enable us to judge the new drugs. These new drugs first made their appearance in about 1950, so at best we can have about ten years of so-called cure, and that is certainly not long enough. It is a well-known fact that if the patient dies of something else, after a so-called cure has been brought about, you can still find the tuberculus germs in his lungs, still alive but merely wrapped up in protective tissue, which may break down at any time. To say that we are going to take tuberculosis sufferers back into the mines, is to my mind something quite incredible. One must regard tuberculosis of the lungs as one would regard a field; the seed is the tubercle bacillus; the lung is the seedbed. The ordinary healthy man will resist infection with tubercle bacillus unless it is overwhelming, or unless there are other conditions present which make him liable to contract the disease. I can think of nothing more likely to produce a lovely fertile seedbed for the tubercle bacillus than a pneumoconiotic lung. It is beautifully fertilized. As a member of the 1955 commission on the relationship between pneumoconiosis and tuberculosis, I cannot help feeling that we are now ignoring the report of that commission; we are completely ignoring it. On page 90 we find this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">From these figures it appears that on an average approximately half the number of Natives found to be suffering from silicosis, also suffered from tuberculosis.</block>

<p>Then paragraph 49 says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is interesting to note further that of the total number of 3,164 Native labourers found to be suffering from both tuberculosis and silicosis during the period under review, only 60 had silicosis in the third stage as against 311 who had second stage silicosis and 2,793 who had first stage silicosis.</block>

<p>One of the things that that commission said, and said without any hesitation, was that the most important thing was to keep the tubercle bacillus out of the mines. Sir, that is what makes me feel very bitter about this. Perhaps the hon. the Minister is prepared to allow men to go into a dusty atmosphere for a limited period, but what is going to be the effect on other miners? The whole trend of this report was that an effort should be made to keep the tubercle bacillus out of the mines as far as it is possible to do so. That is demonstrated by the fact that the commission recommended very strongly&#x2014;and its recommendation has been carried out&#x2014;that the coal mines which before that period were not controlled, should be brought under control, and that all underground labour at the coal mines must be investigated thoroughly, just as the bureau investigated the miners in Johannesburg. The reason is this: It was found that there was a high percentage of tuberculosis amongst workers in the coal mines, due to the fact that the coal mines did not get all their labour through the recruiting organization, and therefore they did not pass through the examination by the recruiting organization: they were engaged locally. Many of these Natives received only a simple clinical examination at the mine-head. The result was that in the coal mines in particular there were workers, many of them White workers who had left the gold mines and come down to the coal mines, who were contracting tuberculosis from these people who had been recruited locally. For that reason various other bureaux and sub-bureaux have been established <span class="col_5823-5824" refersTo="page_245"/>to eliminate local labour should it be tuberculous. Here we find, however, that the hon. the Minister is preparing to take tuberculous people into the mines. The Minister may say that the man feels that he must go back into the mines. I am more interested in what is going to happen to the other miners. It is a well-known fact that nearly all miners spit. A man may be passed as cured but he will go on spitting because he is an ex-miner. At what stage does he become a positive spitter again; at what stage does that spit which he introduces into the mine become infectious? This is one of the most difficult problems to tackle. On page 96 of the report the commission says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The average period for sputum of the 68 per cent of the 22 cases who were later certified for tuberculosis &#x2026;</block>

<p>These were 22 cases who were certified as pneumoconiotics of various stages but in whom the bureau suspected tuberculosis but could not find it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The average period for the sputum of the 68 per cent of the 22 cases who were later certified for tuberculosis to become positive since the first suspicious signs were detected, was seven years &#x2026;</block>

<p>It took seven years from the time that the bureau (presumably expert on this subject), thinking that the man might have tuberculosis, to prove that it was so, and this because the only proof is the presence of the tubercle bacillus in the sputum. The commission goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The average period for the remainder certified on X-ray from the first suspicious report till certification on proof, was nine years. The average period for the whole group from the first suspicion till proof by positive sputum certification was seven years.</block>

<p>Not suspicion of pneumoconiosis; they had already satisfied themselves that the patient had pneumoconiosis, but these men were kept under observation; their sputum was examined time after time, and the average period was 7.7 years. If the hon. the Minister allows this man to go down into the mine, how long will he be able to spit positively before it is detected? Because it is not always present in the sputum. The hon. the Minister is taking a most formidable responsibility upon himself. He has come here without any evidence&#x2014;and there is no evidence; it is only in the minds of certain men&#x2014;that a patient has been cured of tuberculosis. There is not a single bulletin issued by his research bureau which says that they have seen a cured case of tuberculosis. If they have said so in any of their bulletins I will be glad to read it; I am prepared to be convinced, but I say that there is no evidence because not sufficient time has elapsed yet. While it may benefit one or two men to be allowed to work underground again, the whole of the staff of the mine is exposed. Let me quote what the commission says on page 97&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The tubercle bacillus is a particularly resistant organism and various authorities are in agreement that this organism could live for many months in mines outside the human body.</block>

<p>Sir, this country has stood in the forefront of health legislation as far as pneumoconiosis is concerned. It was almost the first country to tackle this matter seriously. It built up the South African Institute of Medical Research which is subsidized heavily by the Government and by the Chamber of Mines. It is true that until about 1957 we had fallen behind but we have recovered our position and today we can hold our heads high in the matter of pneumoconiosis legislation. But this, Sir, is a step in the dark. I do not think the hon. the Minister would find ten or 15 doctors in the country to support him in this connection. There is a feeling that the outlook in tuberculosis has been improved; it has been much improved, this country is spending R11,500,000 on tuberculosis this year, the largest sum it has ever spent, and here the hon. the Minister is taking a risk which I believe is totally unjustified.</p>

<speech by="#meyer">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MEYER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) has given us a fairly lengthy, but I must admit, a very interesting picture of tuberculosis, and he earnestly warned us against the provisions of Clause 2. Personally I do not think it is a warning we should lightly brush aside. I think it is my duty to make my voice also heard in connection with Clause 2. I think we should be most careful, and I think it is the intention, as the hon. the Minister has told us, to be very careful. The hon. member for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) has asked whether the Minister will send back into the mines a person who has suffered from both tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis in an advanced stage, and who has recovered, and who no longer has tuberculosis in a contagious form. I do not think the hon. member ought to be worried about that. I do not believe that a person who has suffered from both tuberculosis and pneumoconiosis in an advanced stage will ever be sent back to the mines by the bureau. I do not think, as he himself also has said, that such a person will be cured of tuberculosis in those circumstances. But I should like to say, for my part, that the danger still exists that one might perhaps regard it as an experiment to have these people employed underground again under certain conditions. I do not think it can be anything but an experiment. If we were to accept it on any other basis, I am afraid I would fine it extremely difficult to vote for such a provision in a Bill. We can only do it on the basis of an experiment, but the danger exists that the experiment may last for too short a time, and that we may then arrive at wrong conclusions, for <span class="col_5825-5826" refersTo="page_246"/>it will take many years before we shall be able to say with certainty that this experiment has met with success. I am convinced it will be very difficult to prove whether this experiment is a success, or whether it entails prejudicial consequences. I am afraid that whereas it is intended to-day to give only certain officials an opportunity to go down into the mine during certain hours, there may be some coercion on the part of the mineworkers. One of the speakers has said here that mineworkers, once they know they have tuberculosis, will never be prepared to go and work underground again. My experience has been otherwise. I find that when a man has suffered from tuberculosis and his doctor has told him that he has been cured in his opinion, these people are keen to return to the mine because they have nothing else to do; they have no other employment. I am afraid that as soon as the door is opened, these very people will begin to exert pressure, to their own disadvantage, to be permitted to work underground again. I should like to emphasize that I have very strong misgivings in connection with this clause, but I believe great caution will be exercised; that the clause will be used only in exceptional circumstances, and that there will be very strict supervision to ensure that people do not work underground for long hours. Some people say that the incidence of tuberculosis among mineworkers is much less than among the general public. In my view this proves nothing. I do not believe it has ever been proved that the incidence is in fact lower, but even if it were so, then it proves nothing save that there may possibly be very good control down below in the mines. But the fact remains that the circumstances under which the mineworker works underground undoubtedly tend to promote tuberculosis. I think it is fertile soil in which tuberculosis may breed, and that is why I say we must be particularly careful. For the rest I welcome this Bill, if I can satisfy myself on the point that special precautions will be taken and that the provisions of Clause 2 will only be made use of under exceptional circumstances. The hon. member for Rosettenville says he is surprised that we have come along with amendments after such a short period of two years. I do not agree with him at all; on the contrary, some of us have perhaps expected amendments sooner, because the hon. the Minister made a promise, did he not, that he would come forward with amendments as soon as it appeared necessary? We are pleased to learn to-day that the snags that existed, have already been eliminated administratively. All we are doing here now is to make the necessary statutory provision in that connection. We welcome the concessions which are now being made by the legislation to widows and dependants; under this measure they will now be getting the rights we have always thought they are entitled to.</p>

<p>With these few words then I should like to emphasize my warning too in connection with Clause 2.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite clear that both sides of the House, despite the fact that on the Government side there has been some praise of the hon. the Minister, are dissatisfied with many of the provisions of the 1962 Act. We support this Bill because some effort, little though it may be, is being made to bring about certain improvements to the 1962 Act.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) and Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) both expressed their dissatisfaction with certain provisions of the 1962 Act. The hon. member for Wolmaransstad expressed his complete disapproval of Clause 2 of the present Bill, and he has been well supported by members on his own side. Sir, we on this side of the House are opposed to Clause 2 for reasons which have already been explained. The hon. member for Brakpan went so far as to say: &#x201C;Die mynwerkers voel nie gelukkig met hierdie wetgewing nie.&#x201D; In another portion of his speech he said, &#x201C;die mynwerker word nie reg behandel nie&#x201D;. He mentioned three distinct aspects of the legislation in which he felt that there were anomalies which should be remedied. Sir, the reason why this side of the House has reiterated some of the warnings we gave the Minister in 1962 is that the act itself has created hardships. Members who represent constituencies in which mineworkers are living or in which mines are situated, constantly have appeals made to them for some improvement of the law in order to remove the shortcomings and the anomalies of the 1962 legislation. While it has been maintained that the legislation of 1962 met with the approval of all sides and that it was in fact an agreed measure, one does not find confirmation of that in any of the utterances of the secretary of the Mineworkers Union or in any of the statements made by the mineworkers through their own organ, the <i>Mineworker.</i> The hon. member for Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling), speaking at Carletonville, said that this measure had the approval of the Department of Mines, the Chamber of Mines, the Chamber of Commerce and the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union. [Interjection.] Well, the report refers to &#x201C;Die Kamer van Koophandel&#x201D;, so the reporter must have made a mistake. Mr. Grundlingh, the acting secretary of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit is belaglik om hier te praat van &#x2019;n ooreengekome maatre&#x00EB;l. Mnr. Daan Ellis het self by herhaling in die <i>Mynwerker</i> geskryf dat daar nie sprake van &#x2019;n ooreengekome maatre&#x00EB;l was nie.</block>

<p>None of these people indicated that they regarded this measure as an agreed measure. Sir, there is no question that the Act introduced some very serious setbacks for the mineworkers. We want to make an appeal to the hon. the Minister to give more attention to this whole issue and to review the entire situation instead of coming forward with amendments on a piecemeal basis. Sir, our concern is not political; our concern is the <span class="col_5827-5828" refersTo="page_247"/>health of these people. We are concerned about the suffering which is being caused to these people. An attempt is being made here to improve the compensation, which is an obvious admission that there are shortcomings in the Act, and one does appreciate the fact that a Bill has been introduced to bring about this change, but the method followed here is not the method which should be used in a very important matter of this kind. Hon. members are all agreed that the mineworker deserves very much better consideration than this new experiment, the immediate effect of which has been to reduce his income at a time when he needs it most in the form of compensation for his suffering. Sir, I would like to make an appeal to the Minister to heed the remarks of the hon. member for Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) with regard to tuberculosis. Rather than send anyone back to work in the mine again, even for a shorter day, would it not be better to follow the new trend in the treatment of tuberculosis, and that is to find other employment on the surface for the person concerned when the disease has been arrested with the use of modern drugs. Surely it should be possible to find surface employment for him. Once the disease has been arrested the tuberculosis sufferer should not be thrown to the mercy of society; his services should be used in some useful manner and he should be re-integrated into society. Our fear is that if he is sent back it can only lead to the danger of a recurrence or a relapse of this particular disease. I do not think it is right that we should even make provision for this type of reemployment for the tuberculosis sufferer. I believe it is our duty to meet the difficulties the mineworker has experienced as a result of this legislation. It is the duty of the Minister to ensure, not by means of this amending Bill, but in some other way, such as a commission for example, that these anomalies are put right. When the Bill was submitted to the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union they actually sent for a Dr. Scheepers, who is a world authority on pneumoconiosis. He came here from overseas. He criticized the medical methods that were being made use of.</p>

<p>Let me just correct something the hon. member for Krugersdorp said a little earlier. Here I have a report dated 28 September 1962 of a meeting which was held in Krugersdorp, which &#x201C;150 angry miners attended; they stamped their feet and shouted one another down in their eagerness to ask Mr. van den Berg questions after he had told them that&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x201C;This is the kind of law that I will always overthrow if I can.&#x201D; He criticized the law for altering benefits payable to phthisis sufferers and said he had warned the Minister of Mines, Dr. Diederichs, that he was taking a big risk by introducing the legislation. He hoped there would soon be representations to the Minister asking him to review the entire pneumoconiosis legislation, Mr. Van den Berg said.</block>

<p>That is exactly what this side of the House is doing, Sir. This side of the House is appealing to the hon. the Minister to go very much further than he is going to-day. That is why I say all sides of the House are agreed that there are some serious anomalies in the legislation. It is the duty of the Minister to ensure that they are dealt with as soon as possible. This legislation we are dealing with at the moment is merely patchwork. It is just putting little things right here and there in order to satisfy certain complaints, complaints which cry out for some form of attention. It was necessary to have legislation in order to bring that about. But if the hon. the Minister calls this an amending Bill merely for the purpose of adjusting certain administrative difficulties his Department has experienced, I am afraid we must express very deep disappointment at his approach to the whole subject. My commendation to the hon. the Minister would be that he should not only take careful note of what has been said on this side of the House but he should keep his ear to the ground with regard to the grumblings within his own ranks, people who are not only dissatisfied but know that there is complete dissatisfaction amongst the mineworkers with the provisions and the working of this legislation.</p>

<p>As I have said, it is our duty to ensure that in this particular industry, where people go underground and are subjected to a disease over which they have no control at all, a disease in respect of which no preventive measures can be taken to avoid it being contracting, a disease which is inevitably the end of a mineworker&#x2019;s life, everything is done that can be done to see that the mineworkers receive the necessary care as soon as possible, the necessary compensation for themselves and for their widows and their children. It has already been stressed that there is a difference in the compensation payable in the case of daughters. We do not want to be accused by members opposite of making a political football of the people who are the subject of this legislation. That is the most utter nonsense any member could utter. The hon. member knows very well that it is a nonsensical statement. It has always been the objective of this House to try to ensure that the best possible is done for the safety and welfare of the mineworkers. My appeal to the hon. the Minister is exactly on those lines, Sir. We have pointed out to him that no purpose is served by constantly, year by year, coming with amending legislation when the fundamentals of the issue have not been tackled and fully dealt with. We say that patch-work legislation is not the means of setting right a wrong&#x2014;not intentionally, of course&#x2014;which this legislation has brought about, a wrong which is seriously affecting the health and the goodwill of the workers.</p>

<p>I just want to read a further quotation from this report of that meeting to which I have already referred. Both members for Krugersdorp and Ventersdorp (Mr. Greyling) appeared at this meeting. They expressed their <span class="col_5829-5830" refersTo="page_248"/>confidence in the Minister and his advisers. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mnr. Greyling het ges&#x00EA; dat hy die Minister se adviseurs vertrou. Ons het nie meer daardie vertroue nie. Mnr. Greyling s&#x00EA; dat die haakplekke langs verantwoordelike weg uitgeskakel moet word. Bedoel hy dat die Mynwerkersunie onverantwoordelik optree?</block>

<p>All we want to show is that there is no point glossing over something which is obviously a source of deep dissatisfaction to the workers in this country.</p>

<p>I have already made it clear that we do&#x2014;for the edification of the hon. member who has just dropped in; he has not yet appeared in my line of vision. We support any effort that is made to bring about an improvement in the Act. My appeal is that there should not be improvements on a fragmentary basis. I hope that is clear to the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;). I hope the hon. the Minister will be able to reply to us on this issue, namely, what he intends to do to set right the anomalies and the hardships which flow from the present legislation.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GREYLING</person>:</from>

<p>I cannot understand the Opposition. When the hon. the Minister introduced that legislation his last words were&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In conclusion I want to say that this Bill is being submitted as an agreed measure between my Department, the mining industry and the mining trade unions.</block>

<p>The delegates of the mining trade unions were sitting here in the gallery that day. They had had various discussions with the Minister, his Department and with those of us who represent mining constituencies. I have a letter in my possession which was addressed to me by the former secretary of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, in which he said that after a careful study of this measure they had decided to give their wholehearted support to the Bill. I have that here in Black and White. When the Minister moved the second reading of that Bill in 1962 the Opposition voted for the Bill. We voted for it unanimously. What else does one have to do to get an agreed measure? A careful study was made of the Bill; discussions were held, and the Bill went through without a single opposing vote. What more can one do to get an agreed measure? What is happening to-day? As the result of circumstances which I do not want to analyse here now there are signs to-day that there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction in the ranks of the mineworkers with regard to this Act which, after all, is being implemented by people who are liable to make mistakes. We can all make mistakes. And what do we find to-day? We find that these political vultures swoop down immediately. Here they sit. I am quite correct in saying that they are political vultures, Mr. Speaker. What I mean is that they pick here and they pick there. They have entirely forgotten their obligations and their honour. In 1962 they voted for this measure and to-day in 1964, scarcely two years since the passing of the Bill, they renounce their support of this measure.</p>

<p>Sir, on 15 March 1963 at the meeting to which the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) referred, I said that the Minister had given us his guarantee that if the Act proved to be defective he would bring about the necessary amendments. To-day the Minister is carrying out that promise. I also made a second statement; when this dissatisfaction was being encouraged amongst the mineworkers at a time when this measure had not yet been subjected to any real test, because it had not been in operation long enough, I made the statement that I had the fullest confidence in the people who had advised the Minister and in the people who had drafted the measure. I, adhere to every word of that statement. I also made a third statement; I said that I had full confidence in the panel of medical practitioners who constituted the staff of the bureau at the time. I repeat that; I stand by every word I said. I want to pay a tribute here to-day and express my thanks to the director of the bureau and his helpers. I want to mention four cases of which I have personal knowledge and in which the bureau spared no pains; they travelled to Pretoria to go and examine a mineworker who was suffering; they came to Carletonville; they travelled to Coligny, and the week before last they travelled to Zeerust. Sir, if that does not reveal a sympathetic interest in our mineworkers who suffer from pneumoconiosis, then I do not know what a sympathetic interest is. I repeat therefore that I can only speak in laudatory terms of the individuals and the medical practitioners who form the staff of the bureau at the moment. I stand by what I said formerly.</p>

<p>I made a further statement at that particular meeting. I said that the 1962 Act was the product of advanced, scientific research as far as occupational diseases were concerned and as far as pneumoconiosis as a socio-economic problem was concerned. I said that it was a measure which was not being applied on a sectional basis but for the benefit of every section of the population. Pneumoconiosis is a socio-economic problem to which the State has to give its continual attention and in connection with which the State continually has to amend the relevant legislation. I went on to make another statement; I said that as far as the material aspect was concerned, the monetary aspect, the mineworkers would receive increased benefits under the 1962 Act as a result of an increase in the number of cases certified and as a result of the fact that mineworkers who would not have been certified formerly would now be certified under the 1962 Act. Under the old Act the complaint of the mineworker was this, &#x201C;I am spitting <span class="col_5831-5832" refersTo="page_249"/>blood; I am completely exhausted; I cannot exert myself, my days are numbered but nevertheless I am not certified.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I readily admit that this measure is not the Alpha and Omega as far as occupational disease are concerned. I would be the last person to say that this is the last word as far as pneumoconiosis is concerned. Any intelligent person who makes a study of pneumoconiosis and reads what experts throughout the world have to say about it, very soon comes to the conclusion that we are dealing here with one of the most dangerous and one of the most incurable diseases in the world. I think somebody once said that it was like a yellow cobra; one never knows when it is going to strike. It is an insidious disease and, according to the evidence of many medical practitioners, it is an incurable disease. In other words, we are trying by legislative means here to combat what is one of the most intricate socio-economic problems. It is obvious that we are still going to stumble a great deal and struggle a great deal before we hit upon the right answers. When I listened today to the hon. member for Krugersdorp and to his request to the Minister that an entirely new commission of inquiry should be appointed to go into all these aspects of this extremely dangerous, uncontrollable, insidious disease, pneumoconiosis, I found that he was voicing my sentiments. If such a commission is appointed it will bring about the following benefits: (1) We shall be able to integrate into our legislation in respect of occupational diseases the most modern, scientific research results in relation to this dread disease; (2) after having obtained expert advice our whole approach to this terrible problem may change completely; (3) it may result, firstly, in the granting of a pension to the mineworkers, just as in the case of a teacher or a public servant, once he has completed a certain number of years of service in the mining industry and, secondly, it may result in the granting of a pension to a mineworker who becomes disabled during his period of service, irrespective of the cause of his disability.</p>

<p>I want to conclude on this note: I stand by this measure; I will support this measure with all the power at my command; I will support every amendment which is designed to improve this measure. There is one thing that worries me a little&#x2014;I am not an expert in the medical sphere&#x2014;and that is the meticulous measuring that takes place to check the health of the mineworker; even his breath is measured and he either makes the grade or just fails to make the grade. I think it is this sort of thing which makes our mineworkers dissatisfied. I hope and trust that the medical advisers (for whom we have the greatest respect) of the hon. the Minister, in whom I have the fullest confidence and in whose sympathetic treatment I have unlimited faith, and the Medical Bureau, which is staffed by honourable men, men who would not allow personal reasons to enter into the picture when it comes to the treatment of the mineworker and the diagnosis and certification of a disease, will carry on and that in the course of time they will produce a measure which is a further improvement on what is already a model Act.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>I want to express my sincere appreciation to both sides of the House for the responsible and sensible way in which they dealt with this Bill. I wish to express my thanks to hon. members opposite, particularly to the hon. member for Germiston (District) (Mr. Tucker), who was the first speaker, for giving the assurance that the Opposition welcomes this Bill and accepts it, although they have certain doubts in regard to certain clauses. Much of the discussion today did not really concern this Bill, but the 1962 Act. I think you will agree with me, Sir, when I say that it is not my task this afternoon to deal in detail with that particular criticism when we are dealing with a Bill introduced this year. I hope you will allow me during the course of my reply to refer to a few points of criticism voiced against me and my Department here, criticism which appeared rather irresponsible to me but which I cannot just allow to pass.</p>

<p>In this regard I want to refer in the first place to the criticism of the hon. member for Springs (Mr. Taurog), which he did not voice to-day here for the first time but for the umpteenth time. The hon. member for Springs once again made a general accusation. I am sorry to have to say what I am about to say; I do not do it to show any ill-will but, as I have said before, the hon. member for Springs voices severe criticism based on insufficient knowledge of this matter. If he had known more about it, he would not have said what he did. As on former occasions, the hon. member for Springs again said that I had stated that this was now the fruit of lengthy scientific research. Where is that research? Can you show it to me? He says the research was so little that I, after the Bill was passed, had to send a mission overseas to go and find out whether this legislation was correct. Sir, that is a totally wrong attitude. The 1962 Act was based on the research and the reports and the investigations of all the commissions of inquiry, the Stratford Commission, the Allen Commission, the Beyers Commission and the Oosthuizen Commission. That legislation was based on that. Some of the principles contained in that legislation are the same principles for which the hon. members for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) and Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) have been pleading in this House for years. That mission we sent overseas did not go there to confirm the scientific basis of the 1962 Act. They went to investigate quite a different matter. They went to investigate the problem of the aftercare and the treatment of pneumoconiosis sufferers, particularly with respect to aluminium therapy. It had nothing to do with this legislation. What we do with such a man, his after-care, is quite a different field of activity. We hope to be able to come to this House <span class="col_5833-5834" refersTo="page_250"/>later with proposals in connection with that after-care.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs and other hon. members also said that we were in too much of a hurry with the 1962 Act. I admit that we acted speedily. But I still say that even if we had gone much more slowly no hon. member would have been able to give me the assurance that technical faults would not have slipped in. Technical mistakes slip into any legislation. It is only in the practical application of an Act that one discovers any technical faults. Even though we had discussed that Act for weeks, such technical faults would still have appeared. Neither the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) nor the hon. member for Springs have pointed out one fundamental mistake in this Act. We hear about the disabilities; we hear about the weaknesses, we hear of the shortcomings in the 1962 Act, but we are not told how the Act is basically defective. The hon. member for Springs and other hon. members have now said for the umpteenth time that I had said it was an agreed measure, and that I had misled the House. Must I reveal the facts to hon. members now? I shall give them the details. I repeat that it was an agreed measure between my Department, the Chamber of Mines and the mining trade unions, and I have written proof of it. I have before me an extract from the minutes of consultations lasting for months between my Department and the trade unions. I have the reservations which the trade unions had in regard to the legislation, reservations which we met. I have the resolution of the trade unions which says that after the reservations fell away, &#x201C;the draft Bill was accepted by Mr. Ellis&#x2019; proposal&#x201D;. As the hon. member for Ventersdorp said, the representatives of the trade unions sat in the gallery here. On previous days they visited me and asked that the legislation should in heaven&#x2019;s name be put through that year still and that we should not wait until the next year. That was the attitude of the trade unions.</p>

<p>What about the Chamber of Mines? Mr. Speaker, I have the correspondence before me and I will show it to hon. members if they want to see it. The Chamber of Mines discussed this matter and expressed their satisfaction with everything except in regard to the medical aspect. I mentioned that during my second-reading speech. They were not quite satisfied with the medical aspect of certification. The Chamber asked me whether I, after the legislation had been in operation for a while, would have the matter investigated in order to see whether this aspect worked satisfactorily in practice, and I agreed. You will remember that I mentioned this in my second-reading speech at the time. Thereafter I received a letter from the Chamber of Mines saying that subject to that condition they accepted the Bill in its present form. I hope the hon. member for Springs will now take my word for it that both the Chamber of Mines, with the proviso I mentioned in the debate, and the trade union accepted the Bill, and that the trade union insisted that it should be passed that year still. I cannot help it if thereafter certain people set afoot new movements in the trade unions. I cannot help it if a Dr. Scheepers came along&#x2014;I think it was the hon. member for Florida who mentioned his name&#x2014;who told the mineworkers certain things. I had everything investigated by a panel of experts, and this panel of medical experts rejected in principle everything he had said, and then he disappeared and we never heard from him again.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs spoke about the dissatisfaction among the mineworkers. I also represent a mining constituency, and perhaps one of the biggest mining constituencies. I also hold meetings among the mining voters, and I also know what the feeling is among the mineworkers. I know there is a certain amount of dissatisfaction, but one gets dissatisfaction under any Act. I think we should ask the hon. members for Springs and Florida to draft an Act for us, and I am convinced that there will be people who are dissatisfied with that also. One cannot get any Act which applies to tens of thousands of people without finding people who are dissatisfied with it. But I can say that there is much less dissatisfaction with the present Act than with any previous Act. I administered the previous Act for some time, and I have now administered the existing Act for 20 months. I know what letters come in weekly from people who complain. I know what happened under the old Act and what is happening under the new Act. Whereas under the old Act we received approximately 28 complaints a week, in the first six months under the new Act we received only nine per month. Nine per month! And the people who complain are mostly people who complain that they are not classified in a higher category, which is quite understandable psychologically. They are, in most cases, people who are dissatisfied because they were classified in the first and not in the second or third category. But the complaints are much fewer than under the previous Acts. Hon. members can go to the bureau and the bureau will tell them how smoothly this Act is working, and that gratitude is continually being expressed, much more so than under the previous legislation. But there are people who are dissatisfied. That one will always have. There is, however, greater satisfaction under the present Act than under any previous Act.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Springs referred to a certain machine which is used, and the hon. member for Ventersdorp also referred to it. Sir, that lung function testing machine is not the basis for determining whether a man has tuberculosis or not, or whether he has pneumoconiosis or not. These lung function tests are only one of the measures applied, and the mineworker can choose whether he wants to have it or not. There are many other measures, clinical examinations, pathological examinations, radiological examinations, and the whole history of the mineworker is investigated <span class="col_5835-5836" refersTo="page_251"/>, and this machine is not the decisive factor; it is only an additional factor. The hon. member should not run away with the idea that this is the machine which now determines whether a mineworker is sick or not.</p>

<p>The hon. members for Rosettenville (Dr. Fisher) and Durban (Central) (Dr. Radford) and Wolmaransstad (Mr. G. P. van den Berg) and Odendaalsrus (Dr. Meyer) spoke very seriously about the tuberculotic cases and the provision in the Bill which provides that tuberculosis cases may again work in a dusty atmosphere. I may tell them that I also realize the seriousness of the matter. We know it is a serious matter. I do not wish to quarrel with the medical men on this matter. My Department has instituted investigations and obtained the advice of prominent medical men in regard to the matter, and we received the reply from them that we should continue with the measure, subject to the provision I have already explained. I can give hon. members the assurance that if this Bill is passed, this section will be applied with the greatest circumspection. The hon. member for Germiston (District) asked whether we could not insert a section providing for the withdrawal of this certificate. This is not necessary. Section 23 of the Act already provides that the Dirctor may at any time again withdraw any certificate. Provision has therefore already been made for it, and we shall act with the greatest circumspection, and if we find anything that looks dangerous I will ask the House to withdraw this provision. It is a matter which we have thoroughly investigated, after both the Chamber and the trade unions and the medical men advised us that under these circumstances we could take this step. The hon. member for Rosettenville asked me whether a pneumoconiosis sufferer of 50 years of age or more will be allowed to enter a mine. He may not. In terms of the Act, nobody aged 50 or over may work in a dusty atmosphere.</p>

<p>May I put a question? If a mineworker suffers from tuberculosis with 15 per cent pneumoconiosis, will he be allowed to work underground if his tuberculosis has been cured and certified?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_mines">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF MINES</person>:</from>

<p>No. I think I have now disposed of most of the general problems mentioned by hon. members. The hon. member for Springs put another question. He says that there is a certain amount of confusion among the mineworkers in regard to a directive I am alleged to have issued in regard to the old first-grade pneumoconiosis sufferers. I just want to tell the hon. member that I never issued such a directive. But what I did in fact do was to lay down certain standdards. One of those standards is that clear radiological signs of pneumoconiosis should be accepted as being a minimum of 20 per cent pneumoconiosis. But every old pneumoconiosis sufferer under the old system must be re-examined, and if in terms of the standard laid down he is grouped between 20 per cent and 50 per cent, he immediately receives a pension. He does not get it automatically.</p>

<p>The hon. member also aksed me to what extent this legislation would assist the marginal mines. His information is that it will not help them. I do not know how the hon. member can say that. To begin with, the actuaries are still busy calculating the outstanding debt of all the mines. The actuaries have not yet submitted their report. We hope to receive it in the near future, and when we receive it we will be able to determine the outstanding debts, which will be calculated favourably for the older mines. We have also appointed a risks committee and we are convinced that the activities of this committee will benefit the old mines.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I just want to reply to a question put by the hon. member for Germiston (District) and other hon. members, namely whether in terms of the new approach which we will now follow we will grant favourable consideration to proposals submitted by the Chamber of Mines and the trade unions. Let me say that we will handle them with great seriousness and the greatest circumspection. When a trade union or trade unions, the employees and the employers agree with one another on an important matter, it is a serious matter and not something which we can lightly brush aside. Therefore one must take serious notice of it. But although we will take serious notice of it, I want to tell the hon. member that we will be very critical because we do not want this new dispensation which we are creating for the mining industry to be more detrimental either to the mines and to the workers than the existing one. I take it that this is also the same point which hon. members there adopt. We shall not allow ourselves to be forced into a new situation without proper investigation.</p>

<li>(b) in terms of Section 75 of the Customs Act, 1955, approves of the notes which were exchanged between the Governments of the Republic of South Africa and Southern Rhodesia on 23 December 1963 confirming South Africa&#x2019;s agreement to the continued application of the terms and provisions of the Trade Agreement of 16 May 1960 between the Republic of South Africa and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to the trade between South Africa and Southern Rhodesia after the dissolution of the Federation on 31 December 1963,</li>

</ol>

<block name="quote">copies of which were laid upon the Table on 26 March 1964.</block>

<p>On 26 March 1964 already I tabled copies of the exchange of notes relating to this motion. In regard to part (a) of this motion, the British Government informed the South African Government in May 1962 that in principle it had granted a request for the customs-free entry of apricots, peaches and cherries preserved in water. At the same time the South African Government was requested to relieve the British Government of its obligation to maintain a preference margin of 10 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> on these products.</p>

<p>The reason for this request was stated to be that British canners import these products from the Continent of Europe as raw material for the canning of fruit and fruit salad and that the import duties payable on it put the British canners in an unfavourable position, particularly <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> cheaper fruit salad from the non-Commonwealth countries, on which only a sugar duty of 0.625 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> is payable. The British Government indicated that the withdrawal of this preference margin was of particular interest to it due to the difficulties experienced by the British canners as the result of foreign competition.</p>

<p>In considering this request, the South African Government took into consideration that it was desirable that the Ottawa Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom should be applied in a spirit of mutual goodwill. The British Government has, for example, always been prepared in the past to agree to the temporary suspension of the guaranteed preference margin it has enjoyed on tinplate in South Africa on occasions when British producers were not able to supply South Africa&#x2019;s requirements. In that way the fruit canning industry in South Africa derived considerable benefit from this in the form of lower prices for cans.</p>

<p>Although from time to time small quantities of peaches and pineapples preserved in water are exported to the United Kingdom and it is clear that the withdrawal of this preference margin will place the British canners in a more advantageous position to compete with South African canned fruit in the British market, it was nevertheless decided that it would still be advisable to accede to the British request, on the understanding that the question of compensation to South Africa for abandoning this preference margin would be discussed during future tariff negotiations between the two countries. Notes were exchanged to confirm the Republic&#x2019;s agreement, and the House is now being asked to approve this exchange of notes.</p>

<p>In so far as part (b) of my motion is concerned, the position is that the trade agreement of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, in terms of its provisions, will remain in force until 30 June 1965 and thereafter will remain in force until after the expiry of 12 months from the date on which the one party or the other gives notice of its intention to terminate the agreement.</p>

<p>The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasa-land was, however, dissolved on 31 December 1963 and in terms of the arrangements for its dissolution the functions in regard to customs and excise and related matters in respect of Southern Rhodesia, which previously have been performed by the Federal Government, reverted to the Southern Rhodesian Government.</p>

<p>In order to avoid any disruption of the trade relations between South African and Southern Rhodesia after the dissolution of the Federation, the Southern Rhodesian Government proposed that the trade agreement of 16 May 1960 between South Africa and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland should remain in force between Southern Rhodesia and the Republic of South Africa until such time as the two Governments have agreed on and have reached a decision in regard to the conditions of their future trade relations.</p>

<p>It will also be to the benefit of South Africa if its trade relations with Southern Rhodesia are disturbed as little as possible until such time as they can be placed on a firm basis. The Southern Rhodesian Government&#x2019;s proposal was therefore accepted as an interim arrangement, and notes were exchanged between the South African and the Southern Rhodesian Governments in order to <span class="col_5839-5840" refersTo="page_253"/>confirm the South African Government&#x2019;s approval of the proposal made by Southern Rhodesia. The House is now being asked to approve this exchange of notes also.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as far as this side of the House is concerned, we have no objection to the approval of this exchange of notes.

<p>I think the hon. member is referring to the abandonment of the preference margin. In this margin I just want to say that the same phrase appears in quite a few proposals of a similar nature which I have already made. By abandoning the preference margin in respect of these goods, we are losing something in Britain. That has happened a few times already in the past, althouth we have not yet demanded any compensation from Britain for what we lost in that way. It stands over to a later stage, when we will group together several of these things and ask for compensation for what we have abandoned. In other words, it will take place between state and state.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The amendments which were effected to this Bill in the Committe Stage indicate the extent to which both sides of the House co-operated to reach agreement on the various points. This Bill is, after all, the very basis on which this Parliament exists. The functioning of the electoral machinery decides whether or not democracy in this country works or not, and I am very pleased that we have been able to reach this measure of agreement. I hope the hon. the Minister will allow me the pleasure of saying that we could have reached the stage at which we now are as far back as 1955 when this side of the House introduced a private member&#x2019;s Bill incorporating the principles of the Bill before us now. The matter was again raised by us in 1960, 1961 and 1962. And from the suggestions we made over the years &#x2026; [Interruptions.] Gradually the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) who is grumbling away in his seat, as well as others, have come to see the light. And now we have before us a measure on which, bar a few aspects, we are agreed. [Interruptions.] I think there are hon. members who are not quite sure as to their motives in accepting our suggestions but they were nevertheless accepted.</p>

<p>However, the point is that now we have succeeded in placing upon the Statute Book machinery which, with a few exceptions, is agreed, and whereunder our future elections will be conducted. But no machinery can work unless the people in charge of it want to make it work. You can create the finest machine in the world, but if that machine is not maintained and driven properly, or controlled properly, it will fail. The success or failure of the Bill we are now passing will depend upon the joint willingness of both sides of the House when they go to the hustings to conduct elections in the spirit in which we have placed these amendments upon the Statute Book; a spirit of seeking to close the door against abuses and of creating complete and total confidence in the system as well as in the security and the privacy of each individual&#x2019;s vote. I am sorry that there should be points of differences which remain. There is, for instance, the question of justices of the peace, who are not State officials, and of stationmasters who are entitled to take part in politics acting as presiding officers for absent voters. This is something which we feel is not in keeping with the spirit of the Bill but it is a matter which the Minister said he would watch. We accept his assurance that if it should be found that the inclusion of these categories was not necessary or is being abused, he will reconsider the position. That will soon become clear. We are also unhappy that the Minister did not take this opportunity of removing the restrictions which exist on voting outside South Africa. But apart from that, as the Bill is now before us, there remain only a few minor matters which have not yet been finalized. I want to remind the Minister of the three matters he has promised to investigate, where we are agreed in our objective, but not in regard to the wording necessary to achieve that objective. There was an amendment moved to Clause 7, a technical one which I will not deal with, which the Minister wants to go into and which we hope he will correct in the Other Place. In regard to Clause 15, there was an important issue, the right of parties to accompany a polling officer when he goes out to take a postal vote. There again, we were agreed on the principle and it was a question of wording. I trust that the Minister has now been able to give some thought to the matter and that in the Other Place he will introduce an amendment placing the onus on the political parties to make the approach, but making it quite clear that when the approach is made, the polling officer must accede to any request to be accompanied by a representative of the candidate. The other matter of importance was the question <span class="col_5841-5842" refersTo="page_254"/>which may need a contingent motion in order to introduce protection against intimidation either in the polling booth or by the presiding officer for absent voters. Those are the matters which are outstanding and on which the Minister said he accepted our point of view but in regard to which we could not find the exact formula for settling our problems. On the assurances the Minister has given us we believe that mechanically this Bill should now provide for clean procedure in regard to absent voters, and being the fruit of consultations in the select committee and on the commission, we believe it represents as far as it is possible to get this, the joint and unanimous wishes of all the political organizations which will have to work within the framework of this measure.</p>

<p>We support this third reading and we are grateful for the spirit in which the Minister has met us in almost all the proposals we have put forward.</p>

<p>Those were merely my introductory remarks. But the hon. member for Durban Point (Mr. Raw) has now shown a few small horns at the third reading, and the wings have become shorter, for this reason, that the hon. member really wants to take the credit, from a party political angle, that they are really responsible for the amendments in this Bill. The hon. member will recall that in all the elections that have been fought, this side of the House has always been accused that the results were due to the fact that postal votes have not been dealt with too well by this side of the House. Thereafter I said in my second-reading speech that this Bill did not originate with my Department or myself, but from the instructions of this House, and I think we must put the matter in its proper perspective. It was a joint attempt by this House to close the loopholes. The Act is there now and this is the third reading, but I should like to predict that loopholes will still always be found, because illegal practices can still take place at any time, and possibly the existing malpractices may also still continue. I should like to make an appeal here to-day. There is no doubt that it has been exaggerated very much, and the public possibly gained the impression during the passage of this Act that an election is fought in such a manner that the people who should really win do not win, and that is not true. The commission itself found that those malpractices were exaggerated very much. As we are now making an honest attempt to put a stop to it, I should like to appeal to the whole House and the country that in future there should not be the slightest vestige of a suggestion that elections are not fought on an honest basis. If we find loopholes, we shall close them further, and we want to retain the confidence of our people outside, as well as that of the whole world, in the honest manner in which elections are fought in this country. That was our honest intention. All the suggestions and the co-operation are appreciated. The few things mentioned here by the hon. member have not really been accepted by me; I think the hon. member put it somewhat strongly, but I said I would give my serious attention to it, and I am already doing so. I have already had consultations to see to what extent we can still put right those things, as the hon. members would like us to do, and then I shall do it in the Other Place. I should like to express my thanks and appreciation as well as my hope that this legislation will be to our credit, and will strengthen the confidence of the electorate, and will give them the assurance that in this country we are honest people who win honestly and lose courageously.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. J. M. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, shortly before the House adjourned, the hon. member for Orange Grove (Mr. E. G. Malan) put some questions to the Minister on the report of the Press Commission and the Minister kindly replied to him immediately. We appreciated that speedy reaction on the part of the Minister. We feel that in some respects the short speech made by the Minister yesterday was more important than the report itself. It took him ten minutes, while it took the Press Commission 13 years; yet I think, on balance, more importance should be attached to the Minister&#x2019;s speech than to the report of the commission. The Minister made it very clear that the Government was not taking immediate decisions on the report. I think it is wise not to take immediate decisions to carry out the recommendations of the commission. I think it is wise to give the public an opportunity of reacting to the far-reaching findings of the commission. At the same time I think it would be wrong of the Minister to delay announcing that the Government is not accepting the main recommendations of the commission; it would be unfair to expect the public to react while the sword of Damocles is hanging over the head of the <span class="col_5843-5844" refersTo="page_255"/>Press. Make no mistake, Sir, the main recommendation of the commission is a form of censorship of the Press more severe than the censorship of particular messages; it threatens to deprive people who send reports overseas of their very right to practise their calling. It is more drastic than censoring a particular message, but I do not want to go into that now. I want to ask the Minister whether he will at least tell us whether he will accept a suggestion made by the commission itself that it should be appointed to perform the third part of its task. The commission found 13 years quite inadequate to do three simple jobs. The first job was to investigate the Press in South Africa. It only had time to investigate reports sent out from South Africa. I do not want to derogate from the importance of that work, but it did create this peculiar result, that it became unnecessary for the commission to investigate the Afrikaans or Nationalist Party Press, because they do not send reports overseas. So the public are not in a position to judge of the Press in South Africa at all. Because most of the reports going overseas emanate from the employees of English language newspapers, they had to be investigated but the Afrikaans, and especially the Nationalist Party Press, which in my opinion is more guilty of many of the things attributed to the English Press, was not investigated at all. We have a one-sided and lopsided report, on which it is impossible for public opinion to adjudicate.</p>

<p>Having said that, I want to return to what I consider to be even more important than the commission itself, and that is the Minister&#x2019;s comments on the commission yesterday. He told us that the Government could not react immediately, because this report was regarded as confidential. He told us that it was regarded as so confidential that not a single member of the Cabinet was allowed to see the report before it was tabled yesterday. His own words, as I recall them at the time, and as I checked them with the resources at our disposal, were these&#x2014;</p>

We are told by the Government that in many respects we are a beleaguered country, misunderstood by all the world and persecuted by a large part of it. We are told several times a day by the S.A.B.C. that we are virtually at war. At a time like that it is essential that South Africa should have implicit trust and confidence in the reliability and trustworthiness of its great public institutions. South Africa has the right to demand trustworthiness from the Press, but it has an equal right to demand trustworthiness from the Cabinet. I want the Minister to explain to us on whose authority he withheld this report from the Cabinet, because he feared leakages if his colleagues should get hold of it. In the meantime, we happen to know that the same report was available to officials, e.g. of the Department of Information, officials who kindly prepared a fine summary, as far as we can judge in the time available to us, of the report. Officials of the Department of Information were trustworthy enough to get this report, but the Minister tells us he dared not give it to his own colleagues, not even to the Prime Minister, in order to prevent leakages. Sir, this is a dreadful situation and one of which South Africa should take note. I think the Minister should tell this House on whose authority he denied access to this document to members of the Cabinet? Who warned him about the leakages which would occur if the Cabinet saw this? Why did the Prime Minister not see it? Can the Prime Minister not be trusted?</p>

<p>I believe that this was a decision obviously taken by the Minister himself. He must have found himself in the same position as the Duke of Wellington when in the Iberian Peninsula he was sent a number of raw recruits from Britain, recruits who had been picked up wherever they could be found, and he looked upon them in the same way as the hon. the Minister looked upon the Cabinet, and he said: &#x201C;I do not know what you will do to the enemy, but you put the fear of God into me.&#x201D; [Laughter.] [Time limit.]</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Yeoville (Mr. S. J. M. Steyn) wants us to take him seriously, he should not behave like a clown in this House so often. In the first place he congratulates the Minister for saying that the Government is not going to take any decisions on this matter at the present time, but in this morning&#x2019;s <i>Cape Times</i> the Leader of the Opposition insists that the Government should take immediate decisions on the report of this commission. The Minister has announced the Government&#x2019;s standpoint very clearly. Here we have a report of more than 4,000 pages. The Government is going to study that report and it will in due course announce what it is going to do.</p>

<p>But there is another very serious question that arises, namely this: What are the owners of the English papers going to do about this report? What are the directors of those newspapers going to do about it? Are they going to study this report to see whether what is contained therein is true, and if they find it is true, what are they going to do with the members of their staff who wrote these scandalous things? In these newspaper offices there are responsible people in respect of whom the <span class="col_5845-5846" refersTo="page_256"/>commission found that a responsible person like the editor of the <i>Cape Times</i> sent out false reports to besmirch this country. What is Mr. Clive Corder going to do about that? Is he going to leave it at that, or is he going to investigate the matter to see whether it is true? And if it is true, is he going to continue to employ that traitor to South Africa as editor of the <i>Cape Times</i>? That is the question facing South Africa. It is not the Government which is in the dock as the accused; it is the owners and the directors of the English newspapers, Mr. Clive Corder and Mr. Edmunds and Mr. Brown, because the Press Commission lays the charge against them that in time of crisis large sections of their staff sent out of the country the most scandalous lies about South Africa; not the young journalists but their most senior journalists, people like the editor of the <i>Cape Times</i> and like Stanley Uys&#x2014;their chief political reporters. This is what the commission says about them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In many instances most of those full-timers and a few South African stringers piled sensation upon already existing sensation and despatched news coloured by derogatory, hostile and frequently untruthful comment, which the commission found to be amongst the worst of all the reporting done from South Africa during the two periods of reporting examined by it.</block>

<p>It was at the time when an attack was made on the life of the Prime Minister. That was the time when members of the staffs of these English newspapers sent out of this country the most scandalous lies in order to besmirch South Africa. They then waited to see a successful revolution. Those are not my words, but the words of the commission. Now, what do the owners of those newspapers propose to do about this matter? I am not saying they should accept the commission&#x2019;s report as true, but are they going to investigate the matter?</p>

<p>But there is another question. What is the Opposition going to do about the report? The Leader of the Opposition has said, quite fairly, that he is going to appoint a commission to study this report. Now I should like to ask him: If that commission finds that the findings of this report are well-founded, that those besmirchers of South Africa are in the employ of the English newspapers, that some of the senior journalists of those newspapers have defiled this country in the most shocking way, are they going to sit still? The Leader of the Opposition this morning referred to the so-called intimidation of the Press. Why is this Press intimidated so easily? The Leader of the Opposition says: &#x201C;This process of intimidation has not served to enhance the reputation of South Africa.&#x201D;</p>

They have to say whether they are then going to sit still. And there is a duty on the owners of the English newspapers whose employees are accused here of having done these terrible things to South Africa. The people of South Africa want to know whether they are going to reject those allegations, or whether they are going to investigate them to find out whether what this commission says is rue, and if it is true, what do they intend doing with this band of traitors they are paying every day? [Interjections.] The Minister has said what the Government intends doing. It is going to study the report, and if it finds it necessary to do something, it will announce what it is going to do. All I am asking is this, and the hon. the Leader of the Opposition cannot laugh it away, and the directors of the English newspapers cannot laugh away these things.

<p>May I have the privilege of the half hour? I am not going to reply to the hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee). I think this House is used to his violent, obsessional hatred of the English language Press. I think it is noteworthy, however, that when the hon. member first came to this House he did not at that stage belong to the Nationalist Party, and at that time he was one of the defenders of the freedom of speech.</p>

<p>When the hon. member crossed the floor of the House and joined the Government party, it was then that all his inherent feelings against freedom of speech and of opinion began to manifest themselves. When he found himself the object of criticism by the English Press, the hon. member showed himself in his true colours, so it is not worth debating with him. As far as I am concerned, the less action that is taken on this Press Commission&#x2019;s report, the better, because I have seldom read anything that is more fatuous and more completely wasteful of time and money as far as this country is concerned.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister announced last night that it was not his intention to proceed with any legislation in this regard, but nevertheless I think one ought to say something about this second report of the Press Commission, or rather, about this official summary which magically made its appearance and for which I for one am very grateful, because obviously there was no time to read through the mountainous amount of verbiage which has been produced by the Press Commission in its second report. [Interjections.] I am speaking of the official report put out by the Minister of Information, for the benefit of members of this House. I do not think anyone is under any delusion as to the original reasons for the appointment of the Press Commission. It is part and parcel of the whole cold war that has been waged by the Government against the concept of freedom of expression in South Africa.</p>

<p>But I doubt very much if anybody could have seriously contemplated the chequered course that this Commission has had, or could have imagined that grown men could sit down for nearly 14 years indulging themselves in the absolutely puerile task of sifting thousands of words, of cables with the object of classifying their authors into the headings of &#x201C;good, faulty, bad or very bad.&#x201D; I must say that a lot of things have happened in this country in the past 14 years to bring odium on our heads, but I cannot think of anything more calculated to make us the laughing stock of the civilized world that a report such as this which takes the names of reputable journalists and classifies them in this puerile classification. Some of the world&#x2019;s most famous newspapermen have in fact received dishonourable mention by the Press Commission, men and women whose names I would say carry a good deal more weight than many of the members of the Press Commission itself, including the hon. member for Standerton, who is one of the two surviving members of that Commission. The chief foreign correspondents of some of the most highly respected and responsible newspapers of the world are castigated by this Commission. There is a Pulitzer prize-winner, the Associated Press man, Mr. Henzerling, who is among those singled out for disfavour. There are some of the world&#x2019;s greatest foreign correspondents, one of the world&#x2019;s best War Correspondents, Mr. Noel Monks of the <i>Daily Mail,</i> Douglas Brown of the <i>Daily Telegraph,</i> the top men of Reuters, Mr. Sean Maynes and Astley Hawkins, Mr. Wise of the <i>Daily Express,</i> a top foreign correspondent, the top men of U.P.I. and A.P., of the <i>New York Times</i> and Dame Rebecca West, who is one of the world&#x2019;s greatest writers, whose names I am quite sure will remain in the memories of the world long after the names of the members of the Press Commission have passed on into the limbo of forgotten men. All these people are household names, and yet we have this incredible spectacle of the commissioners sitting down and handing out bad conduct marks to men and women of this calibre. Throughout this report there are anguished moans about South Africa being misunderstood, that the views of minority parties and &#x201C;of deviators and dissidents&#x201D;&#x2014;and these are real authoritarian phrases&#x2014;are given all the publicity, but no one ever defends the Government&#x2019;s eminently sane and sober ideas or appreciates that its policies are nothing more than the old traditional way of life of South Africa, which the Commission says, according to the summary, &#x201C;is generally accepted by the vast majority of people in every race and language group in South Africa.&#x201D; Well, it seems to me that the commissioners have done nothing but talk to themselves for the last 13 years. It also seems to me that the charge of misrepresentation brought by the Commission can much more truly be brought against itself instead of against these journalists. The hon. member for Vereeniging spoke about false reporting. I want to draw his attention to some of the sections quoted in this <span class="col_5849-5850" refersTo="page_258"/>summary, and then he can tell us whether this is an impartial summing-up of the situation. Take the extraordinary statement made by the Commission about Reuters on page 16. It says there is practically no need or desire by members of any non-White group to be admitted into White society, or by members of any non-White group to be admitted into the society of another group. This is one of the charges against Reuters, that it failed to make mention of this fact that there is practically no need or desire by members of any non-White group to be admitted into White society. Well, if that is so, perhaps the hon. member for Vereeniging will explain to the House why it has been necessary since the Government came into power, to introduce the Separate Amenities Act and the Group Areas Act, the Mixed Marriages Act and to amend the Immorality Act? I wonder whether the hon. member will explain to this House why, if there is no desire on the part of any member of the non-White groups to mix with anybody in any other group, the Government has found it necessary to introduce one piece of legislation after the other designed with the specific purpose of keeping the racial groups apart. As far as I know, Governments are not supposed to waste the time of the House of Parliament in passing laws for which there is no need, and according to this report the charge against Reuters is that it failed to make any mention of the fact that there was no such need. On page 17 of the summary of the commission&#x2019;s report, the complaint is made that Reuters &#x201C;selected news which created the impression that Indians were oppressed, being discriminated against and generally not justly dealt by and that it was the present Government who was primarily responsible for this state of affairs.&#x201D; But, Sir, is it not a fact that Indians are being oppressed and discriminated against? And is it not this Government that has carried that discrimination even further? What does the hon. member for Vereeniging, for instance, think the Indians feel about the Group Areas Act, about the fact that most of the Indians in the Transvaal are awaiting ejection under the Group Areas Act and that their livelihood is going to be taken away from them? Is it therefore false reporting to say that the Indians are being oppressed and discriminated against? Is it false reporting to say that they have no vote and that they are unable to move from one province to the other? Because is this not in fact oppression? Does the hon. the Minister think the reporting of Reuters is less accurate than some of the glossy pamphlets which I have seen being distributed overseas by our Department of Information? These represent the Indians as living a happy and prosperous life, and show little Indians girls trotting happily off to school or being driven to school in large automobiles belonging to their parents. Is that a true picture of the life of the Indian community in South Africa or is the true position that the vast majority of Indians live on a very low standard of living and are being discriminated against? Are the pamphlets being put out by the Minister of Information about the African population in this country, creating a picture of prosperous business men in the townships of Johannesburg while he knows that all these are living under a threat of ejection to the reserve, that they are not allowed to expand their businesses, that pass laws prohibit free movement, etc.? Which is the faulty reporting: the reporting of Reuters or these pamphlets being put out by the hon. the Minister of Information?</p>

<p>Take, furthermore, the commission&#x2019;s complaint that cables which were sent overseas created the impression that the Government was intolerant towards the African trade union movement in South Africa. But is it not a fact that the Government is intolerant towards African trade unions in this country? Did not the hon. the Minister of Labour when he introduced the Settlement of Disputes Act say that he hoped that this trade union movement would die on is feet?</p>

<p>The hon. member knows full well that while one is in a certain party one publicly supports the policy of that party while you can move resolution after resolution at the party&#x2019;s congresses to get that policy changed if you want it changed. That is what I did. My main question to the hon. member for Vereeniging and to the hon. the Minister is how it is that this commission, according to page 5 of the summary, had little criticism to offer in regard to general news despatched from South Africa, more particularly news dealing with mining, scientific, financial, economic, industrial, agricultural and educational matters? How is it that the commission could find that the reports about these matters, both as regards the selection and presentation of the news, fair and reasonable? That covers practically the entire orbit of life in South Africa&#x2014;every facet with the exception of the political and racial field. Now, can hon. members opposite explain to me how it is that this commission could find that these very same journalists, the very same men whom the hon. member for Vereeniging castigates as being unmitigated liars, are able to report fairly and apparently without bias on education, mining, scientific, economic and industrial matters but the minute they turn to racial or political matters they become unmitigated liars?</p>

<p>It is extraordinary that these very same people can immediately drop all their claims to veracity and turn into avowed enemies of the Nationalist Government or of Afrikanerdom. According to this <span class="col_5851-5852" refersTo="page_259"/>report, the minute these 6 journalists with their measured opinion on every other matter turn to racial or political matters they become Jekylls and Hydes&#x2014;their whole personality changes and they immediately become the tools of communists. I wonder how long the hon. member for Vereeniging will continue to believe that conservative and respectable newspapers like the <i>New York Times,</i> or the London <i>Times</i> and an avowed anti-communist magazine like <i>Time,</i> would continue to allow correspondents to represent them who are tools of communists and immediately drop all pretence to impartial reporting the moment they have to report on racial matters. Of course, what the commission failed to appreciate, what the Government fails to appreciate and, more particularly, what the hon.. member for Vereeniging fails to appreciate&#x2014;because he has to outdo everybody in his protestations of loyalty to the Nationalist Government and its policies&#x2014;is that it is the racialism of this country which upsets people and that it is the racialism being practised in this country which is not accepted by civilized people&#x2014;be they journalists or not.</p>

<p>I have seen enough from the direct quotes contained in this summary of the report of the commission to justify my saying that the commission examined the evidence before it from the point of view of the Nationalist Government. The contradictory quotes which I have read out should, I believe, show this quite convincingly. In other words, what I am trying to say is that anti-communists hate racialism more, far more, than the people the hon. member for Vereeniging believes they are shielding. That is why the utterances of what the commission calls minor political groups receive &#x201C;unwarranted prominence&#x201D; in reports going overseas. Those views happen to reflect the views of the civilized world and the criticism of racialism is the criticism that is echoed by the civilized world and therefore receives all this prominence in the overseas Press. It would be surprising if it did not. It would be just as surprising to my mind if the Nationalist Press failed to give publicity to the views of Government spokesmen. We must accept that. Equally one should expect newspapers overseas, that are against racialism, who have adopted non-discrimination as the ethical policy for the civilized world, to give prominence to views which are against racialism, the racialism which emanates from South Africa.</p>

<p>If the report itself is fatuous I believe the recommendations are downright dangerous and that they are a menace to anybody who has any idea of the cherished concept of freedom of opinion. Last year when the Censorship Act was passed in this House I said we were engaged on a dangerous course in South Africa, that we were going ever further along the road of inhibiting thought and the freedom of expression under threats of punishment. I objected to the setting up of a Press Board with a &#x201C;voluntary&#x201D; code of conduct. I then criticized the N.P.U. for accepting the principle of a &#x201C;voluntary&#x201D; form of censorship of newspapers. Because I believed, and I still believe, that once that basic principle was conceded, and it was conceded by the various sectors that a voluntary code was necessary for the newspapers, the first important breach in the whole concept of freedom of expression had been made in South Africa. The Censorship Act, of course, went even further with its very wide definition of what was considered undesirable literature. Now we have a vast mass of verbiage, the second report of the Press Commission, and what does it propose? It proposes what it calls &#x201C;self-control of the Press&#x201D;. This &#x201C;self-control&#x201D; of course, is to be imposed from outside. That how much &#x201C;self&#x201D; there is to be in this &#x201C;self-control&#x201D;. One must point out that already there are many inhibitions on free reporting in this country. We have our criminal procedure laws which prevent the reporting of anything that goes on in prisons. We have the Sabotage Act which gave the hon. the Minister of Justice the power to ban newspapers he thought were advancing aims of which he disapproved. We have the Riotous Assemblies Act. All these Acts in one way or another inhibit free reporting and go far further than any censorship in any of the normal democratic countries in the world. In giving evidence before the commission the N.P.U. asked for relaxation of these inhibiting laws, with the exception, incidentally of <i>Dagbreek</i> and the Voortrekker Pers. The Press Commission&#x2019;s reply to that request of the N.P.U. for release from inhibitions was to recommend the establishment of a Press Council with punitive powers from which there is no right of appeal! Fines may be levied, licences may be suspended or cancelled with no right of appeal from this Press Council. According to this report the Press Council will have on its personnel what are called representatives of the two major political parties in Parliament. It makes no provision whatsoever for the representation of minority groups, or more important, of the non-White communities on the council since &#x201C;it is of the opinion that at the moment there is no need for these groups to be represented&#x201D;. If there is one thing, apart from the major principles against any further censorship, that will condemn this report in the eyes of the world it is that statement of the commission that <span class="col_5853-5854" refersTo="page_260"/>&#x201C;it is of the opinion that at the moment there is no need for these groups to be represented&#x201D;. Can anyone imagine a more self-condemnatory proposal, Sir. After all, the gravamen of the criticism against this country is that it excludes non-Whites from all representation on councils and in Parliament. A register is to be set up and every newspaperman and journalist must register with the council every year. The council is to advance 13 objects, most of which are thinly disguised to hide, what I believe, is to be the real purpose, which is, of course, to make punishable the sin of daring to indulge in criticism of the Government and its racial policy. I hope very much indeed that the hon. the Minister will give us his assurance that not only has he no intention whatsoever of implementing any of the proposals in this report this year but that he will leave it to gather dust in the darkest recesses of this House.</p>

<p>I have said all I want to say about the Press Commission Report. I have a few minutes left and I want to raise an entirely different subject with the hon. the Minister. I want to raise the subject of the alteration of the form which is signed by people when they enter South Africa&#x2014;the passenger&#x2019;s declaration form. I have already asked the hon. the Minister two questions about this form. He informed me at the beginning of the year that it was his intention to change the format of this passenger&#x2019;s declaration form. Later I saw gazetted the old form. I again asked the hon. the Minister whether it was his intention to change the form and on 24 April he told me that the regulations gazetted were merely a consolidation of the regulations in existence at the date and that the passenger&#x2019;s declaration form was in the process of being re-drafted. A visitor to this country who received notice in this House not so long ago. Mr. Radnall, commented on the embarrassing questions that he had been asked to answer on arrival in this country. At that stage the Secretary for the Interior stated that the Government was investigating changing the forms. But that was already in November 1962. To-day is May 1964, and the Minister has not yet been able to come forward with a simplified form for people to fill in when they come to South Africa. If it is the intention of the Government to encourage tourists to visit South Africa, then the least the Government can do is to iron out some of these difficulties that tourists encounter. I have taken the trouble to obtain the entry forms to be filled in by visitors to Italy. France, the United Kingdom and America. In each case the relevant document which has to be filled in by aliens takes the form of a simple postcard which simply asks for the surname, forename, date of birth, place of birth, sex, nationality, occupation, passport number and address where the visitor will be staying while in the country he is entering. Why then is it necessary for South Africa to have more complicated forms than the ones used in these countries I have enumerated? I have the forms here and will gladly hand them to the hon. the Minister. At the same time I should like to ask him please to expedite this whole question of revising this ludicrous passenger declaration form that people entering South Africa have to fill in. There are 16 questions that have to be filled in by such people, namely, ranging from citizenship, race, whether accompanied by children, the reasons for coming to South Africa, the period of any previous residence in the country, the country of permanent residence, last home address, what means they can produce as their own <i>bona fide</i> property for their use in South Africa, etc. Sir, this is offensive to people coming to South Africa. It is quite unnecessary and consequently I do commend to the hon. the Minister that whilst he is at it, he should have a complete change in the regulations and should go in for something that apparently every country in the world has adopted, at least all the major countries in the Western world.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">F. S. STEYN</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, the United Party to-day really put up an astonishing performance. This morning their Leader made a statement which the hon. member for Yeoville has not read and with which he is not in agreement. The hon. member for Yeoville, who had to lead the reaction of his party to this Press Commission&#x2019;s Report, gave a comic performance on a small phrase in the statement made by the hon. the Minister, a performance which will do credit to any Shakespearean comic actor. I think that the hon. member should, while he is in such a frame of mind, rather go and visit the stage than this House, in order to show his histrionic artistry.</p>

<p>But what is more, the United Party crowns all this by not itself launching its attack on the tenor of this commission&#x2019;s report, but by granting the half-hour privilege to the hon. member for Houghton to speak for the United Party. So we have a party here which is too weak to launch its own attack and for that reason appoints the hon. member for Houghton as its agent to do so for it. That is symptomatic of the movement to the left of that party.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Houghton started, as we have seen so often before, with a defence of the freedom of the Press. Therefore, I should like to ask her, as spokesman for the Opposition, and therefore also the whole Opposition, whether they have already considered the responsibility of the Press. Did the conception of the freedom of the Press not originate in those days when the small paper was issued by the pleader of a particular cause who wanted the opportunity to make known to his country his beliefs and views? From that small beginning the Press has grown into a mighty opinion-forming organ, opinion-forming not only on political matters, but on moral issues, the status of people, on musical and literary appraisement, etc. In fact, public thinking is to a large extent guided by this opinion-forming Press. This is a new responsibility which has arisen during this last half <span class="col_5855-5856" refersTo="page_261"/>century or so, which is not faced up to. I should like to say only this to the hon. member, that if she wants to plead for the freedom of the Press, she should, in assuming her own responsibility, simultaneously plead for measures to be taken to compel the Press to accept its responsibility also.</p>

<p>Her first argument is the fruit of the opinion-forming power of the Press. She came along here with the ridiculous attack on the Press Commission, and said that this commission was assailing great names in the newspaper world&#x2014;internationally known persons whose work is classified as good or less good. Is it feminine logic or Opposition logic that the eminence of a person may be regarded as proof of his innocence? If the submission of the hon. member in this connection were true, the Cabinet of Mr. Mcmillan would still have been in power and there would still have been a Minister of Defence, for there we had a very prominent gentleman. Then he would still have been there to-day, had her submission been correct that because of the prominent status of a person it is impossible for him to make a mistake. But to what is the prominence of these journalists attributable? It is attributable to this, that the opinion-forming Press of the world holds up these journalists as men of deep insight and authority. But the fact that the opinion-forming Press has elevated these people does not give them special lustre, because here we are concerned with a critical analysis of the Press itself. The hon. member launched her attack on the members of the commission in the same state of mind she always reveals, namely that the views of this side of the House are rejected by all civilized people, as she puts it. And time and again the hon. member posed with great pride as apparently the only spokesman for the civilized world. The hon. member should reflect whether one&#x2019;s civilization and one&#x2019;s state of refinement is served by arrogance of claiming for oneself only all refinement, to the exclusion of all other people. I should like to suggest to the hon. member for her consideration also that it is strange that while the whole world outside is a symbol of civilization to her, as regards its so-called condemnation of our racial hatred, so few people in her own fatherland wish to share that civilization. So is there not possibly a mistaken view as to what civilization really is? The hon. member bases her classification of herself as the civilized one and us as the uncivilized ones on the allegation that our policy is based on racialism. But our policy is not concerned with that at all; it is concerned with the evaluation of our own freedom.</p>
