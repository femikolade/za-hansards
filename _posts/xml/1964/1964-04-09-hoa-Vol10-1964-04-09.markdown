<p>The Bill which is now before us at the third reading will enjoy the support of this side of the House. We gave our support to it during the second reading and we made our point of view clear during the Committee Stage. We welcome the protection which this Bill will afford to tenants against exploitation by rapacious landlords. There is no doubt that there was exploitation and legislation was necessary. We on this side of the House recognize that. In fact, we not only support, but we sought the provisions which form the basis of this measure which is before us. There was exploitation in various forms&#x2014;by the furnishing of controlled buildings and the charging of higher rents for use of the furniture; by the charging of exorbitant rents for garages; by the conversion of controlled buildings into furnished holiday flats; by the removal of tenants so as to obtain demolition orders so as to be able to embark on the rebuilding or reconstruction. All these things were going on; we recognize their evil; the Minister accepted the position and has now acted.</p>

<p>But we have a measure before us which has had to cover a very difficult field indeed. We recognize the problem which the Minister has had and we recognize the difficulties which he has faced. These difficulties have been shown only too clearly during the passage of this measure through the House. When we look at the Bill which is now before us we find that more than half of the Bill is not the Bill as it was originally presented to this House; more than half the Bill comprises amendments introduced during the Committee Stage, amendments which we now have to consider in the new form in which this Bill is before us. We had statements by the Minister; we had statements about those statements; we had amendments introduced by the Minister; we had amendments introduced by the Minister to his own amendments, and then we had more statements during the Committee Stage itself; there are still three issues on which the Minister has accepted the probable or possible validity of arguments advanced from this side of the House concerning possible snags still in the Bill as it is. I make this point because I think it is only fair to point out that we on this side of the House foresaw these difficulties; we foresaw the snags which the Minister was going to face and we appealed to him to send this Bill to a select committee so that when it was presented to this House at the third reading it would have had the advantage of calm, unhurried consideration. I think in fairness the Minister must now agree, after the experience he has had in piloting the Bill through the Committee Stage, that we were right in our first contention. I realize that it is too late in this case to do anything about it but I think the Government must realize that when you deal with a measure such as the Rents Bill affecting the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people and where the Opposition has pledged its co-operation, this House could have produced a better measure than the one which is before us now. But that does not mean that the measure was unnecessary or that we are not going to support it. What it means is that the Minister with our assistance could have avoided the snags which he faced and the embarrassment which he faced. I think he will agree that there were stages in the discussion where issues were raised which he was unable to consider on the spur of the moment. We do not blame him; they were complicated legal issues; they were issues affecting the consequences of this Bill in its long-term effects, and no Minister could have handled them on the spur of the moment and given an immediate decision. These difficulties are difficulties which the people of South Africa will be faced with in their day-to-day lives. The vast majority of the people in this country, particularly those living in the cities, will be faced with the consequences of this Bill. I emphasize this because as a result of the course which the Minister chose, the course of piloting this Bill through as quickly as he could, as a result of that decision of the Minister himself, there are two points on which we on this side of the House have reservations. The Minister in both cases must accept the full responsibility for the decision he has taken. I make this clear because in time to come it must be apparent to those people who are affected by this Bill that the responsibility rests on the Minister and the Goverment.</p>

<p>The first of the reservations we have is the fear that this Bill may stop or slow down the provision of housing by private enterprise in some areas of South Africa. In the Committee Stage the Minister gave us the assurance that he was satisfied that would not happen. We have our doubts. The Minister has given the assurance, as is his responsibility, that this measure will not slow down, will not damage, the part which private enterprise must play in providing housing for the people of this country. The Minister has given that assurance and future investment by entrepreneurs depends on the assurances given by the Minister. We accept his good faith, and I think many of the entrepreneurs will accept in good faith, those assurances by the Minister. The future of building investment depends on his goodwill and on his undertakings. But there is no undertaking that he will be the Minister to-morrow. He may be transferred to another Department. Heaven knows, there are enough Departments which even he could handle better than they are being handled to-day. He may be sent to one of those other Departments and I think he would do a better job than many of the present Ministers in those Departments. This Minister&#x2019;s assurances in this debate are the sole guarantee which private enterprise has in regard to its future investment in housing. Therefore, we on this side of the House say we accept those assurances; we accept his assurances to this House but we place the responsibility on his shoulders in that acceptance. [Interjections.] Hon. members over to my left apparently do not want <span class="col_3917-3918" refersTo="page_0651"/>us to accept the Minister&#x2019;s assurances. What I am saying is that we accept them. They apparently do not accept those assurances. They want us to accept the responsibility. We say we accept the Minister&#x2019;s assurances but in that acceptance we say it is over to the Minister. That is all I want to make clear in regard to the consequences of this measure on the provision of future housing by private enterprise.</p>

<p>Our second reservation, Sir, is in regard to the effect this measure will have on existing controlled rentals. The Minister has assured us in the Committee Stage that the amendments which are now being introduced giving a fixed return, will not lead to a spate of applications for increases in the rentals of existing controlled flats. The Minister has the knowledge; he has his Department behind him; he has the facts available to him. He has told us there will be no large-scale increases in the rentals of controlled buildings. Again I say, the Minister having made that statement, we accept it. But we say the responsibility rests on the Minister&#x2019;s shoulders. We believe there may have been other ways of dealing with the situation, other ways which might have been more satisfactory. In that case we would have shared responsibility on these two issues. Because the Minister chose his own course we support him on the Bill as a whole but we say on these two issues we accept his word and his undertakings and we say, therefore, we cannot share in the responsibility because we have had no part in determining the final form in which those two issues are before the House.</p>

<p>I have listed the abuses with which this Bill will deal. We on this side of the House believe that it will in fact deal with those abuses. We have no doubts about that; we have no reservations in regard to the manner in which this Bill will prevent the abuses which are to-day taking place. It will give the Minister power to counter those abuses and to prevent them. We have no sympathy whatsoever for any person who tries to exploit the housing shortage by forcing excessive rents on people who cannot afford them in order to feather their own nests. Where that is happening no sympathy at all should be shown the person who is prepared to exploit the position and to demand from a tenant unjustifiable rental. In that the Minister has our full and unqualified support. We will support him in the future administration of this measure for this measure will depend on its administration. As it is now before us it is a measure which places tremendous responsibilities on the Minister and his Department in its administration. Whole fields of control are left, in fact total control over all buildings since 1949 is left to the discretion to the Minister and the Rent Boards. Therefore, the Bill as it stands at the moment is purposeless without efficient and careful administration. This Bill is largely an empowering measure. It empowers the Rent Board to investigate, the Minister to recommend and the State President to proclaim. In that process the contents of the Bill we are now passing will therefore be worthless unless properly administered.</p>

<p>I want to ask the hon. the Minister to give this House two assurances. Firstly, that he will take the necessary steps to ensure that the necessary staff is available to cope with the extra work which this Bill will place on his Department. Nobody can escape the fact that a tremendous, an unforeseeable, amount of additional work will fall on the Rent Boards and on the Department. If the Minister is going to place that burden on them I believe we have the right to ask him to give an assurance to this House that he will take the necessary administrative steps to make that administration effective and quick. It will be no good at all to have this protection for the tenant if there are going to be months of delay in coming to a decision. If it is going to take months, or even years, to reach a decision, in terms of the powers we are now granting to the Minister and to the Rent Boards, that protection will be meaningless. On that point, I would ask him for an undertaking that he will, in good time, and not only when there is the usual chaos which follows upon too much work, see that the necessary staff is there so as to prevent such chaos resulting from this Bill.</p>

<p>The second suggestion I should like to make is that the Minister, in carrying out the powers this Bill is granting him, should bear in mind that it affects two classes of people. It affects the tenant who must be protected but it also affects the landlord directly. I do not believe the Minister has the right to expect private enterprise to subsidize cheap housing. I would like to make the suggestion to the Minister that instead of only the slow process of building houses, he bears in mind the fact that this Bill is placing restrictions on existing owners who are to-day providing housing to the lower income groups. It would be far easier for the Minister, by means of low-interest loans or interest-free loans, to subsidize the housing which this Bill controls and so maintain the availability of that housing than merely to try to build new housing. Where this Bill will establish control over a block of flats, and that block of flats is perfectly suitable for housing, it will be a tragedy if the effect of this Bill should be a desire by the owner to demolish it. That is what we are finding. We are finding all over South Africa that perfectly good buildings are being demolished because the effect of this Bill which is about to be passed, and the effect of the previous provisions, was that the owner did not receive an income which he regarded as reasonable.</p>

<p>Nonsense.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member says I am talking nonsense. Only three weeks ago the hon. the Minister himself assisted in preventing the demolition of a building which had no need to be demolished. Buildings are being demolished in order to build luxury flats because the income from the rentals determined <span class="col_3919-3920" refersTo="page_0652"/>under existing legislation, and as to be determined in terms of this amending Bill, is not considered sufficient by the owners. In my constituency alone I can name at least ten buildings which have been demolished or are in the process of demolition or reconstruction over the last 12 to 18 months.</p>

<p>I plead with the Minister: In applying this legislation do not so apply it that existing buildings will be pulled down because they are not economic to the owners. Let there be a partnership between the State, the Minister and the private entrepreneur. Let the State assist where necessary or where possible so that existing low-rental housing which this Bill prot&#x00E9;cts will continue to be available and so that there will be no desire whatever to break it down. Off-hand, I can think of six buildings in my constituency which are half to three-quarters empty at this moment, while thousands of people are seeking low-rental accommodation. They are half empty because the owners, as the tenants leave, do not relet those flats. They hope that when they have emptied the buildings they will get demolition orders ether to rebuild or to reconstruct. As I say I can think of six off-hand where that situation applies in my constituency at the moment. That will continue. The Minister has no power to deal with that problem. This Bill does not give him that power. This Bill, however, gives him the opening he can use in order to eliminate that position where people would rather not let a flat than accept the rental which is allowed.</p>

<p>On the other hand this Bill deals with the position of the tenant who is being exploited. I hope the Minister will be able to balance those two problems so that we will be able to say that despite the fact that we are not entirely happy that we have achieved all that might have been achieved, by having supported this Bill we have enabled an improvement to be effected and have accorded protection to tens and hundreds of thousands of people who have to pay rental every month and who, by this Bill, are now protected from exploitation.</p>

<p>Therefore, Sir, we on this side of the House support this measure &#x2026;</p>

<p>Those members do not understand, Sir, because they only know one expression &#x201C;Ngiyabonga&#x2014;Nkosi Nkulu&#x201D;. They think that if you agree with something you must accept it blindly, hook, line and sinker; you may not blink an eyelid. Those members are so indoctrinated by the idea of submission to the will of a Minister that they cannot understand that a principle can be good, that an objective can be good, but that you still have the right to criticize. We exercise our right to criticize. We are not like a lot of blind sheep. We have made our proposals and we hope the Government will take advantage of that advice.</p>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>It is all very well for the hon. the Minister to introduce a Bill of this nature. It was evident immediately that it was the duty of the Opposition to accept the principle but at the same time to be critical of what was contained in the measure. That became evident immediately because soon after the introduction of this Bill the Minister saw many a deputation; he dealt with a considerable amount of correspondence in connection with this Bill; he received a considerable number of telegrams, something which many other members in this House experienced, and in the light of all that the Minister introduced a number of amendments himself.</p>

<p>We are not entirely satisfied with the wording of many of the clauses of this Bill. In fact, there is a proviso to Clause 7 which will most certainly require careful redrafting by the law advisers when the Minister discusses the matter with them in the light of the criticism that was levelled against its drafting during the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>What has been the experience of other Governments in the past in dealing with rental legislation&#x003F; We have only had two Acts passed by this House in regard to rent. One was passed in 1920. That was immediately after the war. The other was passed in 1950 which was in a sense a consolidation of what had been passed previously with the addition of new provisions. In both these instances a select committee was appointed. It called for evidence and when one peruses the report of the last select committee one finds that many of the original clauses of the Bill, as presented to the House at that time, emerged from the select committee with a large number of amendments, many of which have been found to have been extremely useful. This is not surprising in view of the nature of this type of legislation. This legislation is social legislation, Sir, and it affects the intimate lives of the citizens of the country. The Minister himself knows with what anxiety the people of the country watched the passage of this Bill through the House and what it contained. We were disappointed because the Minister should have known what was taking place last year. He knows what the expanding economy of this country has brought about. There has been a greater demand for manpower. He knows South Africa has made every effort to bring as many immigrants as possible to this country in order to provide that manpower. The Minister must have realized immediately what the consequences would be. He should have visualized what position to expect and not waited until the situation which arose towards the end of last year and which became accentuated during the early part of this year, when tenants were placed virtually at the mercy of landlords and against whom the hon. the Minister is now legislating.</p>

<p>When this side of the House pressed for a select committee, it was not with the object, as the hon. the Minister tried to suggest, of delaying the Bill but rather with the object <span class="col_3921-3922" refersTo="page_0653"/>of bringing about greater clarity and in order to ensure that justice was done to both the tenant and the landlord; to ensure that the tenant would be protected and that the citizens of the country were not exploited, but at the same time to ensure that no obstacles would be placed in the way of a continuous process of building flats and houses which South Africa needed so badly. This is not the first time we have experienced something of this nature in this country. We therefore believe that the Minister has in many senses failed in his duty when he arrogantly took unto himself the sole right to arbitrate what should go into the Bill in order to protect both the landlord and the tenant. We now find ourselves in the awkward position where the Minister has to make certain inquiries, and where he has to have certain discussions with the law advisers. He will probably find himself in the position where it will be necessary to amend the present Bill still further in the Other Place. We commend all that. We feel that we have rendered a service to the community in our criticism of this Bill and in having guided the Minister and having pointed out to him some of the pitfalls and difficulties which are likely to arise.</p>

<p>One of the assurances asked for by the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) was that the Minister should see to it that adequate staff was available so that the administrative machinery of this Bill, when it became law, would operate smoothly and satisfactorily. The hon. the Minister has already had representations made to him. Those representations could not be dealt with under the present Bill but representations have already been made to him in regard to the staffing of Rent Boards and the speed with which the Rent Boards must apply the terms of the law. We are well aware that a chaotic condition may easily arise if, in terms of Clause 1 of the Bill, there were to be a suggestion that rentals will be increased over a very wide field because a change is being made in the assessment of a reasonable rental by the Rent Board. One does not really know what the effect of that is going to be. I fed the hon. the Minister should give this House an assurance that this Bill, when it becomes law, will not embarrass tenants and that it Will not bring about chaotic conditions in the heavily built-up areas of our cities where the question of rental is; a very important factor, particularly to the people in the lower and middle income groups.</p>

<p>These matters are rightly brought to the attention of the House. One is rather surprised to find the type of jeering on the part of hon. members opposite when another hon. member seeks of the Minister, not only for assurances, but also draws his attention to the fact that this type of legislation, particularly when it deals so intimately with the lives of people, should be subject to the fullest scrutiny and that any evidence which can be brought to the notice of the House should be brought to its attention.</p>

<p>What I should like to know further from the hon. the Minister is this: Will he and his Department continue to maintain a watching brief over the effects of these amendments&#x003F; And if necessary will they come back to the House ether with a further Bill or with a consolidating measure, together with a select committee in order to have the whole issue elucidated&#x003F; We are hoping that the immigration to South Africa will continue at an ever growing pace. We sincerely hope the Minister realizes how important this aspect is to our country, and that he will ensure that we do not have to meet the difficulties in an almost <i>ad hoc</i> manner by bringing a Bill before this House, rushing it through, without being fully aware of the consequences of what it contains. The hon. the Minister will be the first person to admit that had it not been for the fact that during the second reading of this Bill certain anomalies were pointed out to him, he would not have been able to bring forward the many amendments that he has. I think he has already admitted during discussions on previous stages of this Bill that he has welcomed deputations not only from the public but also deputations introduced to him by members of this House and that that has given him a much clearer picture of what is required to overcome the pitfalls and difficulties which have been occasioned over the last six to eight months due to the change in our population.</p>

<p>I hope the hon. the Minister will deal with this matter on the level that it demands and that he will not only give us the assurances asked for but that he will give us any further explanation which is necessary in order to allay the fears of those people who will be affected by the terms of this Bill. I believe no Minister has the right to deal with legislation unless he declares publicly exactly what the implications are of a Bill and assures the public that it will not be embarrassed financially, that family life will not be disturbed and that it will continue to have a roof over its head to which it is justly entitled. That is one of the intrinsic bases of legislation of this nature. Let us therefore hope that even if the hon. the Minister has to lose face by moving further amendments in the Other Place, he will be prepared to tell us to-day that he, intends to move such amendments in order to eliminate some of the vaguely drafted portions of this Bill before it finally reaches the Statute Book.</p>

<p>We support the action of the Minister, if he is correct to have taken this action in order to put a stop to exploitation. This House is with him in principle for what he has done but this House is very critical of the manner in which this Bill has been handled. It is sincerely hoped that the improvements called for will be carried out.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. members for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) and Florida (Mr. Miller) tried to throw up a smokescreen to get out of their difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="col_3923-3924" refersTo="page_0654"/>Once again the United Party has found itself in difficulties as a result of the weak and spineless manner in which they tackle things, as a result of the lack of policy and the pointlessness with which they approach legislation in this House. If the United Party want to be consistent, they should vote against the third reading of this Bill to-day. During the second reading they fought this Bill tooth and nail on the pretext that it should be referred to a select committee. They opposed this Bill and they voted against it. What happened then&#x003F; Their supporters outside started to make things hot for them. They told them: &#x201C;You may not do that; do you know what you are doing&#x003F; It is essential legislation; we must have it on the Statute Book and you are acting against our interests in the House of Assembly.&#x201D; As a result we to-day have this ludicrous attitude on the part of hon. members on that side of the House. They now have to retrace their steps, and now they are throwing up a smokescreen.</p>

<p>What attitude has the hon. member for Durban (Point) now really adopted in this third-reading debate&#x003F; He says: Having been taken to task by our constituents, we are now at this stage desirous of having a share in this legislation. We shall vote for the third reading. We shall go and tell our constituents that we had a share in placing this legislation on the Statute Book. We assisted in protecting you against exploitation. We voted for the legislation in its final form.&#x201D; Then he adds: &#x201C;Whilst we are voting for it, I should like to say clearly that we are not going to accept any responsibility for any unpopularity that may result from it. In that event the Minister and the Government must bear the responsibility alone.&#x201D; Mr. Speaker, the Opposition may vote against this legislation. We shall do the unpopular thing and we alone will bear the responsibility for the consequences. We do not need them. I challenge the Opposition to vote against this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Point) is so shameless as to say candidly: &#x201C;We have now discovered that this measure is a popular one, and we should like to share in this popularity. For that reason we are desirous at this stage of voting for it, but if perchance this legislation does affect owners and lessors adversely at a later stage, they must please not come to us with their complaints and blame us for it; then they must blame the Government and the Minister for it. Because they must bear the blame, and if a slackness in the building industry does occur as a result of this legislation, they must not blame us for it. We are voting for the third reading for political reasons only. We are only seeking popularity, but any adverse consequences we place four-square upon the shoulders of the Minister.&#x201D; Now that is a typical United Party attitude, a typical United Party point of view, one they have consistently adopted since the commencement of this Session. They wax hot and cold simultaneously; they want to sit upon all the chairs simultaneously. They want to tell the tenants they protected them, but they also wish to appease the owners and entrepreneurs and say to them: &#x201C;We have tried to protect your interests and tried to fight for you.&#x201D; Sir, the United Party will achieve nothing with this. They will fall down between all the chairs. We on this side are convinced that this legislation will not bring about any slackening in the tempo of building activities in respect of residential units, the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje) yesterday testified to that. He said that in spite of the knowledge at the beginning of the year that legislation on rent control would be introduced, in spite of the fact that the people expected the legislation and that it has been introduced and has been before the House, there has been an increase in the tempo at which residential units in this country have been built. Yet in spite of this information which was at the disposal of the United Party they were so stupid as to try to oppose this Bill at the second reading, and they found themselves in trouble with their voters. We have been assured, particularly after the amendments introduced by the hon. the Minister at the Committee Stage, especially two of them, that there will not be the slightest discouragement of private enterprise to build residential units in our country. On the contrary, we expect it to increase, because under this legislation the entrepreneurs for the first time are getting the assurance that they will be able to obtain a minimum of 8 per cent on their capital. What is more, we are convinced that this legislation does not introduce general rent control throughout the country. After the Bill has been passed, not a single housing unit more will be subject to control than has been the case thus far. But what this legislation does in fact do is that it provides the Government with an opportunity to subject additional residential units to control in order to safeguard the tenants against exploitation, should that become necessary. We are convinced that hereby we are rendering an important and essential service to the country, and that it is an essential protective measure. The mere fact that we have passed this Bill will deter prospective exploiters and they will charge their tenants a reasonable rental. The Opposition should not come along at this late stage and under these pretexts, and say that they also now are in favour of the measure, while at the same time they wish to burden the Minister with the onus of any unpopularity that may arise from the measure. They should rather be consistent and vote against the Bill at this stage also, and then face their constituents outside in connection with this measure.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The accusations of the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) against this side of the House are typical of the irresponsible political propaganda which this Nationalist Government is trying to make at every possible opportunity. Not satisfied to make irresponsible political propaganda in <span class="col_3925-3926" refersTo="page_0655"/>racial matters, they want to bring it in in matters of this sort which have to do with the everyday living of the ordinary people of this country. Mr. Speaker, normally I would ignore the accusations of the hon. member with the contempt they deserve, but I intend to deal with them during the course of my speech.</p>

<p>First of all, I want to repeat what the previous speakers on this side of the House have made clear and that is that in regard to this legislation there are two matters which concern us particularly. There is firstly the situation of tenants and secondly the slowing down of housing. The hon. member for Parow asked us why it is, in view of the speeches made by the two speakers who spoke before me, that we do not oppose this Bill at the third reading. I will tell him. We do not oppose this Bill for the reason which we gave during the second-reading debate, namely, that there has arisen at the present time an extreme shortage of housing as a result of the complete incompetence of this Government, the incompetence of this Government to appreciate that if they were going to bring in thousands of immigrants, as they have done, they would have to house them somewhere and that if they made no provision for houses, but brought in thousands of immigrants, there was bound to be a housing shortage. As we made quite clear in the second-reading debate, we accept the fact that there is a housing shortage in this country at the present date and that there is likely to be a housing shortage for some time to come. Under those circumstances we say that it is clear that there must be a measure of control such as this to prevent exploitation of persons who have nowhere to live and who look for accommodation. Therefore we support this measure. That is the principle of this Bill and it is that principle which we support.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there are various matters that do give us concern, as has been pointed out by speakers before me, and up to now we have had very little satisfaction, in fact no assurance from hon. members on the other side of the House. In regard to the situation of the tenants what concerns us particularly is the situation that the tenants of controlled dwellings prior to 1949 may find themselves in the light of the amendment introduced by the hon. Minister to Clause 1, whereby a fixed net return of 8 per cent on buildings may now be allowed. I think we ought to be clear about this. Under the legislation as it exists at present there are two variables which the Rent Board can fix at their discretion. The first variable is the value to be placed on the land and the buildings; the second variable is the return which the Rent Board may allow on the investments. As the law stands at present the Rent Board is entitled to allow up to 8 per cent on buildings and up to 6 per cent on land, but the board can allow less than those figures. In terms of the new amendment introduced by the hon. Minister, the Rent Board must allow 8 per cent on the buildings and cannot allow less and must allow 6 per cent on the land. So one variable is done away with and it is now a fixed situation. In regard to pre-1949 buildings, those buildings which are controlled have had a value placed by the board on the land and on the buildings. That variable in regard to pre-1949 buildings is now fixed. The Rent Board, after this Bill is passed, cannot juggle around (I use that freely, without suggesting anything improper) with the value of the investment in order to prevent an increase in rentals. The situation then arises that in regard to pre-1949 buildings the two variables which exist under the legislation at present are done away with and in place of that there is a fixed return substituted of 8 per cent on buildings, which may or may not be greater than the return which is at present allowed.</p>

<p>Where do we go from here&#x003F; Members of the Opposition do not have the facts at our disposal to enable us to decide whether or not large increases in rentals are likely as a result of this amendment. The Government on the other hand, because they control the Rent Boards, do have that information. That information is readily available to them, and the hon. the Minister has given us an assurance that he has consulted all the various Rent Boards and he can give us the assurance that the majority of rentals allowed by the Rent Boards at present are based on a return of 8 per cent. And so he can give us the assurance that because of that there will not be any substantial increase in rents. Therefore we say to him that we accept his assurance, but because that information is at the Minister&#x2019;s disposal we placed the full responsibility on him for any possible increase that may result in those rentals.</p>

<from><span class="col_3927-3928" refersTo="page_0656"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>This is one of the reasons why we stated right at the outset that we considered that a select committee was necessary because on the one hand there was evidence that the returns which would be allowed in respect of land and buildings should be increased. There was that evidence. On the other hand we did not know what effect that would have on rentals and the only way to find that out was to have a select committee. That deals with what I have to say in regard to the position of tenants.</p>

<p>In regard to the slowing down of the building of houses, it goes without saying that the only way to overcome the housing shortage is to ensure maximum development, to ensure that the maximum number of housing units are put up, and clearly the best way of doing that is to place minimum restrictions or none at all if possible, on the construction of new dwellings. We on this side of the House have urged the hon. Minister to exclude new buildings altogether from this Bill, and frankly I still find it difficult to understand why the Minister is not prepared to do that. His arguments have not been satisfactory, because there is no evidence to show that there will be undue exploitation, or if there were undue exploitation that the matter could not be quickly put right at the forthcoming session of Parliament next year, in just over eight months; very little damage could be done in that period because it is unlikely that that many new buildings will be put up in that period. So I would again urge the hon. Minister to take the wise course and to exclude new constructions, new buildings, altogether from this Act. In that way he will ensure that there can be no possible stifling of new building. But if he will not do that, then I must look at the Bill as it stands.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister has said that he has had discussions with big entrepreneurs and that they are quite satisfied with the legislation as it now appears before the House. Once again I accept his statement. Whilst that may be the position in regard to the large entrepreneurs, I am still not happy that the amendments as drafted will cover the position of the individual builder. I do not wish to labour the argument which I advanced during the Committee Stage in this regard yesterday. I would once again, though, urge the hon. Minister to consider that aspect of it. His answer to me was that in regard to the individual builder, the clause as it stands provides that a return in excess of 8 per cent can be granted in the discretion of the board and the board may well use its discretion to give a larger return in respect of the individual builder. But, Mr. Speaker, it may well be that a court of law would not interpret the Clause 1n that way, because the clause specifically says that the Rent Board must take into account the audited actual cost of erection of the dwelling. Now the actual cost of the erection of a dwelling does not take into account any cost in respect of the labour of the individual builder. That is quite clear. So it may well be that the court may find that a Rent Board would be improperly exercising its discretion if on the one hand it were to allow no more than 8 per cent to a large entrepreneur but were to allow an amount in excess of 8 per cent to the individual builder. As I said a moment ago I do not wish to labour this point, but I consider that this is a matter which the hon. the Minister and his advisers should give further consideration to. The other point which I suggest warrants further consideration is the Minister&#x2019;s proposed amendment to Clause 5 of this Bill, in terms of which he will exclude from the provisions of the new Section <i>1 bis</i> flats which are let for no more than four months. Considerable argument was advanced during the Committee Stage to show how that can cause hardship to fairly large groups of people. I do not wish to repeat those arguments, but I would again urge the hon. the Minister to give further consideration to accepting the amendment which we moved, namely to change the four months&#x2019; period to six months.</p>

<p>Finally, I wish once again to make it quite clear that we on this side of the House are satisfied that at this stage a rent control measure is necessary and therefore we support this Bill. But at the same time the Government chose not to accept our suggestion to send this Bill to a select committee and chooses to press on with this legislation despite all the difficulties that have appeared during the various stages and have necessitated amendment after amendment by the Minister himself. In that situation we consider ourselves entirely justified to say to this Government, as we do, that we support this measure, but that at the same time we place on the Government full responsibility if this results in the two things or ether of the two things which we fear, namely an increase in rentals and a slowing down of new buildings.</p>

<p>If I were to follow the hon. members of the Opposition who have spoken here this afternoon, Mr. Speaker, you probably would rule me out of order, but you will surely permit me to refer to the inconsistency revealed here this afternoon. The hon. member who has just resumed his Seat said once again that the Opposition accept the principle of this Bill, but the fact of the matter is that when a vote had to be taken on the principle of the Bill, namely at the second reading, they voted against it, and in respect of the contents of the Bill, against which they have spoken here this afternoon, they now intend voting in favour of it. Surely that is the utmost inconsistency. As I have said already, I do not wish to follow hon. members opposite, for the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) indeed referred to the incompetence of certain other Ministers of the Cabinet, and if I were to go into that, you will probably rule me out of order, but surely it is clear that as regards the conduct of the Opposition in this House in respect of this measure, they as usual run with the hare and <span class="col_3929-3930" refersTo="page_0657"/>hunt with the dogs. The fact of the matter is that the contents of this Bill are the result of a very urgent need which has arisen in our country. As a result of certain circumstances in our country, there has been exploitation and therefore it is fitting that any responsible Government and any responsible Minister should act immediately. That is exactly what is aimed at with this Bill. The actions of the United Party at the third reading remind me of the man who said to his son: Do not do what I am doing; do what I say. They are pretending to vote for this third reading, but they had a lot to say against it.</p>

<p>Now their great complaint is that the contents of this Bill are such that it may possibly have adverse consequences and they do not wish to share the responsibility for those adverse consequences; the contents of this Bill are such that it teems with defects. I have said that the Minister took this action because there has been an urgent need for it, and then I should like to associate myself with the English adage: &#x201C;I prefer my imperfect way of doing something to your perfect way of doing nothing.&#x201D; The hon. member for Dur-ban-Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) said that the shortage of housing is the result of the incompetence of the Government. No, that is not the cause. I should like to point out that the contents of this Bill will indeed result in more housing and flats being built. Sir, the reason why a shortage of residential units has arisen is simply an economic fact, namely that in the past there have been other more remunerative fields of investment, particularly since Sharpeville. Since Sharpeville there have been other fields of investment that were so remunerative that the investors concentrated upon them. Prices dropped tremendously on the Stock Exchange, and there was a very favourable field of investment on the Stock Exchange. Financial institutions which would otherwise have invested their funds in residential units, moved over to the Stock Exchange in order to derive the greatest possible benefit from the position. But since then conditions have changed to such an extent that at the present time the money one invests on the Stock Exchange yields a return of as little as 2 per cent, and now one will see that large financial institutions will once again revert to building units. There will be a revival in the building industry as regards residential units such as we have never experienced before. No, it has not been the Government&#x2019;s incompetence that has caused this shortage of residential units, but it has been economic circumstances and particularly the wonderful field of investment on the Stock Exchange during the past two years. Now that the position has changed and share prices have risen to such an extent that the return is only 2 per cent, we shall have a revival in the building industry such as never before, and the hon. the Minister may be satisfied, that the position envisaged by hon. members of the Opposition will not arise. For that reason I shall very gladly vote for the third reading.</p>

<p>He has come under the whip of those persons in his party who do not want this measure, because there are such people, and I want to ask those hon. members to deny it. The fact is that they had an opportunity in the beginning of the year in their caucus to vote on this question of whether they wanted rent control in this form or not and the fact is that they outvoted a person in their caucus who wanted to move a motion that further rent control should be instituted. [Interjection.] The persons who have to-day gained the victory in that party are those who also won at that time. But when we introduced the measure there was rebellion in that party. [Interjections.] We know of course that the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) and the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson) got up here and frankly gave their wholehearted support to the measure, and then the others remained silent, but in the further stages of the Bill the others again got an opportunity to voice their protest, and they are still doing so to-day, and the poor hon. member for Point had to satisfy both sections, and what a complete mess they made of the whole thing.</p>

<p>Let us just analyse a few of these so-called attacks.</p>

<p>Instead of the hon. member for Durban (Point) rather sticking to his guns, because that is always the best thing to do in politics, he grasped at the question of the demolition of houses. Now he knows that in terms of the Housing Act it is within my power as Minister to prevent the demolition of a building, and he knows that in the majority of cases where a house is still in any way suitable for occupation we do not allow it to be demolished. But I want to tell the hon. member that the number of applications of that nature is very small. There is one defect, namely that in some cases where people wish to demolish they give the tenants <span class="col_3931-3932" refersTo="page_0658"/>notice before having obtained the necessary consent, and in connection with that matter I have already taken steps and I have a Bill before the House which will be debated later, in terms of which the position will be changed so that notice cannot be given unless prior consent for demolition has been obtained. The hon. member pretends that this happens on a very large scale, but that is not so. I do not know whether I have had even 18 applications since I became Minister.</p>

<p>Now the hon. member says this Bill was characterized by amendment after amendment and by one embarrassing situation after another for me. Let us test the truth of that. The fact is that when I made my second-reading speech I myself held out in prospect four amendments, without any urging on the part of the Opposition. I said that on closer study I would introduce four amendments, and then in the Committee Stage some hon. members made pleas, like the hon. member for Jeppes (Dr. Cronje), who said, <i>inter alia,</i> that I could not expect people to provide houses unless they could make a decent profit. Now the hon. member for Musgrave (Mr. Hourquebie) comes along to-day and quarrels with me because there may possibly be people who will make a bigger profit. There you have the two heads, the Jeppes head and the Musgrave head.</p>

<p>That is the one head of that party, and those are the interests they represent here. They do not represent the interests of the tenant or of the decent investor, but those of the people who want to make use of the housing shortage to exploit others. The fact is therefore that in the Committee Stage there was not one appreciable amendment moved by the Opposition which was worth considering, but now they complain. But on the other hand I moved amendments here which were the result of consultations with investors. I make no secret of it, and what is wrong with it&#x003F; The investors who came to see me had so little confidence in the Opposition that they did not ask the Opposition to put amendments on the Order Paper but came straight to me, and they convinced me that their interests would be served by it, and I acceded to their request. But they did not go to the Opposition because even they have already given up the Opposition.</p>

<p>But the hon. member for Durban (Point) went further. He said that I should give him assurances, firstly, that I would have enough staff available. Mr. Speaker, I do not intend giving him any assurance, because in the same breath he said the assurances I give are worthless because I do not know how long I shall still be here.

<p>Those hon. members remind me of an old man who lived in the town where I grew up. My parents told me that he loved his grandchild so much that he hugged him to death. Those hon. members are so fond of this Bill that they want to squeeze the life out of it. Then the hon. member said I had to interview numerous deputations and had to reply to numerous letters. That is not true. I received a small number of letters from people in regard to this Bill, and most of them were people who supported me or said that I should take even more drastic action. And there were not numbers of deputations. Two deputations interviewed me. But I can understand that this <span class="col_3933-3934" refersTo="page_0659"/>seems a lot to that hon. member, because if two people interview him it must seem a lot, so unpopular is that party now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Musgrave also tried to be very clever here. It seems as if another little head is growing out of that party. What is his objection&#x003F; His objection is that this position would never have arisen had this acute housing shortage not existed in the country. Where is the acute housing shortage&#x003F; I said during the second reading, and I said yesterday, and I repeat it to-day, that there is no general housing shortage in South Africa. There is a shortage of a certain category of houses, viz. for the middle and lower income groups, and particularly of houses for rent. Just look at the advertisement columns in the newspapers and hon. members will see that what I say is the truth. The hon. member for Musgrave said a most reprehensible thing in order to create the impression that we do not have enough houses. I thought he was so anxious for us to get immigrants, but what will frighten away an immigrant more than to tell him that he will not get a house in South Africa&#x003F; Does he want this to be used for foreign consumption&#x003F; Because the fact is that there is no immigrant in this country who does not have a house to-day.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>No, I am not prepared to reply. If the hon. member had treated me decently a little while ago when I wanted to put a question to him, I would also have treated him decently. The fact is that there is no general shortage, and in the second place the hon. member talks nonsense when he says there is a general shortage of housing. What is more, no immigrant here lacks accommodation, and even more than that, the Government started last year already, long before the Opposition woke up, and it took extra measures to combat the housing needs of the country. Therefore we did not make plans only in regard to conventional building methods, such as we are now implementing, but we also took steps in respect, of prefabricated material. Therefore we are to-day granting loans for the building of wooden houses in order to stimulate our timber industry, and we have adopted various courses in regard to the provision of housing. If the hon. member therefore makes that allegation he is talking nonsense.</p>

<p>But the hon. member goes further and says that what concerns him so much in regard to this measure for which he wishes to vote is that new buildings are not being excluded. Surely that is not true. New buildings are excluded until such time as exploitation takes place, and then they can be put under control. But he says new buildings are not excluded. Can you see, Sir, what poison he is spreading in the country to frighten off investors&#x003F; My accusation against the hon. member for Musgrave is that he wants to frighten the investor. He wants there to-be a housing shortage because he wants to make political capital out of it.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member made a third allegation. He alleged that I said in the debate yesterday that whereas Clause 1 provided that there could be a profit of 6 per cent to 8 per cent, I am now changing it to 8 per cent, and I am alleged to have said that this is because in the majority of cases it is already 8 per cent. That is not true. I never said so. What I did say was this. In numerous cases it has already been fixed by the Rent Boards at 8 per cent, but I added, and this is contained in the Bill, that we are inserting a proviso so that people who do not keep their buildings in order are prohibited from obtaining increased rentals. But the hon. member says that I said in the majority of cases it was 8 per cent. He should not quarrel with me; he should quarrel with the hon. member for Jeppes, who said that this provision in the old Rents Act was one of the reasons why the investor did not want to erect buildings. How can the hon. member for Jeppes be right in pleading for increased rentals while the hon. member for Musgrave accuses me of now wanting to make it 8 per cent&#x003F; Which of the two am I to believe&#x003F; If the hon. member wants to quarrel with the hon. member for Jeppes, he should do so in his caucus, but he should not quarrel with me.</p>

<p>I wish to conclude. I do not think there are any other points to which I have to reply. I want to tell the hon. member for Point, who is a brave political fighter and who took the lead to-day, this: Stand by your convictions and persuade your party now to vote against the third reading. If they do not have the courage to vote against the third reading to-day, then all this fuss that was made to-day is so much nonsense and political hypocrisy.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>In connection with Clause 2 I asked the Minister yesterday whether all the moneys paid into the account would be moneys voted by other bodies and the Minister said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. It is clearly stated in Clause 2 (1) (a) of the Bill that moneys voted by Parliament would be paid into this account <span class="col_3935-3936" refersTo="page_0660"/>and I am sure this side of the House was under the impression that Parliament would definitely vote money for this account. But now the Minister says &#x201C;no&#x201D;, whereas he said on another occasion that of all the moneys voted over a period of years by the board&#x2014;I mentioned the figure yesterday&#x2014;R800,000 was for housing and equipment and R1,200,000 for bursaries and education. As far as this side of the House is concerned we cannot reconcile at all. Had the Minister come forward with legislation to establish an agricultural research account and envisaged that all the moneys to be paid into that fund would be money not voted by Parliament or the State, but only those sums of moneys contributed by boards or agricultural organizations, etc., this legislation practically becomes a joke as far as we are concerned. I want to put this question directly to the Minister in connection with 2 (1) (a): Is it the intention that Parliament should vote money for this fund or not&#x003F;</p>

<p>Yes, the hon. member may perhaps regard it as a serious misunderstanding but I regard it as a slight misunderstanding. As I explained in my second-reading speech, and as I also explained in my reply yesterday, the fact is that we are now for the first time establishing a research account, an account in which all contributions by public bodies and other bodies, except the State, can be paid, because the State votes money for research under my Department&#x2019;s Vote. Let me just give an example. The State has taken the initiative in respect of the tobacco research account and the wine industry research account, which are completely separate things. The State wanted to make a contribution towards those two industries because the State benefited greatly from them in the form of excise duty and that it could now give something direct to the farmer or to the industry; but the farmer benefits by it. Circumstances may arise where the public or the boards may make specific contributions to such a separate research account but that may not be quite sufficient to carry out that project. We now make provision for an appeal to be made to the State and that the State can also make its contribution. We are only making it possible for the State to contribute by getting Parliament to vote the money. The primary idea, however, is not that it should be a fund to which the State contributes, but that it is really one which is supplemented by the State. That is the only difference. Naturally the State will not hestitate to contribute when the public gives money for important research work and more money is required for that research. I hope that is now clear.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) surprises me; he has hold of the working end of the stick. As somebody who has had a great deal to do with the wool-growing industry the hon. member ought to know that the wool research that was done at Grahamstown had absolutely nothing to do whatsoever with the Department of Agriculture as such. It was simply secondary research in connection with wool, its industrial value, and it came directly under the Department of Commerce and Industry. The contribution the State has made to that research and is still making is done through the Department of Commerce and Industry and not through the Department of Agricultural Technical Services. The research which was done at that institute was done mainly in conjunction with the C.S.I.R. The research which my Department undertakes is more in connection with production and breeding. The hon. member now levels the charge at my Department that the only research it does is to how to cross-breed sheep, but is that so&#x003F; I can assure the hon. member that the Wool Committee of the S.A. Agricultural Union was also more or less under that impression and during the course of last year, at our request, they made a study tour of all our research institutions concerned with wool and sheep and breeding. The result was that I had an interview with them, at their request, at which they told me that they did not know we were doing so much, not only in regard to the crossbreeding of sheep ether for their meat or for other breeding purposes, but to improve the quality of the wool. I have in mind, for example, the research which we did in connection with the Dohne-merino and the Dormer in the Boland. I do not want to mention the other breeds. The research our Department does is to produce a type of sheep that will be adaptable to the various ecological areas, sheep with which the farmer can farm more profitably without of necessity producing a poorer type of wool. I want to know from the hon. member whether he does not think we have done the farmer a service by having done that&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>On two successive occasions, in respect of two successive laws, it happened yesterday that the Opposition supported the Bills <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> a farmer, a person who represents an agricultural constituency, and that a venomous attack was made on the Oppotion for supporting those Bills. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) and the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek), one after the other, launched a venomous attack on the Opposition for supporting a Bill such as this&#x2014;a minor Bill which makes provision under the State Advances Recoveries Act and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act for two or three things. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom did not even talk about those two or three things and the principle of the Bill; he simply went from clause to Clause 1n order to use up his time. This Bill largely provides for additional security when assistance is granted to farmers under the State Advances Recoveries Act and by the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board, and in terms of Clause 6, where agricultural machinery and equipment and lorries are purchased under the hire-purchase system with the assistance of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board, provision is made that those cannot be demanded back from him. That is mostly what is contained in the Bill. But the hon. member for Wakkerstroom comes along&#x2014;and I am sorry he is not here at the moment&#x2014;and blames us for having entered into this debate which ought not to be an agricultural debate, because the Agricultural Vote must still come up for discussion, but which is a debate on finances under the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. He holds it against <span class="col_3939-3940" refersTo="page_0662"/>us that urban dwellers and people who do not represent agricultural constituencies have entered the debate. Mr. Speaker, I want to say this: If that is the best contribution the Government can make in the form of members representing agricultural constituencies to this debate, people who want to convert this into an agricultural debate because so far they have not had an opportunity of attacking the Opposition&#x2014;if the best contribution they can make is the kind of contribution the hon. member for Wakkerstroom made yesterday, I am not surprised that this Government cannot produce anything better for agriculture than the Ministers concerned. I believe the hon. member for Wakkerstroom is also secretary of the farmers&#x2019; group in the Government party.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Heaven help us if our best speakers on agricultural matters on this side of the House made the sort of contribution the hon. member for Wakkerstroom made yesterday. I have already said that he did not deal with the principle of the Bill. He dealt with the Bill clause by clause. I have already stated broadly what the principles contained in this Bill were, namely, additional security to the State for assistance granted ether <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> State Advances or <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> Farmers&#x2019; Assistance&#x2014;it is really a short cut as far as financing is concerned inasmuch as mortgage bonds no longer have to be registered in the way they were in the past. Stamp duty and the like are all being done away with, in other words that financial assistance can be given as quickly as possible to those needy farmers who are assisted under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act. We doubt whether that is always the right thing to do but we shall deal with that when we reach the Committee Stage. We doubt whether that is the right way of dealing with this particular matter, but we shall still come to that.</p>

<p>The second point raised was in connection with the acquisition of machinery under the hire-purchase system. Where an agriculturist has applied for assistance the merchant who has provided him with that machinery under a hire-purchase system will not have the right to re-possess it. Even in this connection the question arises whether we should thwart and hamper the suppliers in granting credit facilities by introducing this new clause, but we shall have ample opportunity at the Committee Stage to deal with that as well. I do not want to deal with that now.</p>

<p>I notice the hon. member for Wakkerstroom has not yet returned; I shall therefore leave him and turn to the hon. member for Waterberg who is here and who in a roaring voice read his paean of praise in such a melancholy way in this House. I heard him say he was going to tell his constituents of the wonderful things this Government have done in connection with farming matters; of the wonderful achievements they have attained in connection with assistance to farmers. Do you know, Sir, to what he referred as the wonderful achievements when he read that heart-stirring speech in regard to the misery the farmers in the Northern Transvaal were experiencing, something of which we are as well aware as he and to which we have already been referring for weeks while that side of the House continually maintained that the farmers were not having such a hard time. Oh no, they are not having a difficult time at all because the wool prices are high. He is not at all concerned whether they produce more wool or whether they do not produce any because the wool prices are high. The farmer is having a more difficult time to-day than he has had for a long time and the hon. member for Waterberg has said so himself. But what did he say further&#x003F; He talked about research in connection with plants that would be drought-resistant as though that would be the solution to the severe drought which faced Northern Transvaal to-day. He hardly thought of anything new which the Government could do to assist those farmers. I ask you: How hollow can a person&#x2019;s head be&#x003F; He can hardly think of anything new which the Government can do! He referred to the rebates on the transportation of stock and fodder during droughts; he referred to loans for the purchase of stock and loans for the purchase of rations and more loans and more loans; he talked about the alms to which the Minister also referred when he introduced this Bill, alms which the farmers do not want. The days of alms and subsidies are past in this century in which we are living and because of the prosperity this country is enjoying. We are not living in a time of alms. Nor do we want loans if we can do without them. Is there a method whereby we can do without loans&#x003F; I want members of the Government to listen to what they do in another country where they are experiencing a similar drought as we. I quote from the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 1 April 1964&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The drought in Southern Rhodesia has reached the point of no return. In a statement yesterday the Ministry of Agriculture said that it must now be accepted that the main rains are over and it is too late for the situation to be redeemed. The Government has appealed to the more fortunate farmers whose farms are able to carry a greater number of cattle to help alleviate the situation by leasing grazing or buying in cattle from drought-stricken areas. The Cold Storage Commission has offered financial support to farmers buying in cattle.</block>

<p>&#x201C;To delay the assessment or to overestimate the carrying capacity of their farms may in the end compel farmers to dispose of more cattle than would have been necessary had the assessment been made in goodtime,&#x201D; the statement warned.</p>

<p>As far as crops are concerned the Ministry said: &#x201C;Maize, groundnut, bean and cotton crops on a considerable number of farms <span class="col_3941-3942" refersTo="page_0663"/>in the major cropping areas have suffered so severely from the drought that yields will be extremely low.&#x201D;</p>

<p>The statement advised farmers to plough their withered maize crops under if they were too dry to be cut and used as silage.</p>

<p>The Minister of Rhodesia also went further. He also advised those farmers whose crops were being ruined by the drought to lease their lands to those farmers whose stock was dying because of the drought.</p>

<p>My point is this that had this Government and the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing had any intention of helping the farmers in the Northern Transvaal out of their difficulty, without lending them money which they have to repay, they would also have followed the policy which the Rhodesian Minister was following by saying that they would make money available through the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board or through another financial concern, to other farmers who were sufficiently fortunate to have grazing, to go and buy up that cattle.</p>

<p>The Minister can take my word for it; I have property in Rhodesia. Many young men from the Republic have gone there and purchased farms under the hire-purchase system; they have purchased stock from the Rhodesian Cold Storage Commission without any capital. They can do that as long as it is an approved farm on which there is water and a farm which is fenced in. He returns that stock after the first year when they have grown into big oxen; if they are young oxen he returns them after the second year; if it is stock for breeding purposes he returns them after the third year and he does not pay a cent interest out of his pocket.</p>

<p>May I ask the hon. member a question&#x003F; The hon. member says 4 per cent interest is deducted and when the farmer resells that stock to the Commission the original purchase price of that cattle is deducted plus the 4 per cent interest. How can the hon. member maintain the farmer does not pay the original purchase price nor the 4 per cent interest&#x003F; Surely that is a simple little sum.</p>

<speech by="#moolman">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>I never alleged that the farmer did not pay that. I said it was not necessary for him to disburse a penny when he acquired those cattle. The purchase price is deducted from his account. If he purchased a lean ox, fattened it, but does not make a profit he is as bad a farmer as the Minister is a Minister. I have read what they are doing in Rhodesia at the moment. I read the statement by the Rhodesian Minister in this connection word for word. The hon. member for Waterberg told us yesterday about the wonderful assistance given to farmers in connection with foot-and-mouth disease. The position is different in Rhodesia. Where there has been an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in an area and where the grazing of that farmer has been ruined by drought, as has already happened in our country &#x2026;</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, that is ignorance talking! The cattle are then removed from that area in a sealed vehicle; they are taken to the abattoirs where they are treated as infected slaughter stock but at the same guaranteed price as the price paid by the Cold Storage Commission for other stock. That is what they do in the case of foot-andmouth disease.

<p>Insignificant in this sense that the debate on this Bill ought not to be converted into a debate on agricultural matters. We should regard this measure purely as a financial measure and treat it as such. But hon. members on that side want to turn this into an agricultural debate. I repeat that from 1948 to 1953 it went so well with the farmers that they were worried about the high tax they had to pay. In 1958-63, ten years later, they started to wonder how they would make ends meet. What is the position to-day I in 1964&#x003F; I am not going to confine myself to <span class="col_3943-3944" refersTo="page_0664"/>the maize crop and I am not going to confine myself to the drought. All those are factors, but when the hon. member for Waterberg says, apart from the drought, everything is as rosy in the agricultural garden as it can possibly be, he does not know what he is talking about. As though the drought alone was responsible for the fact that the price and production of dairy products fluctuated to such an extent in the past and that we sometimes had to import dairy products. The drought is not to blame for that. I admit the drought is a contributory factor to the reason farmers are having the hard time in 1964 but that is not the main factor.</p>

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MOOLMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The bad Government. That is an unfortunate factor which is beyond our control. The fact remains and I emphasize this that the farmers who thought in 1948-53 this Government was strong enough to handle the situation as far as farming matters were concerned are not only sick and tired of this Government but they have lost confidence in this Government&#x2019;s agricultural policy. At this stage the farmers already know that the Government, particularly the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing, has no agricultural policy. He struggles on as best he can with subsidies and rebates to overcome the drought. No new idea has emanated from the grains of the farmer members on that side; they cannot suggest any remedy to save the situation, even if it is only the remedy employed by our neighbouring state. Let us move the stock which is dying in the Northern Transvaal to the Eastern Cape and if the person who wants to buy that stock does not have the money to do so let us assist him because in that case you will be assisting the man who can save those cattle. It is no use assisting the farmer in the drought-stricken area; what can he do with that assistance&#x003F; Or must he trek 500 miles with his stock to look for grazing&#x003F; I put this question in all fairness: If the farmer in the Eastern Cape is assisted to purchase the stock in Northern Transvaal and he does not have to pay the purchase price until such time as he resells them, does anybody suggest that the Government will suffer a loss by financing him in that way and does anybody suggest that the best way of saving the farmer in the drought-stricken area is not to enable him to sell his stock at a reasonable price but rather to advance further loans and subsidies, etc. to him&#x003F; I repeat that we support this Bill because it will mean that financial assistance will be more readily available. We promised to support this measure and to give it our blessing. A bogy was then raised by members on the Government side who accused members on this side of having made a poor contribution to the debate and, in the case of other members, of unwillingness to take part in the debate. We shall take part in this debate and we shall turn it into an agricultural debate but I want to say this to hon. members opposite: If that is the best argument they can advance and if the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, who is the secretary of the farmers&#x2019; group, is the best speaker they can put forward to advance those arguments, I can only say: Heaven help the agriculturist.</p>

<speech by="#niemand">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEMAND</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) has displayed an ignorance in connection with farming conditions in Southern Africa which amazes me. He tried to dictate to us how we should debate this matter. I want to point out that when the Rents Amendment Bill was under discussion an hour or so ago the United Party took a great deal of time to say that they supported that measure. They had a great deal of time in which to discuss the measure and many United Party members participated in that debate although they supported the measure. We have here a measure which deals with the interests of the farmers in South Africa. Although it suited them to devote a great deal of time in discussing the Rents Amendment Bill, it does not suit them to discuss the interests of the farmers of South Africa, particularly those farmers who find themselves in a critical position. Sir, it suits us to discuss farming matters and we will not permit the United Party to dictate to us and to tell us how much time we should devote to this debate.</p>

<p>The hon. member for East London (City) spoke about conditions in Rhodesia. I want to point out to him that that country is still to a large extent undeveloped. There are large areas still untouched and the Government is encouraging people to farm those areas. One has to pay a farmer to farm there because people do not wish to farm. All the land in our country controlled by the Land Board and the Government has already been given out for this purpose. I want to know how the hon. member is going to succeed in selling the stock of the farmers in the Northern Transvaal and finding grazing for that stock in the Eastern Province. He said that the farmers in the Eastern Province, who do not need assistance, must be assisted to buy the cattle of the farmers in the Northern Transvaal. But then the farmers in the Northern Transvaal will have no cattle at all. At some stage they will have to buy back their cattle from the hon. member for East London (City) at his own price.</p>

<p>I think it is to be deprecated that while we are discussing a Bill which is of the most vital importance to a large number of citizens of this country who are experiencing difficult times, the United Party, in the person of the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson), should reveal such light-heartedness and try to make a farce of the whole debate. The reason for his action is obvious. The platteland has rejected the United Party and now the hon. member for Sea Point has to participate in a debate on agriculture. He did so yesterday on no fewer than two occasions.</p>

<p><span class="col_3945-3946" refersTo="page_0665"/>By doing so he only succeeded in revealing his ignorance in regard to conditions in agriculture. This Bill is of the most vital importance to the farmers who are experiencing difficult drought conditions. We who live in those parts know what we are talking about. This Bill is another attempt on the part of the Government to try to assist those farmers who are the victims of natural disasters. Those who need that assistance welcome this Bill wholeheartedly.</p>

<p>I want to express my thanks to the hon. the Minister and his officials who are entrusted with the task of lightening the load of the farmers.</p>

<p>Another song of praise!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#niemand">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">NIEMAND</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is necessary to sing a song of praise, no matter what the hon. member for East London (City) may say. It is necessary for us to do so. The officials of the Department are acting in the interests of the farmers who are in difficulty. They have done a very great deal in this connection. Various forms of assistance are being given to-day. This assistance is mostly in the form of loans, rebates and subsidies. These are sources of assistance which have already been mentioned by the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek). The question always arises as to whether assistance to these farmers is justified and to what extent that assistance is justified. I believe that we are all in agreement that that assistance is indeed justified and that it is absolutely necessary for us to have a strong farming population in the country. Assistance must be given at all times to those who need it. I want to point out that the farmers who are being assisted in terms of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act are usually those who can no longer command credit at other institutions. When we consider this fact, it is pleasing to be able to say that, according to statistics, it is clear that since the introduction of aid schemes, the State has lost very little. Up to 31 March 1963, of a total recoverable amount of R142,500,000, only 3.65 per cent was written off. This speaks volumes for the integrity and the honesty of those farmers who are in a critical position. The percentage written off in respect of advances for farming purposes, is only 3.17 per cent while in the case of the demobilization scheme it amounted to 6.47 per cent. The total amount outstanding on about 42,000 loans amounted to about R37,500,000 as at 31 March 1963. An amount of R7,700,000 had already been paid on a capital amount of R30,000,000 advanced for farming purposes which was outstanding on 31 March 1963 while an amount of R1,900,000 in interest was outstanding.</p>

<p>When we consider these statistics, Mr. Speaker, we arrive at certain conclusions. The first is that the farmers who have been assisted in terms of these aid schemes have fulfilled their obligations faithfully. On the other hand, when we look at the large outstanding amount and when we consider the continued serious and threatening drought conditions, we can understand that these farmers are filled with unease and concern. It is only the endurance and the toughness and the strong willpower of these farmers which enables them to survive these conditions. I think that this compels our respect. I have already said that statistics prove that these farmers have fulfilled their obligations faithfully. This is to no small extent due to the fact that the farmers living in the drought-stricken areas have altered and adjusted their way of life to the lean years in which they have been earning a smaller income. I think that their determination and consistency compels our greatest respect and admiration. Farmers affected by natural disasters merit special attention. Their problems must be kept apart from the ordinary agricultural problems and difficulties. It is for this reason that the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board was set up and it is for this reason that we have this Bill before us to-day.</p>

<p>Certain additional concessions are being made in this Bill. We think of the registration of bonds and the reduced fees in this connection; we think of the control which will now be exercised over those who sell agricultural machinery such as tractors to farmers under hire-purchase agreements and who then repossess that machinery when the farmer needs it most. When we think of solutions, then I say that there are many remedies existing to-day. It is very difficult for one to imagine any further assistance that can be made available. There are people who have a poor knowledge of agricultural problems and who raise farmers&#x2019; hopes, hopes which are perhaps unrealistic. But the Government has given careful consideration to this problem and many means of assistance have been made available. These means of assistance have saved many thousands of farmers from ruin during periods of drought over the past 60 years. I believe that with the sympathetic assistance of the present Government and because of the toughness and the determination of the farmers, they will be able to survive this difficult period.</p>

<p>But I do think that there are other remedies to which the Government should give its serious attention and I want to mention a few of them. I think that the Department of Agricultural Technical Services and the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing should frame plans jointly. As far as the Department of Agricultural Technical Services is concerned I think that the number of experimental farms, for example, should be increased. I am pleased that an investigation has recently been made in connection with experimental farms in the Northern Transvaal because the Department realizes that it is necessary to make special efforts in order to assist those stricken farmers. If the services at the Mara station cannot be expanded, I think consideration ought to be given to the establishment of a special experimental farm which will give particular attention to experiments in connection with the growing of crops <span class="col_3947-3948" refersTo="page_0666"/>and the control of grazing in the areas of the country prone to drought. I think that it has been a generally accepted fact in the past that crop-raising should actually be discouraged in certain parts of the Northern Transvaal. The fact is, however, that because the farms in that area are small, crop-raising has increased and has to-day become the most important facet of farming operations there. That is why it is necessary for experiments in connection with crop-raising to be made in the Northern Transvaal, particularly with a view to producing cattle-feed for the stock which do very well in those parts. We need far more extension officers for that purpose. I think of the question of the dissemination of more information in connection with soil conservation; I think of the building of more dams in those areas where it is so dry. Consideration should possibly be given to the making available of larger subsidies for water-works, such as the building of earth dams. Even though the topography may not always lend itself to this, the water can always be conserved. Because of the climate in the Northern Transvaal the pumping of water is a very important factor and many farmers are able to keep going in this way. I think too of an extension of the services rendered by the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, farming has become a very involved business undertaking. It is necessary for us to have the services of agricultural economists. We must increase the number of agricultural economists whom we have to-day. It is necessary for a farmer to make a thorough study of cost-price estimating, of book-keeping and of advanced planning in connection with his farming operations. I also feel that because of the assistance which it is necessary to give in these drought-stricken areas, consideration should also be given, for example, to the establishment of agricultural centres at central points in those areas from which all the information in connection with agricultural financing and in connection with agricultural technical information can be supplied to the farmers.</p>

<p>These few suggestions that I have made will provide the farmers with indirect services but services which I believe are justified and which I also believe will contribute towards assisting the farmers during these difficult times. It will be of assistance to them if they are made to feel that the Department of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the Department of Agricultural Technical Services are showing more interest in them and doing more in order to combat this problem of drought.</p>

<p>I was not here when the hon. member for Sea Point spoke, but I cannot believe that the hon. member for Sea Point would not look after the interests of the farmers in this House. I believe that this Bill has been introduced mainly as the result of the continual representations made by hon. members on this side. It is we on this side who know precisely what the position of the farmers in the country is. It is we on this side who continually bring it to the notice of the Minister that the position of the farmers to-day is not an enviable one. We did so again this year by way of a motion. We told the Government precisely what their position was. When that motion was discussed hon. members opposite wished to intimate that the position of the farmers was sound. Sir, the position of the farmer is not sound; that is the reason for our constantly having to introduce this kind of legislation. [Interjections.] There may be other people also with whom things are not going well, but when we discuss agriculture we discuss the farmers. Nor am I saying that things are not going well with all the farmers. I have never said so, but a large section of the farmers in this country are having a difficult time to-day, with the result that <span class="col_3949-3950" refersTo="page_0667"/>we have this type of legislation. We welcome it, because we want to assist those people.</p>

<p>This legislation, however, gives too little and it comes too late. It comes too late, and 28,000 farmers have already left the land, and we are told that every year 2,400 of them are leaving the land. This is not the type of assistance which puts the farmer on a sound basis. This is temporary assistance. The hon. member for Groblersdal (Mr. M. J. H. Bekker) made a speech about a fortnight ago in which he pleaded that agriculture should be placed on a sound basis. That is the right thing. We must place agriculture on a sound basis and then we will not need this type of legislation all the time.</p>

<p>Finally, I just want to say that we approve of this legislation. But I repeat that I think this side of the House is to a large extent responsible for the fact that our farmers are receiving assistance, because we are constantly advocating their case here and bringing it to the notice of the Government.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. J. H. BEKKER</person>:</from>

<p>We have just listened to the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan), the leader of the farming group on the Opposition side. He told us quite frankly that his side of the House supported this legislation. We are grateful for that. Listening to previous speakers on that side, Mr. Speaker, we heard each one of them say that they supported this Bill but &#x2026; They then proceeded to hurl a number of accusations at the Government. For example, we started last night with the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren). He is an hon. member for whom we all have a great deal of respect. We also have respect for his knowledge in regard to agricultural matters. But that hon. member also made the accusation that this legislation was being introduced too late. Then we had the hon. member for Sea Point (Mr. J. A. L. Basson), of whom I can unfortunately not say what I have said of the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town. The hon. member for Sea Point took exception to what was said by the hon. member for Waterberg (Mr. Heystek). He tried to ridicule him because he thanked the hon. the Minister and the Department for what they have done for the farmers up to the present.</p>

<p>We listened this afternoon to the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman). He delivered a tirade here and he said that the hon. the Minister has not been successful in his efforts to control agriculture in South Africa. He referred derisively and accusingly to the efforts that have been made in this regard but eventually he said that his side of the House supported this legislation. The hon. member for Gardens has also just told us that it is unfortunate that the legislation has been introduced at such a late stage. Not one of those hon. members is at present in the House to listen to our counter-arguments. This makes me think of a bird which we have in the Bosveld. It notices where other birds build their nests and as soon as a nest is finished, it lays its egg in that nest and then flies away and the owner of that nest has to hatch out that egg. That is what is happening in the United Party. They lay certain things in our midst but they do not have the responsibility to give effect to those matters; they raise certain hopes throughout the country, expectations which they are not prepared or which they are unable to carry out. It is a pity that a political debate should have been made of a debate such as this, a debate which is full of good intentions, a debate on legislation which we all believe will have a salutary effect on the farmers who are struggling, and that hon. members opposite should make use of this opportunity to make light of a vitally important matter, the survival of those farmers who are struggling. I think that this is action of which we must record our disapproval.</p>

<p>I rise, however, to exchange a few ideas with you, Mr. Speaker, in connection with the effect of this legislation on, and what it means to the agricultural industry. The Republic of South Africa is a young country with tremendous possibilities. Recently it has shown a rate of growth which compares well with the best in the world. We can testify that the oldest industry in South Africa&#x2014;the agricultural industry&#x2014;has also contributed its share, together with other industries, in bringing about this tremendous economic prosperity. The agricultural industry has once again added a new record amount to our national income this year&#x2014;R882,000,000. This is indeed an achievement for our farmers. Notwithstanding the difficult times that they have experienced and notwithstanding all the criticism and accusations that have been levelled at us from the other side, our farmers have succeeded in making this achievement.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are dealing here with amending legislation which seeks to co-ordinate the State assistance given to this industry in the proper way. Just as we in this House have from time to time to introduce legislation to overcome certain problems and to meet the demands of the time in regard to various industries, so it is also necessary for us to introduce legislation in regard to the agricultural industry from time to time in order to keep pace with progress and to establish the necessary machinery to keep the industry on a sound basis and to ensure the necessary future expansion. This Bill amends the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act and the State Advances Recoveries Act. As we know, those Acts were placed on the Statute Book after a thorough inquiry into the financial position of farmers after the 1933 drought. This inquiry was instituted in 1933 and in 1935 the aforementioned Acts were passed by this House. Sir, this amending Bill is the result of the experience and the requests of our agricultural industry, with all its recognized organizations, and of our Departments of Agriculture and our Ministers up to the present. That is why it is obvious that during this long period, from 1935 to 1960, during which 69 <span class="col_3951-3952" refersTo="page_0668"/>various aid schemes were made available to farmers, certain problems and difficulties should have been experienced. And so we are grateful that this legislation is before the House to-day because it will remove those stumbling-blocks and problems and ensure that State assistance can be made available to deserving farmers more swiftly and more efficiently.</p>

<p>The policy of this Government, as well as that of all previous Governments, has been that aid schemes should be set up from time to time in terms of the aforementioned legislation in order to combat certain specific circumstances and problems. It is true, as I have just indicated, that it has sometimes been necessary to set up the various aid schemes required by way of special legislation, other than simply by way of Cabinet instructions. We are very grateful for this because many of our farmers have been assisted to stay on their farms in this way. From our experience it has also appeared to be necessary not only to set up these schemes from time to time but to make some of them of a permanent nature. Since 1960 the Government has put continuous crop production loan schemes into operation of which all farmers can under certain circumstances and certain conditions make use. Special loans are also allocated under specific circumstances in drought-stricken areas; we also have special loans that are granted under extraordinary circumstances, such as conditions which can be disastrous to a particular area, which is what we are experiencing at present in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for East London (City) said that the hon. the Minister should follow the example set by Southern Rhodesia in its agricultural policy and that we should arrange matters here according to what is being done there. As I have already said, it is a pity that that hon. member is so ignorant and that he has to display that ignorance here. He is not even in the House now. He is not here to hear his arguments being replied to. Members of Parliament who know those conditions and who are surrounded by those problems from day to day, who eat, sleep and drink with those problems, are satisfied that the Government and particularly the hon. the Minister and his Department, are making a special effort to give relief where it is at all possible to do so and in this way are enabling many of our farmers to remain on their farms. I do not want to go into detail; this has been done in a very capable manner by my colleagues, the hon. members for Waterberg and Pietersburg. But it is untrue and it is unjust of the hon. member for East London (City) to accuse the Government of not acting positively and to say that this Government is responsible for the fact that things are going so badly with the farmers in the Northern Transvaal.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, if we examine our agricultural industry as such a little more closely we will find that there are three special financial sec tors which have invested money in our agricultural industry. In the first instance, there is the farmer himself. The savings of the farmer are invested in the soil of South Africa because the farmer loves his soil. In, the second place, we have the private financial sector which makes certain investments in agriculture with a profit motive. In the third place, we have the investments made by the State. Having mentioned those investments, for which certain security exists under normal circumstances, I want to point out what the Government of the day and former Governments&#x2014;I do not want to do an injustice to any former Governments&#x2014;have done to keep agriculture in the Republic on a sound footing. In the first place I want to mention the tremendous amounts of money and the number of staff used to do research in agriculture. We can mention the development of special projects; we think of the emergency aid schemes that have been set up to comply with certain specific requirements. We think of subsidies on agricultural products; limited forms of financing under specific circumstances; information to farmers, particularly in order to enable them to overcome these drought problems and other agricultural problems. We think of the marketing facilities that have been set up and are being maintained both in this country and on the export market; we think of our soil conservation projects which, as the hon. member for Pietersburg told us here, are so necessary in order to enable our farmers to weather the difficult periods which are dealt with in this Bill. We also think of very special services that are rendered to our farmers from time to time by way of farmers&#x2019; days and so forth in order to educate our farmers and to enable them to overcome the difficult times that are sometimes forthcoming. The Government has made phenomenal contributions to agriculture. But notwithstanding these large investments by the State, the Government has continued to play a small part in the general financing of agriculture. This being so, I want to say that the Government&#x2019;s share has been small with the specific purpose of preventing the investment of the private sector from being impeded in any way. It is the policy of the Government to continue to encourage the private sector to invest money where it can be invested most advantageously and that is why the Government has deliberately not played as large a role in the financing of agriculture as many of us would have liked to have seen it play. But the importance of our agricultural industry viewed from a national point of view and the importance of the people in that industry has changed and increased tremendously. This has resulted in the fact that we are living in changed circumstances to-day and we have to approach the question of the financing of agriculture from a completely different angle. In my view it is vitally necessary for us to review the whole question of the position of our agricultural industry in our entire national economy. Changed national and international circumstances therefore make a <span class="col_3953-3954" refersTo="page_0669"/>new approach to our agricultural finance problem absolutely necessary as well. The national prosperity which our country is experiencing to-day is providing our private investors with more comprehensive and more profitable investment fields in which these investments can earn more money in greater safety and with less risk. Because of this it is obvious that the private investor is hesitant to invest in the agricultural industry. His investment is exposed to a greater risk because of the uncertain factors in the agricultural industry. It is possible that we may experience a financial recession simply because we have so much scope for investment and we want to point out the danger in time that our agricultural industry may run out of sources of finance in the private sector.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the tendency is also noticeable, or so it is said, that about 2,000 farmers leave the industry annually. The Opposition like saying that these 2,000 farmers leave because they become bankrupt, and blame the Nationalist Government for it; but we want to point out immediately that a large percentage of these farmers leave for other reasons. We admit that there are some of them who leave for financial reasons. I am convinced that if it is true that 2,000 farmers are leaving the industry annually, then this tempo is too swift. I do not think that it can be healthy for our agricultural industry to lose farmers at that rate. This can have a disruptive effect upon the industry, and, if it is true, then I do believe that we must take the necessary steps in time to prevent that tempo continuing or even increasing. When we talk about the financial interests and economic aspects of agriculture, the question arises as to whether this important and delicate problem of agricultural finance should be seen from a purely economic point of view or whether we should give more consideration to other factors connected with it. If we consider it from a purely economic point of view and we leave our farmers to the mercy of the economic laws of the day, then I predict that the law of the jungle will ensure that the weaker farmers make way for the stronger ones. There is already, I am sorry to say, a noticeable tendency in that direction. That is why we say that if this erosion in the ranks of our farmers continues, it will be an evil day for agriculture. We know that certain people will have to leave the industry because they can no longer carry on and because they may possibly be able to do better in other industries, but we are also convinced of the fact that large numbers of the people who leave the industry will be a great asset to us if they can be assisted to continue farming. In the light of the important role of the agricultural industry in our national economy as a whole, and the gigantic role which the State has played over the years in assisting to build up the agricultural industry to what it is to-day, it is my well-considered opinion that it should be accepted Government policy to accept responsibility for the financing of the farmers who are unable to obtain assistance through the usual financial channels.</p>

<p>No, only deserving farmers. We do not want to stand in the way of any private financial investors who wish to be of assistance in this regard; we welcome their assistance because these private investors have rendered valuable services to the farmers in the past. But we must accept the fact that the State should not only provide emergency assistance under special circumstances; the farmer must have the opportunity of approaching the State under special circumstances without having to be referred to the private investor. Let us be grateful to the men and women in the agricultural industry who are prepared to endure privations and make sacrifices. Let us issue a warning to those people who refer airily and sneeringly to the fact that &#x201C;everything is done for the farmers&#x201D;, because there are certain farmers who may at present not be sharing in the prosperity of the country to the same extent. Let us tell those people who say these things that those farmers on the platteland form an absolutely necessary and indispensable part of our population. Those people are to a large extent the ones who introduce the enduring, the conservative way of life into our national life, and maintain it, and it is my conviction that if we permit a large percentage of those people to disappear from our platteland and to be absorbed amongst the larger masses in our cities with their more liberal approach to life, this will be damaging to our nation as a whole and will result in national erosion which will upset the balance of our population to the detriment of our South African nation.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, because of the fact that this Bill before us creates new possibilities and opportunities for the farmers and enables the hon. the Minister and his Department to make new means of assistance available, we want to thank the hon. the Minister and his Department for what they have done up to the present; we want to wish them every success in connection with the implementation of the provisions of this Bill and we fervently trust that this will be the beginning of a new era for our agriculture and for our farmers.</p>

<p>I do not want to pursue that argument at all. It does not help us in this debate. I would rather come to the question of helping farmers who are in trouble. This is important because when I address myself particularly to the Minister, I want to say that this Bill which has been welcomed by members on both sides of the House, is a Bill to help individuals in a crisis&#x2014;but how did that crisis come about&#x003F; I think to just help them at this stage and do nothing more, so that the first small drought that comes along throws them back into a similar position, is not sufficient. This hon. Minister is the Minister in the Cabinet who is responsible for prices of farm produce, and we have asked him time and again to see that the economics of farming, that is the whole question of economics and marketing, are such that the farmer is in a position to meet his financial obligations from his returns on his farming activities. The ordinary man in business, the ordinary man in industry, or in mining, or any other form of commerce, gets a return on his work which enables him to build up a reserve so that when there is a bit of trouble in his marketing of his particular product, or when perhaps he strikes a snag in his mining, he is in a position to call on his reserves to tide him over. But the farmer in the last few years, with the low prices he has received in relation to his cost of production, has not been able to build up any reserve whatsoever, and in fact in many instances has not only been running his farm on a marginal basis, but in many instances the production of many of his products has been on a marginal loss basis. We have pointed out to the hon. Minister over and over again that in the dairy industry, and in other sections of the farming industry, there are no guarantees of prices, but this Minister controls the marketing. When the wattle-bark producers had troubles with the marketing overseas and were put on quotas, on very short quotas, the prices were affected a bit, but to save his price the wattle-bark farmer had to agree to reduced quotas. Of course the hon. Minister will come back and say: &#x201C;Ah, the wattle industry has now its own board, and they have their own quotas self-imposed,&#x201D; but, Mr. Speaker, they had to do that to save their price and save what little they could out of what they had invested in that industry. But many of those people had commitments in machinery, in capital expenditure and such-like that they are in the position that their quota is so small that their return of profit on that quota is not sufficient to meet their annual commitments of capital redemption and interest. Mr. Speaker, if the hon. the Minister really wants to help the farmers he should overhaul the whole question of marketing and get down to doing something on a long-term basis. One of the Members on this side referred to Rhodesia. The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman), and he referred to the Rhodesian scheme to overcome drought difficulties. But we do know that their cattle scheme is one under which prices are guaranteed over a number of years. A producer there knows what he is going to get for some years to come. Is there any such guarantee in this country&#x003F; What happens when there is a very slight overproduction in one good summer and when the dairy production is at its peak&#x003F; Immediately the Minister keeps down the price and says: &#x201C;We have to deal with the question of supply and demand.&#x201D; The whole idea of the Marketing Act was to protect the primary producer against that very situation and to see that he got a reasonable return. I and other members on this side of the House pleaded with the Minister to look after the interests of the farmers, and that is when he could have really assisted the good farmers of this country to remain on the land, enabling them to go in for proper farming methods, not being forced to mine their soil, thereby creating difficulties of soil erosion and therefore more costs in soil and water conservation, and the enforced application of the Soil Conservation Act in many districts where it had not been found necessary to do so before. If there are any farmers this hon. Minister ought to protect and keep on the land it is those very farmers who are trying to go in for good farming methods but cannot do so at the present prices prevailing for primary produce. I do appeal to this hon. Minister to give them this help. I welcome any financial aid to help keep men on the land who are good farmers, and we know that it is this Minister&#x2019;s policy and the policy of the Government to keep the prices of food low. They follow a cheap food policy, because the cost of food is low in this country compared to the salaries of artisans, professional men, the men employed in mining or any other part of commerce and industry. The farmer to-day is getting a lower return on his investment and his work than anybody else in this country and I put it at the door of the present Minister, as the Minister responsible for economics and marketing, for not looking after these farmers and for not making it the responsibility of the Cabinet to look after them to ensure that their economy is placed on a sound basis. Because unless our farming community is placed on a sound basis, we may, because we are going to have more droughts, find more and more farmers being driven off the land. That in turn has an effect on the community as a whole.</p>

<p>I want to say that when we welcome this assistance to farmers, we are not assisting farmers to get money to put in their pockets because every rand they are going to receive will go into the pocket of somebody else. These funds will land in the pockets of the farmers&#x2019; creditors. The money will consequently not be for their own use but will serve the object only of keeping them on their land and to pay their creditors. It is given with the object of assisting them to stay on their land. Every cent will, thus, be paid out and the community at large will in the end profit from it. This, I think, is something which should <span class="col_3957-3958" refersTo="page_0671"/>be brought home to the country at large. It is often thought, when publicity is given to assistance to farmers, that such assistance is being given to them simply as a bonus for their own retention. In fact, every cent thereof is being paid out to the public at large. There it circulates and creates avenues of employment. Furthermore, it will do away with bad debts. These debts can, if assistance is not given, make themselves felt on the community concerned. So that this money is money well spent. I say this advisedly because we know the record of the farmers of our country. In fact one can be proud if one looks at this record if one keeps in mind what assistance has been given to them by the various. Governments over the years. The greatest proportion of all this has been repaid. In fact, it is amazing, keeping in mind the extent of the assistance given, to find what small percentage has ended up as bad debts. In fact, this percentage is no larger than in the case of the ordinary financial institution dealing with large sums of money. At the same time a service was rendered to the community at large because by assisting the farmers, they could produce cheap food. There is in addition those primary products which are exported and those which are processed by industries in this country.</p>

<p>I say again that this assistance is money well spent. At the same time, however, I want to say that it is incumbent on this Minister as well as on the Government to get down and do a real job of work for a change to see that the economic side of farming is properly developed instead of it being handled in this haphazard way of handing out sums of money at certain periods. This often has the effect of not keeping the right man on the land which could have been achieved if the whole matter was effectively planned and handled properly.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down said in the course of his speech that the assistance which the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing and the Government would be able to grant to the farmers in terms of this measure was supported by the United Party. But at the same time he said that this sort of assistance was not the right type of assistance and is not the kind of assistance which the farmers actually needed. He would prefer the Government rather to assist the farmer by means of long-term planning and by paying him higher prices for his agricultural products. The hon. member is a farmer and as such he is a member of the agricultural union of a farmers&#x2019; association. As such he knows that we have the system of marketing boards and that the representatives of the farmers are in the majority on these boards. These representatives, together with the various agricultural unions, discuss the prices for the various agricultural products and thereafter they make a recommendation. In this connection I want to point out to the hon. member that all the recommendations made by the various marketing boards in recent times have been accepted by the hon. the Minister. The hon. member for Cradock (Mr. G. F. H. Bekker) has always referred to the Marketing Act as the Magna Charta of the farmer. Indeed, this system gives the farmer every opportunity on the various boards to make his own decision as to the prices to be fixed for the various agricultural products.</p>

<p>But there is another matter to which I want to draw the attention of the hon. member. Let us assume that the hon. the Minister fixed the price of wheat at RIO per bag, not simply 23 cents higher than last year&#x2019;s price, and that we then had a drought as a result of which the farmers are unable to harvest a single bag of wheat. How then would that increased price help the farmers&#x003F; It would not help them at all. That is why I feel that this is not the time or the place to make a speech such as that made by the hon. member here to-day. On occasions such as these we think of the farmers in our country who have been hit by abnormal natural disasters and who are threatened with ruin. The Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board can help them by providing them with loans to help them to overcome those circumstances over which they have no control. These natural disasters are the main reason really why farmers in certain parts of our country find themselves in financial difficulties. In 1958 I tried to describe to the House the plight of the farmers in the North-eastern Free State. At that time they were struggling to overcome a natural disaster which nearly ruined large numbers of farmers. On that occasion, however, these conditions were not caused by drought but by torrential rain. For example, at Bethlehem, where the average rainfall is between 30 and 35 inches a year, it was 62 inches during that year. The result was that the wheat crops were practically completely destroyed by rust and the potato and maize crops were ruined. All those crops failed. During the period 1959-60 when the Government put the farmers&#x2019; assistance scheme into operation, there were no fewer than 234 farmers in my constituency who applied for a consolidation of debts, all as a result of the natural disaster to which I have referred. In order to show that the statement made by the hon. member is not entirely correct, I want to point out that according to the report of the State Advances Recoveries Office for 1962-3, only 11 farmers from that constituency applied for State assistance. This proves that those farmers have fared reasonably well in recent years, they have had good wheat and maize crops. Even this year conditions are fairly normal in the North-eastern Free State although other parts of the country are very dry. In any case they do not experience the same problems as the farmers of the Northern Transvaal, for example.</p>

<p>I do not think there is anyone in this House who does not view with sympathy the position in which the farmers in the Northern Transvaal find themselves&#x2014;in the districts of Pietersburg, <span class="col_3959-3960" refersTo="page_0672"/>Brits, Lataba, Potgietersrust, Rustenburg and Soutpansberg. Last year there were only four applications for State assistance at Bethlehem in comparison with 22 at Brits, 26 at Letaba, 12 at Pietersburg, 30 at Potgietersrust, 16 at Rustenburg and 18 at Soutpansberg. Those areas also experienced drought conditions in 1933 but over the past 30 years there has been a normal rainfall in that area, the farmers have been able to harvest normal crops and they have fared well over this period. But over the past four or five years, because of a freak of nature, because something has gone wrong with our climatic conditions in those parts, things have not been going well with them, but I do not doubt that conditions will again become normal. Whereas previously crop loans were limited to R600 per annum, the Government has now stated that the maximum crop loan throughout the whole of the Republic will be R4,000. The application of every farmer, of course, is treated on its merits as far as the granting of these loans is concerned. A small farmer farming on only 200 morgen of land cannot of course expect a loan of R4,000. But there are others who in the normal course of events harvest between 10,000 and 20,000 bags of maize and who this year expect to have no harvest at all. These farmers cannot make ends meet on R600. As far as they are concerned, that is only a drop in the ocean. That is why the Government has agreed to increase the maximum loan to R4,000.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the amendments which this Bill seeks to effect to the existing Act. At the present time the State Advances Recoveries Office can declare a moratorium for a certain period in order to protect the farmer against his creditors. This moratorium can now also be extended to include companies which sell goods to the farmers under hire-purchase areements. I have heard the question posed whether it is fair towards a business concern which has sold a tractor under a hire-purchase agreement if it is unable to repossess that article. It is argued that if the State Advances Recoveries Office undertakes to keep a watchful eye on the tractor to ensure that it is not neglected, then it will not be unfair. But that is not a fair argument. A firm sells a tractor to a farmer under a hire-purchase agreement extending over three years. The farmer pays his deposit and he has three years in which to pay off that article. But during that period of three years that firm does not keep a watchful eye on that tractor on the farm. That is not an argument which one can use. We must not lose sight of the fact that this system of hire-purchase agreements in terms of which farmers buy implements&#x2014;in my opinion at any rate&#x2014;is one of the greatest evils, particularly in the case of the small farmer. The financially strong farmer does not buy an implement on hire purchase because he has to pay 12&#x00BD; per cent interest and if he falls into arrears with his instalments, the interest may be as high as 20 per cent. I think business firms make enough money and it is no more than right, in those cases where the State Advances Recoveries Office wants to assist the farmer, that those firms should wait for at least two months because it does not usually take longer than two months before an applicant&#x2019;s case is disposed of. If the State Advances Recoveries Office does not assist that farmer, the firm can always repossess that implement. But what has happened in the past&#x003F; The firms do not repossess the tractors during the dry period; they do so as soon as it rains and the farmer wants to start ploughing. That tractor is repossessed and the farmer is powerless; he is unable to plant.</p>

<p>There are many matters troubling me which I would very much like to bring to the attention of the hon. the Minister. When a farmer applies for State assistance, for the consolidation of his debts, the first thing that the State Advances Recoveries Office should do is to find out whether that farmer farms on an economic unit because I know of numbers of cases where State Advances have assisted a farmer although he has been farming on a farm which is too small and quite uneconomic. It simply means that such a farmer is only postponing the evil day. I want to ask that in such cases State Advances should not only assist the farmer to consolidate his debts but also help him to obtain an economic unit so that he can make a reasonable living.</p>

<p>I have one last point to make. When I think of the farmers in Northern Transvaal, I want to assure the House that as a farmer myself my heart goes out to them. I think of the farmers there who have had no harvest for five successive years although each year they have been given a crop loan. They plough and plant and fertilize and as soon as the maize starts growing nicely, a drought comes along and destroys everything. Certain parts of Northern Transvaal have had good rains over the past >ear and the farmers there have planted maize. But it has not rained since December and everything there is very dry. There are cases where the farmer&#x2019;s debts, his bond on his farm, his loans from State Advances, his indebtedness to the commercial banks and other businesses, exceed the value of his assets. His liabilities exceed his assets. Such a person may perhaps be one of the best farmers in the country but he is powerless under those circumstances because he cannot fight nature. I want to suggest that in such cases the hon. the Minister should give serious consideration not to giving charity to those people but to writing off part of that debt in order to enable them to continue farming because otherwise they will leave the land and their loss will be a great loss to the country. Sir, our country is developing and our population is growing rapidly. Our agricultural land is not increasing and there is a great need for good farmers. I am not speaking about the man who is incapable of farming, the man who spends his time on the road or in the ba; I am speaking about the farmer who is a real asset to the country. I want to <span class="col_3961-3962" refersTo="page_0673"/>ask that in the case of such a farmer we should do everything we can to prevent his leaving the land.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Bethlehem (Mr. Knobel) said a few things with which I think the House can agree, particularly towards the end of his speech when he asked that the man whom we regard as a good farmer should be assisted to remain on the land. But the hon. member made a statement earlier on in his speech with which I cannot agree. He quoted from the report of the State Advances Recoveries Office and he contended that the difficulties experienced by the farmers in his district were simply due to climatic conditions. I stay in a part of the country which is probably most affected by climatic conditions. What are the facts of the situation there&#x003F; The farmers in the Karoo who have experienced extreme drought conditions in the past have made very little use of the assistance available to them under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act or from the Land Bank. Why&#x003F; They have also had to contend with unnatural climatic conditions, just like the farmers at Bethlehem, but why have they been able to keep their heads above water&#x003F; They have been able to do so for one reason and that is because the wool farmer is experiencing a certain amount of prosperity to-day in comparison with other farmers in South Africa. If he receives a good price for his product he will also be in a position to build up his reserves to such an extent that he will be able to cope with unnatural climatic conditions which would otherwise compel him to apply for assistance from time to time. Who are the people who most often apply for assistance to-day&#x003F; It is those people who own small farms or who farm on settlements. They are experiencing extremely difficult conditions not only as a result of climatic conditions&#x2014;I do not want to ignore climatic conditions because we know that they play an important part&#x2014; but as a result of the fact that the people in those areas have to be prepared to make do with less as far as the prices for their products are concerned. It is for that reason that they find themselves in difficulties and it is for that reason that the people in the constituency of the hon. member for Bethlehem found themselves in difficulties when the prices of their products were reduced a year or two ago.</p>

<p>The farmers who do not raise crops and who do not find it necessary to mechanize on a large scale. They are able to control their production costs to a certain extent. But the wool farmers are not the only farmers in the country. The agricultural industry produces products worth R882,000,000 annually and only about R90,000,000 of that amount is produced by the wool farmers. The other farmers are the crop farmers, the fruit farmers and so forth. They find it difficult to control their production costs and they are not in a position to control the price of their products. But we welcome this legislation before the House. Hon. members opposite say that a great deal of assistance can now be given to farmers in terms of this Bill but with the exception of Clause 6 which deals with the hire-purchase system and which provides that any article purchased in this way cannot summarily be repossessed by the dealer, I cannot see any other provision which provides for large amounts of money to be voted. Of course, every possible assistance is welcomed, but what does Clause 8 prove&#x003F; It proves only one thing and that is that more and more farmers are finding it difficult to keep going, farmers who are unable to meet their commitments to the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board. Action is now being taken in their case which is further proof that this is not merely a measure to assist the farmers; it simply proves how many more farmers are finding themselves in difficulties. I want to tell the hon. the Minister who is handling this sort of legislation for the first time&#x2014;it was handled previously by the hon. the Minister of Finance&#x2014;that we will have to introduce this type of legislation year in and year out unless we can find a longterm solution to the problems of the farmers. If we cannot do so, we will have to approach Parliament each year to ask for more and more assistance and opportunities to prevent creditors from taking action against farmers. A day or two ago the report of the Land Bank was tabled and in the Press this morning&#x2014;not the United Party Press but the Nationalist Press&#x2014;I noticed the following headline: &#x201C;Great increase in debts of farmers&#x201D;.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>That is exactly the point. I know of course that there are many people who incur debt with the Land Bank in order to consolidate and make new purchases, but to what extent are the debts which those people have had to incur attributable to the fact that they have found themselves in a more and more difficult position, not as result of climatic conditions but as a result <span class="col_3963-3964" refersTo="page_0674"/>of economic conditions&#x003F; The hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs told us last year that 2,400 farmers would have to leave the land annually and what reason did he give for saying so&#x003F; He said that the reason was chiefly an economic one; that these people were not in a position to keep their heads above water. That was why they would have to leave the land. [Interjections.] I do not know whether the hon. member for Nelspruit (Mr. Faurie) read what Dr. Frikkie Tomlinson had to say a few days ago&#x2014;that 14 years ago there were 147,000 farmers in our country and that to-day we only have 105,000. Those farmers were not all driven out of agriculture because they became too old to farm; many of them were forced off the land as a result of economic circumstances.</p>

<p>The hon. member is quite correct when he says that it is a universal occurrence, but in other countries in which this is happening do the powers that be simply sit back and do nothing about it&#x003F; Does the hon. member know what amount is being spent in West Germany on food subsidies in order to keep these farmers on the land&#x003F; Does the hon. member know what is taking place in America; does he know what is being done in America to try to keep these people on the land&#x003F; Does the hon. member know that &#x00A3;1,000,000 is being spent in Britain every day in respect of subsidies in order to keep farmers on the land&#x003F; An amount of &#x00A3;365,000,000 is spent annually in this regard. The hon. member for Pietersburg (Mr. Niemand) suggested certain things that could be done, and I want to thank him for having done so. He is the only hon. member on that side who has dared to make any positive suggestions in regard to what can be done. The others are afraid to say anything. They know how they are being criticized by farmers throughout the country. They know that the farmers are seeking a solution to this problem but those hon. members are not prepared to give us that solution. The hon. member for Groblersdal (Mr. M. J. H. Bekker) wants the farmers to remain on the land. Are they not disappearing from the land&#x003F; That is exactly what is happening and what are they doing to prevent it&#x003F; I want to say again that under the circumstances that we have here in South Africa this legislation will mean absolutely nothing. It will only serve to assist us temporarily; we must follow a long-term policy otherwise agriculture in this country is heading for a catastrophe. It will not only be the small farmer who will have to leave the platteland; the big farmer will also be faced with ever-increasing economic problems. But the hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing has also not given us a solution. He has been seeking excuses to explain away the difficulties of the farmers. The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Technical Services does the same thing. A year or two ago he said in the Free State that he wondered whether the farmers were not living too extravagantly.</p>

<p>I hope you will allow me to make a few remarks in regard to what hon. members opposite have said in connection with this very important legislation. In Clause 1 (a) of this amending Bill we find the following provision&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Or to defray any expenses incurred in connection with the carrying on of his farming operations.</block>

<p>This is agricultural financing and the making available for capital for agriculture. The hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) made a remark here and I am very sorry that he used the language which he did use because I do not think it becomes an English or Afrikaans-speaking person to murder a language in the way he did in this House. He said: &#x201C;the Government cannot throw up anything better through this Minister than this Bill&#x201D;. I hope that he will not murder the Afrikaans language in this way in the future. I deprecate the fact that language of this nature should be used in this House. I also want to make a remark in connection with what was said by the hon. member for Pietermaritzburg (District) (Capt. Henwood). He said that the farmers were unable to build up reserves because of the policy followed by the hon. the Minister and the Government. He did not enlarge upon it and tell us which commodity prices he wanted increased and to what extent they should be increased. He also very cleverly omitted to tell us what the reaction of the consumers would be to such increased prices. If he cannot tell us clearly to what extent the prices of agricultural products should be increased, then his argument falls away. The hollowness and emptiness of that argument of the United Party is quite obvious. It is simply intended to catch a few votes. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) continued in the same vein. He told us about a long-term solution to the problem but he did not give us any details in order to show us precisely what he meant by a long-term solution. He told us here about the increase in the liabilities of our farmers but he failed to tell the House how those liabilities had been increased&#x2014;whether they had been increased productively or unproductively. No, this sort of argument is one which a farmer despises. The farmer does not like this sort of honeyed political speech; the farmer wants the facts. The hon. the Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing has often said in this House and outside of this House that he is in favour of the highest possible price for any agricultural commodity, provided that price is determined by supply and demand and provided it is in the interests of the industry. I challenge the United Party to deny that an artificial increase in prices with the idea of keeping the farmer on the land will eventually harm the agricultural industry.</p>

<p>I think we in South Africa can be very thankful to-day that under these specific circumstances we have a Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing who has the interests of agriculture as much at heart as the present Minister has. This Bill which we have the privilege of discussing here this afternoon has been introduced for very specific reasons and I want to mention a few of the reasons why I think the hon. the Minister felt compelled to introduce this Bill and to pilot it through the House. In the first place, it is because he adopts an extremely sympathetic attitude towards the farmers, not because the farmers need sympathy for any particular reason but because of climatic conditions, and particularly, conditions in parts of the Free State and the Northern Transvaal which have been struck by dreadful droughts. These conditions have already been outlined to us in a masterly fashion by previous speakers on this side. It is for that reason that Act No. 48 of 1935 has to be amended in such a way that further assistance can be given to those farmers who need it. This is a further attempt to keep our farmers on the land by providing them with financial assistance where necessary. The United Party has tried to tell us that the hon. the Minister will be pleased if certain farmers leave the platteland. This Bill proves that the hon. the <span class="col_3967-3968" refersTo="page_0676"/>Minister wants to keep the farmer on the land. We have production and emergency loans and those loans too are intended not to remove the farmer from the platteland but to keep him on the platteland so that when climatic conditions improve, the farmers who are at present struggling under drought conditions can look forward to a brighter future.</p>

<p>The farmer is being given further protection in terms of Clause 6 which ensures that he will not be deprived of the agricultural implements which he purchases under a hire-purchase agreement when steps are taken against him in this regard. He will be able to retain his irrigation machines, his tractors, his lorries and so forth. In this connection I would like the hon. the Minister to give us the assurance that once the farmer has planted his crop he will be given the time to enjoy the fruits of his labours because, if he is deprived of those agricultural implements after he has used them to plant his crop but before he can enjoy the fruits of his labour, then I fear that the assistance given to him will not serve its purpose. I want to ask therefore that special steps be taken to enable the farmer not only to retain his farming equipment but also to reap the fruits of his labours. The amendments contained in this measure, seen in the light of the increase in the prices of maize, wheat, wool, rye and barley, and the sympathetic attitude of the hon. the Minister and of the officials in the State Advances Recoveries Office, will be heartily welcomed by our farmers. I want in passing to pay special tribute to the officials of the State Advances Recoveries Office for what they have done over the past few years to keep the farmers on the platteland. We are very grateful for the sympathetic treatment received from those officials. If it were not for the fact that they have faithfully carried out the policy of this Government, the percentage of farmers leaving the land would have been far greater. We want to pay tribute to those officials for their sympathetic treatment of the farmers.</p>

<p>It has been said here by hon. members of the United Party that things are going very badly with the farmers. In this connection I just want to quote a brief paragraph from the Annual Report of the Secretary for Agricultural Economics and Merketing for the period 1 July 1962 to 30 June 1963 (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Producers&#x2019; prices for agricultural products generally showed an average increase of about 3 per cent over the figure for the previous year. Of particular importance was the price increase which was apparent in the case of wool&#x2014;about 11 per cent.</block>

<p>But this is not the only agricultural product in connection with which there has been an increase in price. This is not the only proof that I can adduce to show that we are entering an era of higher prices. Let me quote a paragraph from the Report of the State Advances Recoveries Office for the year 1962-3. I am sure hon. members will agree that the picture for the year 1963-4 will be even more attractive than for the period 1962-3. Amongst other things, the Secretary to the State Advances Recoveries Office has this to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The reasonably stable wheat and dairy prices and increasing meat and wool prices enabled farmers generally to fulfill their financial obligations satisfactorily and kept the need for further financial assistance within reasonable limits.</block>

<p>This gives the lie to the statement made by hon. members on that side of the House that things are going so badly with the farmers. I accept that the persons who drew up these two reports based their statements on the actual position. We readily admit that problems are being experienced in certain sections of the agricultural industry but in the light of the increase in prices and in the light of the improved conditions we are hopeful that this position, as reflected in the report of the Secretary to the State Advances Recoveries Office, will improve in the near future. I refer to page 9 of that report and the heading &#x201C;Recovery of Loans&#x201D;. It appears from this report that there were 42,271 loans outstanding as at 31 March 1960 representing an amount of R23,557,452. As at 31 March 1963 there were 41,829 loans outstanding representing an amount of about R37,000,000, an increase, therefore, of about R14,000,000. But these debts cannot be regarded as unproductive debts. A large amount of this capital has been invested in stock and improvements and implements for the improvement of agriculture. The Opposition have failed hopelessly in their attempt to make the public suspicious of the efforts of the National Party and its Minister of Agricultural Economics and Marketing. If hon. members on that side consider all the facts they must agree with us that South Africa is in a very fortunate position notwithstanding the problems that we have to face.</p>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down has told the House that the farmers are in a &#x201C;gelukkige posisie&#x201D; and he says the Opposition will have to agree that that is so. Sir, I have never seen so much gloom on the faces of Government members as I have seen here to-day while this measure has been under discussion. Sir, you should have seen the smiles of relief when you stopped the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) from going further into the hardships which the farmers are suffering to-day.</p>

<p>Last night we gave our blessing to this Bill. We do support this Bill because it gives relief to the farmer. Sir, it is only a palliative but we support it because we come to the assistance of the farmers on every possible occasion; we are the only people who can assist the farmers.</p>

<p>By giving approval to the little that the Government does do. Sir, I think back to the days of 1945, 1946 and 1947. What was the position of the farmers in those days&#x003F; Everybody was rushing to buy farms; everybody was happy; the farmers were the lucky people. The Ministers were buying farms. They could not get enough farms in this country so the Minister of Agriculture himself went to Rhodesia to buy a farm. What has happened now&#x003F; Under this Minister the Prime Minister has sold his farm. The Minister of Transport has sold his farm and the Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions is selling his farm. I think he cannot sell his farm; he cannot find a buyer. They are giving up farming to-day. [Interjection.] Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister says that he sold his stock. He did it before he had to come to the Government for relief. The only member on the other side who looked at ease and quite happy during this debate was the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development. Having listened to the debates here he realizes why the farmers have asked the Prime Minister to make him Minister of Agriculture instead of the present Minister of Agriculture. The farmers want a Minister who will do something for them.</p>

<p>Sir, when we gave our blessings to this Bill yesterday afternoon Government members thought that we would have nothing to say. We did not intend to embarrass the Government any further on this issue. We made short speeches giving our blessing to this Bill, realizing that the farmers needed assistance and that this measure must be passed as quickly as possible to try to keep the farmers on the land. But then the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) thought he would play a little politics; he thought that we would not take part in the debate and he said that we had no farmers here who could take part in the debate. Sir, when we criticize other measures in this House we are accused of putting the outside world against South Africa; a little while ago when we criticized the shortage of housing the Minister of Housing said that we were putting immigrants off; that we are always trying to influence the outside world against South Africa. And when we give our blessing to this Bill we are attacked because we do not attack the Government. When we do come into this debate to-day and tell the Government why the farmers are in trouble, we are asked whether we are going to support this Bill. Sir, we have no alternative; we have to support this Bill because nothing else is being done for the farmers. If the Minister would come along with some long-term plan to help the farmers we would also give our approval to it. No matter what hon. members on the other side say they know as well as we do that the farmers are dissatisfied and that the farmers are demanding that some action be taken. They do not want these palliatives; they do not want this sort of assistance. The hon. member who has just sat down thanked the civil servants for their sympathy and for their loyalty to the Government.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>If it had not been for the civil servant I wonder what would have happened to the farmers, so hon. members are quite entitled to thank the civil servants for their sympathy. That is all the farmers are getting from this Government to-day&#x2014;sympathy. When this Government took over the farmers thought that they would get &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D;; what has happened to that so-called &#x201C;kragdadigheid&#x201D;&#x003F;</p>

<p>As I have said we support the principle of giving assistance to the farmers. But I want to deal with another principle in this Bill and that is the principle of giving security to the State for the loans made by it to the farmers. It is well known and accepted that if a farmer or anybody else is lent money the lender expects some security, and the normal way of giving security is by giving a mortgage bond over landed property. Those mortgage bonds are registered in our Deeds Office. Our system of deeds registry is the envy of the rest of the world; it is a system that we have worked out over the years, and the lawyers and the Deeds Office officials themselves are very jealous of the efficiency of the system that we have developed. But we find that inroads are continually being made into our system. A further inroad is being made into that system in this Bill. The normal method of getting security by way of a mortgage bond is for the borrower, the mortgagor, to execute a power of attorney authorizing his conveyancer to execute a deed before a registrar who then registers it; that is the normal procedure. In terms of Clause 8 of this Bill at will not be necessary for that to be done. The farmer will merely appear before the Magistrate and there he will sign a legal document in the form of a bond; this will be sent to the Registrar of Deeds where it will be registered. The point I want to make is that it is not executed, and under our law a bond which is registered in the Deeds Office is of no effect if it was not in fact executed by a conveyancer. I know that there are precedents for the method now proposed; I know that in terms of the Land Bank Act a conveyancer does not necessarily have to execute the deed. But I will say this as far as the Land Bank is concerned that they do follow the normal procedure; the bond is executed by an official of the Land Bank although he is not a conveyancer. When this system was first developed the Land Bank happened to have conveyancers in their employ who did the registration of the bonds. I know too that this system is adopted under the soil conservation laws and I know that relief was also given to soldiers by a war measure during the war. But the legal profession and the Deeds Registry officials have always objected to these inroads. They have quite rightly pointed out that once you allow one exception, that exception is used as a <span class="col_3971-3972" refersTo="page_0678"/>precedent and then further inroads are made. Sir, the law societies were not consulted by the Minister when this Bill was prepared. I think the least he could have done was to have consulted with the law societies, as the law societies were in fact consulted when previous Acts were put through &#x2026;</p>

<p>Are you talking now for the farmers&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>I will tell the hon. member in a moment why I am talking for the farmers. The law societies opposed these inroads and they are also opposed to this inroad into the system, because not only are we interfering here with the Deeds Office procedure but in the next clause we deal with the question of execution. It is the right of every citizen to go to court; borrowers are protected. Normally the lender cannot take the law into his own hands and execute against his bond if the borrower does not fulfil his obligations. The normal thing, of course, is for the lender to go to the court and sue the borrower and if the borrower has any defence he will appear before the court. Under Clause <i>liter</i> the State is now given the power to execute without going to court. The Sheriff will merely be notified that the borrower is in arrear, that he has not fulfilled his obligations for a period of 30 days and then the Sheriff can execute without any writ of execution; he then behaves as if he had received a writ. The Minister of Finance must be shocked when he hears what is happening in other Departments; he is a lawyer and he ought to know how wrong this is. Sir, I know that under the Land Bank Act the Land Bank also takes action without getting an order of court. The Land Bank is even worse because they do not even go to the Sheriff; they do it on their own. I will say this for this Minister&#x2019;s Department&#x2014; and I do not thank the Minister for this because I do not think he knows what is happening&#x2014;that they have not gone as far as the Land Bank. I say it is quite wrong for us to ignore the normal judicial procedure in this way. I suppose the excuse will be given that there are unnecessary delays; that the farmer leaves the land when he is in trouble and before they can execute against him the stock has depreciated in value and the implements have depreciated in value, and therefore they want to be able to act as soon as possible.</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I agree that it is a good reason. All I say is that if the Department had approached the legal profession and said, &#x201C;We are having this trouble; we cannot go through the courts quickly enough; we want to be able to act more quickly in order to protect our interests&#x201D;, the law societies would have worked out some scheme for the Department. We could have got together and we could have adhered to our Rule of Law and the normal judicial procedure, and we could still have given the Government protection. But, as I have said, the legal profession was ignored. We were not consulted at all on this matter. I appeal to the Minister and to other Ministers that in the future, before we make further inroads into our judicial system or into our system of deeds registration, the legal profession should be consulted and that an endeavour should be made to get the legal profession to help the Department to adhere to our normal judicial procedure and to our normal method of registering deeds.</p>

<p>I want to thank hon. members on both sides of the House for their support of this Bill. Some of them have shown their support in strange ways. Every member had his own way of saying that he supported this Bill. I said at the outset that the idea of this Bill was more specifically to facilitate the giving of assistance under the State Advances Recoveries Act and the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act. Over the past day or two we have had a long discussion on what has actually been done for the farmers in terms of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act and the State Advances Recoveries Act. Mr. Speaker, we have had some strange speeches here. As far as the Opposition are concerned, the hon. member for King William&#x2019;s Town (Mr. Warren) said that he would support this Bill. He asked one question to which I would like to reply. He asked whether immigrants entering the country could also be assisted under the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act and the State Advances Recoveries Act. I just want to give him the assurance that any <i>bona fide</i> farmer farming in South Africa can be given assistance under those two Acts even though he is an immigrant. Immigrants have often been assisted under these two Acts in the past. I think the hon. member was trying to find out whether immigrants can be assisted in terms of these Acts as far as the purchase of land is concerned. In the first place, that is not the function of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board; it is more specifically the function of the Land Bank. The Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board is there to provide assistance in those cases where farmers who are already on the land experience financial difficulties.</p>

<p>The discussion on this Bill has covered a very wide field; it has covered a far wider field than the contents of this Bill. I want to reply briefly to the remarks made by hon. members opposite in connection with the way in which the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act and the State Advances Recoveries Act are being administered and the way in which funds are being made available. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) contended that the drought conditions were not responsible for the difficulties of the farmers; he said that there were other economic circumstances which caused the farmers to find themselves in trouble.</p>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>There are always economic conditions, of course, which cause the farmers to find themselves in difficulties, and there are many reasons for that. Unfortunately, the hon. member used a very poor example. He said that the sheep farmers, for example, were not experiencing difficulties because the price of wool was high but that the farmers in the Free State and in other parts were experiencing difficulties. Sir, the hon. member does not know what he is talking about if he makes an allegation of that kind. During the financial year 1962-3, 780 monthly fodder loans to an amount of R393,000 were made available to farmers in the Karoo. In the Transvaal, where drought conditions also prevailed, the amount made available to 284 farmers was R64,000 over the same period.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>That is not the point; the argument which the hon. member used was that assistance should be given because wheat prices were low. He said that it was not necessary to assist the wool farmer because wool prices were high. He drew a distinction between prices, not between farmers, and I want to give him some figures in this regard. During 1962-3, 95 loans amounting to R899,000 were granted in the Karoo alone under the special assistance scheme. The main reason for this was the drought. The hon. member tried to prove that grain prices were too low and that it was because of this fact that those people found themselves in difficulty. He added that the wool farmers were not experiencing the same difficulty because wool prices were high.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I want to mention a few figures to prove that in the first instance our farmers find themselves in difficulties as a result of climatic conditions. That is the main reason. There are also other factors. In many cases incompetence on the part of the farmer is also a factor but economic factors also play their part. If hon. members make an analysis of the areas in which this assistance is given, they will see that it is given chiefly in those areas which are subject to periodical droughts. Obviously, the grain producer is hit far harder than the person farming with stock because the grain farmer incurs great expense in producing his crop whereas the stock farmer does not have the same expenditure. If the grain farmer has a poor harvest or no harvest at all he not only loses his income or a portion of it but he also loses the money which he has spent in trying to obtain that income, with the result that in times of drought he finds himself in difficulty far sooner than the stock farmer does.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the hon. member for East London (City) (Dr. Moolman) that rudeness has never been a characteristic to be proud of; still less is meanness a characteristic to be proud of. I just want to tell the hon. member that I think his remark here this afternoon that this Government could not &#x201C;throw up anything better than this Minister&#x201D;, was a reprehensible one. I am quite prepared to leave it to the farmers of South Africa to decide whether I am fulfilling my function as Minister satisfactorily or otherwise. I am quite prepared to leave it to the farmers of South Africa to judge the hon. member for East London (City) who served them for a long period. They have already reacted in his case; they have already made their decision.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>I did not want to take any notice of him this afternoon because of his mean remark but I find myself in this difficult position that it is sometimes difficult for one not to take notice of certain remarks. I find myself in the position to-day of being compelled to take notice of the hon. member. The hon. member for East London (City) said that nothing was being done in this country for the farmers who were in difficulties or who were suffering under drought conditions. He drew a comparison between what we were doing here and what was being done in Rhodesia, our neighbouring state. Apparently the hon. member has two kinds of farming in mind. He apparently has only cattle farming and sheep farming in mind, but we do not farm only with cattle and sheep in South Africa. Wheat is also produced in the areas to which the hon. member referred and loans are available to the farmers in those areas. I should like now to analyse the solution suggested by the hon. member. He says that in Rhodesia the farmers do not pay for the oxen which they buy, nor do they pay any interest <span class="col_3975-3976" refersTo="page_0680"/>on the purchase price. He says that the original purchase price and interest are deducted when they deliver oxen to the commission to be sold, and that the farmers therefore do not pay back the capital or the interest. But that is precisely what we are doing through the medium of the State Advances Recoveries Office. We give the farmer a loan to produce maize. If he has a crop for sale at the end of the year, we deduct the amount of the loan and the interest and then pay him the balance. That is precisely the same principle. I cannot understand therefore how the hon. member makes such a comparison. But he went very much further. When foot-andmouth disease broke out during the drought in the Transvaal we gave loans to the farmers in order to enable them to keep their stock alive. When they eventually sold their stock, we deducted the purchase price. Because they had to contend with both a drought and foot-and-mouth disease, we went even further; we wrote off 20 per cent of that loan. The hon. member makes these accusations which he simply sucks out of his thumb. What is the solution offered by the hon. member&#x003F; He says that we must not give these people money to buy fodder. We must not give them money to feed their stock or to transport their stock; we must lend money to the farmers in the areas in which they are doing well to enable them to buy the stock of the farmers in the drought-stricken areas. Let us assume that the hon. member is a sheep farmer in the Karoo, that there is a drought in that area, and that he has built up a fine herd which is dying because of the drought. What will he do if we come along and say to him: &#x201C;You have a drought on your farm; we will lend money to somebody else to enable him to buy your stock so that you will have no stock left on your farm&#x201D;&#x003F; That would be a short-sighted policy. We must help the farmers to keep their stock on their farms; we must help them to obtain stock so that at a later stage they will not be compelled to purchase stock at very high prices. The hon. member wanted to know why I had not done this long ago.</p>

<p>Our country cannot be compared with Rhodesia. We have our own marketing system. Most of our beef is consumed locally and the local market price is a guaranteed price.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS AND MARKETING</person>:</from>

<p>Very well. If the farmers think that a drought is imminent and they want to sell their stock, there is nothing to prevent them from doing so. Nor is there anything to prevent a farmer from buying stock in a drought-stricken area, fattening the stock and then marketing them. That is done every day. That is the stupid kind of solution which the hon. member suggests and the stupid kind of criticism that he puts forward. I want to point out to the hon. member that in the first instance the farmers in the drought-stricken areas, both sheep and cattle farmers want to be able to retain their stock and they want assistance to enable them to do so. But it does not help to tell a man who is producing wheat in a drought-stricken area that he should sell his wheat to somebody else living in an area with a good rainfall! That farmer has to be assisted to enable him to produce wheat again in the future and that is what is being done on a very large scale. This assistance has been placed on a permament basis whereas that was not the case previously. Loans have been increased, not only loans for the purchase of stock but also stock-feed loans. The loans for production purposes have also been increased because we realize that many parts of our country are experiencing very difficult conditions indeed. It will not help to exploit those conditions and to try to make political capital out of them. It will not help to do so because our farmers have sufficient common sense to realize that the assistance which they are receiving from the Government to-day is superior to any other assistance that they have ever received, except that given to them after the 1933 drought.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). The hon. member referred to the arrangement which we are now making whereby the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board will be able to register bonds. Of course it still has to be done in terms of the Deeds Act and most of the cases dealt with by the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Board are cases of people who are not financially strong. They are people who are unable to obtain credit elsewhere; in most cases they are no longer in a position to raise credit through the usual channels. The hon. member has told us how sorry the United Party is for the farmers in the drought-stricken areas. But in spite of all his sympathy he still wants those few cents that he can make out of them as an attorney! These amendments that we are proposing will make it possible for us not only to take action more quickly and more easily but will also save the farmer who is in need of financial assistance the expense of having his bond registered.</p>

<p>Hon. members have covered a very wide field in the debate on this Bill and I want once again to express my thanks to those who have given their support to this measure. At the same time I want to express the hope that the efforts that we are making here to streamline and facilitate the operation of the Farmers&#x2019; Assistance Act will be to the advantage of our farmers, particularly that group of farmers who are not able to obtain credit through the usual channels. We hope to be able not only to give better protection to the taxpayer&#x2019;s money which is invested by the State in these loans but also to assist the farmer more effectively in the future.</p>

<p>asked the Acting Minister of Economic Affairs:</p>

<block name="quote">Whether he intends to make a statement in regard to the price of petrol; if so, when; and, if not, why not.</block>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_social_welfare_and_pensions" to="#gorshel">

<from>The MINISTER OF SOCIAL WELFARE AND PENSIONS:</from>

<p>I presume that the hon. member is referring to a statement on the price of petrol in consequence of the reduction in railage which became operative as from 1 April 1964 and not to a general statement on this matter.</p>

<p>As announced by the hon. the Minister of Railways, the railage on petrol was reduced by an average of 1c per gallon, as from 1 April. The reduction is being implemented on a variable basis according to the existing pattern followed for the distribution of petrol, and will have the result, in general, that the reduction in railage on stocks carried over short distances will be less than on stocks carried over longer distances. Thus, for example, the reduction in railage on stocks carried 30 miles is one-tenth of a cent per gallon, while on stocks carried 320 miles from the coast it is 1c and on stocks carried 720 miles 1.6c per gallon. The same basis is applied in the case of an increase in railage.</p>

<p>Appreciable stocks of petrol are, of course, in the country, which were carried by the South African Railways prior to 1 April and on which the higher railage had been collected. The price of petrol in the interior can, therefore, not be reduced until such time as these stocks have been consumed, when a reduction in price will be introduced. It has been decided, in consultation with the petrol companies, that this reduction will become operative as from 20 April 1964.</p>

<p>In view of the special circumstances applying to road motor transport of petrol from Mossel Bay and Port Elizabeth the reduction in transport costs on these stocks will be introduced simultaneously with the reduction in price, i.e. on 20 April.</p>

<p>I wish to add that the procedure followed in the case of a reduction in prices also applies in the case of increases thereof.</p>

<answer by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs" to="#suzman">

<from>The MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS:</from>

<p>(1) and (2) Since 26 June 1962, when I met the Council for Coloured Affairs for the first time in connection with the proposed expansion of the council, repeated discussions took place between the Department of Coloured Affairs, the council and the council&#x2019;s legal adviser in regard to the contents of the proposed Bill.A special meeting of the council was called on 24 February 1964 in order to consider the final form in which the Bill had been formulated. On that occasion the council&#x2019;s legal adviser and departmental officials were present. A unanimous resolution by the council has been minuted in the council&#x2019;s minutes in which approval was accorded to the contents of the proposed Bill. I accordingly requested permission for introducing the Bill in Parliament, and the first reading took place the next day.</p>

<p>Since 25 February 1964 till 24 March 1964 the printed Bill was accordingly available to all councillors as well as the public and the Press.</p>

<p>On 25 March 1964 I attended the meeting of the council and gave councillors the opportunity to broach any matter in regard <span class="col_3985-3986" refersTo="page_0685"/> to which they wished to negotiate with me, but the question concerning the contents of the Bill was not raised by any of them, not even at the conclusion of the proceedings when I thanked them for the manner in which they had co-operated to finalize the Bill. Only the next day after some of the councillors had already left, a resolution was passed with 10 votes to 6 (with five abstainees), to request an interview with me.</p>

<p>The nature of the representations evidently has a bearing on the interpretation given to Clause 21 (2) of the Bill.</p>

<question by="#hourquebie" to="#acting_minister_of_economic_affairs">

<heading>Question:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether his attention has been drawn to a statement reported to have been made by the President of the South African Wholesale Textile Associationat the annual meeting of the association in regard to anticipated increases in the prices of shirts, blouses and pyjamas as a result of protection to be accorded by the Government to the Cyril Lord textile factory near East London; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will make a statement in regard to the matter.

</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#acting_minister_of_economic_affairs" to="#hourquebie">

<heading>Reply:</heading>

<ol>

<li>(1) Yes.</li>

<li>(2) The President of the South African Wholesale Textile Association has made certain statements about anticipated increases in the prices of shirts, blouses and pyjamas which may result from the tariff protection to be accorded to Cyril Lord and other local processors of grey cloth. I am, of course, not in a position to say how these anticipated price increases were calculated, but can only assure the hon. member that the anticipated price increases quoted by Mr. Mauerberger are substantially exaggerated. In this connection I would refer the hon. member to columns 3740 and 3741 of Hansard containing a statement which the hon. the Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs made on the subject in this House on 25 March of this year.</li>

</ol>

<p>In his statement the President of the South African Wholesale Textile Association has also expressed the fear that Cyril Lord may monopolize the market. In this connection I would remind the hon. member that between 40,000,000 and 50,000,000 yards of grey cloth are at present being used in the country, and that the market is expanding rapidly. It is highly improbable, on account of capital and other requirements for the manufacture of textiles, that one manufacturer alone would be able to monopolize an expanding market of such proportions.</p>

<p>The existing quotas for the importation of grey cloth for purposes of processing into poplin and other related cloths are shared by six different manufacturers, and Cyril Lord&#x2019;s share only amounts to approximately 50 per cent of the total allocation. However, even if the improbable should happen and Cyril Lord should become the sole supplier of grey cloth, this in itself would not constitute a valid reason for withholding protection from that undertaking. There are numerous other similar cases in which protection has been afforded to individual manufacturers which supply the whole or a predominant portion of the raw material requirements of other industries. The withholding of tariff protection to such sole or predominant suppliers of the raw material requirements of individual industries would seriously retard the <span class="col_3987-3988" refersTo="page_0686"/>country&#x2019;s economic growth, and as long as the Government is in a position to counter monopolistic tendencies on the part of such suppliers of essential materials by allowing import competition to a reasonable extent and by action in terms of the Regulation of Monopolistic Conditions Act, 1955, there would be no justification for discriminating against them in the application of the Government&#x2019;s policy of selective tariff protection.</p>

<heading>COLOURED PERSONS REPRESENTATIVE COUNCIL BILL</heading>

<p>First Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Coloured Persons Representative Council Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_coloured_affairs">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF COLOURED AFFAIRS</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, every person in South Africa with enough patriotism and sense of proportion realizes that race relations must continuously be handled in a spirit of goodwill and sympathy. But everybody who is patriotic and knows our country and realizes its problems also realizes that that sympathy and goodwill cannot be achieved by a mere throwing together of the various population groups in an attempt to create one nation in South Africa. There are differences&#x2014;whether on historical, colour or biological grounds&#x2014;which have to be borne in mind. And therefore everybody who wants to make a contribution towards good relations between the various communities must recognize, accept and bear these differences in mind when plans are made to deal with this matter in the future.</p>

<p>It is therefore my firm conviction that we should seek the welfare and progress of our country not in a deadly uniformity but in a diversity, a variety, in which every population group may, in so far as is practicable, reach full maturity. And in this diversity we must make it possible for a common allegiance to South Africa to be a binding force.</p>

<p>But after having accepted the principle of diversity, a second principle should also be accepted. There should be proper channels and means for consultation between the various population groups. However, in this regard I must reject the standpoint that the only basis for proper consultation and goodwill is an equal franchise on the same Voters&#x2019; Roll. We have seen too much in recent years how the practical application of this standpoint has led to the destruction of democracy and freedom in so many countries in regard to which the sentimentalists were formerly very enthusiastic but now increasingly keep silent. There is nothing wrong with the principle of one man, one vote, as long as it is exercised within the circle of the rights of a particular community or nation. But when the principle of one man, one vote is applied as the final determining factor for the future of more than one people who are intermingled in an unnatural manner in the same country, in spite of the differences, one of two results ensues. Ether the economically stronger of the relevant population groups applies discriminating measures to curtail the voting power of the weaker group, as was the case in South Africa for many years with the so-called Common Roll for Whites, Coloureds and Bantu, particularly because in this case the economically weaker groups would have had the numerical advantage&#x2014;we know how the prescribed qualifications were intended from time to time to curtail the so-called &#x201C;blanket&#x201D; vote&#x2014;or, alternatively, if such obviously artificial arrangements no longer work effectively, bitterness and strife and hatred arise which lead to the numerically stronger sections eventually assuming the dominant position and the minority disappearing without any thought being devoted to their rights. Has Africa not seen this process in full swing in recent times&#x003F;</p>

<p>Therefore other ways of consultation have to be sought. But apart from the principle of seeking goodwill and consultation, every patriot also recognizes the undoubted right of the Whites to remain living in South Africa as a nation in its own right. And that does not mean that the White man in South Africa claims this right just for the present and is prepared gradually to retreat and to follow a policy of surrender. Therefore in any arrangements arrived at between the various population groups, we should bear in mind the undoubted right to continued existence of the White man. And the safety and good order and progress of South Africa as a State with a Christian character are closely dependent on the continued existence of this White nation with its strong position of power in Southern Africa. The continued existence of the White man is also the best guarantee for the safety and progress of the Coloureds as a minority group in the area of White South Africa.</p>

<p>I make this statement, Mr. Speaker, because I am one of those who basically believe that there can be no permanent home or any permanence, for even a section of the Bantu in the area of White South Africa. In other <span class="col_3995-3996" refersTo="page_0690"/>words, White South Africa must gradually free itself from the possibility of a Black proletariat gaining a hold over its economic future, because otherwise this urbanized Black proletariat will, by means of intermingling with the Coloureds, achieve a position of power over the whole of South Africa. The argument is sometimes advanced that the Coloureds, of all the non-White population groups, are nearest to the Whites, and because they have not a homeland of their own, like the Bantu, they must gradually be absorbed into the White community and that a start should be made with political integration. In passing I just want to point out that when such people talk about the Coloureds they, of course, omit to mention that there are various groups of Coloureds. There is the Cape Coloured, there is the Malay, there is the Griqua, and there are various other subgroups, a fact which leads to prejudice and conflict among the Coloureds. However, I do not wish to deal with this argument at length, but have we not tried this course for almost a century&#x003F; And what was the result of the arrangement made in 1854&#x003F; In the political sphere it resulted in the greatest bitterness between the Coloureds and a very large section of the White population. But nowhere did the developing Coloured become a mayor or a Member of Parliament. The few who were elected to the Cape Provincial Council were frustrated people. Did these so-called equal rights lead to socio-economic progress&#x003F; Or did the masses of the Coloureds have to wait for the new era of parallel development in order to make the progress they are experiencing to-day in regard to housing, education and assistance through their own corporation&#x003F;</p>

<p>The number of Coloureds (including Malays and Griquas), men and women, in the Republic above the age of 21 years is approximately 582,000. If the illiterates are left out of account, the number is approximately 350,000. If the supposition is correct that 85 per cent of the literates could register on the basis of the present qualifications demanded, at least 296,000 could be placed on a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll in the whole of the Republic.</p>

<p>Furthermore the fact should be taken into consideration that the Coloureds in general are concentrated in certain areas, particularly in the Western Cape. The result will be that if they are placed on the Common Roll they will have a voting power out of all proportion to their numerical strength and will be able to dominate a number of constituencies. In view of the experience gained in the past, I cannot imagine a greater factor for the destruction of good relations between the Whites and the Coloureds than such a state of affairs.</p>

<p>Yes, as the Minister of Lands says, also between Whites and Whites. And along with that will disappear also a proper basis for consultation. But do the protagonists of such a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll realize to what extent they will then open the door for the urbanized Bantu in this way to share in that Common Roll&#x003F;</p>

<p>I now want to say a few words in regard to a second argument which is often used in the search for a solution, viz. the question of direct representation. Certain circles sometimes take the line that the Coloured population should be represented by Coloureds in Parliament. The basis on which that can be done can surely be moral only if it bears in mind the numbers of enfranchised Coloureds in relation to the Whites. The question therefore immediately arises whether such representation takes into consideration the present number of 582,000 Coloureds, men and women, above the age of 21-years. The Government, and I as the responsible Minister, would be acting irresponsibly if we were to seek good race relations and means for consultation along this road.</p>

<p>Therefore no political party which has the interests of White South Africa at heart and believes in the happiness and prosperity of our country along the road of diversity and variety can adopt the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll or the principle of direct representation as a solution.</p>

<p>I should now briefly like to state another proposition as the background for the measure I am trying to advocate, a proposition in which I believe, and the truth of which I think can be proved from our history:</p>

<block name="quote">No arrangement in respect of a nation&#x2019;s political course of development is cast in final form at any particular period. A nation is a living organism which from time to time undergoes new processes of development. Where we therefore have four main population groups in Southern Africa, viz. Whites, Coloureds, Indians and Bantu, we shall from time to time have to examine our instruments for mutual consultation and revise them as South Africa and its various peoples develop on the basis of diversity and their differences from each other.</block>

<p>I want to say a few more words about the present measure and its background. In 1943 and thereafter we had, in respect of the Coloureds, the Coloured Advisory Council, known as the C.A.C. The object at the time was this, and I quote from a report by the then Secretary for Social Welfare, Mr. Kuske:</p>

<block name="quote">The main functions of the council are to advise the Government and to be available for consultation in regard to all matters affecting the economic, constitutional and social interests of the Coloured population.</block>

<p>Much success was not achieved by this Advisory Council, and it died an early death, and it did so in a fairly unpleasant atmosphere. But it should not be forgotten that at the time when that council was established it <span class="col_3997-3998" refersTo="page_0691"/>was a nominated council, and the system of the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll was still in force. In spite of the power the Coloured had through that Voters&#x2019; Roll and the representation he had in this Parliament together with the White man, in spite of the fact that the Coloureds were registered by the thousands, particularly in Western Cape constituencies, and in spite of the fact that this was an element in the policy of integrated political rights and equality, the then Government, which was a supporter of the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, considered it necessary by means of a separate Coloured Council to do something to enable the Government to be advised in regard to the economic, constitutional and social interests of the Coloured population. In other words, as such it was a condemnation of the existing system, in the sense that the existing system was not considered effective to advise the Government on economic, constitutional and social aspects, and not only was it a condemnation of it, but it was a further admission that this representation which the Coloureds had was inadequate, and that the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll in practice did not have the desired effect. In addition, it should be remembered that this admission should be added to the situation then already existing, that a large section of the White population felt bitter towards the Coloured population because of the existence of that Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, and that there was bitterness between the Whites themselves as the result of that position. In other words, in 1943 already the then Government admitted in so many words that the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll was not effective. Or why else did they establish this council&#x003F;</p>

<p>The next step was taken by this Government with the legislation of 1951, and I should like to quote what the then Minister of the Interior said in regard to the Union Council. He first pointed out that some of the members of the council would be elected, and then he continued to say (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The second respect in which it differs from the previous council is that this council will not merely have an advisory function. Provision is made, as hon. members will see in the Bill, for them to perform certain administrative functions also. My thoughts as to what those specific functions will be have not been crystallized yet, but I want to leave the opening for it, and the opening is left there, and I hope that by means of this council itself, and through the Commissioner of Coloured Affairs, we will get ideas which can be applied in order to give this council some measure of administrative powers and functions also.</block>

<p>The first council, after 1948, was constituted during 1959, and originally this council was treated with contempt in certain circles, and attempts were even made to, belittle it. I can remember, and I shall prove it if necessary, that when this council was established it was said, <i>inter alia,</i> that they were a lot of Government stooges who would only agree with what the Minister said. It was said that a lot of inferior people were taken from the Coloured community and appointed to this council; there was reference to a lot of unknown Quislings who had to assist in justifying the suppressive policy of this Government. If necessary, I can prove this. And to-day&#x003F; The same people who at that time belittled this council, who accused the members of the council of being a lot of inferior Quislings and who said that they were the stooges of the Government, have all changed their minds to-day to such an extent that every day there are attempts to play this council off against the Minister concerned, and people actually fall over themselves in their attempts to get hold of these councillors before their meetings and to tell them what resolutions they should adopt against the Government. Now they have become important.</p>

<p>If hon. members would like to have these extracts, I shall give them to hon. members when I reply. In other words, where the former council under the previous Government failed, this council which was born in an atmosphere of the greatest scepticism and unbelief gradually, in spite of its defects, achieved such status that people are beginning to laud it to-day, and it is being lauded by the very people who condemned it.</p>

<p>In the second place, the past five years also constituted valuable schooling for some of the members on the council in the sphere of public administration, and to-day this council fulfils a real need as a point of contact and a consultative organ in respect of the particular needs of the Coloured community.</p>

<p>That does not mean that at all times there is agreement in regard to standpoint between the council and the Minister concerned or other Ministers; it does not mean that we see eye to eye at all times. There have often been occasions when this council has adopted resolutions in respect of which I strongly differed from them, but it at least gave us the opportunity to discuss matters and to exchange ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>That is why the third step could be taken. The first step was the one taken by the previous Government, and which resulted in failure; we took the second step after 1948, and then the third step could be taken in 1960 when the hon. the Prime Minister on <span class="col_3999-4000" refersTo="page_0692"/>7 December 1960 announced a further developmental step in regard to this council and said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The object is that the steadily increasing status and authority in respect of all matters affecting Coloureds right throughout the Republic should develop.</block>

<p>The Prime Minister, when he met this council, tried to give them a picture for the future in regard to the directions in which the Government believed that this council should develop. Thereafter I met the council on 26 June 1961 and gave them the opportunity themselves to make suggestions in connection with their development and reorganization. At their request, legal advisers, selected by themselves, were made available to them. The result was that the council in the beginning of 1963 submitted a memorandum to the Cabinet containing proposals affecting the future. I do not want to quote that memorandum now, but it amounted to this, that the number of elected members should be increased, that provision should also be made for such members in the other provinces, and that the four provinces should have greater representation on the council, that the franchise should be on a different basis, that the council should be given certain extra functions which it hitherto did not have, and that there were definite directions in which attempts had to be made to give the Coloureds a greater share in arranging their own lives.</p>

<p>Since 1961 further negotiations took place from time to time, with committees of the council and with the full council, but I as Minister was not present on a single one of these occasions. I consistently refrained from taking part in the discussions. I left it to the council and to the departmental officials and to the council&#x2019;s legal adviser to come to final decisions.</p>

<p>I now come to the Bill as such. Hon. members will agree that this Bill is easily read and gives a clear picture of what is envisaged. As is customary, I will on this occasion refer only to the more important provisions of the measure.</p>

<p>If I were to summarize the objects of the Bill, I should say they were the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A constitution for the establishment of a representative Coloured council for the Republic which, with its executive committee, can be the mouthpiece of the Coloured population; which can serve as a means of consultation between the Republican Government and the Coloured population, and can serve as an instrument by means of which Coloured leaders in the spheres of local government, education, communal welfare and rural areas can lead and serve their community.</block>

<p>The first 12 clauses of the Bill deal with how the council is to be constituted, viz. a majority of elected members and a minority of nominated members. The basis on which the election takes place is the general franchise of men and women above the age of 21 years.</p>

<p>As I said in my introductory words, there can be no objection to the principle of one man, one vote if it applies to a population group and within its own circle. There can only be objection to the principle of one man, one vote if it means that the &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; of other population groups is used to decide the fate of a particular population group, in this case the Whites, whose existence in this country guarantees the safety also of the other groups.</p>

<p>I think that the present Union Coloured Advisory Council approved of the basis of the franchise, as I have stated it, because there is not yet compulsory education for Coloureds everywhere and the age of 18 years would therefore be less acceptable as a qualification for the franchise. I personally do not feel strongly on this subject in regard to whether the age should be 18 or 21 years. It was their suggestion that it should be 21 years.</p>

<p>I would further draw attention to the fact that the registration of voters will be done on a voluntary basis. That may contribute towards eliminating undesirable elements, or limiting them to a minimum, and towards giving the Coloured who is really interested in the working of his council an opportunity to register. It is nevertheless a broader basis for the granting of the franchise than the Coloured has ever before had in the history of South Africa.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 8, I must point out that the present council made the suggestion after carefully considering the various population figures of Coloureds in the various provinces. In the original memorandum they advanced their arguments and asked that there should be as little deviation as possible from the basis laid down in the Bill because they regard it as a reasonable basis. I also think that we have succeeded in obtaining a reasonable basis.</p>

<p>Fourthly, I must draw hon. members&#x2019; attention to the provisions in regard to the executive committee, as contained in Clauses 17 and 20, and also the provisions of Clause 21, by which legislative powers can be entrusted to the council. I make no secret of the fact that this can be done and that a specific course was adopted in regard to granting those rights because, as I shall show later, it will take an appreciable time before this council can be established. At this stage it is not wise to specify what legislative power they will have, or the form it should take. One must only create the means whereby one can grant those legislative powers in the light of the prevailing circumstances. It is a process of emancipation; it is a process which must follow on consultation and negotiation. It is not a process which can just take place holus bolus. It has been said that one should never try to do more for a person or a population group than they are prepared to do for themselves, and with <span class="col_4001-4002" refersTo="page_0693"/>this proposal, I think, we have the precautionary measure that we shall not be doing more for the Coloured population than they are prepared to do for themselves. As long as I remain the Minister, that will remain the policy, and they will have to show signs of initiative, of a sense of responsibility, of a willingness to serve, of faith in their own people; they will have to show signs that they are trying to escape from the misery and the difficulties of their own masses, before they receive responsibility from me.</p>

<p>This process of the granting of a greater measure of control over matters affecting them directly is gradually being made possible by these clauses and are so formulated as to ensure that there will be consultation in regard to every step taken.</p>

<p>Now I just want to say at this stage that since the Bill was published I have had consultations with the four Administrators of the provinces on other matters, and they pointed out to me a defect in the existing Bill, viz. that it is not stated clearly that when powers at present held by the provinces are possibly transferred, that should also be done in consultation with the Administrator concerned. I have consequently agreed to add a further provision in Clause 21 in which it is stated clearly that there will also be consultation with the four Administrators, if necessary.</p>

<p>A further provision deals with the funds which the council will require to exercise its powers, and for their proper control. The accounts of the council will be subject to audit by the Controller and Auditor-General.</p>

<p>Further, provision is made for proper Standing Orders for this council, and that members must take a solemn oath or declaration in regard to their duties. That is contained in Clauses 26 and 27. I think it is one of the defects of the present council that the chairman is really powerless to keep proper order. I think we should see to it that the chairman is able to uphold the dignity of the council and maintain order, and that certain obligations will rest on the members of that council, so that when they speak there they will do it in such a way that they do not do more harm than good to their population group, because these proceedings of the council will be held in public. It is not the intention to exclude the Press. But then there will have to be proper rules of procedure to ensure that this council acts in such a way that it does not make a fool of itself and cast ridicule on us. [Laughter.] It seems to me that there are hon. members who would prefer that there should be no rules of procedure.</p>

<p>There are also a number of clauses in terms of which the authority of the State President, Parliament and other authorities are recognized and placed beyond all doubt (Clauses 17, 21 and 23).</p>

<p>I have already said that an appreciable time will have to elapse before all the work in connection with the registration of voters and the delimitation of constituencies can be completed and the proper functioning of the council can be made possible. Therefore the Bill provides that the term of office of the present councillors can be extended to bridge this period of preparation. I do not want to bind myself to a date, but this preparatory work must be done by the Department of the Interior, and the registration has to be finalized and Voters&#x2019; Rolls have to be drawn up and there must be delimitation, for which provision is made in the Bill, and I cannot see how this council can really be established before late in 1966, at the earliest. Therefore provision is made that use may be made of the present councillors for purposes of consultation during the transition stage.</p>

<p>Now an idea was expressed, <i>inter alia,</i> by the council itself that provision should be made in the Bill for the establishment of a standing select committee of both Houses of Parliament which in turn could consult with the Executive Committee of the Coloured Council in regard to proposed legislation affecting the Coloured population. The Government gave thorough consideration to this proposal, but after due consideration this proposal was not adopted because Parliament, of its own free will, can appoint a select committee whenever it considers it necessary to do so. To lay down such a procedure in legislation will, in our opinion, be wrong and in conflict with the spirit of Parliament. It was felt that instead of that proposal there should rather be another provision, which was in fact inserted in Clause 20 (3) and (4). In terms of that clause, a very specific opportunity is created for the council to consult not only with the particular Minister entrusted with their affairs, but that they will have access through that Minister to all other Ministers in the Cabinet. That is regarded as a much better form of consultation, because it can take place at the highest level.</p>

<p>Finally, the hon. the Prime Minister has repeatedly in the past referred to the possibility and the desirability of providing instruments on the basis of a four-stream policy which will make consultation possible on matters of common interest on the Commonwealth principle between Whites, Coloureds, Bantu and Indians. Thus each population group retains its rights in its own circle. This Bill is a further step towards making it possible for the Coloured population as a minority group also to have a share in the essential consultation. South Africa&#x2019;s racial constitution offers no easy solution. Nowhere in the world is there an easy solution for racial relations. Nowhere in the world have we ever had an example of any other plan in regard to race relations having succeeded. Only one pattern has been successful, and that is the elimination of the minority group by the majority group. In the most civilized countries of the world colour and biological <span class="col_4003-4004" refersTo="page_0694"/>differences and historical differences play a role between the various races and their relations with one another. Therefore South Africa cannot go to the outside world in its search for a solution of its difficult problem, and in addition its problem is unique in the sense that here we have a minority group which is a nation in its own right, the Whites, and that nation is the protector of the rights of the other population groups. We find ourselves in unique circumstances. Therefore we must have the courage to seek our own solution. This is a serious attempt along the road which we regard as the only possible one, the road of neighbourliness with diversity and the recognition of each section&#x2019;s rights in its own circle, the preservation of the rights of the Whites, but also the right of emancipation for those who are under our tutelage and who must be taught to assume greater responsibilities towards their own people.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill is another step on the road of separate development, the policy of this Government, a policy with which we do not agree. This policy is harmful to the good relations of the two sections, the Coloureds and the Whites in this country, good relations which have existed for a very long period. It is only since the present Government has come into power that those relations have been disturbed. The hon. the Minister stated here that there was bitterness between the Whites and the Coloureds and even between the Whites themselves when the Coloureds were on the Common Roll. But the Coloured people were on the Common Roll for a century and for the greater part of that time there was no bitterness whatsoever. Even in the days of the old Nationalist Party under General Hertzog there was no bitterness at all.</p>

<p>I make bold to say that bitterness did not exist on the part of General Hertzog and his party against the Coloured people, and why&#x003F; Because in those days the Coloured people voted for the Nationalist Party as well as for the old S.A. Party. We remember the days when the Coloureds voted Mr. Bruckner de Villiers into Parliament and the S.A. Party had no bitterness against the Coloureds on account of that. This policy, Mr. Speaker, is harmful and will further deteriorate the good relations that have always existed between the two sections, and under no circumstances can we support this Bill.</p>

<p>When this debate was adjourned a few weeks ago, I had told the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) that his allegation that a large number of our tourists did not consist of holidaymakers was not correct. I am sorry the hon. member is not present to-day because I should like to reply to that point. I wish to draw his attention to the fact that there is an international definition of who can be regarded as a tourist, a definition which has been accepted by a committee of experts of the old League of Nations and which is to-day accepted by the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development, the so-called O.E.C.D. As the hon. member knows, not only Europe but Canada and the U.S.A. are members of that organization. That definition which is to-day universally accepted reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Any person visiting a country other than that in which he normally resides for a period of at least 24 hours. The following are considered as tourists:</block>

<ol>

<li>(a) Persons travelling on holiday or for family or health reasons, etc.;</li>

<from><span class="col_4005-4006" refersTo="page_0695"/>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER WALT</person>:</from>

<p>I want to point out that the hon. member is wrong and that notwithstanding this current definition the majority of our tourists to-day are in fact holiday-makers. If he looks at the report of the Tourist Corporation he will notice that we had 166,102 tourists from Africa in 1962 of whom 135,295 were holiday-makers. There were 27,536 tourists from Europe of whom 17,700 were here on holiday. From America 6,254 tourists visited our country of whom 4,000 were holiday-makers. If we take the total of 202,000 tourists who visited South Africa in 1962 we find that 185,800 or 78 per cent were holiday-makers. That is why I say the hon. member is not correct when he says this country is only visited by business people. He is creating a wrong impression which does an injustice to the work of the Tourist Corporation.</p>

<p>This Bill is the direct result of the establishment of the Ministry and Department of Tourism. The step taken last year was an important one, a very important one, in the development of tourism. One does not want to detract from the good work done by the Tourist Corporation during the years but they never had a voice in this House, Sir, and under the present set-up this House can give more effective attention to the promotion of tourism than in the past. That is why we are pleased that we have a Minister of Tourism in this House to-day, a Minister who can report to the House and who can be called to account by this House.</p>

<p>After World War II most modern countries became very tourist conscious. Tourism is one of the most important earners of foreign exchange to-day. When you think of it, Sir, that we give a great deal of attention to-day to the promotion of overseas markets, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that tourism plays a very important role in finding overseas markets for us, because the people who visit South Africa to-day are clients who come here to spend money. Where we know that tourists already spend R64,000,000 per annum in South Africa that is tantamount to our having exported R64,000,000 worth of goods overseas. I saw the other day that the corporation expected us to earn R100,000,000 this year from tourism and that is not an amount that we can ignore. When we think of it that it is estimated that the turnover of the world tourist industry is $4,000,000,000, our R64,000,000 or the expected R100,000,000 only constitutes a very small percentage of that. That is why, from that point of view, great attention should be given to our tourist industry, and I am pleased that we have the opportunity to-day of discussing this Bill.</p>

<p>But there are other reasons as well why it is important. We all know the old saying &#x201C;onbekend is onbemind&#x201D; (you do not love that which you do not know). We spend large sums of money annually in an effort to remedy the distorted image of South Africa in the world outside and as part of that process we bring a number of influential persons to South Africa annually to see for themselves what is happening here. The tourists who visit this country can play a similar role. In the tourists we literally have thousands of people coming to South Africa annually at their own expense and they can therefore form their own opinion as to what is happening here. We cannot under-estimate the value of that in order to correct the image the outside world has of us. For that reason, too, I think we should encourage tourists to come to South Africa although we must admit that there are certain limitations in our country as far as tourism is concerned and I wish to deal with a few of them.</p>

<p>I think we can divide the tourists to South Africa into two groups. The first group are those who come from the Continent of Africa and the other group are those who come from other continents. I shall call them the within-Continental and the inter-Continental groups. Hon. members have already pointed out that as a result of the happenings in Africa the number of tourists from Africa to South Africa could be expected to drop because the number of White people has decreased. In other words, if we want to increase the number of tourists who come to South Africa we shall have to compensate for that loss by attracting more tourists from other continents. One of our main drawbacks is the distance between South Africa and Europe and America. That makes a trip here very expensive. That is why South Africa will find it difficult to compete with Europe or South America in attracting tourists from Europe or America and I think we must face up to the fact that we shall not draw large numbers of young people to South Africa. We shall have to concentrate mainly on the older and richer people of the world. We must accept that. When you look at surveys taken in Britain which is in a much better position than South Africa to attract tourists from other continents, the survey taken in 1955 shows that 59 per cent of the American tourists to Britain in that year were of the age group 45 to 50 years. A further 20 per cent were of the age group 35 to 44 years, and only 21 per cent were under 35 years. I think we must face up to that fact, because a trip to South Africa is expensive and will mainly be undertaken by the richer tourist.</p>

<p>I mention this fact because I want to plead with the hon. the Minister and his Department to-day to establish a research section ether in his Department or in the Tourist Corporation. Research plays a very important role to-day in promoting tourism between the various countries in the world. One method employed is to make a sample survey which is used extensively to determine the markets in the various countries where tourists can be canvassed. There is also another method of finding the markets which can be used. They use all sorts of methods such as personal interviews with tourists. The first object of the research I am pleading for is to determine <span class="col_4007-4008" refersTo="page_0696"/>in which particular country there is a tourist market; where can South Africa get tourists, and after that you must concentrate on a propaganda campaign amongst those people. If you can determine where your tourist market is you can also determine what type of publicity you should undertake. The hon. member for Turffontein spoke about the bikini-clad girls at Clifton. If we have to rely on the older tourist we shall not achieve much by showing films of the bikini girls at Clifton.</p>

<p>The second object of the research should be to determine which will be the second group of people we shall attract, what their needs will be and how we can meet those needs. Once you know what the market is you know what facilities to provide. In other words, if you know you will attract wealthy and older people the facilities you provide must be accordingly. That is why we must know what sort of people will visit South Africa. But the nature of the propaganda and the kind of attractions you offer are important. It is no good advertising Clifton if the older people are not going to swim, except perhaps if they want to look at the pretty girls. Then I want to plead that we must have greater certainty and be more sure of the object we have in mind and that we should not rely on the old method of trying to hit the target. We are a young country and we cannot compete with the old countries with their wonderful cultural wealth. We do not have those historically old things to show the people. That is why we should make a start with what we have and create artificial attractions from that point because the old tourist countries of Europe created many artificial comforts to attract people to Europe. We have the wonderful Kruger National Park which I want to give as example and in respect of which I want to say a few words.</p>

<p>Where the Kruger National Park is a big attraction, there are many things in that park that we must develop further, things that will induce the people in the Eastern Transvaal to visit it for a much longer period than just a few days. That is why one is pleased that beautiful roads are to-day being constructed in that area, such as the beautiful Koewynspas which was opened a year ago, and to-day the beautiful Long Tom Pass between Lydenburg and Sabie. You also have the Strijdom tunnel along the mountain route which is being developed. But there is much more in the Eastern Transvaal that can be developed to ensure that people extend their visit beyond just a few days at the National Park. We should make a survey of all our various attractions and take that as our central point round which to provide other things. I have in mind our hot springs. When you think what they do in Europe to make their hot springs attractive to tourists and if we wish to attract the older people to South Africa we are making very little use of those springs, considering our sunny climate and long season. We can make much better use of our hot springs and there should also be further planning in their vicinity. I do not wish to speculate any further. I only tried to prove my point that we should start with what we have and develop those further.</p>

<p>I want to say something else; I am very grateful for the reply the Minister gave this morning. If we want to attract the wealthy tourists the facilities we offer will have to be of international standard. That is why we welcome the fact that it is the intention to erect a number of luxury tourist hotels in South Africa. I think the three mentioned are by far not enough nor should they be concentrated in one place; they should be spread over the country. You must select strategic points and build hotels there. The facilities offered must be planned and you must also take the vicinity into account. Perhaps a luxury hotel in the game reserve may be an attraction. The luxury hotels must be planned according to the attractions we offer. I am pleased therefore that the Government is giving attention to this matter. In Europe the tourist industry is assisted in various ways, <i>inter alia,</i> by giving hotels loans and subsidies at cheap rates and granting them tax concessions. That is why I am pleased that the Government is giving attention to this matter.</p>

<p>I wish to point out that the competition for tourists has become very keen in the world to-day. It is clear that we are facing very strong competition. When we look at the tourist trade in South Africa we realize that although tourism has increased tremendously throughout the world over the past ten years the inter-Continental tourist trade to South Africa has practically remained constant. Where it is expected that in 1975 the tourist traffic of the world will be four times as heavy as it was in 1960, we shall have to do much more if we want to attract a larger number of those tourists to South Africa. That is why we cannot rest on our laurels. One is actually sorry to read in the annual report of the Tourist Corporation that they lack the funds for certain aspects of their work, such as making the maximum use of their films for example. In welcoming this Bill and the establishment of a Department of Tourism. I want to plead that we should not continue with this method of just trying to hit the target but that we should employ scientific methods and that we should give attention to research in particular so that we shall know where to get tourists and concentrate on attracting them here.</p>

<from>Maj. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DER BYL</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with some points made by the last speaker, particularly his remark that research should be done. To-day in all modern business and industry you have to have research to know exactly what your requirements are, etc. Also, in regard to tourism, we need careful research before taking casual decisions, and I wish to support him in that.</p>

<p>Now, the House debated this Bill on 28 February last, six weeks ago, and much of <span class="col_4009-4010" refersTo="page_0697"/>what was said then has faded in the memories of hon. members. I feel therefore that it is a little difficult to reply to former arguments and to put the case stated by hon. members on this side of the House because to a large extent what they have said has been forgotten. Whilst I do not wish to be repetitive, I should like to remind hon. members of some of the things that were said then. The hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) and the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) put the case of this side of the House very clearly and stated what our views are, and I will not repeat their arguments. But my constituency is very gravely concerned with this Bill and therefore I would like to put their case as they see it, and I hope the House will bear with me. I have a copy here of a letter written by the Hotel Association (non-liquor) of the Cape to the Minister. I know that the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) referred to this letter and quoted two or three bits of it. This letter puts the case clearly from their point of view. I come back to this because, as I say, there are large numbers of these hotels in my constituency. With your permission, Sir, I would just like to read the letter again to refresh our memories because this letter states the position more clearly than I could have stated it. In referring to the National Federation of Hotels Associations (non-liquor) of South Africa, the letter said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This federation was astonished to read of the first reading of a Bill to amend the South African Tourist Corporation Act, particularly in relation to the sections altering paragraph (1), so that the corporation is now to be empowered to &#x201C;register, grade and classify accommodation establishments&#x201D; or &#x201C;any class of such establishment&#x201D;, without the previous requisite of application being made for such registration.</block>

<p>That is a point which the hon. member for Von Brandis stressed very strongly, and so did the hon. member for Turffontein. I will come back to what they said a little bit later. The letter goes on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This whole question of registering, grading and classification is an extremely difficult one and we were assured by the members of the Hotel Inquiries Commission when we appeared before such commission, that before the commission itself finalized its report, it would, if at all possible, give the two Hotel Federations ample opportunity to consider the ramifications of such a system.</block>

<p>We are, to say the least of it, surprised and mystified that such a far-reaching change in the present system is contemplated before the Hotel Inquiries Commission presents its report, which presumably will give consideration to the whole aspect of grading, which, in effect, may be dealt with by bodies other than the South African Tourist Corporation.</p>

<p>We would like to point out quite clearly that our organization is not necessarily against the principle of grading. However, we feel that there may be a great conflict of purpose and direction, and that surely it is only after the commission has presented its report, which undoubtedly will contain within it recommendations as to what body should be placed in charge of hotel affairs; what bodies will be represented on such body; how grading is to be set into operation; and who exactly is to be responsible for the institution and execution of such system, that this question be finalized.</p>

<p>We accordingly most respectfully request that this particular Section 1 (b) of the contemplated Tourists Corporation Bill be deleted, and left over until such time as the Hotel Inquiries Commission has presented its full report.</p>

<p>Sir, that point was put very clearly over and over again by speakers on this side of the House. We support this Bill but we feel that before incorporating this Clause 1n the Bill the Minister should await the commission's report. As I have said, there are large numbers of private hotels in my constituency. They are to a large extent non-liquor hotels. They serve a very important part of a highly respectable group of middle and lower income groups. Many of these people are pensioners. To many of these people a charge of an extra few shillings per week makes a difference. These are not luxury hotels. They are well run, clean hotels with a reasonable table. I have seen that myself on many occasions. They are not luxury hotels and cannot be classed as such. But, to come back to what the hon. member for Von Brandis said, if they get a low classification it will harm their business seriously. These hotels are of a high grade in terms of the fees they charge. Sir, Clause 1 (b) now proposes to classify these hotels even if no application has been made for classification. Many of these hotels have but few overseas visitors as guests. Most of them serve people living in South Africa, pensioners and older people. We know that there is a Commission of Inquiry sitting, as was stressed by the hon. member for Von Brandis. This commission is likely to appoint a board on which this class of hotel will have representation. Why, then, bring this legislation in before the commission has reported&#x003F;</p>

<p>During the second-reading debate I put a question to the hon. the Minister on these lines, I said (Col. 2153)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In view of the fact that this commission still has to report and will do so within the next few months, what is the necessity for introducing this Bill now&#x003F;</block>

<p>The Minister replied&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I appreciate that question &#x2026; the only important point here is this, that previously the position was that the classification and <span class="col_4011-4012" refersTo="page_0698"/>grading of hotels should be on a voluntary basis. You could not classify or grade or register an establishment unless an application was made. Now I am changing that, not necessarily because I want Satour to perform that function but because in my opinion it should not be on a voluntary basis but on a compulsory basis. That is the only principle I am establishing here. If the hon. member wants to attack me on that point he may do so. &#x2026;</block>

<p>I had no intention of attacking the Minister on this. I am trying to put it to him as a reasonable man that we have a commission sitting, which is going to go into this matter completely and fully. I again interrupted the hon. the Minister across the floor of the House and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am not attacking you on that point. I am just asking you why you do not wait for the report.</block>

<p>The Minister of Tourism: I am convinced that, without having had the commission&#x2019;s report, in South Africa we have to tackle registration and classification on a compulsory basis and not on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>Maj. van der Byl; You are forestalling your commission.</p>

<p>The Minister of Tourism: No, I am not, I am awaiting their report, but if I need the authority I have it here. If I have to operate on a compulsory basis I do not want to find myself in the position that I am not allowed to do so.</p>

<p>But surely if this legislation goes through without Clause 1 (b), the Minister can still introduce a short amending Bill afterwards if it is necessary to do so in the light of the commission&#x2019;s report. Here you have a responsible commission sitting at the present time; why not wait until it reports&#x003F;</p>

<p>As I say, the hon. member for Von Brandis put our case clearly. He said (Col. 2158)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I would in all seriousness therefore ask the Minister to drop this particular clause dealing with the classification of hotels &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is all I am asking the hon. the Minister to do. Sir, the Tourist Corporations have no hotel representative on its board. Is that not correct&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<p>Surely he is not a hotel man. I am not going to contradict the hon. the Minister because I do not have the facts. I believe that they have no real representation on the board. I do not want to contradict the Minister without being able to produce my evidence but I am convinced that he is wrong. However, he can look up the facts and let us know what the position is. The new board, however, will have such representation. Why should it not be left to the hotels to ask for classification&#x003F; Why should this type of hotel have to be classified when it is not necessary&#x003F; Sir, I also appeal to the Minister to agree to the representations made by the hon. members for Von Brandis and Turffontein. I would urge the Minister please to leave out Clause 1 (b), until such time as the commission has reported. He said in the second-reading debate that he wanted to take this power now. Well, if the power is not required and if the commission does not recommend that he should take this power, why should he incorporate it in the Bill at this stage&#x003F; Once more therefore I suggest to him that he should drop Clause 1 (b). As far as we can see this Bill is necessary, and we support it, but I ask the Minister to drop Clause 1 (b). I do hope he will do so.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) who has just sat down emphasized what was said by the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty). I appreciate the fact that the hon. member supports this Bill in principle. But it is a pity that the hon. member did not quote the hon. member for Von Brandis a little further. The hon. member for Von Brandis said: &#x201C;Get on with the job.&#x201D; The way in which the hon. member for Von Brandis addressed the hon. Minister for Information and Tourism is something which I as a backbencher really cannot understand. I say that it is a pity that the hon. member for Green Point did not also quote what the hon. member for Von Brandis had to say in this connection. In any event, I appreciate the fact that he supports the Bill in principle.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in dealing with this matter we must have clarity in the first place in regard to the aims of the principal Act. It is perfectly clear that the aim of the South African Tourist Corporation Act of 1947 is the expansion of our young tourist industry. The principal Act seeks to expand our tourist industry by making available the necessary travelling facilities and accommodation. Bearing in mind these aims I can understand why the hon. member for Von Brandis wants us to get on with the job, and there are many hon. members in this House who hold the same view, particularly when we consider what was said by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) in connection with the financial aspects of this matter and particularly when we have regard to the income derived from this industry by other countries. I do not want to weary the House by quoting statistics but I want to mention a few figures in support of my argument. These figures are for the year 1961; they are therefore out of date by two years. During that year Britain attracted 1,800,000 tourists who spent a total of $575,000,000. Austria attracted 5,000,000 <span class="col_4013-4014" refersTo="page_0699"/>tourists who spent $270,000,000, which is about 10 per cent of the value of the total exports of Austria. Ireland attracted 5,000,000 tourists who spent $130,000,000 which amounts to about 30 per cent of the value of the exports of Ireland. Spain attracted 7,800,000 tourists who spent $450,000,000 which is about 40 per cent of the value of the exports of Spain whereas Italy, which stood at the top of the list that year, attracted 21,500,000 tourists who spent $840,000,000. This gives us an indication of the importance of this industry. It also shows that the Government was justified in establishing this Department as a separate Department under the hon. the Minister of Information and Tourism. These figures justify the plea of the hon. member for Von Brandis that we should get on with the job but, unlike the hon. member for Von Brandis, I am not afraid that we will move too slowly. I am afraid that we will move too fast, because in dealing with tourism there are certain matters to which one has to give careful consideration. In the first place, we are dealing here with a particular group of people in society, a group of people who are more or less independent financially, and who have money at their disposal that they want to spend in a way which will give them pleasure. We are dealing with a group of people who are well aware of the fact that they are welcomed with open arms in all countries because they have the means to build up any country&#x2019;s tourist industry. They have the potential not only to assist a country materially but also to make propaganda for a country when they leave that country and return to their own homes. I must also add that it would be difficult for any country, particularly South Africa, to find a cheaper form of advertising its attractions than through the medium of tourists. That is why I say that we must make doubly sure that we are in a position to receive tourists in our country and to receive them in such a way that they will enjoy their stay here; that they will get value for their money and that they will return to their homelands with the right impression so that they can make favourable propaganda for our country overseas. There is another matter, too, that we must not overlook and that is that we are dealing to-day with international tourists. It will be those people whom we shall attract, people who have already travelled through Europe and North America and who are now looking for other sights to see. In order to satisfy them we will have to try to offer them something which they have not yet seen in other countries and which it will not cost them very much to see in this country. In other words, we must offer them something different, not simply bathing facilities and beach resorts and scenic attractions. They may perhaps have seen similar scenic beauties in other countries. We must find out whether we do not have other attractions which will grip the imagination of these people. We must show them things which they have not been able to see in other countries. I think that we do have such attractions in our country. Apart from that we must remember that travelling has been made more convenient in recent years; tariffs have been reduced; our monetary system has been adapted to suit the requirements of the traveller better than it did in the past. If we concentrate intensively on a specific point in advertising the attractions of our country it is not at all impossible that within a reasonable space of time we shall attract more tourists than we can properly accommodate in our country. That is a risk that we shall have to take. During 1962 we attracted about 202,000 tourists to this country. Here again, if we want to learn from past experience, there are certain things that we must not overlook. From 1947 to 1962 the number of tourists increased by 132,000 but the number of beds in licensed hotels only increased by 27,000! Another significant point is that since 1958 the number of tourists travelling on our roads has increased by 19,000. The number of tourists using our air services has only increased by 9,000 whereas the number of tourists who travel by rail and by boat has gradually decreased. The first lesson that we ought to learn from this is that we should maintain the correct balance between the number of people visiting our country and the accommodation that we have available for them. The second lesson that we must learn is that our visitors concentrate mainly on our roads. This is a fact that we must not lose sieht of. The fact that tourists concentrate mainly on our roads is an indication that they want to see the countryside; that they want to travel slowly and comfortably and quietly through the countryside. That is why it is necessary for us to make suitable arrangments for these tourists who use our roads. It will not help us to attract a vast number of tourists to this country if our hotel accommodation is inadequate or unsatisfactory. In saying this I do not mean that all tourists demand luxury hotels. Even though they may be able to afford these hotels, they do not always want to stay in luxury hotels on their travels. Other tourists may perhaps prefer hotels which have no more than ordinary amenities. Another section may perhaps prefer an outdoor life and prefer to stay at rest camps. These are matters which must be considered in our planning because we want to promote this young industry of ours. Nor will it avail us to have the necessary accommodation available unless our roads are in good condition. I cannot imagine anybody enjoying a trip in any part of the country if he has to travel on a bumpy and dusty road. And good roads and adequate accommodation will not help us ether unless the sights along those routes used by the tourists are such that we can derive full value from the caoital invested in roads and hotel accommodation. On the contrary, when the tourist returns overseas he is going to make negative propaganda for us instead of positive propaganda. That is why it is so important for us not to be over-hasty in trying to promote this young industry. A tourist industry is not something which is built up overnight.</p>

<p><span class="col_4015-4016" refersTo="page_0700"/>It is built up and nurtured by the natural resources of a country; it is a national asset and a permanent asset and that is why I say that when we plan our tourist routes, we must be sure that those routes will serve as advertising signboards for our country. What do we find in certain parts of our country to-day&#x003F; What is the position&#x003F; In the rural areas our forebears built their little housing schemes practically alongside our national roads. Do they serve as an advertisement for us&#x003F; Can we advertise them to the outside world&#x003F; The fault does not lie with the State. The Department of Coloured Affairs has already taken the necessary steps in this connection; negotiations have already been entered into with the Administrators of the various provinces for the provinces to do the administrative work and the Department of Coloured Affairs will then provide the capital. But that has not yet been done. We need time to do it. Rome was not built in a day. I just want to emphasize the fact that we must be extremely careful, in view of the feeling that exists in the world to-day in regard to South Africa, that in our enthusiasm for this important matter we do not do the wrong thing and bring about the very thing that we do not want.</p>

<p>I want to invite the hon. the Minister of Information and Tourism to visit the northwest. Let us harness the enthusiasm which exists on the part of every local body; let us canalize that enthusiasm, let us co-ordinate that enthusiasm and use it in the interests of our country so that we can reap the fruits of our endeavours when the tourist returns to his own country.</p>

<p>In support of what I have said&#x2014;that I should like the hon. the Minister to apply this legislation in the north-west&#x2014;I should like to mention just a few matters in connection with this vast remote part of our country. Sir, here we have an area that is completely different; it is an area of strange contrasts; it is a desert area and, one might almost say, an area of nothingness, but it is also an area of fabulous riches, the sort of riches for which people have been prepared to risk and give their lives. We know that amongst tourists we find people who are prepared to risk their money and their lives. The north-west offers such people ample opportunity. About 150 miles to the north of Cape Town we suddenly come upon roads which are unsuitable for tourist traffic. We simply do not have good roads there and it is no use saying that we do have good roads merely because of enthusiasm for our cause. This is a matter which requires sober consideration. About 150 miles to the north of Cape Town we have the Knegsvlakte, wrongly called the Knersvlakte because nature is so cruel there. Its climate is in complete contrast to the moderate climate of the Western Province. The correct name for this area is Knegsvlakte. It is a lonely part of the world because it is waterless. It is an area in which the plant life, the dandelion and the vygle (<i>Mesembryanthemum</i>) compete with the backglound. runtuer no in we have a large variety of plants and flowers. In the gateway to Namaqualand proper, the area between Bitterfontein and Garies, we have hilly country, and when nature co-operates the slopes of the hills are adorned in certain months during the spring with a beautiful carpet of purple flowers. When the visitor follows the winding road to the north he finds suddenly himself on the Namaqualand plateau. In his immediate vicinity the scene assumes a patchwork pattern varying from arable land to fallow land and hilly country thickly overgrown with bushes and flowers. To the east lies the Kamiesberg mountain range with its forest-covered ravines; to the west lies the hilly country which gradually slopes down to the coast where the waters of the Atlantic Ocean are dimly visible and fade away in the hazy mist of a spring day. For the first time the tourist gets a panoramic view of the diamond fields of Namaqualand &#x2014;the coastal area&#x2014;stretching from the Olifants River up to the Orange River mouth. Sir, fabulous riches were unearthed there in bygone days and I daresay even more fabulous legends and stories were woven around those treasures. Here we have an area of fabulous riches&#x2014;diamonds above the ground, diamonds under the ground and diamonds in the water in the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is a strange thing that the hon. member over there with his economic leanings and tradition is not familiar with that part of the world! Further north the visitor quite unexpectedly comes upon the humble hamlet of Kamieskroon in the folds of the Kamiesberg mountain range. Here he finds himself in the very heart of Namaqualand, a part of our country renowned for its vygles and for its calendulae. Further to the north lies the main town of Namaqualand, Springbok, in the copperbelt, situated between massive hills. Sir, what a delightful scene unfolds itself before the eyes of the tourist on a spring day late in August between those majestic hills&#x2014;huge rockeries designed and beautified by the Creator Himself. In spring, when the water has flowed down the slopes of the hill, the gnarled vygle grows in a profusion of colour wherever the water has wound its way over the soft earth until it disappears from view behind tall shrubs and scattered granite boulders. Mr. Speaker, assailed by the scent of the flowers and plants, a scent which blends with the sweet smell of damp earth, the visitor experiences a feeling akin to what must have been in the mind of a celebrated poet like Leipoldt when he wrote his simple little poem entitled &#x201C; &#x2019;n Handvol Gruis&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Handvol gruis en gedroogde blare, Waboomblare, Ghannabosblare!</block>

<p><span class="col_4017-4018" refersTo="page_0701"/>And may I add, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2019;n Handvol gruis met gedroogde blare, Vertel so baie uit die wonderjare.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must hurry. In a year of good rainfall in the north-west, nature is lavish with his flowers. Once the visitor travelling over bumpy roads has left the Namaqualand hills behind him, the plains of Bushmanland stretch out before him. There, as far as the eye can see, the orange-coloured gousblom of Namaqualand grows waist-high in a solid bank, to the north and to the south and far to the east on the slopes of the hills where the sun-bleached desert grass is transformed by this blaze of orange into a flaming sea. But, alas, the visitor must say farewell to this garden, a natural garden which is the largest in the world. Sir, this is a scene of such sheer splendour that it takes one&#x2019;s breath away; it is the work of the Creator and the Creator alone. Leaving this scene, the desert opens up before the visitor and then, unexpectedly, the green valley of the Orange River, the main artery of the north-west, unfolds before his eyes. At the Place of the Great Noise the grey muddy waters of the Orange plunge recklessly a dizzy 485 feet straight down to the bottom of the Aughrabies Falls. There is little plant life; granite rocks, splintered and shattered, lie strewn around bearing testimony to the devastating work of the cruel sun through the ages.</p>

<p>As the visitor travels eastward, following the course of the Orange River, he comes upon cotton lands, lucerne lands and carefully tended row upon row of sultanas, until he passes Keimoes. There are 3,000 farmers in the valley of the Orange River, the only river in South Africa which has a delta. This is the only place where one finds communities of island dwellers. This fact may not perhaps be of very much interest to a foreign visitor but it is of particular importance to a local visitor; it is a quirk of nature. This is where 50 per cent of the country&#x2019;s lucerne is produced, 52 per cent of our cotton, 87 per cent of our sultanas and 49 per cent of the dried fruit of our country. These products are produced by these 3,000 farmers. Eventually, the visitor arrives at Upington, the main town of the north-west. There, to the eye of the expert, beats the pulse of the north-west. For 200 miles to the north there is the Kalahari Desert. These 200 miles fall in the Gordonia area. Sir, this is desert land; it is the home of the black diamond, the karakul sheep. Karakul farms are scattered throughout the area. The landscape changes again and soon the visitor is faced with a strange natural phenomenon in the shape of 90 miles of dunes, row upon row of them, all facing in the same direction. And in that Kalahari desert tough North-westers are taming the desert; the struggle for water in the Kalahari desert continues day and night. Here we have the home of the gemsbok, the pride of the Republic of South Africa, the pride of the Kalahari and the prize buck of the dunelands of Gordonia. Eventually, the traveller comes upon something out of the ordinary, a nature reserve, the Kalahari Gemsbok Park, trapped in a dune world between two former rivers, the Ohop and the Nossop; a reserve which is the home of vast numbers of gemsbok, eland and springbok. Sir, nowhere in the world does the king of beasts show up to better advantage and more proudly. As far as its size is concerned it offers a challenge to any member of its species on the Continent of Africa and its roar, carried by the night winds across the desert, brings lustre to this particular nature reserve.</p>

<p>Sir, we invite the visitor to come to Namaqualand, to come to Gordonia, to come to the north-west. When it becomes necessary to entertain the sort of visitor who is looking for something different, who is searching for something out of the ordinary, we invite the hon. the Minister to bring that visitor to the north-west. Let him bring to the north-west those people who have their eyes on the distant horizon, who are searching for material riches, who are looking for something which enriches but which is not negotiable&#x2014; something which is a permanent national treasure. I say, Mr. Speaker&#x2014;</p>

<p>As we say farewell to this fair land I regret that we must bring the debate back from the lyrical and delightful travalogue to which we have just listened. Perhaps, in doing so, I might suggest to the hon. the Minister that he has a ready-made adviser to his Department in the hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. G. P. Kotze) to write some of his propaganda pieces to draw the crowds. There was one unfortunate aspect in the remarks the hon. member for Gordonia has just made. That was his reference to not rushing too fast because people might see things which we did not want them to see and go back with the wrong impression. He referred particularly to locations which were along main roads. I think it was unfortunate that that should have been brought into the debate. Sir, we should not be ashamed of anything in South Africa. We should not be ashamed to show anything in this country. I do not believe we should mark time because we are afraid too many tourists will come out to this country, I would like to see as many as humanly possible come out here. If there are things that are wrong then they must be put right, but we cannot hide them behind a fence or move them away from the main roads and say: &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t see it from the main road now so it does not exist any more.&#x201D; <span class="col_4019-4020" refersTo="page_0702"/>Let us rather have the black spots of South Africa visible so that we can eradicate them and not move them away so that they cannot be seen.</p>

<p>If the hon. member is afraid why does he not see that his Government removes these things of which the outside world will take adverse notice. The hon. member says the outside world will be put off. Surely that is not the job of the Tourist Department. I was sorry that the hon. member should have brought into what was otherwise a delightful eulogy of his area, this unfortunate comment of not bringing out too many tourists to South Africa.</p>

<from>An <person refersTo="hansard_za">HON. MEMBER</person>:</from>

<p>You missed the whole point.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>I did not miss the point at all. The hon. member clearly said: Let us have tourists but there are certain things which may do us harm so do not let us be in too much of a hurry. The hon. member can check his Hansard; that was what he said.</p>

<p>In any case, Mr. Speaker, the point is that the Bill before us places a responsibility on the Minister. I am not going to deal in detail with the various places in the country to which we must draw tourists. The fact remains that this Bill places a responsibility upon the Minister. I think it has been clear from the speeches made on both sides of the House that there is a tremendous task resting on his shoulders. We have four aspects of tourism with which the Minister has to deal. One is the attractions&#x2014;we have heard a great deal about those atractions&#x2014;and the advertising of those attractions. The second is the tourist himself, the person who is to come and look at that attraction. The third is the facilities for travel, to get him here and to get him from point to point in the country. The fourth is the accommodation in which he lives here. Up to now the South African Tourist Corporation has done excellent work but it has concentrated its efforts almost entirely on the attractions which exist; on trying to draw people to those attractions. Having got the person to come to South Africa that is really the end of the story. The Minister must now pick up the work from that point. Not only must he draw people to South Africa but having got them here he must deal with the other facets of tourism, their accommodation, their travel facilities and the areas, places etc. at which they are going to look.</p>

<p>I think my own constituency is an excellent example of what can be done with imagination. I do not think anyone in this House can deny that the beach front of Durban to-day&#x2014;it falls within my constituency&#x2014;has set an example of how to attract people to a centre, and how to entertain them when they are there, which is a notable one in South Africa. There is nowhere else in the country which even starts to compare with what is being done there. For every age-group, for every economic group, for every type of holiday-maker facilities of one sort or another are available; children&#x2019;s paddling ponds to night clubs, to go from the one extreme to the other. In between there is the exploitation of the beach itself, boat ponds, playgrounds, almost anything you can think of, Sir, which is designed to draw people and to make their stay an attractive one. That is done with the specific object of exploiting a specific asset, an asset which is peculiar to Durban itself.</p>

<p>I mentioned that purely as an example of what can be done and how it works in practice. Because to-day, where it used to be a city with two seasons a year, Durban is virtually a 12 month a year holiday resort. People come there throughout the year because there is something to come for. There are hotels to live in when they get there and there are other facilities. They can make a memorable occasion of their visit. That, I believe, is the sort of pattern which the hon. the Minister can follow on a broader scale, using the natural assets which South Africa has to offer. I do not say that you must deal with other assets in the same way; obviously, you would not try to deal with a nature reserve in the same way as Durban has dealt with her problem. But the thing is imagination, the willingness to take a risk, to spend money and to ensure as far as possible that the wishes and the desires of the people you are attracting are met. I believe these things have been neglected. I do not intend to go into them in detail. I do not believe that is the purpose of this debate. The purpose of this debate is to launch the Minister on the course which he must follow as soon as this Bill is passed. He now accepts responsibility for the exploitation of our tourist trade. I believe he will have the complete and unqualified support of every South African in that task. The Minister is the person who, under this measure, accepts the responsibility. We are launching him on the course which we expect him to follow and in doing so I believe he has tremendous scope, to revolutionize the tourist industry completely. I am not going to repeat the figures given by the hon. member for Von Brandis and the hon. member for Turffontein which indicate that we have no reason to be satisfied with the statistics of our foreign tourist trade. The Minister has been Minister of this Department for over a year. He will know the snags Satour representatives overseas come up against. He will know the emphasis which is placed upon accommodation. He will know the importance which is placed upon having available the sort of accommodation which the rich tourist is used to and which he expects to find in the places which he visits. The Minister will be aware of the problem of getting the message across; he will be aware of the importance of the travel agent in any tourist propaganda and advertising campaign.</p>

<p><span class="col_4021-4022" refersTo="page_0703"/>It is no good getting people interested if, when they get to the tourist office, they are put off by the agent who serves them. These are all problems the Minister has to face. We wish him luck with that task. We believe it is overdue; it has been neglected and it is going to call for hard work and it is going to call for imagination. The Minister will have available to him the goodwill of the whole country and particularly the goodwill of all those people concerned with tourism. There are innumerable things which can be done. I am sure that he will find, for instance, the car-hire companies and those companies which arrange safaris and coach tours, only too willing and happy to co-operate with him and making available to him the information they have gathered from practical experience. Everyone of these instances which work with tourists have practical experience of the complaints and equally so the things which attract tourists. They know what pleases the tourist; they know what makes the tourist say &#x201C;I am coming back again&#x201D;; they know what makes the tourist say &#x201C;I am fed-up; I am not doing this trip again&#x201D;. Now, the Minister has that information available to him from those people who day in and day out work with the tourist and have the closest and the only real knowledge which matters.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) was so right when he said we must have scientific &#x201C;reklamewerk&#x201D;. The people who can provide the facts and the detailed information necessary for any scientific survey in the country are those who deal with tourists day in and day out. I am going to leave it at that by emphasizing again that the Minister must go outside the field of merely putting up a few posters and work with the other three facets of tourism, accommodation, travelling facilities and the attractions.</p>

<p>I want to deal with one of those in a little more detail, and that is the question of accommodation. I want at the same time to support the plea of the hon. member for Von Brandis and the plea of the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) made this morning in regard to the classification of hotels. The hon. member for Green Point gave the point of view of the private hotel, the unlicensed hotel, of which there are many in his constituency. The hon. member for Von Brandis dealt with hotels in general, and I know the Minister has had approaches in this regard. There is no objection to classification. I do not think you will find that the hotels are opposed in principle in any shape or form to classification nor are they opposed to compulsory classification. What they are worried about, <i>Si</i> r, is the fact that at the moment they fall under so many different controls. At this very moment a classification system is in the process of being evolved. The hotels have not yet received any information regarding that system but it is being worked out at this very moment. Within a month or two it is hoped that system will be announced. So you will have one system of classification under the Minister of Justice&#x2014;the system of classification imposed by the National Liquor Board. The Minister now also takes power to classify under this Bill, under the Tourist Corporation. In a short time we hope to have the report of the Hotel Commission. That again deals with hotels and there will be recommendations. I hope one of those recommendations will be the establishment of a statutory body to deal with accommodation establishments. So you will have a third system of control there. I believe it would be better if the hon. the Minister were to drop this power he is taking until such time as he sorted out with the industry, with the Department of Justice, and after he has received the report of the Hotel Commission, exactly what line he is going to take. He is unable to say now, he cannot say now, what approach he is going to take to this question. He himself has stated that he is waiting for the report. He has stated he will not use this power until he has had that report. We all know the situation, Mr. Speaker. Once a power is taken and handed over to an organization or to a Department it is most unlikely that the temptation to use that power will be resisted. Why not wait and do the thing properly when we have all the information before us&#x003F; Do it with the support of the people who are mostly concerned and the people who are going to fall under it rather than do it now with a feeling of worry and concern and a feeling of &#x201C;this is being forced on us; we are not happy about it&#x201D;. If the Minister is not prepared to withdraw it I hope he will make a very clear statement of exactly what he is going to do about this, how he is going to apply it. Again I appeal to him, as I have done before, to give an assurance that in any system of classification the Federated Hotel Association which represents all licensed hotels, and if unlicensed hotels are to be classified, their federation, will be represented directly on the body which deals with this classification. They are the people who have the knowledge and the experience. It would be unreasonable and it would not be a sensible policy to eliminate them from the body which is to classify them. So I ask the hon. the Minister to deal with that specifically in his reply.</p>

<p>I would also like to ask the Minister to give us the assurance that in his encouragement of hotels he will not only look to the new luxury hotels but will bear in mind existing hotels which have borne the burden of providing facilities over the years. There is a fear that in our enthusiasm to assist modern, international, luxury hotels we are going to ignore those Who, despite all the difficulties, have provided as best they could the best services they were able to supply. There is, as I say, the concern that they be forgotten in the new enthusiasm for tourism. Existing hotels have a big part to play. Admittedly, and essentially there must be new and luxury establishments. I agree with those hon. members who dealt with this that they must be available to give coverage to South Africa. But <span class="col_4023-4024" refersTo="page_0704"/>they must come from private enterprise with the support and the assistance of the Minister and the Government. That is the only way in which we can have a satisfactory system.</p>

<p>In regard to the other problems, all of them are problems which are known to the Minister. They are, shall I say, of a detailed nature and I believe not germane to a general discussion such as this, which is a discussion on the principle of this measure. I am confident that the Minister will find that all those to whom he turns for assistance will give it to him. We therefore support this measure. We launch the Minister on this road of responsibility for tourism with that one reservation in regard to classification. We wish him luck in making an outstanding job of our tourist trade so that South Africa may become the holiday centre of the world.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>It is a great pity that the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw), perhaps because he could not properly understand and follow the speech of the hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. G. P. Kotze), spoilt a good speech by ridiculing the speech of the hon. member for Gordonia. It is a pity that although the hon. member for Gordonia gave us a wonderful picture of what the tourists in South Africa can see and also gave the world a superb portrait of all that South Africa has to offer, the hon. member for Durban (Point) could only poke fun at his speech. I think it is a pity that he did so. I also think that the hon. member for Gordonia has done South Africa a service by pointing out that, particularly as far as the tourists travelling through the platteland are concerned, we shall have to take steps ether to remove or renovate the unsightly houses, non-White and often White houses, which are often to be seen along our public highways. Unfortunately, it is true that as a result of the way in which our national roads have been planned, small pieces of land are often left over along those roads and numbers of people on the platteland have made use of those small pieces of land to accommodate Bantu, and this accommodation is sometimes not particularly attractive. I think that it was quite right of the hon. member for Gordonia to refer to that aspect.</p>

<p>When one considers the request of the United Party that the hon. the Minister should not have the power to register private hotels, hotels and boarding houses, one must have recourse to the original Act and its aims which are as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; to develop the tourist industry of the Union of South Africa by encouraging persons to visit the Union of South Africa from elsewhere and to travel about therein, and by encouraging the development and improvement of travel services to and within, and of accommodation for travellers within, the Union of South Africa, &#x2026;</block>

<p>The original Act refers to accommodation and that accommodation must be such that it will be an advertisement for South Africa. Is there any reason for saying that because an inquiry is in progress and because the Department of Justice has a registration scheme in terms of the Liquor Act, that the hon. the Minister should not have this power&#x003F; If the hon. the Minister does not have this power and the Department of Justice or any other body sets a norm in terms of which registration must take place, the hon. the Minister will then, in any event, have to be given powers in terms of this Act in order to give consideration, on registration, to the norm that has been set. That is why I think that the hon. the Minister must go ahead with the registration. He must not leave this provision out of the Bill. I want to agree with the hon. member for Durban (Point). He gave us a description of what is being done in Durban. It may perhaps be because he only sees the sea front at Durban that he has given us a city-dweller&#x2019;s interpretation of the position and that he was not able to understand what the hon. member for Gordonia said here. I agree that the Durban sea front is worthwhile seeing; it is as good as any Riviera in the world; it is just as good as anything that France can offer. The hon. member for Gordonia told us about just as many sights worth seeing but for a special sort of tourist.</p>

<p>In not only congratulating but also giving our support to this hon. Minister who is at the head of this new industry in South Africa, we must, without repeating what was said here by the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) or what was said by other hon. members in regard to the importance of tourism, consider two examples of what tourism can mean to a country. I want to take Spain as an example. Last year Spain had a tourist turnover of $450,000,000. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that as a result of the increase in the number of tourists to Spain, the sugar consumption in that country trebled in comparison with the consumption in previous years&#x003F; It may perhaps be because the rich Americans have had their fill of the luxuries of Europe that they are now going to Spain, which is a poor country. An American told me the other day that this is true; they are now going to Spain but he also said: &#x201C;You must remember that when an American visits Spain, he still wants his candy and his coke.&#x201D; In other words, Spain must now start producing those items. This has a chain reaction on production, on trade, on development and on turnover. This is one example. I am not going to take up the time of the House any further in this regard. I think that the hon. member for Pretoria (West) sketched the position very clearly by the use of figures and statistics to prove how tourism can be valuable to a country. If we look at the Annual Report of the South African Tourist Corporation, we find that they anticipate that four times the number of tourists will come to our country in 1975 as was the case in 1960. I want to say immediately that this expectation will only be realized if two conditions <span class="col_4025-4026" refersTo="page_0705"/>are complied with. Everything depends on these two conditions. In the first place, we must have satisfied visitors and this Bill seeks to ensure that those visitors will be satisfied by making provision for the registration of hotels and boarding houses in order to ensure that the norm is maintained. In the second place, we have to use imaginative advertising, but our advertising must also be true advertising. The hon. member for Gordonia put it very well indeed. He said that our attractions must be attractions with a difference. I want to mention an attraction which is different, an attraction which I saw myself the other day. It was while I was visiting the K.W.V. I found that the K.W.V. have a very competent guide. There were also at least ten foreign tourists there at the time and the guide showed them in a very capable manner everything that is being done there, which is different to what is being done at any other place that one can visit. The same holds good for Rembrandt. In other words, it must be something different. I want to return now to the question of having satisfied visitors. In the first place, the hotels must be satisfactory. That is why this Clause 1s so essential. I want to mention an example to the House. A short while ago I was travelling on the national road and I came upon a wonderful new hotel, a brand new hotel which was only completed three years ago. We could have had a meal at a few other places earlier on but I said to my guests: &#x201C;No, let us eat at that new hotel.&#x201D; When we arrived there for a meal, they did not even have a menu. When I asked the waiter what we could have to eat, he said: &#x201C;Only cold meats.&#x201D; I then said: &#x201C;Bring us some cold meat.&#x201D; He then replied: &#x201C;Sorry, sir, to-day the cold meats are still hot.&#x201D; That is the kind of hotel which one sometimes comes across along our national roads and that is the kind of hotel which harms our tourist industry. We must not allow this to happen and by means of this registration provision we can try to rectify the matter so that the necessary supervision will be exercised.</p>

<p>I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to another matter and I want to ask him to approach the hon. the Minister of the Interior for assistance in this connection. If we want satisfied visitors we must ensure that when a visitor arrives in our country ether by air or by ship, he does not have to answer a large number of questions or fill in a large number of documents, documents which sometimes he cannot even understand. If the hon. the Minister and the corporation compare our documents here with the tourist documents that have to be completed in the rest of the world, they will find that the questions asked in other countries are brief. People visiting South Africa have to fill in a number of documents. I think that this matter should be investigated so that the whole procedure can be facilitated and simplified and so that questions which may possibly be wrongly interpreted by visitors can be avoided. This is something we must do in order to have satisfied tourists. At the same time I want to say that we must praise the way in which the departments deal with these visitors. I know that we are fortunate in that the officials in these departments show the necessary goodwill when tourists approach them with these difficult questionnaires. This goodwill is something that should be encouraged. A satisfied tourist is a tourist who will return to his own country and influence other people to come to this country. In order to have satisfied tourists, we must ensure that our transport facilities are of the highest standard. The hon. member for Gordonia pointed out that if a tourist comes to this country and he has to drive for miles along a bumpy road, without the necessary accommodation being available along the way, without his being able to enjoy the necessary facilities along the way, then he does not feel satisfied. Fortunately, South Africa&#x2019;s transport facilities are among the best in the world. Our airways are second to none. One can go to any place in Europe but one will find that South African Airways are head and shoulders above all the others both in regard to the comforts enjoyed on the flight and also in regard to the courtesy shown and the service rendered by the air hostesses and stewards. I can also mention another example. Our Blue Train service or the express service between Johannesburg and Durban need not stand back for any train service in the world. These are two factors which encourage and assist tourism. I wanted to discuss another matter and that is the opportunities that we have for using our imagination which the hon. member for Gordonia described so succinctly as opportunities with a difference. He mentioned the natural beauty of the north-west; he told us what could be done and then he went on to sneak about the roads. Let us discuss the Garden Route. I am sure that there are few routes of this kind in the world. It is a route which enables a tourist to see everything at his ease. We not only have the Cango Caves, the majestic Meiringspoort, a ride on an ostrich at Oudtshoorn, or the Wilderness, but we have a comprehensive variety of attractions on this one tour which it will be difficult to equal in any other part of the world. It is wonderful to see all these things. The hon. the Minister and his Department must also have liaison with the Orange River Development Board. We have the Orange River scheme, a scheme costing R500,000,000 which will take some time to complete. Fortunately, the Government were wise enough to set up the Orange River Development Board in order to ensure right from the start the scientific organization of tourism in regard to the sights worth seeing and the question of fishing and hotel accommodation. In a similar connection I want to mention the Pongola poort Dam, a dam which will be 287 feet high and which will serve the Bushveld which has a sub-tropical climate. It will be one of the finest schemes in the world but here we must <span class="col_4027-4028" refersTo="page_0706"/>mention the bumpy road to which the hon. member for Gordonia referred. The time has come when we should have a Garden Route from Durban to northern Zululand, the only one of its kind, which will bypass the majestic Lebombo Mountains, which will run from the Kruger National Park right through Swaziland and northern Zululand, following the course of the river to the mountains until we come to the dam. We must do this to attract tourists to the area. It will be a wonderful route.</p>

<p>I also want to mention a few ideas in this connection. This Bill makes provision not only for consultation with Administrators but also that the Administrators of the provinces can spend money on tourism and that these financial provisions will be included in the Financial Relations Act.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of our national parks. A short while ago we read in the newspapers that certain Italian visitors were dissatisfied with St. Lucia. They were not very happy about what happened there. We have the Hluhluwe Game Reserve in Natal where one can take photographs of the white rhino at a distance of about 10 or 12 yards. One has to be a little more careful in photographing the black rhino because he will not hesitate to charge and overturn a car. When we consider these things we know that here we have a game reserve second to none; where in one or two days one can see every type of buck, including the Nyala which cannot be seen in any other part of the world except at Punda Malia; where one can see rhino&#x2019;s which are not found anywhere in the rest of the world. These are all sights that the world wants to see. A short distance away from this Reserve we have the Black Umfolozi and the White Umfolozi, the home of the rhino and just a short distance further on we have the St. Lucia Lake and False Bay. The St. Lucia Lake is a wild bird sanctuary without equal in the world. Here one can see thousands of flamingos and when they all take flight their white and pink feathers are a sight really worth seeing. The question immediately arises as to whether provincial administrations are aware of the service which they can perform for South Africa by improving these places in such a way as to increase the prestige of our country. Or are these simply the step-children of the provincial council&#x003F; Has the time not come for the Tourist Corporation in co-operation, perhaps with the National Parks Board, to have a more coordinated inquiry made in order to make these necessary facilities and this accommodation, these attractions available in such a way as to be world attractions, because they are the only ones of their kind in the world&#x003F;</p>

<p>I want to discuss another idea in this connection. I know of a young organization which has just been established and which wants to register all the farmers in South Africa, who have game on their farms, for tourist purposes. Just think of it! In earlier years in Britain the hunters rode out to hunt the fox, in hunting-pink. I see that there is now a very widespread organization in Britain which is trying to discourage hunting, even to the extent of using helicopters, by drawing the hounds off the scent simply because these people say that it is a cruel sport. But hunting is one of the oldest sports in which man has always been interested, whether he has been an uncivilized Bushman armed with is bow and poisoned arrows, a hunter with a bow and steel-tipped arrows and later with a gun, or merely a person with a camera; hunting is one of the sports which has always had a great attraction for numbers of people. We must also realize that as a result of developments in Africa, because the White man is leaving Africa, the game in Africa will within the next few years become totally extinct; there will be no more game in Africa. No longer will the enthusiastic followers of the sport of hunting have the opportunity of enjoying this sport in an organized way not simply for the sake of killing. If all the farmers in South Africa who have herds of game on their farms, whether they are springbuck, or blesbuck or other kinds of buck, can be registered &#x2026;</p>

<p>When business was suspended I was mentioning briefly the different kinds of sport which can be pursued in South Africa, including the hunting of game. Africa is a declining hunting ground for hunters who are still keen followers of this sport throughout the world. Here in South Africa we can still give them an opportunity to practise this sport in an organized fashion. Those farmers will show the tourists true South African hospitality. Not only will they do this, but every farm can become a tourist centre, organized and co-ordinated in the proper way&#x2014;for a reasonable consideration.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MARTINS</person>:</from>

<p>In my own constituency, for example, I know of eight such farmers who have wonderful herds of buck and who would be only too pleased to do something of this nature in order in this way to be able to perform a service to South Africa and to tourism.</p>

<p>I want to mention another example of a different kind of diversion which we have to offer here and which the rest of the world cannot offer on the same scale. I think of angling&#x2014;for example, in False Bay. We noticed in the newspapers yesterday that a new world record has been set up in regard to the number of tuna caught in any one day. The old record was broken during the competition which we have just had. In earlier years we thought that we would have to go to far distant countries in order to catch <span class="col_4029-4030" refersTo="page_0707"/>tuna and marlin but where can we find more of an angler&#x2019;s paradise throughout the whole world than here in False Bay&#x003F; Where else can be caught the variety of fish that we have here&#x003F; Name another country whose Prime Minister has caught as large a tuna as the hon. the Prime Minister of South Africa has caught! This is only one example of what we can offer to the world. And while I am discussing this matter, let me mention the trout that we have here in South Africa. I think of a place like Wakkerstroom in my own constituency where some of the finest trout imaginable can be caught. This is a sport followed by many people, particularly because the rest of Africa is no longer able to provide the services in this regard which were provided previously. Let me put it in this way: When a tourist arrives at Cape Town by ship early in the morning he sees Table Mountain thrusting majestically into the sky&#x2014;the view on arrival in Cape Town harbour is one of the finest in the world&#x2014;with the sun rising behind it. When that tourist disembarks at Cape Town, he boards one of the luxury buses of the Railways&#x2019; Road Motor Services which is fitted out for tourists. That tourist is driven along the Garden Route and through the Transkei where he can see what is being done there and is then driven down to Durban. He is taken along the North coast and is able to compare the development in the Transkei with the position just across our borders in Swaziland, a country which is becoming a desert. All this gives him a picture of South Africa and of what is being done here. He can see the contrast between what is being done here and what is being done just across our borders and at the same time have a good holiday.</p>

<p>There is another aspect which we must consider in this connection. This new industry must be developed as swiftly as possible. The advantages to be gained from tourism are not only the material turnover which hon. members have mentioned; they are not only the financial turnover, the goods that can be sold. If we want the rest of the world to understand South Africa and to see South Africa in its correct perspective, then to my mind the most important factor is that tourists who return to their own countries after visiting South Africa must return there, firstly, as satisfied people who have been given what they expected in regard to relaxation, travelling facilities, accommodation and so forth. We must also have people who will return to their country more informed about South Africa&#x2014; in regard to the composition of our population, in regard to our country which is one of the most contented countries to-day, a country which has experienced phenomenal progress in recent times. We want informed people to visit this country so that they can come and see our country for themselves, a country which has a variety of population groups and racial groups, a country in which peace, love and progress prevails, other than is the case, for example, in Cyprus, or is the case in certain of the Southern States of America or in countries in Africa from which the White man has departed. South Africa can pluck these wonderful fruits of tourism and that is why it is a good thing that the hon. the Minister of Tourism is also the hon. the Minister of Information because putting South Africa in her correct perspective to the world is the best way to advertise her. The best way is not by advertising, by brochures, by publications nor by means of professional information. When the tourists who come to this country return to their homelands, they must be our ambassadors. The tourists who come to this country must return home so satisfied and so well informed that they will be able to put South Africa in the correct perspective. Each one of those tourists has his circle of influence, to a lesser or greater extent. Some of these tourists will go home and address various meetings, ether on the occasion of Rotary Club lunches or otherwise. They will address various groups of people. If we can develop our tourist industry in such a way as to attract not thousands but millions of tourists, and these people return home to their own countries and put South Africa in her correct perspective, then the task of the hon. the Minister of Information will be made so much easier, as will the task of the hon. the Minister of Foreign Affairs at UNO and other places where people are wrongly conditioned. These will be the good fruits which we shall pluck as a result of the development of our tourist industry in the correct way and on the correct basis. We hone that what the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr, Raw) said will not merely be lip-service&#x2014;he gave the hon. the Minister of Tourism his blessing, promised him his support and said that the United Party would assist him in his task in every way. We hope that in this connection the United Party are not merely indulging in paying slip-service but that they will be truly South African and serve South Africa in this way so that we will be able to enjoy the good results of their actions.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, before I deal with one or two points in the speech of the hon. member for Wakkerstroom, I hope you will permit me to say a few words about the speech made to-day by the hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. G. P. Kotze). We are all inclined in this House to take poetic licence to deviate from the subject under discussion. If we were to award an Oscar for the best speech made here, I would immediately award him an Oscar for his speech. He sits in his backbench and I sit in mine; sometimes we speak and in a recent editorial the <i>Cape Times</i> referred to what it called &#x201C;backbench oratory&#x201D;. I can only say that if his speech this morning is &#x201C;backbench oratory&#x201D;, then I say with the Duke Orsino: &#x201C;Give me excess of it &#x2026;&#x201D; I am sure my colleagues on this side enjoyed his speech as much as I did, and I am only sorry that at the time he spoke on this very interesting and-important subject <span class="col_4031-4032" refersTo="page_0708"/>of tourism, there were no more than ten of his own colleagues to hear that fine speech. It was their loss, but our gain.</p>

<p>Dealing with the point made by the hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) when he referred to the scenic attractions of South Africa, and to hunting and fishing, I realize that those are very important in the context of tourism, but when he dilates on those subjects he is doing no more than to convince us in this Chamber that we have some really wonderful material to attract tourists to South Africa. The question arises &#x2014;why is it that we have failed up to now to obtain from the outside world an aggregate of tourists comparable with those attractions&#x003F; This is the subject which I think should be germane to our discussion of this Bill. I must say that when he referred in such glowing terms to the angling in False Bay (without the permission of the hon. member for Simonstown (Mr. Gay)), and when he referred to the beauty of Cape Town, I wondered whether he was not &#x201C;angling&#x201D; for a seat in the Cape Peninsula, by doing such a good job of propaganda for the Peninsula, or whether he was merely trying to keep Parliament here! But the important point is that we have insufficient amenities to add to the natural attractions which would justify us in laying claim to a much greater portion of world tourism than we get to-day, and I propose to deal with some of the deficiencies a little later on.</p>

<p>Let me come immediately to one of the very obvious deficiencies in the pattern of tourist amenities in South Africa, and that is, of course, the lack of a sufficient number of good hotels, particularly in some of the laster cities of South Africa. It is common knowledge that in the recent past, as the result possibly of the announcement that the largest hotel in Johannesburg, if not in South Africa, was to be demolished, a consortium was formed of two companies, the Anglo-American Corporation and the South African Breweries, to acquire a very large and valuable site more or less in the centre of Johannesburg, and they announced their intention of building what the Minister has called an international or prestige type of hotel. As the result of that they embarked on a really magnificent project. It was made clear at the time that in order to complete that project they would require some assistance from the Government. I am not saying that the Government made it clear that it would give that assistance, but it does appear that in those circles, in the Government, some consideration was given to a request, to put it at its lowest, that the Government should assist this consortium to build a first-class international type of hotel which would attract tourists to South Africa and which would enable us in Johannesburg to accommodate them, since Jan Smuts Airport is the largest port of entry of international tourists to South Africa. A Press statement appeared last week to the effect that the persons responsible for this: project, having approached the Minister for assistance, found that they could not obtain an answer from him or from the Government, as the result of which I put a question to the Minister this morning, quite fortuitously, and the question and the answer ran as follows: I asked whether he had been approached for Government assistance to build an &#x201C;international&#x201D; hotel. The Minister answered &#x201C;Yes&#x201D;. Then I asked (a) on what date and (b) on behalf of which companies or persons was the approach made, and (c) what was the nature of the representations, and (d) what was the date of his reply. To all that, as well as to the additional question, whether any assistance was promised, and if so, what assistance, the Minister replied that discussions and negotiations were proceeding in respect of three international prestige hotels to be erected in Johannesburg, and as soon as finality has been reached a full statement will be issued. Now I put it to the Minister with respect, that it was known 16 months ago that the one hotel, which&#x2014;perhaps with some doubt in the minds of us who knew it&#x2014;could lay claim to being an international or prestige type of hotel in Johannesburg, was to be demolished, and I say that the Minister cannot be serious when he considers that this is an answer, not to me but to those interests which seek to invest a very substantial amount of their capital in the building of one hotel, let alone three. It is perfectly obvious that even if the Minister were to telephone these people in Johannesburg this afternoon and say that the Government will give the following assistance, and even if it is a generous offer of assistance and they accept it immediately, and they then proceed at the maximum speed to carry out their plans, it will take three years or more before a single bedroom in that hotel would be available to any tourist. In other words, it amounts to this: that for the foreseeable future Johannesburg, which in recent years has suffered from a serious dearth of hotel accommodation, and particularly good accommodation, will still have to wait three to five years, even if the Minister were heard to say this afternoon that the Government will assist the entrepreneurs. Now I put it to the hon. member for Wakkerstroom: What on earth is the use of talking about the attractions of South Africa&#x003F; Most of us as South Africans know them, but what is the use of talking about these attractions to people in the outside world when we well know that if they were to arrive in Johannesburg to-day, there is not an hotel which could take them in for the might&#x003F; I say this to-day, and this is after the period of the Rand Easter Show, which is a very popular season in Johannesburg&#x2014;the Minister was there himself to open one or two pavilions&#x2014;and it is a time when the city has always been overcrowded with visitors who are prepared to pay reasonable tariffs for good accommodation, and we have had this problem for years as to where to accommodate people. The old Carlton Hotel to-day looks like something out of the pre-historic <span class="col_4033-4034" refersTo="page_0709"/>past; it is half demolished, and what is there to take its place&#x003F; At this stage there is not even a plan! I would like in due course to get a reply from the Minister to-day, and I would like him to give us some more concrete evidence of the intention of the Government to assist the tourist industry by assisting those who are prepared to hazard very substantial amounts of capital in the erection of hotels where they are necessary. I want to put it to the Minister this way as I understand the position, the Government is under no obligation to help anybody who comes to it and says he wants to erect an hotel providing they give him some help, but clearly, with the establishment of the Ministry of Tourism, and even more clearly with the accession to power over Satour by the Minister himself, the Government owes an obligation to tourism as an industry to exert itself to provide the hotel accommodation where it is needed, and it does not exert itself by giving the kind of answer which the Minister gave this morning, that discussions and negotiations are proceeding in respect of three hotels. In Johannesburg we would be very happy to know that finality had been reached in regard to one hotel, rather than a continuity <i>ad nauseam</i> of discussions in regard to three hotels. We do not ask for a feast of these hotels, but at present there is a famine, and I want to tell the Minister that last year when I went to the United States I took the trouble to have a very fine perspective plan drawn up for a 23-storey hotel in Johannesburg, on a very central site there, but not the one which this consortium has bought. I have no commercial interest in the matter, nor did I have at the time. But I negotiated at the time, because I felt that this was an important matter to the city of Johannesburg and to South Africa, with two very large hotel corporations in America. I am prepared to give the Minister their names and the details of the discussions, privately. In fact, one of those corporations is involved in one of the three schemes to build an international hotel in Johannesburg, to which the Minister referred in his reply. But the question they immediately asked was whether the Government would provide any assistance for this project. They asked: Assuming we invest $5,000,000 in building an hotel in Johannesburg, what assistance will we get from the Government&#x003F; And if this is the kind of answer the Minister were to give them, then the question of hotel accommodation will go no further than it is this afternoon, because it is common cause that where those large corporations in America, whether it is the Pan-American Corporation, the Hilton Hotels Corporation or the International Hotels Corporation&#x2014;whenever they want to build an hotel in a foreign country it is usually on the basis that they obtain substantial concessions from the Government of the country in which they erect the hotel. In a place like Monrovia in Liberia there is a magnificent 20-storey hotel, standing on a crag, air-conditioned, which was erected by one of these American hotel corporations, but one of their board members said to me that they would never have dreamt of putting up an hotel of that nature in Monrovia of all places unless the Government had come to them and said: We need an hotel, and nobody here is prepared to build it because it is not an economic proposition; we have not the population but must draw people from overseas, and we will therefore give you X million dollars, or we will give you a tax-free period of ten years, or we will provide you with a loan for a period of years at a sub-economic rate of interest, or we will waive all assessment rates and local taxes. That is the kind of deal these people are interested in, because if they merely want to build hotels I can assure the Minister there is plenty of scope for them to build hotels in their own country&#x2014;but they go into the foreign field because some Government in that area has induced them to do so. Unless and until the Minister, whether through Satour or his own Department, is prepared to follow that policy and is prepared to persuade the Cabinet that he must give a real inducement to those who are prepared to venture a tremendous amount of capital over a long period in a very uncertain kind of business venture, as an hotel must be, I fear that for the foreseeable future, which may be from three to ten years, we will still be haggling over this question of tourism, and we will still not be in a position to attract people even to the largest city in South Africa, Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Incidentally, I cannot claim for Johannesburg the scenic attractions that have been claimed for Gordonia or the Peninsula or Wakkerstroom, but Johannesburg is after all the only metropolis in South Africa. It is the only city of consequence as world cities go. I know there will be protests from those who represent Cape Town and other cities &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have no desire to beat Cape Town. What I said in all seriousness was that Johannesburg is at present the only metropolis in South Africa, a city which by world standards has a metropolitan aspect. Cape Town is very beautiful, but I am reminded of the man who was induced to attend a concert for the first time in his life and he heard the famous pianist Rubinstein, and afterwards his friend asked him what he thought of it, he said: Take away his piano, and what has this man got&#x003F; I say of Cape Town: Take away the mountain and the Sea, and what have they got&#x003F; I hope that the Minister will reply to this very important question of the provision of hotels, and I do not want to spread it over the whole area of South Africa. I cannot see in all conscience how any Government can be expected to embark on the venture of ether itself building or assisting in the building of hotels in every large town in South Africa. But surely when <span class="col_4035-4036" refersTo="page_0710"/>it comes to the largest city and the only point of entry by air for international visitors, something must be done and done very quickly, or else we are simply wasting breath talking about the matter. In general, where hotels are concerned I share the reservations of my colleagues on this side in regard to the wisdom of the Minister taking the powers he is taking in this Bill to classify all hotels, whether or not their owners have requested such classification. On the other hand, I must say in all fairness that, basically, the idea of classifying hotels is a sound one, because the tourist from overseas will want the same kind of information about South Africa as he gets about other countries. He can go to a travel agent, and if he wants to go to Italy he can get a book which all big travel agencies possess, and certainly all big air-lines&#x2014;I am thinking here of one called &#x201C;New Horizons&#x201D; issued by Pan-American Airways&#x2014;in which virtually every hotel worth staying in in the country is listed and they are grade, five star, four star, three star, etc. Therefore if the visitor contemplates his trip to that country and he knows that he is being offered accommodation in a city like Florence, at a three-star hotel which has a tariff of so much a day, he has some idea of what to expect when he gets there. But in the case of South Africa, until such time as there is classification, which should not be undertaken as lightly as this Bill indicates, the foreign visitor can only take the word of the travel agent for it, and right now, if someone were talking to one of the travel agents, e.g. in London, and were to ask where he could stay in Johannesburg, he would be given a list of probably six good hotels, but in not one of those cases is there anything to indicate to the tourist whether he will get value for his money or the kind of accommodation he wants, because there is no grading. Let us take the hotels in the False Bay area. There are many hotels there, but because of the fact that there is a short season you have the position where probably two hotels rank, at least in their own estimation, as first-class hotels. And I promise you, Sir, that if you were to go into one of the bedrooms in either of those two hotels, you would find those old wooden cupboards made of boxwood, veneered over, those old wooden dressing-tables, and when you look at the plumbing you almost instinctively look around for that wrought-iron wash-basin stand with a marble top, complete with procelain basin. That is the kind of antiquity which passes for hotel accommodation in some parts of South Africa. [Interjection.] I wish some Americans would come to the False Bay Coast and buy up all the furniture in some of those hotels and take them back as antiques, but more than likely the few who would come here would go back and say, as I have heard at least five tell me during the last six months in the U.S.A.: We went to Cape Town and it is a beautiful city, and we went out to False Bay, which was also magnificent, but the hotels were the bitter end! And then they described an hotel which I know so well.</p>

<p>How do you suggest improving it&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#gorshel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I have been talking about it for ten minutes already. Did you not listen&#x003F;</p>

<p>Now I want to deal briefly with one or two other points which arise largely out of the report of Satour for 1962-3. There is reference to the activities of that corporation on the North American Continent. There are two offices of Satour in the U.S.A., one in New York and one in Los Angeles, which was opened about 18 months ago. I know both those offices and I know both the gentlemen who manage them, and may I say, do so very well. May I tell the Minister that I spent some considerable time with the manager of the Los Angeles office of Satour in order to find out how he would set about attracting American tourists, particularly from the West Coast, to come to South Africa. He realizes the importance of this perhaps better than we do, because he is having an uphill struggle. According to this report, we had a total of 24,241 inquiries in the North American offices during the year, and that produced 6,000 visitors, including those from Canada. Certain figures were used by the Minister in his second-reading speech&#x2014;I want to put it to him this way. The United States has a population of 190,000,000. In the case of a country as large as that, according to the figures revealed in regard to the inquiries in other countries, the number of inquiries in the U.S.A. in connection with visits to S.A. should have been multiplied by 600, and we should have had 600,000 inquiries from America, and instead of having only 6,000 visitors the potential number of visitors from the U.S.A. should have been 150,000&#x2014;but we only got 6,000! The Minister will have to go into this very carefully and ask himself why it is that we can only induce 6,000 people to come here from America. The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Mr. Otto) referred to it in another way. He said that every year, according to the statistics, there were 8,000,000 people leaving the U.S.A. to tour foreign countries&#x2014;and what did we get out of the 8,000,000 in 1962&#x003F; Only 6,000. There must be some reason for that. I believe that the Minister will find, when he has established the reason, that he can do something about it in two aspects, the first case being that there must be a more intensified selling campaign in the U.S.A. itself. By that I mean that whereas there are only two offices now at each end of the country, in New York and Los Angeles on the West Coast, the Minister might well consider establishing at least one additional office in Chicago, which is very centrally situated and which serves a very large and rich area, the Middle West. I think an office there would do some good, because you can walk down the street where most of the tourist and travel agencies are, South Michigan Boulevard, and you will <span class="col_4037-4038" refersTo="page_0711"/>not see a poster advertising South Africa. You will see posters galore in every agency saying: &#x201C;Come to Bali&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Go to Hong-Kong&#x201D;, but they never say, &#x201C;Come to South Africa&#x201D; because they just are not there! So I suggest, first of all, that in that respect the Minister can do something and he can do it quickly, and I hope he will be allowed to spend the money required to do so.</p>

<p>In regard to the other aspect where he can do something, in my opinion, it is the provision of amenities where they do not exist at present, and the case of Johannesburg and its lack of hotel accommodation is purely an example, and, of course the worst example. But until such time as it is possible to establish new and more modern and more attractive amenities, I hope the Minister and his Department will use every endeavour to tune up, as it were, the existing amenities and make them more attractive to overseas visitors, and to advertise them in such a way as to make the necessary impact, as it is called in the advertising world, on the 8,000,000 potential tourists from the U.S.A. who provide the international tourist industry all over the world with many more tourists than the rest of the world put together. That is where we should concentrate, in a country which has the population and which has a high standard of living, and where a substantial proportion of the people want to travel, while we are getting, <i>pro rata,</i> the smallest trickle of tourists from the U.S.A. of any country in the world.</p>

<p>There are two other aspects which the Minister will have to deal with, and which I am afraid he will find difficult to tackle. The one is the remoteness of South Africa, as most people overseas see it, from their homes. This is something which can only be broken down by the co-operation of the public communications media such as the newspapers, television, etc., which may be prepared, if they are friendly and well disposed, to stress the fact that it is not nearly as far as most people think from California to Gordonia, that you can get into a jet plane and within 36 hours you are there, etc. This is not being done to any extent at all, and you can speak to most people in America and they seem to think that South Africa is further from their country than the moon. We have to stress that in our propaganda.</p>

<p>The final point I wish to make is this. [Interjections.] That is, that there is a further obstacle to attracting tourists to South Africa. The fact is that they generally have the idea that we are in a state of public disorder here, that there is political instability, and that they may well have to go in fear of their lives. This is not my opinion. The report of Satour says in the paragraph headed &#x201C;Appreciation&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is not always fully appreciated that the task of encouraging people to visit the Republic and to share in its beautiful attractions is at times fraught with certain difficulties &#x2026;</block>

<p>And this to me is the understatement of the year, from my own knowledge&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Not least among these are adverse publicity and criticism in the Press, on television and through radio broadcasts.</block>

<p>How the Minister is going to set about curing that ill, and eliminating that obstacle to tourism, I do not know. If I were to think aloud, I would say that one of the quickest ways of eliminating that obstacle is for the Government to resign, but I do not wish to bring politics into this discussion. However, the fact is that there is a general feeling outside South Africa that conditions in this country are such that a tourist may find himself in a &#x201C;jam&#x201D; and may not be able to move freely, or to go back when he wants to. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to devise a more subtle and therefore a more efficient way of putting over the case for South Africa as a tourist attraction, even if he cannot do it from the political point of view, by indicating that visitors to South Africa have no reason to fear the so-called uncertainty that exists in the country. This uncertainty is something which concerns us in South Africa, but it need not concern the tourist, and I hope therefore that in implementing the Bill before us to-day the Minister will have regard to the fact that while we support this Bill, and support him in his endeavours to increase the quantum of tourism from overseas to South Africa, there are certain very positive and definite steps he will have to take without any further ado, if he means business.</p>

<p>Sir, one of the most pleasant days that one can spend in this Parliament is when everybody suffers from political amnesia, when we can forget politics and confine ourselves to the beauty of our country and to the attractions which it offers to the world. To-day we have such a day, when we should all try not to be parochial in our outlook; we should not try to boost one section of our country against the other because the whole of South Africa is a beautiful country. Each part of South Africa offers a different kind of beauty and a different kind of attraction to the world. We do not have to sell the beauty of South Africa to the world. What we have to do is to bring the people here to see this wonderful country.</p>

<p>Sir, I do not want to discuss the question of hotels; the hon. the Minister has heard all about it. I think the hon. the Minister and the Government are fully conscious of that aspect, but what I do believe is that having missed the bus in the past we must try to see what we can do for the future. Just think what it would have meant for South Africa if the Olympic Games could have been held in South Africa one year. Not only would South Africa have been advertised but we would have had thousands upon thousands of visitors who would have left this country as agents to advertise the beauty of South Africa. <span class="col_4039-4040" refersTo="page_0712"/>Just think how wonderful it would have been if South Africa could have had a World Fair here.</p>

<p>The World Fair has been held in other countries. While smaller countries like Finland and other countries have been catching the very big tunny, from the tourist point of view, to use fishing parlance, South Africa has been catching little sardines because we have missed the bus and there is no likelihood now of ever getting the Olympic Games or the World Fair here. How then can we attract visitors&#x003F; Let me tell the hon. the Minister that many of us on this side as well as on that side have travelled the world, and we are very fortunate in having been able to do so. We all have our own little stories to tell overseas, to the advantage of South Africa. For instance, when I had the privilege of going through Cape Kennedy (then Cape Canaveral), a colonel of the American army sat in the same car with me; he told me that he had been to South Africa three times and that he could not wait to come for the fourth time because he thinks this is such a wonderful country. Sir, we must try to bring these people to South Africa. We have certain factors here that are very difficult. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) mentioned one or two of them. One is the distance of South Africa from the source of tourism. The hon. the Minister can take it from me that there are thousands and thousands of Americans who would like to come here but they have not been able to spend the time nor can many of them afford the price. I do think that we should take a leaf out of the book of certain organizations who have made travel cheap. What is wrong with the South African Government&#x003F; Why cannot they provide subsidies to help to bring people here&#x003F; Why cannot they subsidize air fares and boat fares to bring the people here&#x003F; If it does cost you a certain amount of money to bring them here, that investment will pay very rich dividends. Apart from the money that those people will spend here, they will leave this country as ambassadors who will advertise this country. Sir, for months and months boats have been leaving South Africa for Brazil and other countries, packed with tourists from South Africa. Why&#x003F; Because they could afford to travel. When I went to South America I found that there were thousands of tourists who wanted to come to South Africa, but they all say that it is too expensive. Well, if it is too expensive we in South Africa must make it possible for them to come here by way of Government subsidies., How it is going to be done I do not know, but we have our South African Airways; there are ships &#x2026;</p>

The Kruger Park is well known throughout America and people want to come and see it, but you cannot expect them to come to this country if they cannot afford the time or the money.

Seriously, Sir, is the Minister not ashamed of himself that he leaves it to another organization to print such a wonderful book about South Africa&#x003F; Should not all the steamships that go from South Africa to other parts of the world carry books issued by the tourist organization of South Africa&#x003F; Sir, these books were snapped up by the people and avidly read; they were most interested. I was happy to be of assistance to many Americans who did not stay on in South Africa but who remained on the boat and continued their tour. The Minister should take some of us in business with him. Some of us have brains and we can tell him how to set about things. South Africa is far behind other countries as far as advertising is concerned. The Minister must not say &#x201C;no&#x201D; when I say that we should issue these books; he must not make a joke of the fact that another company found it necessary to advertise South Africa. Sir, in the four months that I was in Florida, in the United States, I looked particularly for just a small bit of evidence of advertisements of South Africa and of its beauty. I looked in vain; I found nothing at all. I do not know where our money goes: the Minister will probably tell us. When I spoke to him privately he gave me a certain answer which he would probably give to the House; I do not want to tell the House what he told me in the course of a private chat. As I say, I saw nothing to advertise South Africa but I saw advertisements from other countries in almost every cinema. I saw wonderful films advertising New Zealand and Australia, issued by <span class="col_4041-4042" refersTo="page_0713"/>the information bureaux of these countries. As far as South Africa is concerned, however, I looked in vain for advertisements of South Africa. Although we have a Minister in the Cabinet who hates the sight of television let me tell the hon. the Minister that if you want to sell South Africa from the tourists point of view, all you have to do is to use the television network in America or in England &#x2026;</p>

<p>Sir, I have spoken about Government subsidies. Let us take the Rhodesian Government and its famous Flame Lily tour which, I believe is subsidized by the Government. Sir, you cannot get a booking on these tours for weeks and months ahead, if you want to go to the Victoria Falls, to the Kariba Dam and to the National Parks of Rhodesia. Thousands and thousands of visitors take advantage of these tours which are subsidized by the Government. I suppose the Minister has been on that tour.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>No, I do not have to sell it; it has sold itself to the people because the Government made it possible for it to be sold to the people. Sir, we are in a difficult position; we have to attract people from afar. I am not worried about the question of hotel accommodation. That is a problem which should be easy to solve. What I am worried about is how we should set about things to get the people here, the people who want to come, who have read about us and who know about our national parks and our beautiful scenery. They cannot come here unless the Government makes it possible for them to come here. I say that any money spent on subsidizing tourism would be well spent. Sir, you only have to open a newspaper in America to see advertisements of tours throughout the world. South Africa is very seldom mentioned in those advertisements. Of course, we do have the millionaires coming here once in a while but it is the man in the street who wants to travel whom we should try to persuade to come to this country. Sir, I do not want to talk politics. As I have said, on a day such as this we should suffer from political amnesia, but I do say that with our surplus we can afford to pay a subsidy to bring these people here. Such an investment would pay us over and over again. I hope that the hon. the Minister will be bold enough to take strong steps, to bring tourists to this country, even if he goes so far as to bring a hundred school children from America free to this country, and pays their expences here. He must not bring one or two; he must bring them in batches of 100 or 200 from all over America. Let them come here and see South Africa; those children when they leave here will become our advertising agents. You Cannot make profits if you do not take chances; you cannot have benefit unless you make an investment. I do hope that the hon. the Minister will learn from the experience of many members on this side and on his own side of the House. We should stand together to bring tourists here to see this beautiful country of ours. Finally, I want to express the hope that we will have much more luck with tourism in the future than we have had in the past.</p>

<speech by="#emdin">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>We on this side of the House are quite satisfied with the take-over bid of the Minister of Tourism. Very often take-over bids are relatively simple until you find that what you have taken over gives you a great deal of concern. I think the hon. the Minister, after having listened to this debate to-day, must be feeling very much like the man who has taken over a business and now has to run it, because he has an enormous job to do, and I hope that ether at the end of this debate or perhaps under the Tourist Vote the hon. the Minister will be able to give us some indication as to what his plans are. The heartening aspect of the whole situation is that at long last the Government is apparently going to treat the question of tourism seriously. We presume that when the Government sets up a Department of State in charge of a Minister to deal with a particular problem, they are going to go all out to make that Department work, and we therefore look forward to tourism being given an injection which is going to revitalize it in this country.</p>

<p>Sir, there is not much point in going back and saying what we should have had. The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) has told the House what the situation is in regard to hotels, for example. But it is no good, as they say on the stock market, jobbing backwards; there is no profit in it. What the hon. the Minister has to do is to take the situation as he finds it to-day and then plan from there onwards.</p>

<p>I think the objectives of any tourist plan are threefold. The first objective is to get tourists to come to the country, but once you have them here it is just as important to keep them here; that is your second objective, and your third objective is to get them to spend as much money as possible here. Tourism is a materialistic business. We realize that there are some other facets which have been dealt with by other speakers to-day, but basically tourism in its real sense is business; get the tourists here, keep them here as long as possible and get them to spend as much as possible. To achieve these objects there are certain pre-requisites and the basic pre-requisite is planning. Tourism, as I have said, is a business and you just cannot create a business. A business needs long-term planning; it needs experts; it needs advice; it needs all those things which are applicable to any normal business venture. Firstly, in order to bring people to a country, it has been found that <span class="col_4043-4044" refersTo="page_0714"/>you have to find out what they want, and once you have found out what they want, then your constant aim should be to give them what they want. Once you know why people want to come to South Africa&#x2014;and that is something which the hon. the Minister has to find out; as the hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) pointed out you have to research&#x2014;once you find out why they want to come here then you start dealing with them from the advertising point of view, from a conditioning point of view, until you have brought them here. I do not think we really know what brings people here. We do not know whether it is our climate, whether it is our Native life, whether it is our Native reserves, whether it is the wide open spaces of Gordonia, whether it is the mountains and seas of Cape Town. We do not know what brings people to this country and that is something that we have to find out. The question of getting people here and the question of cost were dealt with by the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett). One thing that I did find out in America is that people believe that South Africa is far away. I want to put this to the hon. the Minister: I say that South Africa is not far away, nor is it expensive to get to South Africa, because our potential tourists are not in the United States, even if they come from the United States. Our potential tourists are already in Europe. There are tens of thousands of people from the United States of America and from South America who travel to Europe every year; they may go to England or they may go to the Continent; they may come down as /far as Greece, which is almost on our doorstep, seven or eight hours away, and what we have to get across to people is that South Africa is near and that you can get to South Africa cheaply. What happens when you talk to the average travelling American&#x003F; When you ask him whether he is going abroad next year he says &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. When you ask him where he is going to he will say to you that he is going to Italy or Germany. When you ask him why he does not come to South Africa he will tell you that it is too far away. But when you tell him that he can get from Rome to South Africa for &#x00A3;200 or R400 and that he can get here from Rome in a matter of ten hours, he says, &#x201C;I did not realize that South Africa was so near&#x201D;, because his point of departure is no longer New York or Los Angeles or Boston or Florida, his point of departure is in Europe; he is halfway here or three-quarters of the way here. That is what we have to get across to the American tourist, that South Africa is literally on his doorstep once he is on the continent of Europe. That, I think, is the major factor which will bring American tourists to this country. The American tourist does not realize that setting out from New York he can first go to London, then to Germany, then to Italy, then to Greece; he can go to Spain and Israel and he can come on to South Africa and when he goes back he can take a different route and visit another four or five countries. There is a fantastic opportunity for a traveller from abroad to see the world, and at little extra fare cost to come to South Africa, because on his way south he has free stop-offs at five or six countries; going home northwards he takes a different route, and in coming to South Africa he can see practically the whole world. That is what we have to get across to the world.</p>

<p>Mention has been made of our tourist offices abroad. Those of us who go abroad and visit these tourists offices are all impressed by the work that is being done there. Sir, tourist offices owned by a Government are all very well but the kernel of tourism is a tourist office owned by the tourists organizations. That is where our second attack has to come. We must make sure that the tourist organizations throughout the world know South Africa. I am glad to see from the reports of Satour that there were visits this year from the agents of overseas tourist organizations, but not enough, because except for the group of 101 brought by Lufthansa and the group of 25 brought by K.L.M., the others are infinitesimal. We know that people who work in tourist agencies are given certain concessions to go overseas once a year or once every two years as the case may be. Those working in the commercial tourist offices in South Africa go overseas to see the places they are going to tell their customers about. We must try to get the tourist offices in America and on the Continent to send their people here to see what is going on here so that they can tell their potential customers about it. Sir, I have travelled a fair amount. When I decide that I am going to visit a country which I have not visited before I am sure the tourist agent is very glad to see the last of me because there are 1,000 questions that I want to ask. I do not know what the conditions are in these countries, off the beaten tourists track of Europe. You want to know about accommodation, about sightseeing, about clothing and 100 other things, and the agent is the only man who can give you that information. We have to encourage these agents as far as we can to come and visit us.</p>

<p>Another thing is that we are moving into the era of the packaged tour, and I hope that the hon. the Minister in consultation with the commercial tourists organizations, will see that the packaged tour is created to this country. Packaged tours range over a very wide field. There is the ordinary packaged tour where people go together to a country because they are afraid to travel alone; they are nervous to travel alone and they want the ease of travelling in a group where everything is done for them and all they have to do is to put their suitcases outside their door at 9 o&#x2019;clock in the morning and the rest of the tour is worry-free. Many people do not like that type of travelling but there are many others who do. The packaged tour has become much more intelligent and much more attractive to-day. <span class="col_4045-4046" refersTo="page_0715"/>There are nature lovers&#x2019; tours; there are farmers&#x2019; tours, there are bird-watchers&#x2019; tours. In Northern Rhodesia, some two years ago, on a farm in which I had a small interest where we have a terrific amount of bird life, a special bird-watchers&#x2019; tour was arranged to Northern Rhodesia and the tourists spent three weeks on this farm just watching birds, some of which are only to be found in this particular area. As I have said, there are thousands of these packaged tours. And then we have to provide the facilities. The provision of facilities starts when the tourist arrives at Jan Smuts Airport. The thing that has always bothered me, is the lack of foreign languages at Jan Smuts Airport. I know as an English-Afrikaans-speaking South African, that when I go to Rome or France or Russia or anywhere in the world I have to rely on my English or my Afrikaans, which unfortunately few people understand; otherwise I have to get an interpreter. I always find somebody who speaks the language and I always find at international airports that departures of planes, etc., are announced in a number of languages, always in English, always in Italian, always in French and always in German because those are the four accepted languages. If the hon. the Minister wants to attract tourists to this country, then they must be made to feel at home as soon as they get here. Our Customs forms and our immigration forms must be drawn up in such a way that they will help the tourists. I think one of these forms to-day is also in French or Portuguese; I am not certain. When you go to France or to Italy you do not have to fill in a declaration which is only in Italian or only in French; it is in Italian, French, German and English. We have to do the same thing here. We have to have interpreters at our ports of entry if we want to attract people who speak foreign languages to this country; we have to provide the specialities of life; the festivals that are organized overseas, international game fishing, display of Native life in particular settings, because people do like to see the unusual. If you go to the Middle East you do not want to see an oil well or a tyre factory; you want to see an Arab riding his camel or a Bedouin wandering through the desert. That is what you come home and tell your friends about. Those are the things that you have to offer to the public. Sir, the other facilities are good roads, comfortable transport, special flights, of which there are very few in this country today, and proper guided tours. Sir, you will see that tourism is a business that requires planning and organizing. I hope the hon. the Minister will take the opportunity of getting his Department to go into what has happened in other countries in the world which have been faced with the same problems. I want to quote to him the example of Israel. Israel has built up one of the finest tourist businesses in the world for its size, but there was nothing haphazard about it. The whole thing was planned from the commencement. In 1956 an American team of experts was brought to Israel to conduct a complete survey and to make recommendations for the development of tourism. This survey showed that the number of tourists would jump from 44,000 in 1956 to 100,000 in 1960. That was the basis on which the plan was projected, e.g., that by 1960 there would be 100,000 tourists. In fact there were many more than 100,000. The first thing that was done was to make a complete survey of hotel accommodation, and it was found that if 100,000 visitors had to be accommodated by 1960 the hotel accommodation was completely inadequate. It was then established that because the sea and air fares were high it was the wealthier type of person who would come to the country and that therefore the luxury type of hotel would be required. The first planning therefore was for luxury hotels to take care of the wealthy visitor which was what they could expect and which is to a large extent what we can expect to-day. 40 to 50 per cent of the entire capital for these luxury hotels was provided by the Government. That was the first step, and they started building these hotels. But they projected themselves further because they knew that the poor always follow the rich. When the wealthy man has established a road to a particular area from a tourist point of view the less wealthy man follows automatically. They knew once tourism in Israel became popular there would be reductions in sea fares and in air fares and that lower-grade hotels would be required. So they started planning for lowergrade hotels as well. They worked out a basis that 66 per cent annual occupancy of an hotel would be profitable because 60 per cent occupancy was the break-even point. Then they found, as we have in this country, that there was a shortage of managerial skills and trained personnel to run the hotels. So they established training schools for hotel personnel. If you go to Israel to-day, Mr. Speaker, you will find first-class hotels of all qualities, from <i>de luxe</i> to what is known, I think, as the C or D grades. They are properly staffed and managed.</p>

<p>But I said there were two other factors. It was not only a question of getting the tourist to come here and giving him accommodation but you must try to keep him here as long as possible and induce him to spend his money. What they did in Israel was to launch a complete campaign for the sale of local products and souvenirs. It is interesting to know that after they determined what the tourist wanted and after they proceeded to see that he got what he wanted, a quality article and a variety of articles, the income from the sale of this type of goods went up from $225,000 in 1956 to $1,000,000 in 1958. The hon. the Minister, in conjunction with commerce and industry, has got to see that the means to help the tourist to spend his money are available in this country, that the South African goods, the South African curios, are presented and available in quality <span class="col_4047-4048" refersTo="page_0716"/>and quantity and variety. We have also to provide the special shopping facilities they provide overseas.</p>

<p>In America it costs a wealthy American &#x00A3;125 (R250) to have a suit made of the best British cloth. When an American goes to England the first thing he does is to run to the English tailor. He is doing the same thing in Israel, strangely enough, and he is certainly doing the same thing in Hong Kong. When we go to Hong Kong we do it. They have the best English worsted materials in these countries. You can have a British worsted suit made in Hong Kong within 48 hours, a suit of first-class quality, at a third of the price. We know the best quality English worsted suit made by the best tailor in South Africa can be bought for &#x00A3;50 (R100); that is top price, compared with &#x00A3;125 in the United States. If our American visitors to this country knew they were going to be in Cape Town for two or three days and they could have a suit made here in South Africa, where our tailoring is first-class, of English materials (which are still the best in the world) during the two or three days they are here, that will be an inducement to him to spend his money. Those are the people we have to concentrate on. There should be deliveries to airports, etc. I hope the hon. the Minister will encourage the hon. the Minister of Transport to have a duty-free shop in the new International Section he is constructing at the Jan Smuts Airport. I know he cannot do it now; there are no facilities. The easiest way to get South African products overseas are the dutyfree shops. The hon. Minister probably knows better than I do that every American can land in the United States with six bottles of hard liquor free of duty. Why should he have to pay the South African duty to take it to America&#x003F; He does not; he waits till he gets to Amsterdam or London or Rome and then he ducks into the duty-free shop as quickly as he can, makes his purchases and off he goes. I have landed in London, for example, Sir, from the continent on many occasions and I never failed to buy a bottle of wine and a bottle of spirits before I left the airport because I was allowed to take that dutyfree into England where the duty is very high; and I give these away as gifts.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister has a unique opportunity. He has been given the opportunity of taking over the powers of a very hard-working and relatively successful organization with full Cabinet support and with the full strength of a ministerial position. All I would say to the hon. the Minister today is that he has had lots of advice, we hope he will take some of it and we hope he will make a great success of this new undertaking.</p>

<speech by="#dodds">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DODDS</person>:</from>

<p>As the hon. member who has just sat down has said, the Minister has had a lot of advice and I should say, a lot of sympathy in this very big task he is undertaking. I was not here earlier so I do not know just how much support he got from his side of the House. Previous speakers have travelled far and wide in giving the evidence and advice they have so willingly and plainly set before the Minister. I think this is a big undertaking and, therefore, if there is anything we can do we shall gladly do so. We all realize that tourism is a big money-spinner and is a great attraction to our country from that aspect.</p>

<p>We have unlimited beauty in this country; we have fauna and flora. The only trouble is that while we have this in such abundance the world, very largely, does not know of what we have to offer. So many of us who have had the opportunity of travelling overseas know of the beautiful mountain scenery in Switzerland for instance. When we come back and look at our own mountain scenery we realize that the only drawback in regard to our mountain scenery is the lack of roadways. We have beautiful mountain scenery in Natal, in the Eastern Province and here in the Cape. Much attention is given to the building of hotels, etc., but I think our local authorities which have mountain scenery in their areas should be encouraged to construct mountain roads. I can detail quite a number, Sir, but I realize that that is possibly not what this debate is for at this stage. I would, however, focus the Minister&#x2019;s attention on this particular aspect. Many visitors I have taken around have said to me that our mountain scenery in the Eastern Province and along the Garden Route, for instance, compares very favourably with anything else they have seen, but that the difficulty is that it is inaccessible; they could not see from the top of the mountain, or even higher up from the road. I think those are things we must bear in mind in future.</p>

<p>On the question of advertising, I hope you will permit me, Mr. Speaker, to come nearer home just to illustrate what it can do for a city. I think every member has heard of our famous performing dolphin, Haig, at Port Elizabeth, which, through advertising and through being properly housed, has brought a tremendous amount of tourism to that city. It proves the fact that you have to find out what the public appreciates, stage that attraction and then do the advertising. In that respect I am afraid we have failed hopelessly, and I do hope this Minister is going to take the position in hand realistically and overcome that particular weakness. It is constantly put to us by visitors from overseas when they have returned from any of our parks or beauty spots. They usually say: &#x201C;It is grand but why don&#x2019;t you advertise; why does the world not know about it&#x003F;&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="col_4049-4050" refersTo="page_0717"/>I do believe another member has dealt with what I feel is something very important and which will be of great attraction to overseas visitors. We all know that big-game hunting has been a tremendous attraction, particularly to the wealthy Americans, and visitors from the continent. One wonders whether the time is not still there for this Minister, in conjunction with the Minister of Lands, to put aside some large tracts of Government areas and ultimately build up a game park. I know all game in South Africa is now under control. Cannot such a game park be established where overseas visitors could from time to time, naturally under licence and control, have the experience of hunting big game in our country instead of having to go to the northern states to seek that pleasure&#x003F;</p>

<p>We must also emphasize the important fact that we can offer all the big game fishing in our waters. Unfortunately, while the amateur has endeavoured to take advantage of the position and has done a tremendous lot of advertising and has had an enormous amount of pleasure out of it, I have no doubt, it has been left at that stage. I think it is the duty of the Government to let the sportsmen of the world know that these facilities are available. Possibly an exploration on the Minister&#x2019;s part in that direction may make big game fishing in our waters possible. We know our waters abound in all the big game fish. That should be a very big attraction to our country. We have the evidence that even the Prime Minister can prove that he can land a big fish. One must appreciate that if the proper facilities are made available this should prove a tremendous attraction. I do not know much about this matter, but I do know that we have tuna, marlin, sword fish, etc., in our waters.</p>

<p>I felt that I would like to make my contribution to this particular debate, Mr. Speaker. We in the Eastern Cape have much to offer. You will naturally understand, Sir, that we too would like to wish the Minister well in this undertaking. We hope he will apply himself to his task and that, in spite of this Government, we will still have a tremendous flow of visitors and immigrants to our country.</p>

<p>I did not think that this modest little Bill I was introducing would lead to such an interesting discussion, a discussion which found members lyrical, as in the case of the hon. member for Gordonia (Mr. G. P. Kotze), others sometimes critical but at any rate with good feeling. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) and I have often clashed in debates but even he wished me well and good luck in this new Department of Tourism. Hon. members who have spoken&#x2014;and I take it also those who have not taken part in the debate&#x2014;obviously know the tourist attractions of their constituencies well. Basically it is through them, through the local authorities, through the hotel trade and so forth that we shall be able to make our country attractive to visitors.</p>

<p>The debate covered the beauties of the bikini girls at Clifton up to the Gemsbuck Game Reserve in the North-western areas. It was practically a question of round the world in five hours. I appreciate the spirit of the debate and the fact that hon. members appreciate that tourism is a very big business undertaking and that it has great possibilities for South Africa. I can assure hon. members that their remarks, their suggestions and their criticisms will be carefully analysed by my Department. Where necessary their ideas and suggestions will be forwarded to Satour and to the Administrators who are part and parcel of our tourist organization. In that way we shall see to it that every attention is given to the matters raised. I believe criticism is a healthy thing. I do not regard it as a slander against Satour or the Department. I feel well-directed criticism can be very useful in the formulation of the best plan of attack. Of course there are occasions when criticism voiced in newspapers is not always correct. I just want to give hon. members an example of that. The hon. member for Wakkerstroom (Mr. Martins) referred to an Italian visitor, a member of a team, who had made certain complaints to the Press about what he had found in some of our national parks. When I first saw that in the Press I immediately took steps to find out whether he could be contacted in order to hear what the trouble was. I do not want to read the whole telex report but this is more or less the basis&#x2014;</p>

<p>We managed to contact him last night. He alleged that the newspapers had misreported him. He stated further that he never made any allegation against the Department of Tourism except that he thought the Department should contribute towards the improvement of facilities in national parks.</p>

<p>He has no knowledge of conditions in South Africa because the national parks are subsidized by the Government. The report goes on&#x2014;</p>

<p>Do vou have to have spaghetti in the Kruger National Park&#x003F; He also said that there were no facilities in the Kruger National Park to locate lions and elephants. According to the Press report, Sir, you would have thought that here was a sound case of real criticism. I was anxious to rectify anything that was wrong. I am still anxious to talk to this person. I have made arrangements to see him but that was the report of his criticism that I received up to now.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Hospital (Mr. Gorshel) seemed to think I was a little bit off <span class="col_4051-4052" refersTo="page_0718"/>handed and did not disclose sufficient information in regard to his question about hotels. I thought about that question very carefully. It only came up to-day. His question was: &#x201C;Whether he has been approached for Government assistance to build an international hotel&#x201D;. My reply to that was &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. &#x201C;If so, (a) on what date, (b) on behalf of which companies or persons was the approach made, (c) what was the nature of the representations and (d) what was the date of his reply; and (2) whether any assistance was promised; if so, what assistance&#x003F;&#x201D; The hon. member was reluctant to ask questions arising from the reply, and I thought the hon. member, with his business experience, had accepted the reply I gave him. The reply was this: &#x201C;(1) and (2) yes; discussions and negotiations are proceeding in respect of three international prestige hotels to be erected in Johannesburg. As soon as finality has been reached a full statement will be issued.&#x201D; Surely the hon. member does not expect me at this stage to say what the nature of the representations were, which persons or companies had made approaches or whether assistance had been promised. Surely when finality has been reached in connection with these matters is the time for a full statement. The hon. member said my reply was no reply to him and no reply to the people concerned. He referred to a newspaper report &#x2026;</p>

<p>Yes, which gave the name. I want to tell the hon. member that that newspaper report was apparently published in a morning paper. Before I had even seen that report I got a telephone call from the person who led the negotiations for that particular group. I made a note of what he said. He asked me whether I had seen the report and I said, no. He said it was an unauthorized statement not made by him and that I should just ignore it because there was no truth in it. In his criticism the hon. member tried to make out that the Government had failed in its duty with regard to encouraging these sort of hotels, that the Press report blamed the Government and that he accepted that report. The hon. member must not always believe what he sees in the Press. I do not blame them; they want to put over a story but he must not take it as such an accurate story that he can rely on it for his criticism.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>Certainly in Johannesburg. He said there was a shortage of hotels in Johannesburg. The hon. member knows the city of Johannesburg. He has been the mayor of Johannesburg. It has never been the function of a Government to produce hotels. That is the function of private enterprise and yet the Government is still trying to reach some basis on which three international hotels can be built in Johannesburg. I do not think the hon. member was right in his general criticism, based on an inaccurate report.</p>

<p>I want to come to the main point of dissension and that is the so-called Hotel Clause. The change that is taking place is a deletion of certain words. Instead of the words &#x201C;in respect of which application for such registration must be made to the board&#x201D; as the old Act read we have classification and registration without the qualification on application. There has never been an application for classification under that section of the Act. When it came to making amendments to the Act, which we had to do, this was obviously one of the sections we had to take into account. The hon. member for Von Brandis thought this was an unwise step. He said he was not really against the idea of classification but he thought this clause should be dropped. Of course, the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) is always extravagant. He said I was acting like a dictator; that I was taking arbitrary rights and powers; why did I not tell this House about a letter I had received from the Hotel Association, etc.&#x003F; The hon. member for Green Point also expressed some doubts about the Hotel Clause and I accept it in the spirit in which he expressed those doubts. He did not insinuate that I was taking some dictatorial powers. He asked whether it was advisable and he also referred to this letter. The position is quite straightforward.</p>

<p>I want to refer the hon. member for Von Brandis to the commission of which he was chairman in 1942-3. The following was one of the findings of that commission&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">There is a need for a properly compiled national classification of hotels based on South African hotel standards due regard being had to overseas standards, etc. Such classification should apply to all accommodation establishments.</block>

<p><span class="col_4053-4054" refersTo="page_0719"/>It was. a compulsory idea. If you go into the actual draft Bill that was suggested the hon. member, who was the chairman, said&#x2014;</p>

<p>I shall try to reply to the hon. member. I want to show hon. members that it is not a matter of taking dictatorial powers; it is a matter of whether it is wise to take certain steps. The whole basis of grading and registration in this measure was considered on the basis of compulsory classification. I want to point out to hon. members that this clause does not deal only with classification of hotels; it deals with classification of all accommodation. It deals, as it is stated in this Higgerty report, with all categories of hotels, tourist hotels, residential hotels, boarding houses, guest farms, holiday camps. I quite appreciate that a Hotel Commission is sitting. I quite appreciate that the Hotel Commission may think along the lines the hon. member for Von Brandis more or less decided in his report, was the correct approach. But this clause does not deal only with hotels. It deals with all sorts of accommodation establishments. Obviously when it comes to a body that is going to classify and grade hotels that will not necessarily be the same body that will classify and grade residential boarding houses. Therefore, all I wanted to make sure was that even when it came to other classifications it could not only be done on application. You must have the power to classify. All members have said it was right that we should classify. Can hon. members now say that caravan parks and hotels and such like should be classified only when the owner applies&#x003F; Surely one should have the right to classify them. As I said in my second-reading speech this is an enabling power covering many types of accommodation.</p>

<p>With regard to the Hotel Association, the hon. member for Green Point read that letter and I quite appreciate the views of the Hotel Association. Let me first read the reply I got from the Federated Association of Hotels which is the liquor side of the hotel industry. I wrote to them and I said: Look, as far as the compulsory classification of hotels is concerned, I am awaiting the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s Report, as I said in introducing the second-reading debate. I also said to them that when it comes to the compulsory classification of hotels and the commission&#x2019;s report and their recommendations, they could have the assurance that naturally I would call them in for discussion whatever the recommendations might be. I also do not know what the recommendations are going to be and the hotels are going to be directly involved. They are the people to discuss whatever board or whatever body should be established. The hon. member for Durban (Point) asked whether they would be represented on such board. All those things will have to be discussed, and these are the people you have got to discuss these matters. Even the Non-Liquor Association, if there is any recommendation like that, they must be consulted to see in what way a basis of classification arrangement can be reached. This is the letter, in reply, which I received from this Hotel Association&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My committee is grateful to you for your letter of 28 February, and your assurance that the functions of classifying or grading of hotels will not be given by you to Satour or any other body until the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s Report and recommendations had been studied, and whatever the recommendations may be, we shall have an opportunity of making our representations, before final implementation.</block>

<p>So there is no atmosphere of suspicion or anything like that. The hotels themselves realize that something is going to emerge from the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s Report, and I said to them that when the report comes I will study it and discuss it with them, and then a final decision will possibly be made. The hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) mentioned that there could be classification by Satour or some other body. I can assure him that I will not pass it on to Satour (that right I have) or any other body that might be suggested by the Hotel Commission, until the matter has been properly considered. That is one of the matters the commission went into. I want to see what their report has to say about it. I say therefore that I think there has been a bit of misunderstanding, in that this, is merely an enabling clause for all accommodation establishments, right along the line, and as far as the hotel industry is concerned they have the assurance that I have given them, and with which I intend naturally to comply. They will have every opportunity of putting their case, even after the Hotel Commission has made its recommendations and they have had the opportunity of studying these recommendations.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to anticipate the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s Report, but I should imagine that whatever body is put forward, will be a body which is representative of various interests, and the hotel industry will be one of those interests. I do not think for a moment that it will be otherwise. Naturally if they will make representations <span class="col_4055-4056" refersTo="page_0720"/>to me afterwards, I will consider what they have to say in the light of their representations. But their knowledge of the hotel industry is so essential to a board operating in this way that I have no doubt that something of that sort will be put forward.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#raw">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">RAW</person>:</from>

<p>Should the body be Satour, will the hotels be represented&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>If the body would be Satour, it would not be Satour as it exists at the present moment. As I see it, this would not happen, but if it were to be the case and an objection were raised, I would see to it that the hotel industry would be represented on that body dealing with hotel classification.</p>

<p>The next point on which I think there was a certain amount of misunderstanding was in regard to the position of Satour and the Department, or shall I say the Minister, because the Minister as it were can direct certain of these functions of Satour to be carried out by the Department or somebody else. I think the hon. member for Von Brandis (Mr. Higgerty) said that Satour was now a creature of the Minister&#x2019;s Department where previously it had been an autonomous body. But he seemed to accept that possibly there should be a more direct contact between the Minister and Satour. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) said that the Minister was assuming the functions of Satour, that the Minister intends to take over all the functions of Satour, that Satour would become merely an advisory board to the Minister, that it would be no longer an independent statutory body. Of course what the hon. member for Turffontein says is absolute nonsense. And I would put it to the hon. member for Von Brandis, who knows the position, that, in fact, Satour is still an independent autonomous body. He asked whether the Minister when taking over the board, would now insist that public service regulations must be applied to them in regard to the appointment of staff. But Satour&#x2019;s position has not been altered in that respect at all. Satour under Function 9 (a) can &#x201C;engage such employees as may be necessary and enter into contracts for the rendering of personal services by persons other than employees of the Corporation&#x201D;. The Minister&#x2019;s approval is not even necessary. Satour has that authority, and obviously therefore there is no thought whatever of the Minister trying to force another system onto Satour. In fact it is similar to other boards, such as agricultural boards which are also autonomous. There may be an arrangement between the Minister and the Satour Board when it comes to, shall we say, the salary of the Director or the salaries of the higher officials so that it does not get out of line with the ordinary salaries of the higher officials of the various Departments, but as far as their autonomy is concerned, there is no doubt about the position. I would say again to the hon. members that the whole purpose of this alteration is to create a more efficient tourist division of functions to have more co-ordination so that Satour instead of having a whole lot of functions, only some of which it can fulfil, will have certain functions allocated to it and other functions will be allocated elsewhere.</p>

<p>Then we come to another point which was raised in regard to the promotional material of Satour. Here again the hon. member for Turffontein said that the promotional material of Satour is wrong. He talked about the dusky maidens and the hairdo&#x2019;s and the hut in the kraal rather than the Clifton bikinis, he talked about braaivleise instead of luxurious restaurants, and he talked about posters of proteas and zebras which were quite inadequate and uninteresting. The hon. member for Von Brandis, however, said, and I know he meant it, that the promotional productions of Satour are excellent. He said that they are of world standard, accepted on all sides as such. Anybody who has seen Satour productions will say that they are of world class and they are recognized as world class. The hon. member for Turffontein said that we should have posters of Clifton, and posters of this and posters of that, but obviously the hon. member does not even know what Satour is doing. He had the annual reports before him. Even there, there is a statement in regard to Clifton, and Clifton Beach is shown in the book, showing Clifton and the attractions of this Riviera of the Cape. But besides that, there is &#x201C;Colourful South Africa&#x201D; which is issued to all the travel agents in quantities, with all the pictures beautifully done. You have the calendars which members have seen, which are sold and issued in limited numbers.</p>

<p>I am quite prepared to accept criticism but then there must be some substance in it, and to generalize and say that the promotional material is useless and is no good, is nonsense and useless criticism. There are the films that Satour has produced last year &#x201C;To Catch a Rhino&#x201D;, etc., and I want to say that in the one case the film &#x201C;Lake Wilderness&#x201D; with French commentary was entered for the 12th International Tourist and Folklore Film Week Exhibition held under the auspices of an international organization, when 34 countries entered films. &#x201C;Lake Wilderness&#x201D; was awarded the floating trophy by the Belgian Minister. So the material is good and I have no hesitation in saying that on that score Satour cannot be criticized. But of course if the hon. member for Turffontein thinks that South Africa can be changed into a tourist attraction of night clubs with that sort of atmosphere, he does not understand the position of South Africa. South Africa will never be a night club country. It has got too many outdoor attractions. It has got swimming, sports, all these day-time amenities.</p>

<speech by="#van_der_byl">

<from><span class="col_4057-4058" refersTo="page_0721"/>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about a night club country like Paris. But if we have good restaurants and good food in the restaurants, we should be satisfied. I think South Africa will never be a country which will attract tourists who want to play about until 3 or 4 in the morning. For my part I am not going to put any efforts into changing this atmosphere so that we can attract that sort of tourists.</p>

<p>Then he came to the matter of accommodation raised by the hon. member for Von Brandis. I appreciate that with his knowledge of the hotel industry he realizes that it can be a bottleneck, and this Hotel Commission is also tackling the hotel industry as a whole. The negotiations with the Government are not in regard to what hon. members call generally luxury hotels. What I referred to in regard to the speech of the hon. member for Hospital, is an international prestige hotel, which is a luxury hotel, but where there is an international call for an hotel. That is why even before the Hotel Commission&#x2019;s Report has come forward, the Government was prepared to consider ways and means of attracting that sort of hotel.</p>

<p>I do not want to go into a lot of figures that I have here, because the hon. member for Von Brandis asked whether some of our efforts and expenditure in certain countries is worthwhile. I have a lot of figures here. In many cases the expenditure to bring tourists here is fairly cheap, R10, R20, in Australia where the office has only been going for two years it costs R50 per visitor for every man who comes here. But on the average they calculate the cost per visitor as R2.69, and they say that each tourist spends approximately R320 in South Africa. That includes the Rhodesias as well, and that is the average as a whole. The hon. member for Pretoria (West) (Mr. van der Walt) referred to tourist market research, and I know that Satour is giving attention to that in various directions, but undoubtedly if one really wants to tackle tourism in all its aspects, then one must be sure by research that you are going in the right direction, and I think considerable attention will have to be given to that aspect.</p>

<p>As I have said, the points made by hon. members and their suggestions and criticisms will be analysed and tabulized.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_tourism">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF TOURISM</person>:</from>

<p>I can give hon. members a few figures which I held back because I thought time was running short. But let me give a few of these items to hon. members. In 1948, there were 25,000 overseas visitors and in 1962 the number was 36,000. The European Continent was excluded from those figures after 1959-60 when the office in Frankfurt was opened, but the figure for the U.K. was approximately 1959-60 R6, 1960-1, R5&#x00BD;, 1961-2, R7, 1962-3, R6&#x00BD;. Those are very rough figures which I calculated by taking the number of visitors and the expenditure in each case. As far as the European Continent is concerned, Frankfurt started in 1959, and the figures are: R5 in 1960 and R8&#x00BD; for 1960-1, R11&#x00BD; for 1961-2, and R10 for 1962-3. They are rough figures to give hon. members an idea. The work in North America is much more expensive. There the figures were R28, R30, R35 and R40 per visitor. Australia, where we have only had an office for two years, the cost was approximately R50 for each visitor that has come to this country.</p>

<p>I would say in conclusion that I realize that the Department of Tourism will again come under discussion when the Vote comes before this House, not only this year, but also in future years, and members will expect me as Minister to be answerable to them for various points that have been raised now. All I can say is that I appreciate the underlying goodwill that exists on all sides of the House that a success should be made of this Department and of tourism for South Africa, and I can assure them that I will do all I can to see that that comes about.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>It is well known that the South African legislation dealing with bills of exchange, cheques and promissory notes, and which was enacted separately by the four provinces, was modelled on the lines of the British Bills of Exchange Act, 1882. In 1957, however, the British Act was amended in such a way that it is no longer necessary for banks in the United Kingdom <span class="col_4059-4060" refersTo="page_0722"/>to ensure that cheques and other similar negotiable documents are properly endorsed when they are deposited by the drawees directly into their own banking account for collection. This step resulted in the elimination of a vast amount of unproductive work, particularly as far as banking institutions are concerned, and in 1955 the British example was followed by the then Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Some years ago a joint committee, on which commerce and industry, the mining industry, the building societies, etc., were represented, made representations to the Government for the introduction of similar amending legislation in the Republic. The Cabinet agreed and the necessary bills of exchange amending Bill was introduced during the 1962 session but it was not proceeded with after the first reading. Hon. members will remember that in 1963 the amending Bill was referred to a select committee after the first reading. The select committee recommended that the Bill as submitted by it should be proceeded with. As a result of the fact, however, that Parliament was faced with a full legislative programme last session, the Bill as submitted by the select committee was not proceeded with.</p>

<p>It was always our intention, after having brought about the amendments referred to, to translate and to consolidate the various preunion provincial measures, which were enacted in English only. Having regard to the new rules of this House it was decided to introduce one Bill to consolidate and amend the various laws dealing with bills of exchange, cheques and promissory notes rather than to amend the four different laws that we have in the four provinces at the present time. The amended provisions, as they were adopted by the select committee, are incorporated in this consolidating measure.</p>

<p>Hon. members have probably noticed that we have also brought about a number of minor amendments. On the face of it it looks as though we are bringing about many more amendments than those proposed by the select committee, but the reason for that is that we were faced here with quite an exceptional problem as far as consolidating legislation is concerned. We were faced with the problem, not of consolidating quite a number of laws enacted by one legislative authority from time to time, but of consolidating four different provincial ordinances which differed from one another in certain respects, and we felt that the best way to tackle it, where differences existed, was to indicate where those differences existed. Usually the position in the Cape, the Transvaal and the Free State were more or less the same, but the Natal legislation followed a different form. In some cases we accepted the Natal method and in other cases we accepted the system prevailing in the other three provinces. The result of that is that it looks as though this Bill contains quite a large number of amendments. May I just give an example to indicate what our problem was and why it looks as though there are large numbers of amendments. If hon. members will look at Section 3<i>bis</i> in Clause 3 they will see that the whole of Section 3<i>bis</i> is now being deleted. Section 3<i>bis</i> sets out the Natal form, and it is interesting to see what the Natal form was.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>That is so, but I hope that this is no longer the feeling in Natal. The Natal legislation reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An inland bill is a bill which is, or on the face of it purports to be, both drawn and payable within the province of Natal. Any other bill is a foreign bill.</block>

<p>Well, I think that provision in the Natal ordinance is no longer of force and effect but we had to indicate it here as though we are bringing about a change whereas in actual fact the position is not being changed. Then there are two other cases which I might just mention to hon. members. I refer to Clause 57. There it looks as though a new provision is being inserted. I read out the English text because the original is in the English language only. In this Bill the clause reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A bill is discharged by payment in due course or is discharged proportionally by payment of part of the amount for which the bill is drawn, noted by endorsement on the bill &#x2026;</block>

<p>That is not a new provision that we are inserting here; This actually sets out what the position was in the Transvaal, the Free State and the Cape, but in Natal the position was slightly different. There they stated it very briefly and succinctly&#x2014;</p>

<p>A bill is discharged by payment in due course if such payment be made by or on behalf of the drawee or acceptor.</p>

<p>I just want to add too that in Clause 58 there are certain words which should really have been underlined, namely the proviso. Hon. members will observe that the proviso has not been underlined, but I draw attention to this because it has been brought to my notice by the law advisers. The proviso in Clause 58 does not appear in the Natal law either, and this portion of the clause should therefore have been underlined, just as in the case of Clause 57 which I have read out.</p>

<p>The only other point which is really of interest and which I want to mention just to illustrate what our problem was in consolidating the various laws, is contained in Clause 62. There, as hon. members will see, we have underlined the first words as though they represent a new insertion: &#x201C;If a bill or an acceptance is materially altered, the liability of all parties who were parties to the Bill at the date of alteration and who did not assent to it, must be regarded as if the alteration had not been made, but any party who has in <span class="col_4061-4062" refersTo="page_0723"/>himself made, authorized or assented to the alteration, and all subsequent endorsers are liable on the bill as altered.&#x201D; The Natal Section 62 read somewhat differently; it read as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Where a bill or an acceptance is materially altered without the assent of all parties liable on the bill, the bill is discharged except as against the party who has himself made, authorized or assented to the alteration and subsequent endorsers.</block>

<p>The actual meaning has not been altered here but the clause has been drafted in a different form.</p>

<p>Hon. members may want to know perhaps why we decided in certain cases to follow the Natal text and in other cases the text which appears in the law of the other three provinces. Well, as far as possible we were guided by what is the actual banking practice at the present time, and to make quite sure that we were on the right track, that this was not just the interpretation of my Department or of the legal draftsman, I asked Mr. Greenlees, a retired general manager of Barclays Bank, who is at present a director of the bank, to go through these clauses and to tell us whether the clauses, as incorporated in this Bill, were in agreement with the existing banking practice. Mr. Greenlees also went through the three important clauses which I have read out, but they were also examined by Mr. Beattie, the assistant general manager of Barclays Bank, together with all the other clauses, and they reported to me that these clauses were in conformity with the existing practice of the banks. For all practical purposes therefore, hon. members can take it from me that they need not really take much notice of all the square brackets and the solid lines indicating omissions and insertions. The important change which is actually being brought about here is the change which is being effected on the recommendation of the select committee and to which I have already referred.</p>

<p>Before I conclude I should like to refer to the second report of the select committee on the subject of the Bills of Exchange Amendment Bill. The committee recommended that the Government should consider the advisability of prohibiting the use of receipt forms at the back of cheques in the future. This aspect was discussed with the Reserve Bank and the commercial banks. In the light of our discussions with these bodies, I do not consider it desirable to pass legislation to prohibit the use of receipt forms on cheques in view of the fact that this is something which can be rectified administratively. An agreement was eventually arrived at with the banks that the banks themselves would try to discourage their clients from using the backs of cheques for the purpose of obtaining receipts. It is generally felt, however, that as soon as these amending provisions become law, receipts at the backs of cheques will automatically disappear. That is why I cannot accept this recommendation. The banks have given me an undertaking that they themselves will urge upon their clients that this is redundant. Their own feeling is that this will take place automatically. In actual fact therefore the only new provision here is the provision that if a drawee pays a cheque into his own account he need not endorse the back of the cheque. This provision, as I have already said, is one which will eliminate a tremendous amount of unproductive work.</p>

<p>We support this Bill which brings the law into line with modern mercantile and banking practice. I think the Minister can be criticized for not either referring this matter to a select committee or submitting a White Paper on the Bill. As the Minister indicated in his opening remarks, and as the Schedule to the Bill shows, it affects some ten statutes, one going as far back as 1862. Here we have a Bill which, as the Minister said in the course of his remarks, is not a consolidating Bill, as is generally known in the parliamentary sense. It is a Bill which takes various portions of the various statutes and ordinances in the various provinces, and as the Minister rightly says, it takes the best and the most practical portions of those statutes and imports those into the text of this Bill. It would be far easier to examine the Bill in greater detail if one had the advantage of a White Paper or, alternatively, if this Bill could have been referred to a select committee and the various interested parties could be called to give their views and criticisms and to make suggestions to improve the Bill. Last year a Bill which was not nearly as important as this one, in regard to bills of exchange, was referred to a select committee, which heard the views of interested parties, and the Bill which came back to Parliament was virtually an agreed measure. Here we are altering statutes which have been in operation for many years in the various provinces, and while we rightly agree that there should be consolidation at this stage we think there should have been an opportunity to have a fuller explanation than that given by the Minister. The Minister has given us a very sketchy explanation of the Bill. We are surely entitled to more than that in a Bill of this nature. The Minister has practised at the Bar with some success and I think he will agree with me that the bills of exchange practice and some of the cases he lost and won must have convinced him that in practice a bill of exchange is not as simple as the Minister appears to believe, judging from his remarks. We trust that if the Minister proposes introducing any further financial measures of this kind, he will come to Parliament with a White Paper. That is the way to treat Parliament. While we support the Bill, we do suggest that it might have been wiser to refer the matter to a select committee, and submitted a White Paper. As far as we can ascertain from the interested parties and the various banks and the members of the accounting and the legal professions, there is general acceptance of this Bill, but that is no excuse for the <span class="col_4063-4064" refersTo="page_0724"/>Minister not giving Parliament the benefit of a White Paper so that we can see in greater detail the effect of all the various amendments to the statutes and proclamations and ordinances which have been the background of bills of exchange in practice in the mercantile and banking life of this country. With those words I support the second reading of the Bill.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>It is tragic and shocking to hear the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) criticising the Minister for not having issued a White Paper, and because the Bill has not been referred to a Select Committee. Have the Opposition now descended to such a level that they can no longer think for themselves and cannot check a law and see what is good, and that the Minister has to explain everything to them by way of a White Paper, or that every little piece of legislation introduced here has to be referred to a select Committee&#x003F; It seems to me the Opposition is no longer willing to work. They are tired and paralysed. The hon. member should rather devote his time to studying the laws and then coming forward with something positive.</p>

<p>I think we can congratulate and thank the hon. the Minister and the Department for having come forward with these amendments in this consolidating legislation. Ten Acts and ordinances are now being repealed. Things have been very difficult, but now these things have been made easier. However as the Minister has said, a few new things are added, which have been accepted by the Banks. I do not know why there should be a Select Committee now. I think we as a House of Assembly are capable of dealing with these matters ourselves and to make certain recommendations.</p>

<p>I should like to throw out a few suggestions for the consideration of the House, and draw the attention of the hon. the Minister to some new ideas which might be considered, if not now then later. Section 57 now provides very clearly that when a bill is partly paid, it may be endorsed to that effect. That is a very good thing, for one frequently finds that when a Bill has to be met, the party who has to pay cannot always pay in full, and now this can be done. I should like to ask the Minister whether this is not the occasion for introducing a uniform form of bill in our law. When a Bill is accepted and transferred, it sometimes is so completely covered with signatures and stamps that one is unable to ascertain what the true position is. Is it not possible to specify some standard form in the Act, with spaces for the signatures of the endorser and the acceptor&#x003F; If that were done, it will be much easier for the parties dealing with it. for the banks, and it will eliminate much of the time unnecessarily wasted in searching for signatures.</p>

<p>This brings me to my next point, namely our cheques. Section 83 provides that businesses no longer have to endorse cheques when they are banked. Of course this has it&#x2019;s pro&#x2019;s and it&#x2019;s con&#x2019;s. A fairly large branch of a bank handles between 20,000 and 30,000 cheques per day, and now the bank officials have to check that large number of cheques every day to see whether all the endorsements are in order, and that is a tremendous waste of time. But there is another factor worrying me, and that is that when a cheque is deposited in a bank account, and it is not stipulated or endorsed upon its reverse side to which account it has gone, and it is returned unpaid which account is then going to be credited by the Bank&#x003F; That is something the banks will have to do, namely to see to it that when such a cheque is deposited in an account, which is not drawn in favour of the account in which it has been deposited, the signature or the stamp of the account in which it is deposited is endorsed on it. But taken by and large, this is a very great improvement and in spite of this objection I have, it is a great advantage too.</p>

<p>However, there is another aspect I should like to mention and that is unpaid cheques. The present position is that a cheque is not really legal tender. A creditor need not accept a cheque in payment, and if he does accept a cheque he really does so as conditional payment of the debt. If the cheque is returned unpaid, he may sue the creditor on the original debt, or he may sue the drawer of that cheque on the basis of his obligations as guarantor on the cheque itself. When it is a cash transaction and the cheque comes back unpaid, the person who has received the cheque may at once recover his goods, if it is not too long afterwards. Then we have the position also that if there has been fraud in connection with a dishonoured cheque, criminal action may be instituted, but then we place upon the State the onus of proving that there has been fraud. As regards these unpaid cheques, there are an enormous number of cheques that are returned unpaid in our country. To me a cheque is as much an economic article as anything else, such as a tin of fish one buys. It is something you give as a consideration for something you have received. I have gone into the position and I find that in England and in Germany there is no such rule of law that the issue of a cheque which is subsequently returned unpaid is an offence <i>per se.</i> There may be fraud, but then the onus is on the State to prove that there has been fraud. In the U.S.A. all the States have the so-called &#x201C;Bad Check Laws&#x201D;. In terms of those Acts, the drawer is given a specified period of time in which the matter may be out right after such a cheque has been returned unpaid. In the U.S.A. it is an offence to issue a cheque if the drawer does not have funds in his account to meet that cheque and there is an intention to defraud. No mention of punishable offences in this particular connection is made in the laws of the Netherlands. However, under the criminal law of that country, such an act may be <span class="col_4065-4066" refersTo="page_0725"/>regarded as fraud, and dealt with as such. In Switzerland the law is somewhat more stringent. There the issue of cheques which are returned to the drawer is not permissible. However, it is not clear to me whether it is regarded as a punishable offence if this does in fact happen. In Belgium the position is very interesting, and that is what I really wish to urge upon the Minister. Imprisonment for one to two years as well as a fine may be imposed where a person knowingly issued a cheque without having cover for that cheque in his bank account. This legislation in Belgium has resulted in very few cheques being returned in Belgium, and I should like to urge the hon. the Minister to consider whether the time has not arrived for it to be made an offence when a cheque is returned, and for this procedure which has been adopted in Belgium to be adopted in our country also.</p>

<p>Then I should like to mention a few other small points. My remarks do not apply to this legislation only, but they contain a few general thoughts in respect of all laws, and I have come across these points in this Bill too incidentally. The one is in regard to the use of Latin expressions. A few years ago we had a private motion in this House which urged that Latin should be dispensed with as a pre-requisite for the admission of attorneys. The question has occurred to me: When we pass legislation here, do we adhere to our official languages, English and Afrikaans&#x003F; But no, I see now that this Act teem; with Latin expressions. It reminds me so much of a haunch of game stuffed with bacon. It is very tasty, but the bacon is not good for one&#x2019;s health, and I think these Latin terms are not so good for the person who does not know Latin. I should like to mention only a few, amongst others &#x201C;prima facie&#x201D; in Clauses 28 and 34. I think we could very easily substitute the English expression &#x201C;on the face of it&#x201D; or the Afrikaans expression &#x201C;op die oog af&#x201D; for it. These Acts should not be only for the man who has taken Latin, and others who have not taken Latin must go to an attorney every time to ask what it means, or otherwise he must look up a Latin dictionary. I think we should draft our Acts in such a way in English and Afrikaans, without using these Latin terms, that anybody can understand them clearly. Next there is the expression &#x201C;mutatis mutandis&#x201D; which means &#x201C;with the necessary changes&#x201D;. Incidentally, in Clause 98(2) the Afrikaans expression is used once. Then I should like to draw attention to Clause 20. Here we have a reference to those two Latin laws the &#x201C;Senatus consultum Velleianum&#x201D; which means that a woman may not be a surety for anybody, and the second the &#x201C;Authentica si qua mulier&#x201D; which means that a woman may not be surety for her husband.</p>

<p>A few years ago I had this interesting case in Pretoria, that where these terms are used, you have to take your wife to the attorney and he then explains to her what all this means. When I arrived in the attorney's office, and he had to explain it to me, I asked him what those words really meant, and he merely explained to me that there are certain restrictions to which a woman is subject, and those restrictions were now being eliminated, and he could not explain more closely to me what the meaning of those words was. He said he had studied Latin for years and years, but he had forgotten it. Surely that is not what we want in this country to-day.</p>

<p>This then brings me to these two laws. I feel the time has arrived for us to do away with these two laws. I wish to urge that the right of a woman under these two laws should be done away with. What is the real position of a woman at the present time&#x003F; The position of a woman has changed considerably since these two laws were originally inherited from the Roman-Dutch law. We find that in their book &#x201C;Kontraktereg en Handelsreg&#x201D;, De Wet and Yeats tell us that the capacity and the incapacity of a woman are curtailed to some extent by these two laws, but sometimes there may be exceptions. I should like to read only this little paragraph (Translated):</p>

<block name="quote">In the following cases a woman cannot invoke this safeguard, viz. (i) where she has waived the safeguard after it has been explained fully to her.</block>

<p>This is really the case where she has appeared before an attorney and he has enlightened her. At the present time we have women who are themselves doing big business, and I think it is quite superfluous to take a woman to an attorney so that he may enlighten her and tell her just what I have already said here. The second case is where she assumes the debt of somebody who is her creditor. Then it does not apply either. Thirdly, where, after two years, she confirms the assumption of debt; fourthly, where she has been benefitted by the assumption of debt, or has received a consideration for it; fifthly, where she has fraudulently held herself out to be the principal debtor of joint principal debtor; sixthly, where the creditor is a minor and the principal debtor is unable to pay; and, finally, where the woman is a public trader and the Act relates to her trade. Those are the instances in which she cannot invoke this protection. I should like to mention only one example of what happens in connection with our cheques at the present time. When a woman pays her rent by cheque, and subsequently it appears that she has stood surety for her husband, she may recover that rent. For these reasons I am pleading that this matter should receive attention.</p>

<p>Then there are a few other things. I found it in this legislation also incidentally, and once again this is only a thought with reference to what I have said already, namely that our Acts should be readable and uniform. I am thinking, among other things, of my articled <span class="col_4067-4068" refersTo="page_0726"/>clerks. This is one of the Acts they must know, and if it is difficult to understand, they cannot be expected to consult an attorney. Nor can I expect it from the man in the street to do it every day. In Clauses 68 and 100 &#x201C;namptissement&#x201D; is referred to. This really means a provisional sentence. I should like to urge that when our legislation is drafted it should be done in simple language. I know the legal draftsmen disagree with me. Personally I premier to have the Act in flowing reading language, but I shall not evoke further arguments on that.</p>

<p>There is another matter I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, and that is the mode of modification of a dishonoured bill, that is to say, when a Bill is not met and is returned. As soon as a Bill has been refused by nonacceptance or non-payment, the holder has to give the drawer and every indorser notice, because they are virtually the sureties. A drawer or indorser who has not yet received notice, is discharged from his obligations as guarantor. But now we find that if the holder of such a Bill which has not been met has given the drawer and the indorser notice, this is not sufficient. He has to go still further and protest the Bill in order to recover from the drawer and the indorser, and it is not sufficient for that holder merely to notify him that payment has been refused. In order to facilitate proof in Court that there has not been payment, he has to go still further and have a return of debt drawn by a notary, which we call a protest. The fact that the Bill has not been paid, has to be set forth fully there. Now, if a Bill is refused, there has to be due protest through that notary, and now I ask what are all the things that notary has to do and who is he&#x003F;</p>

<p>In ordinary practical life, a notary is a very important person. In former years we found that in the towns the notary, together with the minister of religion and the teacher really was the prominent person in the town, and the man carried much weight. When we refer to the Admission of Attorneys, Notaries and Conveyancers Act No. 23 of 1934, we find a definition of &#x201C;notary&#x201D;. I just want to quote Section 23 which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<p>The court may, upon application made in the manner prescribed by this Act, admit and enrol as a notary, any attorney who produces proof that&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) he is an attorney admitted to practise as such by such court; and</li>

<li>(b) he has not at any time been struck off the roll or suspended from practice, and that no proceedings are pending to strike his name off the roll or to suspend him from practice; and</li>

<li>(c) he has passed the practical examination referred to in paragraph (b) of section <i>twenty-seven.</i></li>

</ol>

<p>In other words, the notary virtually is the cream of that profession. This shows us they are picked men. This notary always had to make that return. It is a very involved matter and it is difficult, but an exception has also been made now that where there is no notary available, a landowner or the head of a family &#x2014;which are new expressions in this Act (formerly it was an affluent inhabitant)&#x2014;may go with two witnesses to protest that Bill. Then they have to take that Bill to the person who accepted it and present it again, and if he then refuses, this return is drawn up. Mr. Speaker, I say that is completely obsolete and unnecessary and so I should like to urge that this should also be reconsidered. Any businessman, any honourable person&#x2014;not one of these members of Parliament may protest his own Bill. I am thinking of men like Mr. Harry Oppenheimer, Dr. Anton Rupert and all these big businessmen. Surely they are not men who will go to court fraudulently when they certify that a Bill was not paid when presented. I think that to make things easier in commerce our Courts should be in a position to accept this also, that when it is stipulated that a Bill has been duly presented by the business undertaking itself, regard should be had to that, and this red tape of a notary as well as a land owner or occupier with two witnesses should be eliminated.</p>

<p>Those are a few thoughts I should like to bring to the Minister&#x2019;s attention, but I should like to express my gratitude and pay tribute to those concerned for having consolidated this Act. It facilitates things for us and it is uniform and practical. Our banks in general welcome it and the future will show that the labour of the Minister and the Department will be appreciated. If the Act can be amended in future, I hope these matters will receive the Minister&#x2019;s attention.</p>

<speech by="#plewman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">PLEWMAN</person>:</from>

<p>No one wants to oppose this Bill or to quibble about it, except the hon. member for Pretoria-Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl). For myself, I thought this was a very pleasant change to have before this House a Bill which did not call for any party or political approach, but the hon. member for Sunnyside obviously thinks differently. He tried to make a political issue of it by criticizing the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) for doing what was precisely his duty as a member of the Opposition in a democratic Parliament. I think it was a sorry demonstration of lack of experience of parliamentary procedure on the part of the hon. member. The tabling of White Papers in the case of a Bill like this is traditional in parliamentary practice and the use of Select Committees is equally well established practice. In fact, what the hon. member for Sunnyside has done is to make out a very good case why this Bill should have been referred to a Select Committee. I hope, therefore, that he at any rate has convinced the hon. the Minister that that would have been the correct procedure to adopt. Then the hon. member would have had an opportunity of raising the matters which he <span class="col_4069-4070" refersTo="page_0727"/>has raised, and they might have been dealt with and considered by the Select Committee, which could get expert advice from outside in dealing with the problem. I am sorry that the hon. member&#x2019;s lack of knowledge of Latin should make him critical of making use of Latin phrases which are not only concise and apt but which are used and well understood throughout the whole of the commercial world. Sir, trade and commerce are not confined to the narrow ambits of South Africa alone. Bills of Exchange are an internationally accepted method of dealing with financial transactions in trade and commerce. I am sorry for the hon. member but it seems to me to be perfectly correct and right that the terms which are well known and well understood and accepted throughout the trading world should be maintained. Sir, the hon. member got rid of a lot of views in dealing with the Bill. I do not intend dealing with those remarks of his; I hardly think this is the place to do so. Those remarks would have been apt in a Select Committee where you not only have the opportunity to air such views but to get the advice of experts in dealing with the matter. But I leave it to the hon. the Minister to deal with that aspect of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech. He gives me the impression of being somewhat ambitious to follow in the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s footsteps. I leave the matter there.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister would have been wise if he had adopted the procedure that was adopted last session and if he had sent this Bill to a Select Committee for consideration. It could easily have been done. The Bill was read a first time on 6 February and there was ample time in which to submit the Bill as a whole to the Select Committee&#x2014;possibly the same Committee that dealt with the main additional portion of the Bill last Session. Speaking for myself I think it is unfortunate that changes other than those recommended by the Select Committee of last Session has been included in the Bill. I say that because the law on Bills of exchange has thus far had a remarkable history of what I should call freedom from legislative intervention or legislative attention, and this is so because, in the words of an official witness who gave evidence before the Select Committee last year&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Bills of Exchange law in South Africa is looked upon as amongst the best conceived and best tried legislation on the Statute Book.</block>

<p>That is indeed high praise from somebody who is not concerned with the political issues, who views this Bill and the law on bills of exchange as they should be viewed, and I think it is a complete answer to the criticism of the hon. member for Sunnyside. It is because the bills of exchange law has had this high prestige that the Department itself has always been prepared to leave well alone. We therefore find that few changes have been made. It is very highly specialized legislation, and I think it is well left alone. That is my criticism of the Minister for not sending it to a Select Committee, even for the lesser changes which have been made, a few of which the hon. the Minister has dealt with. Sir, as the hon. the Minister has indicated, the law on bills of exchange in South Africa was modelled on the British law of bills of exchange. The first bit of legislation in South Africa goes as far back as 1862. It has worked so well that only on four occasions since Union has it been found necessary to introduce minor changes and amendments. What is taking place now is not strictly a consolidation of the law on bills of exchange; it is rather the telescoping into one comprehensive measure of four pre-Union laws on the subject plus the four Union laws which apply to one or other of the pre-Union laws. As the hon. the Minister has indicated, although all four pre-Union laws were modelled on the British legislation, there were differences in each, and it is extremely difficult to determine how those differences are now being reconciled in this comprehensive measure or to find out to what extent this telescoping process will affect those differences. I am sorry that the hon. the Minister did not exercise that same care in regard to this Bill by seeing that difficulties of this nature were removed. This is a highly specialized piece of legislation. I can only say that one must be cautious because you tamper with it at the peril of commerce, trade, banking and finance. I know of no other law on our Statute Book which allows for the smooth running of trade, internal and external, as does this bills of exchange law. Paradoxically every single member of this House has some knowledge of the law of bills of exchange, but I am quite sure that I do nobody any wrong, not even the member for Sunnyside, when I say that cumulatively all that knowledge just remains &#x201C;a little knowledge.&#x201D; As you know, Sir, in most matters, but certainly in a matter of this intricate nature a little knowledge is indeed dangerous. I have indicated that this is something more than a consolidating measure as is contemplated in the Standing Orders of this House, numbers 54 and 70. The safeguards which are provided under that procedure are therefore absent in the case of this Bill. One must therefore accept on trust from the hon. the Minister that the changes which have been introduced will also stand the test of practice and of judicial interpretation, along with the old provisions of the Bill. I hope however that this comprehensive measure will also adorn the Statute Book and will in time also be looked upon &#x201C;as amongst the best conceived and the best tried legislation on the Statute Book.&#x201D; I accept the Minister&#x2019;s statement in regard to the additional recommendation which was made by the Select Committee last year about doing away with receipts on bills of exchange. I share the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s views that in time practice alone will eliminate that. Sir, as my hon. colleague has indicated, the Bill will have the support of this side of the House at the second reading.</p>

<p>As the hon. member who has just sat down has said, this measure <span class="col_4071-4072" refersTo="page_0728"/>will, of course, receive the support of this side of the House in principle. In principle I submit that there is no more complicated law than the laws relating to Bills of exchange and promissory notes. I am sure the hon. the Minister who is an eminent silk in his own right would agree with that. This uncertainty and differing law that we have in the Republic is something which I think we must do away with as soon as we can in all the spheres in which this operates. I think that in this sphere this is perhaps more necessary because of the interchange to-day of these notes from one province to another. But, Sir, this Bill affects Natal more particularly than it does any other province, because, as the Minister has pointed out, where there is a difference in the law, usually it is a difference between Natal and all the other provinces.</p>

<p>Yes, I do remember that. I had to deal with Bills of exchange when I practised at the Bar and I cannot pretend that I know very much about Bills of exchange. In fact, the people who are usually one&#x2019;s clients in Natal are the people who know more about it than the person whose advice they come to seek, nl. the Indian merchants. The Indian merchants, so far as I am aware, deal almost exclusively, in their dealings with one another in the Grey Street area, in promissory notes and bills of exchange&#x2014; mostly promissory notes&#x2014;and I think the Queen Street branches of the banks there must be the banking experts in promissory notes in the Republic. It is particuarly because in Natal the practice and the law are going to change so much that I am so disappointed that the hon. the Minister has not put out a White Paper and has not referred this Bill to a select Committee.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>That is just what we do not have. The hon. member who has just made that interjection was the chairman of the Select Committee which dealt with this Bill last year, and he knows as well as anybody else that this whole concept of bills of exchange, the laws relating to Bills of exchange and promissory notes, are so extraordinary and so complicated and so unfounded apparently in any sort of normal processes of legal thought that one has the greatest difficulty in grasoing what they mean. Indeed the Select Committee said in its report that although it was agreeable to recommend the amendments to the legislation which were pilt before it in the draft bill, nevertheless it said that it felt that they were not necessary at all. Sir, this is the state of affairs that we have in relation to the laws on bills of exchange. We have a Select Committee saying. &#x201C;Yes we think you should pass legislation, but we do not think the legislation is necessary because we do not think in fact, so far as the law is concerned, that any change is really warranted.&#x201D; But the banks&#x2019; practice was such that the banks insisted that they would not change their practice unless the law was changed. Sir, this is the sort of impasse in which we find ourselves with this law. This Bill particularly needs to go to a Select Committee. If the hon. the Minister felt, as he obviously did, that the amending Bill of last year, which only amended the law relating to the endorsement of cheques should go to the Select Committee, then surely this Bill should go to the Select Committee.</p>

<p>Sir, let us have a look at this Bill. It is a Bill &#x201C;to consolidate and amend the laws relating to bills of exchange, cheques and promissory notes&#x201D;. But we have in this Bill the new format of amendments used, where words in bold type in square brackets indicate omissions proposed by the Minister on introduction, and words underlined with a solid line indicate insertions proposed by the Minister. Sir, it took me a long time to discover which of the various Colonial Acts we were dealing with here was the original to which things were being added and from which things were being taken away. It seemed to me that the Transvaal law was the one to which all these square brackets and solid lines referred. I was quite wrong in that regard because as the hon. the Minister indicated 3 <i>bis</i> was taken out and 3 <i>bis</i> obviously should only have applied in Natal. So we have a document which purports to be something which is being amended; it has square brackets indicating omissions and solid lines indicating insertions, and nobody knows from which Statute omissions are being made and into which Statute insertions are being made; and indeed whether it is being taken from one Statute and put into another, or whether it is something that the Minister&#x2019;s Department has taken out of the air and put into all of them, one simply does not know.</p>

<p>It is a very difficult Bill to read, and the only way in which you can properly read it would be to take all four Colonial Statutes, to put them all before you, to look at the Bill and then decide in what way this has been changed. But it is even worse than that because. as the hon. the Minister indicated, the wording of the Statute has also been changed. Although the law is as it was and always has been and is just a translation of the centuries-old custom relating to these matters, the wording has been slightly modernized or slightly jazzed up, but in the result are any changes made&#x003F; Sir, this is precisely what a Select Committee ought to look at. If the hon. the Minister were introducing a normal consolidating Bill &#x2026;</p>

<p>The Bill is certified to be a consolidating measure by the law adviser.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Of course, the hon. the Minister is quite right, but what he overlooks is that if in any Bill you have words in bold type in square brackets indicating omissions, then you know that the words omitted appear in the Statute referred to in the Bill which is being repealed, and there is usually one Statute, but here we have four different Colonial Statutes.</p>

<p>Let us have a look at some of these things. There is 3<i>bis,</i> for example, to which the hon. the Minister himself pointed; it relates to inland and foreign bills. Obviously that comes out of the Natal Statute, but how is anyone to know that but for the fact that reference is made in it to Natal&#x003F; You have a number of these examples on page 5. There you have a solid line drawn alongside (3)(c) and (d), indicating that these two paragraphs are insertions proposed by the Minister. Let me quote them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">(c) A statement on the bill that it is drawn against specified documents attached thereto for delivery on acceptance or on payment of the bill, as the case may be; or</block>

<block name="quote">(d) a statement on the bill that it is drawn under or against a specified letter of credit or other similar authority.</block>

<p>Sir, these provisions already appear in the Cape legislation but I do not think they appear in the Transvaal legislation, so this leads me to believe that the basic law which is being inserted here and subtracted from and added to is the Transvaal law, because those provisions did not appear in the Transvaal law. But how is anyone reading this to know that that is the position&#x003F;</p>

<p>Anyone in the Cape reading this might think that this is something new. In fact, in the Cape this is not something new; these provisions have always been there. But if you look at the Bill you would think that this was a new provision which was being inserted. Who decided that these provisions should be applied to the Transvaal&#x003F; Why was it decided that this should happen rather than that these two paragraphs should come out of the Cape law so as to conform with the Transvaal law&#x003F;</p>

<p>There is another example on page five. Clause 5 (2) (c) refers to a bill which may be drawn payable &#x201C;to the holder of an office&#x201D;. If this was properly done then the words &#x201C;for the time being&#x201D; would have appeared; paragraph (c) would have read &#x201C;to the holder of an office for the time being&#x201D;. But there is no indication here that those words have been omitted although in fact those words have been omitted in some of the Statutes. I appreciate that it is almost impossible for the hon. the Minister to say in Committee right now, &#x201C;This is what the Natal law says; this is what the Transvaal law says: these words were left out, and this is the reason for omitting them.&#x201D; But, Sir, it is not even indicated here that these words were omitted. Then in Clause 5 (3) the words &#x201C;or a person not having capacity to contract&#x201D; are underlined with a solid line, indicating that these words are being inserted. This sub-clause reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If the payee is a fictitious person, or a person not having capacity to contract, the bill may be treated as payable to bearer.</block>

<p>This is a most important change in the law. It is a most important thing that any bill should ever be treated as payable to bearer, especially if it was not intended that it should be payable to bearer, as is the case here. This is a most important change in our law. This is in the Cape law already, so anybody in the Cape looking at this might think that this was something new; he would not know merely by looking at the Bill. The more one goes through this Bill the more one finds examples of this kind. Then there is another example on page 19 in Clause 39 (1) (c). In the Natal law&#x2014;and this is the only difference between the four provinces&#x2014;after the word &#x201C;executor&#x201D; there appear the words, &#x201C;or personal representative&#x201D;. Those words do not appear here; they have been taken out. I think it is probably proper that they should be omitted, but that is not the point. The point is that it is not even indicated in this Bill that those words are omitted from the Natal law. Perhaps if it was indicated where it was, we might be able to find out from which law it was omitted and from which law it is not being omitted. I think these are all reasons why in this case there should at least have been a White Paper.</p>

<p>I want to suggest to the hon. the Minister that it is within his power to send this Bill to a Select Committee after the second reading. It is within his power still to produce a White Paper, and I do believe that the House is entitled to do it. I do not believe that there is any member in this House who is able to know merely by looking at this Bill how the rights of his constituents are being changed; how the practice in his province is being changed, because the Bill itself does not indicate that at all. If this Bill were not referred to <i>a</i> Select Committee then anyone who was really interested would be entitled to get up in Committee of the whole House on every single clause and say, &#x201C;How is this being changed; what is the position in Natal; is the wording the same&#x003F;&#x201D; You see, Sir, we are dealing with four different laws of in effect four different countries because that is what the four provinces were. We are dealing with four different, separate and distinct laws relating to four different and distinct areas.</p>

<p>I want to say that they are aspects of this Bill which appear to me to be very good changes, although I have only been able to see a little bit of the Bill. There is the whole question, which the Minister would know more about than I. of &#x201C;valuable consideration&#x201D; and <span class="col_4075-4076" refersTo="page_0730"/>&#x201C;redelike oorsaak&#x201D;; there is the case of Conradie vs. Rossouw and all those old cases; and all the difference which existed between Natal and the rest of the country have now been resolved once and for all, and I think quite properly so.</p>

<p>Sir, I bow to your appreciation of the worthiness of that remark. On page 15 there is another amendment in Clause 30. Clause 30 (5) provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">If in a bill payable to order, the payee or endorsee is wrongly designated, or his name mis-spelt, he must, in order to effect a negotiation of the bill, endorse the bill as he is therein described, adding (if he thinks fit) his proper signature.</block>

<p>The words &#x201C;if he thinks fit&#x201D; appear in square brackets. Of course, if you were in the Cape and you knew your bills of exchange law you would know that that was already in the law in the Cape, but if anyone in Natal reads this Bill he might think that this was something new that is being inserted. This is a most important change. Why is this change being made&#x003F; The position is that in some place in the Republic&#x2014;I happen to know that it is in the Cape but there is no indication in the Bill that it was the Cape&#x2014;you could formerly add your proper signature if you wanted to do so; you now have to add your proper signature. This is a most important change. The whole of the law on bills of exchange has been built up out of commercial practice.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to say in all sincerity that looking at this Bill it is not possible for the people of Natal to know how the law in Natal is being changed, and the people in Natal who are mostly concerned with bills of exchange laws are the Indian merchants. I believe that they deal more in promissory notes than any other class of person in the Republic.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I have already acknowledged that. This Bill does, of course, take away much of the Natal law, and I hope the Minister will indicate why it is that Natal has suffered so badly. I have not been able to find any aspect of Natal law which has been preferred over the law in the other provinces. It is true, as the hon. the Minister says, that it is three to one, but the Natal law is founded upon the English law as all our bills of exchange legislation is, and this Bill will affect a number of people there.</p>

<p>Sir, I hope the hon. the Minister will be convinced by what he has heard from this side of the House that a Select Committee could far more easily and far more properly deal with this Bill than the full House, and would be able to expedite the passage of this Bill through the House.</p>

<p>There is one last matter that I should like to put to the hon. the Minister. Clause 101 provides&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Subject to the provisions of sub-section (2), the laws specified in the Second Schedule are hereby repealed.</li>

<li>(2) Such repeal shall not affect the validity of any instrument which, at the commencement of this Act, is valid according to any law so repealed, or of any thing which, according to any such law, was validly done prior to such commencement.</li>

</ol>

<p>What it does not do is to indicate how and when and where the liability of parties to a note or parties to a bill is going to be affected. This Bill is going to become law when the State President affixes his signature to it. On that day it will become law. The Bill provides that any notes that are made or bills will be valid; the repeal of the laws will not affect their validity, but it might affect the liability of either the endorsers or the makers of the bill or note as the case may be. One of the matters I have in mind in relation to Natal is the question of joint makers of a bill and accommodations bills. That is something which is peculiar to Natal. As the Minister knows where joint-makers in Natal, and only Natal, sign a bill or a note in the form: &#x201C;I promise to pay&#x201D;, they are jointly and severally liable on that note, and only in that case. In any other case the co-makers of a bill are only jointly liable. In the rest of the Republic they are jointly and severally liable on that note. There is nothing that I can find in this Bill to indicate whether the makers of such a bill or note are going to be protected and whether their liability is going to change. The bill is going to be valid according to Clause 101 of this Bill. That is fine, but when this Bill becomes law their liability will change according to the law. I might say, Sir, I have not been able to find the particular clause in the <span class="col_4077-4078" refersTo="page_0731"/>Bill which deals with this, but this is the law at present. What is going to happen&#x003F; Are those people who thought they were jointly liable, those people who signed a note not made out in the form &#x201C;I promise to pay &#x2026;&#x201D;now to become jointly and severally liable at a date after this Bill becomes law&#x003F; I hope the hon. the Minister will give that his consideration. This is something which is of great importance in Natal to the merchants and particularly to the Indian merchants in Natal who make a habit of signing notes jointly. The Bill ought to provide for this.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Generally this Bill has been well received. The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell), supported by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) and the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell), has voiced some complaints. I want to say at once that if there had been any change made in the law as it existed in one or other of the provinces I would have felt it necessary to issue a White Paper. I have the assurance that every single clause in this Bill appears in one or other law of the various provinces. The only thing hon. members can complain about is &#x201C;why do you take this from one province and why do you take that from another&#x003F;&#x201D; Hon. members must remember that the various dates of the colonial legislation differ. The changes are all based on the same prototype, the Bills of Exchange Act in Great Britain. But there are certain minor discrepancies although they are not important. Very often it is a question of the language. Take the two most important ones. Hon. members will see that in effect the difference is not very extensive. Take Clause 57 of the Bill. As it reads now we have taken the form of the Transvaal, the Cape and the Free State. The Natal law says &#x201C;A Bill is discharged by payment in due course if such payment be made by or on behalf of the drawee or acceptor&#x201D;. We have now added &#x201C;or <i>pro tanto</i> by payment of part of the amount for which the Bill is drawn, noted by endorsement on the Bill&#x201D;. That seems to be such a natural thing; if it is not in the Natal law it ought to have been there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>Did you say <i>&#x201C;pro tanto&#x201D;</i>&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. In Natal a bill is discharged by payment in due course on behalf of the drawer or acceptor. That is certainly not the practice to-day. You can also do it <i>pro tanto</i> provided you notify them. That is considered to be one of the most important changes here.</p>

<p>Take the other one, Clause 62. It means the same in effect; it is just a question of the wording. In Natal it read: &#x201C;If a bill or an acceptance is materially altered without the assent of all parties liable on the bill, the bill is discharged, except as against any party who has himself made, authorized or assented to the alteration, and subsequent endorsers &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>

<p>It now reads: &#x201C;If a bill or an acceptance is materially altered, the liability of all parties who were parties to the bill at the date of alteration and who did not assent to it, must be regarded as if the alteration had not been made.&#x201D; In effect it amounts to the same; we are approaching it from a different angle.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Constantia (Mr. Waterson) spoke to me about his Bill. I admit when you look at it it looks very formidable. I confess I did not go into details. I was prepared to accept that this was a consolidating measure.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister has just said that every Clause covers existing law. Can the Minister explain why the certificate issued by the law adviser states that only 75 out of the 102 Clauses are existing law. What is the position in regard to the remaining Clauses&#x003F; This certificate has just been handed to me since this debate started. It states that 75 Clauses do not affect the existing law in any way. What about the other Clauses&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I have just explained. In the case of 75 Clauses the form is the same in all four provinces. The other 27 are the examples I have just given. Mr. Speaker, we are now having the festival of Shakespeare and I think &#x201C;Much Ado About Nothing&#x201D; would probably be a very appropriate title to this debate! I can quite understand the difficulty of hon. members. We had to deal with a very peculiar position. I give hon. members the assurance that this Bill is nothing new except for the recommendation of the Select Committee. All the other Clauses are in one or other of the Colonial legislations.</p>

<p>I consider it almost as an excess of zeal on the part of the legal adviser for having done all this underlining and for putting in all these square brackets in the case of the 27 Clauses because those underlinings and square brackets do not really indicate anything new that is being introduced. There was simply a difference in the wording between one province and another province and he very faithfully indicated it, but there is no tampering with the old law. The old law is still there. It is only where there has been a difference in the wording between one province and another that we have asked ourselves what the actual banking practice was to-day. I asked independent people to give me personally the assurance. I want to assure hon. members that had there been any change in existing law, apart from the recommendations of the Select Committee, I would have issued a White Paper and I might have considered sending it to a Select Committee, I at any rate, would have given much more attention to it. The real difficulty is that we are dealing with a very particular problem of consolidation. The legal adviser has done his best to indicate very faithfully every small departure, even if that departure is only from the law of one of the provinces.</p>

<p>That is not the point. The point is what is the law&#x003F; You will find in most cases the law as it stands now gives expression to the practice that maintains in this country. Who, for instance, considers the difference between an inland and a foreign bill of exchange.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<p>That is an extreme example.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>But that shows you. That is the law. There is no tampering with the existing law or anything of that kind. It is only perhaps that we dealt over faithfully with the problem of consolidation. The hon. member wants to know where did this come from and where did that come from. Surely anybody who knows the Natal law will be able to see immediately that this is something which Natal has not got in the same form or that is something which Natal does have in the same form.</p>

<p>I am glad about one thing, Sir, and that is that in this whole debate there has been no criticism of the contents of this Bill. We have been criticized for not having sent it to a Select Committee which would have been totally unnecessary. I have been criticized for not having issued a White Paper which I would have done had the existing law been changed. One does not usually issue a White Paper on a consolidating Bill. The hon. member for Durban (North) has devoted a lot of time and study to this Bill. I can almost say that I think he could have devoted that time and study to a better purpose than this Bill. Had he come to me as the hon. member for Constantia had done I would have told him that there was really nothing in this whole Bill. I can assure hon. members that there is not a single point in this Bill which is a departure from existing banking practice in the Republic. We are simply trying to attain the very great object of consolidating the slightly differing details in the various provinces in order to have legislation for the whole Republic.</p>

<p>*The hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl) has made some very interesting remarks. Like the hon. member for Durban (North) he too has apparently devoted much time and study to this Bill. I can also say to him that he could perhaps have devoted that time and study to better purpose, because this is a consolidating measure; we are not examining here whether the law. as it has existed all these years, is good or whether it is not good. If we had done so we would, as the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (South) (Mr. Plewman) said, have been tampering with the existing law, and that is not our intention.</p>

<p>I just want to say that no legislation is needed to provide for the setting aside of a particular amount of space for signatures. That is a matter which can be dealt with administratively. The other proposal which the hon. member made and which I want to mention here concerns the question of language. The hon. member said that the language of this Bill should be more simple and that the Bill should contain fewer Latin phrases. But I wonder if he can translate the terms <i>authentica si qua mulier</i> and <i>senatus consultum velleianum</i> into Afrikaans&#x003F; These are old Roman Statutes which are known by these terms, and they are terms which cannot be translated. As far as his complaint is concerned that the language is not simple enough, may I tell this House this little story. When the Bills of Sale Act was passed in Britain in 1893, there was a strong movement that the law should be framed in simple language and not in such cumbersome, long-winded legal language. The Minister concerned then gave instructions to that effect and the law was drafted in beautiful, clear and lucid language. But this Act, drafted in simple language, resulted in more litigation than any other British Act. These Latin expressions are necessary; they are stereotyped terms which have been interpreted judicially from time to time. These expressions must be retained therefore if we are to have any degree of certainty under the law. If we do not retain these expressions we will only create the same sort of uncertainty and the same sort of difficulty that was experienced in the case of the British Statute to which I have referred.</p>

<p>The other points raised by the hon. member are not really relevant here, but if an amendment appears to be necessary, then his proposals will be taken into account. In the meantime, if he feels that he is justified in doing so, he should get in touch with the bodies concerned, particularly the banks for example, so that they can make the necessary representations if they are of the opinion that amending legislation is necessary, and we shall then consider such representations.</p>

<p>On Clause 3,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The amendment in this clause is in respect of Natal only. When the Minister introduced the Bill, he referred in rather scoffing terms to it. What is being removed here is the distinction in Natal between what was known as an inland bill and a foreign bill. An inland bill was one which on the face of it purports to be both drawn and payable within the Province of Natal, and any other bill is a foreign bill. But there was a very good reason for this in Natal. It was that an inland bill did not have to be noted. The protest procedure did not involve the services of a notary unless the holder so required. The hon. member for Sunnyside (Mr. van Zyl), speaking in the second reading, appealed to the Minister to do away with all this procedure relating to the noting and protesting of bills, and I want to support what the hon. member said. In Natal we have not since the laws dealing with bills of exchange were passed in 1887 had the requirement for the noting and all this procedure through a notary. In Britain, on which all our laws are founded, they also have a distinction between an inland bill and a foreign bill, and they too have done away with this very expensive procedure relating to the noting of bills. In the old days when the original Natal laws were passed there was a very good reason for it. Distances were great and communications were difficult and the obtaining of evidence was also very difficult and so you had to have certain noting procedures. But it does not exist in Great Britain and they have operated their bills of exchange laws without this procedure, and it has never operated in Natal in respect of a local bill. If this Bill is passed like this, I submit that the people in Natal will be saddled with a lot of extra and unnecessary expense&#x2014;unnecessary, as we have proved in Natal over the past 80 years, and as was proved in Britain. The hon. member for Sunnyside raised the matter, but the Minister did not deal with it then, and I hope the Minister will explain to us why it is that he is insisting, as he does in Clause 49, that this procedure and the services of a notary should be required in respect of every bill.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I can quite understand that many years ago, Natal perhaps had reason to make the distinction between the Greeks and the barbarians, but to ask me now to continue with that distinction and to run counter to the practice and the procedure in the Transvaal, the Cape and the Orange Free State, that I am not prepared to do. If I have to choose between the two, then I will choose the other procedure. What the hon. member is asking for now is not for the use of those words, but that there should be no noting and protesting by means of a notary in regard to unpaid bills. Consolidation is all we are doing here. If there has to be an amendment of the law, that is a matter that can be raised in the future, and if there is a large measure of support for it I will go into it, but this is a consolidating measure and we simply had to choose between the procedure in Natal and that in the other three provinces. I should have imagined that Natal would have been the first to admit that the provisions of the law of 1887 are no longer applicable.</p>

<p>The position is that the words &#x201C;or after&#x201D; were not included in the Natal law of 1887. Apparently the position in all the other provinces was the other way. But, Sir, I have some heartening news for the hon. member for Durban (North) (Mr. M. L. Mitchell). I am not going to spoil his pleasure by anticipation, but there are certain clauses in which we have chosen to follow the wording of the Natal law in preference to the wording of the laws of the other three provinces.</p>

<speech by="#mitchell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">M. L. MITCHELL</person>:</from>

<p>The matter I wish to raise under this clause is one which I raised during the second-reading debate; the hon. the Minister did not reply to it then. This clause provides that no bill or note which was made before the commencement of the Act or at the commencement of the Act shall become invalid by reason of the provisions of this measure. What I want to know from the hon. the Minister is this: What about the liability of the parties to the bill&#x003F; This is not dealt with under this clause and it is not dealt with in this Bill. What I have in mind is an example that I gave the hon. the Minister of joint makers of a bill. In Natal, unlike any of the other provinces, a bill which is jointly made and which does not begin with the words &#x201C;I promise to pay&#x201D; brings only joint liability to the joint makers; it does not bring, as it does in the other provinces, joint and several liability. In Natal the position is that only if the joint makers sign a note &#x201C;I promise to pay&#x201D;, is there joint and several liability. The custom in Natal, certainly amongst the Indian merchants, is to sign joint notes, and they very often sign joint notes which do not begin with the words &#x201C;I promise to pay&#x201D;, and they do so for the reason that in Natal there is only joint liability. As I read this, their liability is likely to be changed into joint and several liability. I would like to know why the hon. the Minister has not provided for the change that this law might bring about in the liability of joint parties to a note in Natal.</p>

<p>Second Order read: Resumption of second-reading debate,&#x2014;Coloured Persons Representative Council Bill.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Coloured Affairs, adjourned on 10 April, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#connan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>When this debate was adjourned on Friday afternoon, I had made it quite clear that we were utterly opposed to this Bill, and that it would further damage the good relations which have always existed between the Coloureds and the Whites, relations which have already been damaged by this Government. I also showed that the statement made by the Minister that bitterness was caused by the fact that the Coloured <span class="col_4085-4086" refersTo="page_0735"/>people were on the Common Roll, was not correct. I pointed out that most White people were not bitter against the Coloured people; that we on this side had never been bitter against the Coloured people, we are not bitter against them now and we shall never be bitter against them. Any bitterness that existed, existed in the minds of those White people who were against the Coloured people being on the Common Roll. The removal of the Coloured people from the Common Roll plus other legislation caused bitterness in the minds of some of the Coloured people against the Whites. This Bill will further damage our good relations and cause further bitterness in the minds of the Coloured people against the Whites.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we are going to move the most radical amendment open to us to indicate our complete opposition to this Bill. I accordingly move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>We move this motion for many reasons, but particularly because we regard this simply as a further instrument to segregate the Coloured people politically. In our view the direction in which this Bill moves amounts to a further retrograde step in the breaching of all the solemn pledges given to the Coloured people in the past. It may be held out as offering something which they have not got at the present time, but what is in fact offered is something which leads in the wrong direction. It can only lead to further frustration; it can only lead to complete loss of faith in the White man&#x2019;s word, to friction and possibly&#x2014; heaven forbid&#x2014;the formation of a solid non-White front directed against the White man in South Africa. This legislation is, of course, being held out to the Coloured people&#x2014;and to the world&#x2014;as an important step towards giving them political self-expression, but I want to say that if the Coloured people had been consulted directly or through their representatives in this House it would have been abundantly clear, even to the present Government, that the direction which it represents is contrary to the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the Coloured people. Despite what it pretends to be, it is, I fear, the penultimate step in the ultimate denial to the Coloured people of their traditional, special position as a political appendage of the White map in South Africa. The ultimate step will, of course, be the removal from this House of the four members who still sit here as the direct representatives of the Coloured people of the Cape Province. I shall have something more to say about this a little later.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this Bill as a whole to me represents simply an extension of the phoney policy of separate development, of the myth that apartheid of this sort is a feasible policy. And I want to say that the application of this so-called policy must end in the break-up of South Africa into independent and antagonistic racial groups, not even settled in territorial entitites. Particularly, of course, is this latter fact true in respect of the Coloured community. We have heard from members opposite and from the Prime Minister himself that the moral justification for applying the apartheid policy to the Bantu&#x2014;for depriving the Bantu in the Cape of the limited representation which they enjoyed in this House prior to 1959&#x2014;is that they shall exercise full rights and grow to independence in their own homelands, the Transkei. But where is the &#x201C;homeland&#x201D; for the Coloured people&#x003F;</p>

<p>What are the historical facts in regard to the Coloured vote&#x003F; For over a century the Coloureds in the Cape enjoyed the right of voting on a Common Roll provided he could satisfy certain qualifications. Over 50 years ago that right was inserted also into the contract of Union and was made one of the entrenched clauses of the Act of Union, drawn up by the fathers of our Constitution, men like General Botha, General Smuts, General Hertzog, John X. Merriman, ex-President Steyn, General de Wet, General de la Rey, J. W. Sauer and many others. In the 1920s, when General Hertzog at the head of the old Nationalist Party of those days declared it his policy to place the Natives on a separate roll, it was made clear that there was no intention to treat the Coloureds in the same way but rather to treat them politically as Europeans. In the words of General Hertzog, speaking in Parliament in 1930&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the Coloureds are concerned, we have no right to separate them from us on political, economic and industrial lines. They originated in our midst. They descend from and owe their descent to Europeans. &#x2026; Their language is either English or Afrikaans, the official languages of our country; they are completely separate from the Natives. They are educated from the very first according to the moral customs, institutions and principles of the Europeans. They grew up in the Christian religion.</block>

<p>With this exposition we on this side of the House fully agree. General Hertzog and his party and his Government gave the solemn pledge that if the Coloured people would help him to remove the Natives from the Common Roll, they in their turn would not be segregated either politically or economically. The National Party under General Hertzog, ably assisted at that time by our present Minister of Lands, thought that it was in the best interest of all, and particularly of the White man, to keep the Coloured on the Common Roll. But in 1936 the &#x201C;gesuiwerde&#x201D; Nasionale Party, a small party, thought that if they were to advance they would have to come along with something radical. They thought that if they advocated the removal of the Coloured man from the Common Roll it would be a popular policy with the electorate. They thought that they could stir up a section of the White people and that they could <span class="col_4087-4088" refersTo="page_0736"/>frighten the White people into believing that the Coloureds would dominate them politically. By advocating that policy they thought they would succeed, and they did succeed, in getting a large number of White voters to support them. That is the origin of the removal of the Coloured man from the Common Roll. The removal of the Coloured people from the Common Roll represented a diminution of their political right, and in his second-reading speech the hon. the Minister made a statement from which it seems that he is prepared to bring about a further diminution of the political rights which the Coloured people enjoy at the present time. This is what he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Daar word soms in sekere denkrigtinge genoem om die Kleurling bevolking deur Kleurlinge in die Parlement te laat verteenwoordig. Die grondslag waarop dit kan geskied kan tog slegs moreel wees indien dit rekening hou met die getalle van die stemgeregtigde Kleurling in verhouding tot die van die Blankes. Die vraag ontstaan onmiddellik of so &#x2019;n verteenwoordiging rekening moet hou met die huidige getal van bv. 582,000 Kleurlinge.</block>

<p>In other words the hon. the Minister, if I understand this correctly, is not prepared to have more and more representatives of the Coloured people in Parliament, irrespective of the number of Coloured voters. In other words, if there are 70,000 Coloured voters they will still be limited to four representatives. But, Mr. Havenga, Col. 6233 of 1951, said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The numbers (of Coloured representatives) have not been pegged; they can grow according to the comparative increase.</block>

<p>That is the position as it stands, and according to the hon. the Minister there will be a further diminution of the political rights of the Coloured people; they will never get the increased representation in this House which we always understood they were entitled to. Sir, the Coloured people have never been a danger to the Whites. They have been our close allies; they have stood by us for centuries; they have worked for us and with us; they have fought with us; they have almost had the same rights. They were almost on a par with us, except that socially we have always had separation, to which we all agreed, including the Coloured people. They have respected us and we have respected them. Now with separate development we will drive them further away from us. The result of this legislation may be that the Coloured may develop a new separate nationalism, just as a group often embraces ultra-nationalism, and just as ultra-nationalism developed at one time amongst the Afrikaner people, so much so that the nationalists sympathized with the communists in the 1922 disturbances on the Rand. That is what ultra-nationalism does, and the same thing may happen amongst the Coloured people. Sir, what will the Whiteman&#x2019;s position be if that should come to pass&#x003F; They have always stood by us and they want to stand by us. Why take steps to drive them away, make enemies of them and jeopardize the White man&#x2019;s position&#x003F; We want to protect ourselves, our children and our grandchildren; we want to protect our future existence. Our policy is also in the best interests of the Coloured people. It is designed to protect them, their children and their future existence. The hon. the Minister spoke the other day of the &#x201C;ontwisbare reg van voortbestaan van die blanke&#x201D;. Sir, we on this side equally believe in the &#x201C;ontwisbare reg van voortbestaan van die blanke&#x201D;. The only difference is that we on this side of the House believe that that can be attained by supporting the policy of this party. We believe that it will be lost if we support the policy of the party on that side.</p>

<p>Sir, I have already referred to what General Hertzog said. This Government ignores the truth of General Hertzog&#x2019;s words completely and proceeds with its separation policy, of which this Bill, as I have said, is the penultimate political instrument. It purports, of course, to establish real and effective functions for the Coloureds in respect of their own people in certain spheres. It pretends, in fact, to create that &#x201C;state within a state&#x201D; of which the Prime Minister so often speaks. But in fact it gives the Coloured people simply the trappings of power without the reality, and the whole thing is simply a pretence. The Executive Committee which purports to have power in respect of finance, local government, education, community welfare and pensions, rural areas and settlements for Coloureds, consists of five members, four of whom shall be elected. But the chairman shall be appointed by the State President and will clearly be the instrument of the Minister and his Government. The council itself shall have power&#x2014;the Bill uses the word &#x201C;power&#x201D;&#x2014;to advise the Government on request in regard to the interests of the Coloured population; to make recommendations to the Government and to serve as a link between the Government and the Coloured population. But it has not even the right to introduce any law without the approval of the Minister, granted after consultation with the Minister of Finance. In addition, a Bill, after having been introduced, with the lead of the Minister, and passed does not become binding until it has been assented to by the State President. All this simply indicates a state of tutelage without even, as I have said, the so-called moral justification that these people, like the Xhosas, will one day attain to complete independence in a homeland of their own! So far from being treated as an appendage of the White man in the Hertzog tradition, they are now reduced to a situation inferior to the Transkeian peoples against whom, ironically enough, their forefathers helped the White man defend his frontiers in days gone by.</p>

<p>I stated earlier that I regard this legislation as the penultimate step in the Government&#x2019;s <span class="col_4089-4090" refersTo="page_0737"/>separatist plans for the Coloured people. The ultimate step, I believe, will be abolition of Coloured representation in this House. I say so for two obvious reasons. The first is that this Bill provides that &#x201C;by mediation of the Minister, members of the Executive Committee shall have direct access to any Minister in connection with any matters affecting the Coloured population in the Republic. This simply means that the four Members of Parliament representing the Coloured people of the Cape have no <i>locus standi</i> and are completely short-circuited. Surely this will in time be advanced as a reason for their elimination. The second is that this Bill makes provision for the large-scale registration of voters for the election of the Coloured council on a basis which is much easier than that which applies in respect of the registration of voters for the election of the four parliamentary and the two provincial council representatives. This lower registration figure for the parliamentary seats and the higher registration figure for the election of council members will be used by the Government to support the argument that the Coloured people are not even interested in registration for the election of Members of Parliament and that therefore there is no justification for the presence of representatives of the Coloureds in this Parliament. Sir, this Bill is anathema to us. It is a snare and delusion for the Coloured people and it is a step in the wrong direction. Our wise national leaders of the past would not have been in favour of the trend which this Bill embodies, and neither are we. We on this side stand by our pledges in the past in regard to the Coloured people. We shall consult with them in regard to their political future but on the basis of their return to the Common Roll here in the Cape Province and in Natal. We regard them as a Western people. What has the Government done to consult them in regard to this Bill&#x003F; It was interesting to note the other day that the hon. the Minister mentioned that Mr. Harry Lawrence has established a Coloured advisory council because the system of the Common Roll had failed and that he wanted that council as a channel of consultation between the Coloured people, himself and the Government. The Minister said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Dit was &#x2019;n verdoeming van die bestaande stelsel in die sin dat die bestaande stelsel nie as genoegsaam beskou was om die Regering te adviseer oor ekonomiese en staatkundige en maatskaplike aspekte nie.</block>

<p>Must we then also assume that the members of this House cannot advise the Government on economic matters; was that why the Government established an Economic Advisory Council&#x003F; Surely, Sir, the hon. the Prime Minister was wise in establishing that Economic Advisory Council to advise him further. Mr. Harry Lawrence was also wise in establishing a council to advise him further in regard to Coloured matters.</p>

<p>What has the Government done to consult them in regard to this matter&#x003F; Have they consulted the properly elected representatives of the Coloured people, the four representatives who sit in this House, representatives who sit here by virtue of the Government&#x2019;s own legislation&#x003F; What have they done to consult with the Coloured people&#x003F; The Minister has told us that there was consultation in 1961 with the existing Coloured Affairs Council. But who and what is that council&#x003F; It is a council the majority of whose members are nominated, members who are prepared to think as the Minister thinks. There is a certain number of elected members and how were they elected&#x003F; There was no election, the Coloured people boycotted those elections; they would have nothing to do with them. So 12 individuals presented themselves and were elected. The existing council does not by any stretch of imagination represent the views of the Coloured people in this country. Were the four Coloured Representatives consulted&#x003F; The representatives who are in close contact with the Coloured people of this country; they fight elections; they contact the electorate and in between elections they visit their constituents; they know what the views of the Coloured people are. The elections have shown us that the Coloured people are completely opposed to the policy of the Nationalist Party. Towards the end of last year we had a by-election and Mr. Daantjie Scholtz offered himself as a candidate; he offered himself as an independent candidate. He went to great pains to dissociate himself from the Nationalist Party. He told the Coloured people that he had lost the party nomination because he was too well disposed towards the Coloured people. In other words, anybody who was well disposed towards the Coloured people had no hope of winning a Nationalist Party nomination. At first Mr. Scholtz did very well in regard to the postal vote. We all know how the postal vote system works; he got a fair number of postal votes. But I maintain that on the day of the election itself he did not get more than 300 votes. Anyway, he lost the election, a fair amount of this money went down the drain and the hopes of the hon. Minister for his candidate went up in smoke. The vast bulk of the Coloured people have been completely ignored. I believe the lack of consultation is contemptuous of the Coloured voters, contemptuous of their representatives and bodes ill for the future of the Coloured Representatives in this House.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the Coloured people do not want this legislation. We do not want it. Only this Government with its preoccupation with ideological legislation wants it. I therefore move the amendment which I have read.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_staden">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down and who is also one of the leaders of the United Party had practically nothing to say about this Bill. The few questions this Bill poses to the Opposition have definitely not been answered by him. <span class="col_4091-4092" refersTo="page_0738"/>The hon. member had much to say about the Coloureds not having been consulted. When it suits the Opposition they advance the argument that this Coloured Council consists of stooges of the Government. The fact of the matter is that this legislation emanates from that Coloured Council. They have approved of it. If the United Party have to provide us with the people with whom we must consult we shall never have that consultation, but I shall return to that at a later stage.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked the Minister whether, if the number of Coloureds increased to 582,000, the number of Coloured Representatives in this House would remain at four&#x003F; That number will definitely remain the same. I want to remind the hon. member that in 1951 when legislation in connection with the Coloured vote was discussed for the first time in this House, the then Government issued a statement on behalf of the National Party to the effect that the Coloureds would be given four representatives in this House and that that number would only be increased if the White representation in this House were increased, in which case it would be increased proportionately. That was a promise and we adhere to it. The number will definitely not be increased because they were not appointed on a numerical basis.</p>

<p>The hon. member says the relationship has deteriorated. I can only say this to him: Race relations were never as bad in the history of this country as they were in 1948 when the National Party came into power. He denies that; he says there is bitterness to-day. It was because of the bitterness which existed at the time that the National Party came into power in 1948. The Whites were embittered because of the way in which the United Party had misused the Coloureds. I can tell the hon. member that the bitterness which existed at that time bordered on hatred. There is nothing like that to-day. We have reached the stage to-day where the Whites are extending the helping hand and the Coloured people are in fact prepared to accept that helping hand. The hon. member told us they were opposed to this legislation because it was only another step along the road to separate development. They want to return to the Common Roll, because, says he, under that system there was no bitterness. I repeat: In those days there was bitterness which bordered on hatred; it was a dangerous bitterness. We shall not return to that position, Mr. Speaker. I am firmly convinced that the White people of this country will never return to that position; they will not place the United Party in a position to do so. I am also firmly convinced that even the Coloureds do not ever want to return to that period when nothing was done. We were embittered in those days, but the Coloureds were also embittered because the United Party held out the National Party to the Coloured as his enemy&#x2014;that was why there was bitterness. I think I have reason today to say that over the past 16 years that bitterness on the part of the Whites and on the part of the Coloured has totally disappeared.</p>

<p>This is not merely a further step in the direction of separate development as the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) has alleged. This is an important step; this is one of the most important pieces of legislation this Government has ever handled. It is equal to the Transkei legislation as far as our fourstream policy is concerned. The machinery is now created to obtain the ideal form of consultation which that party is always pleading for. For years the United Party has been accusing us of not consulting properly. The hon. member for Gardens did so again a moment ago. The peculiar thing about the whole matter is this: Why do they not welcome this legislation&#x003F; A better opportunity for consultation than this has never yet been created. For the very first time this places the entire Coloured population in a position of electing people. If the United Party lays the charge at the door of the Government that that Coloured Council consists of stooges of the Government, the Government comes forward with this legislation with the very object of giving the entire Coloured population the opportunity of electing their leaders with whom the Government can consult. Why does the United Party not welcome this step&#x003F; Surely the United Party was dishonest in laying that charge if they do not welcome this legislation; in that case the Opposition is dishonest and they do not really want consultation. It is only a sword they wish to keep over the heads of the National Party.</p>

<p>The United Party have to answer an important question as far as this legislation is concerned because in respect of this legislation the United Party stand arraigned before the people. It is not a case of an attack on the Government. There are questions to be answered to the entire population. This legislation does not only give the vote to the Coloureds in the Cape Province but it gives it to them over the entire Republic. What is more it is an unqualified vote. What is more the Coloured woman also gets the vote. They have never had it in the past. They are given the right to choose those people who have to be consulted. Those people are going to be elected on a very broad basis, Mr. Speaker. In this legislation provision is made for one man one vote and surely that complies with the much-lauded world opinion the United Party always refers to. Are they not always telling us to do those things that will satisfy world opinion&#x003F; This legislation of one man one vote complies with that requirement. The question the United Party must answer in these circumstances is this: How are you going to return to the Common Roll and with whom&#x003F; The Opposition who represent the alternative Government must reply to this question: Are you going to revert to the old position of a qualified vote for the Coloured people&#x003F; If the reply is &#x201C;yes&#x201D; they will have to disfranchise the Coloured woman and they will have to disfranchise the Coloureds in the northern <span class="col_4093-4094" refersTo="page_0739"/>provinces. They will have to disfranchise the tens of thousands of Coloureds who are now going to come on the unqualified Voters&#x2019; Roll. I want to make this submission to them: In that case they will be taking away vested rights. Are they not the party who are always fighting for vested rights&#x003F; If ever the United Party should again come into power, by the time they come into power the rights which are given to the Coloured people in this legislation will already have been vested rights for many years. In that case the people who are always fighting for vested rights will be taking vested rights away.</p>

<p>If the reply is &#x201C;no&#x201D;, if the United Party say they are going to transfer this general vote to the Voters&#x2019; Roll, I predict the few supporters they still have will fall away from them like leaves off a tree. We should like to have a definite reply from them to this question. It is no use their telling us they will revert to the old position, that they will consult. The hon. member for Gardens said they would consult. Whom are they going to consult and what will be the outcome of those consultations&#x003F; That is not enough. Mr. Speaker, the United Party must tell us what their policy is going to be in future. I predict, as has so often happened in the past, they will say &#x201C;yes, no&#x201D;. We shall not get &#x201C;yes&#x201D; from them nor shall we get &#x201C;no&#x201D; from them; we shall get &#x201C;yes, no&#x201D; from them.</p>

<p>This legislation is really the culmination of the National Party&#x2019;s policy in respect of the Coloureds. With this the National Party and the Government prove that they are continuing to honour their undertakings and that they are serious about separate development because separate development offers the solution to our racial problems in South Africa. This legislation is not being forced on to anybody. Let them say what they like about that Coloured council but those people have served the Coloured population very well; those people have served the Coloured population for five years; they must be very stupid if they do not know what the Coloured people want. That is why we are entitled to say that the will of the Coloured people is to a very high degree reflected in this legislation. Everybody in this world wants to be of some account. That is so in respect of various racial groups. Everyone seeks an opportunity of being of some account. Nobody holds that against the Coloured; you cannot hold it against anybody if he wants to assert himself. No human being has the right to hold it against another human being for wanting to be of some account. We do not hold it against any group in this country if they strive to be of some account. On the contrary we want to give them the opportunity of doing so. This legislation gives the Coloured population the opportunity of asserting themselves, of having a say in the management of the country; of having a share in the upliftment of their own people; it gives them the opportunity of being of some account. We are not depriving them of that.</p>

<p>The United Party pleads for the return to the Common Roll. I am convinced the Coloured people of this country do not want to return to the old position. When this policy of separate development was originally applied in 1948 there was bitterness; there was bitterness on the part of the Coloureds, as I have said, because we were represented as their enemies, as the persons who wanted to suppress and destroy them. But that bitterness has disappeared; that bitterness has to a great extent disappeared. I shall tell you why, Sir. Up to 1948 the Coloured in this country was regarded and treated by the United Party as an appendage to the Whites. Let us admit that that was originally also the attitude of the old National Party but the position was not as stated by the hon. member for Gardens. In 1932 already, when the late General Hertzog was still leader of the National Party, he gave permission to the National Party of the Cape Province to carry on and to submit the question of the Coloureds going on to a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll to their congresses.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN STADEN</person>:</from>

<p>I am talking about 1932. In 1932 the old National Party of the Cape Province was given permission to carry on and to submit this matter to its congresses. That happened already during the days of General Hertzog because he was not unsympathetically inclined towards the idea of the Coloureds being placed on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll. This party does not regard the Coloureds as an appendage to the Whites. We regard him as a human being with his own identity and we treat him as such. We have been treating him as such ever since we came into power in 1948. The truth of the matter is that we regard the Coloured as a valuable ally. We want to do everything in our power to lift him out of the morass into which he has landed with the passage of time particularly as a result of the actions of the United Party. This legislation has not been formulated, as is so often suggested by the United Party, merely as a result of a whim. The charge is often made that this is simply a whim on the part of the people from the northern provinces, the granite people; we often hear about the vast difference which exists between the people from the north and those from the south. The truth of the matter is that this policy was formulated by what was known as the Sauer Commission. That commission was appointed in 1943 and the report of that commission was accepted by the National Party Congress in 1945. That became the policy of the National Party. I can say this to the House to-day: There have been few departures from the recommendations of that commission. That was a National Party report; it was a combination of south and north. It was accepted unanimously and it is still our policy to-day.</p>

<p>Time does not permit me to deal with, those recommendations but so many of those recommendations <span class="col_4095-4096" refersTo="page_0740"/>have already become reality, are already a <i>fait accompli.</i> The Department which had to be established, the Department which ultimately had to have its own social welfare section for the Coloureds, is already history to-day; we have the housing which is being provided for the Coloureds. Everyone who is prepared to open his eyes can see what is happening in order to give effect to that report. Take education. It is stated in that report that a university must be established for the Coloureds and that is already a <i>fait accompli.</i> They refer in that report to local authorities and they are already becoming a <i>fait accompli.</i> Instead of accusing us of inflexibility I maintain that we are indeed flexible. That 1945 report recommended that the Coloureds should only have three representatives in this House and that they should be elected by a representative Coloured council. To-day four of them are sitting here and they are not elected by a Coloured council but by the Coloured electorate. The same applies in respect of the representatives in the provincial council in the Cape Province. In terms of the policy which the party accepted at the time they were to have been elected by a Coloured council and not by the Coloured electorate. These things prove that this side of the House, in spite of the fact that we cling steadfastly to a principle&#x2014;we are anchored to principles&#x2014;face up to the truth as far as our policy is concerned and that we adapt it to circumstances in a way which will be best for South Africa. The main difference between the National Party and the United Party is perhaps this that the United Party is on a slippery road because its policy is not anchored to a principle; it is simply a policy. That is why they are on a slippery road. The United Party policy of so many representatives for this group and so many representatives for that group is devoid of any principle&#x2014;ultimately it will be numbers that will govern South Africa and we all know that, if it is to be numbers, and it will be numbers, it will not be the White man who will govern. Then it will be the Black man.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that there are no Coloured leaders, recognized Coloured leaders, in our country. Why is that the position&#x003F; Because they have never yet had the opportunity of developing into leaders. There was not a field in which they have had the opportunity of developing leaders. This legislation now gives them that opportunity. Even in the Cape Town City Council they do not have the opportunity of developing into leaders. There too they are simply treated as an appendage and they can only be there when it suits the Whites. We say this legislation gives the Coloureds the opportunity for the first time of developing leaders, a group of leaders who will be able to serve their own people. We want to give them the opportunity of serving their own people. The United Party, on the other hand, do not want to give them that opportunity. They do with the Coloureds what was done years ago, under the Colonial r&#x00E9;gime, with the White Afrikaans-speaking section. The cream was welcome in their circles and they wanted to skim that off, the van der Byls and the van der Merwes and the Cloetes, but the rest they discarded and relegated them to the slums to live amongst the non-Whites that was actually the wish and desire of the Colonial power. They want to do exactly the same with the Coloureds. The United Party only have two objects in mind with the Coloureds. Politically they want the Coloureds on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll so that they can, as in the past, trade with the vote of the Coloured, and the second reason why the United Party does not want any separate development is that they do not want the Coloureds to trade; they want to keep the trade for themselves. The United Party would not have been as irritable as they are as far as separate development was concerned if the Government were to decide that the Coloureds should not be allowed to trade and that even in the Coloured areas the trade should remain in the hands of the White man.</p>

<p>The separate residential areas of the Coloureds. Surely the United Party is also in favour of social separation. They too wish them to live separately but they do not want to grant them any rights. They wish to obtain the Coloured trade for themselves as they did in those days in the case of the White Afrikaans-speaking section. When you talk to individual United Party members, Sir, they tell you: &#x201C;We are against the policy of separate development. There are many Coloureds who are the equals of the Whites. Let us skim off that top layer from time to time and bring it over to the Whites.&#x201D; They do not want to allow the Coloureds to serve their own people; they want to skim them off. What do they want to do with the others&#x003F; The United Party wish to hand the rest over to the Bantu. Skim off the top layer for the Whites and hand the rest over to the Bantu. There is no morality in their attitude, there is no compassion in it. They still cling to those old Colonial concepts. They raised a loud cry. The hon. member for Gardens raised a loud cry. He referred to Clause 21 in particular and asked what powers were going to be given to the Coloured council and to the executive committee. But surely in no legislation is it stated in advance precisely what the provisions are going to be. Many Bills are passed by this House in which provision is made for the delegation of power. Practically every Bill contains a clause in which provision is made for the delegation of certain powers. But no clause in such legislation lays down specifically which powers may be delegated.

<p>I will in the course of my speech deal with several points made by the hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van <span class="col_4097-4098" refersTo="page_0741"/>Staden). He will forgive me if I do not deal with his speech immediately. I want to concentrate on the Bill now before us.</p>

<p>There is a fundamental difference between the Government&#x2019;s outlook and mine in regard to the future of the Coloured people of South Africa, and it is this fundamental difference which motivates my reaction to this Bill. The Government&#x2019;s policy, evidenced by the type of legislation which it has introduced during the past 15 years, is designed to maintain a barrier between the Coloured people and the White population of this country. It is designed to widen the gulf which has been created by Government policy between our Coloured people and ourselves. On the other hand, my outlook towards the Coloured people has been totally opposed to that policy. I have pleaded with the Government, year in and year out, in this House and out of this House, not to alienate our Coloured people from the White population of this country.</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I hope to show the Chief Whip of the Nationalist Party that this Bill more than anything else will widen this barrier. Sir, I have urged upon the Government to constantly bear in mind the fact that the Coloured people are part and parcel of the White civilization of this country, that their mode of living, their culture, their languages, their education and their religions are identical with those of the White people of South Africa. Despite the fact that this truism that I have enunciated here has been accepted by a very large section of leaders of Afrikaner opinion in this country, I regret to say that the Government has relentlessly pursued the policy of introducing more and more apartheid measures against our Coloured people, with a total disregard to the enormous consequences that are likely to flow from such a policy and completely oblivious of the fact that these measures are widening the unfortunate gulf between the Whites and the Coloured people of this country. Mr. Speaker, this Bill to my mind will perpetuate the barrier which has unfortunately been created between these two sections of our population. It is for this fundamental reason that I am opposed to the principle of this Bill, apart from the other specific reasons in regard to the details of the Bill with which I hope to deal presently. I repeat that the danger that I see in this Bill is not so much the fact that the Government is not really giving anything worth while to the Coloured people, but the fact that the principle of this Bill will create in the mind of our Coloured people and indeed in the minds of many White people in this country, and outside of this country, the inevitable conclusion that a complete and final barrier is now being established between the Coloureds and ourselves. This to my mind is a dangerous principle because it can only have the effect of widening the gulf that exists between us and of alienating the Coloureds from the White people in this country even more than they have been alienated up to now.</p>

<p>To deal with the Bill specifically, I would like to say immediately that I see this measure as an important link in the hon. Prime Minister&#x2019;s grandiose scheme of developing the Coloured people of South Africa as a separate population entity and of creating his famous state within a state. What does this Bill purport to do&#x003F; In pursuance of the hon. Prime Minister&#x2019;s scheme, the Bill purports to establish a Coloured Representative Council and to determine its powers, its functions and its duties. I think it is not inappropriate for us to examine whether this Bill measures up to what the hon. the Prime Minister himself told the Coloured people as to what the Government&#x2019;s intentions were in regard to their future when this Bill was first adumbrated. In December 1961 the hon. the Prime Minister announced for the first time to the South African nation what he had in mind for the future of the Coloured people in this country. He made this announcement when he addressed the Union Coloured Council on 11 December 1961. I think it is necessary to recall to this House what the hon. Prime Minister said on that occasion. Lest it might be said that the hon. the Prime Minister was misreported by the English Press, who heaven knows has been blamed wrongly for a great deal in this country, let me say immediately that I am not quoting from the English language Press. I am quoting from the official report of that meeting and of the speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister on that occasion, a report that was issued under the authority of the hon. Minister of Coloured Affairs by the Information Service of the Department of Coloured Affairs. The report was headed &#x201C;More powers for Coloureds&#x201D;. It is obviously not possible for me in the limited time at my disposal to deal with the entire speech made by the hon. the Prime Minister, but I hope to give to this House some of the salient features of the speech as I see it, the features which are appropriate to the Bill that we are discussing at the moment. The hon. the Prime Minister said this on that occasion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Within the next ten years, the Coloureds could be in full control of their own affairs, with their own parliament and cabinet.</block>

<p>He sketched the Government&#x2019;s plans for which the framework for full control could be established within five years and the complete take-over of their own affairs could be accomplished within ten years.</p>

<p>Further on in the speech the hon. the Prime Minister dealt with the question of self-management to ensure happiness&#x2014;he used a lot of grandiose expressions, and then went on to say this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">With the realization of the situation, the search for opportunities and the rights for the Coloureds must be sought along the <span class="col_4099-4100" refersTo="page_0742"/>way of separation, so that he could have the opportunity of having his own management which could handle his own interests.</block>

<p>Further on he went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It followed that not only would houses be built in that community, but that the group should be a social unity with self-determination of that community &#x2026;</block>

<p>I repeat the words &#x201C;self-determination of that community&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which would eventually be self-employing. Community development and local management were thus basically necessary.</block>

<p>Then the hon. Prime Minister went on, dealing again with the development of this idea, to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured must get control of his own services, such as welfare, health and education.</block>

<p>And then I want to quote this final portion, which is absolutely germane to the Bill we are discussing here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Within the next five years, a start must be made so that within ten years the Coloureds would have full control of all their cities and towns.</block>

<p>And then under the heading of &#x201C;A Coloured Parliament&#x201D; he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured must also have control over his own services. The Council for Coloured Affairs has been established as an advisory body to create the machinery which would consult with the State on the next step. It must be developed into a more representative union control board, actually as a Coloured parliament, which would control all Coloured interests in the country, with administrative and legislative powers and officials to carry out its decisions.</block>

<p>Then he went on to say that there would be an executive council and he said that the control board must also have a permanent council of four persons, each of whom, like a Minister, would be responsible for carrying out the functions which the board as a whole had to carry out.</p>

<p>I have been quoting <i>ipsissima verba</i> the Prime Minister himself. Let us see if this Bill presently before us by any stretch of the imagination measures up to the promises made by the hon. Prime Minister to the Coloured people on that occasion. Let me repeat briefly what those promises were. The Prime Minister said that the Coloured must get control of his own services, such as welfare, health and education; the Coloureds must get their own parliament which will control all Coloured interests in this country, with administrative and legislative powers and officials to carry out its decisions. Let us examine this Bill to see whether it confers upon the Coloured people the powers and functions, or the rights and privileges which the hon. the Prime Minister so glibly spoke about on the occasion when he held out these hopes to the Coloured people and when he first adumbrated this new development for this indigenous section of our South African population.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that the hon. the Prime Minister&#x2019;s hopes and promises to the Coloured people as enunciated by him, and as mentioned by me this afternoon, must be seen against the background of what had happened to the Coloured people at the hands of this Government. Our Coloured people have been deprived of their political rights and they have been deprived of their status as ordinary citizens of this country, which they had enjoyed for well over a century. Their common suffrage rights which they had enjoyed for over a century were taken away from them. They were deprived of their political rights as citizens of South Africa, their only home, to vote for persons of their own choice becoming members of this Central Parliament, on the Common Roll with their fellow White citizens. They have been deprived of similar political rights to vote for people of their own choice to represent them in the provincial council. Against this background, and in the light of this grievous political loss, the hon. the Prime Minister assured them that consistent with his policy of apartheid, of separate development, they would in due course be given full control of their own affairs, with their own parliament and their own cabinet, so that they would be able to deal with all matters affecting the existence of the Coloured people in this country. He told them that they would be entrusted with legislative powers to deal in their own areas with all matters affecting the interests of the Coloured people in South Africa. Let us for a brief moment examine some of the provisions of this Bill in order to see if this political Utopia, promised by the hon. the Prime Minister to the Coloured people, has in fact been granted to them.</p>

<p>What in fact does this Bill provide for the Coloured people&#x003F; The general functions of this so-called parliament are set out in Clause 20 of this Bill. This clause provides that the council shall have the power to give advice to the Government when asked to do so. Clause 21 (a) specifically lays down that the council shall have power &#x201C;on request&#x201D; to advise the Government in regard to all matters affecting the economic and social, educational and political interests of the Coloured people of the Republic. I repeat that the council can only proffer this advice to the Government when asked to do so. They cannot initiate any advice. The members of the council can only give advice to the Government when they are asked to do so. What sort of powers are these&#x003F; What sort of parliament is this&#x003F;</p>

<p><span class="col_4101-4102" refersTo="page_0743"/>What autonomy or even initiative is vested in such a body, in such a Coloured parliament as described in this Bill&#x003F; In Clause 20 (b), again dealing with the general functions of the council, provision is made for the council to have power to make recommendations to the Government in regard to any planning calculated to promote the best interests of the Coloured population, and in sub-section (c) it says &#x201C;generally to serve as a link and means of contact and consultation between the Government and the Coloured population&#x201D;. From this it is quite obvious that the powers of the council are circumscribed to the extent that recommendations can be made by this council, but they need not be acted upon by the Government. Again, in relation to the acquisition and the disposal of property, or the appointment of servants&#x2014; I am taking some of the smaller things&#x2014;or in relation to doing anything which it should consider necessary in the exercise of its powers, the council may do these things only with the approval of the hon. Minister of Coloured Affairs, after he has consulted with the Minister of Finance. That is all they have got. What sort of autonomy is this&#x003F; What sort of parliament can this be, with such limited powers and functions&#x003F; And as though these restrictions are not sufficient, there is an over-riding provision in Clause 21 (2) which specifically lays down &#x2026;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>What about 21 (1)&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member can deal with that. I will come to that in due course. There is an over-riding provision in Clause 21 (2) which specifically lays down that no proposed law shall be introduced in the council except with the approval of the Minister, granted after consultation with the Minister of Finance. It is true that under Clause 21 (1), which my hon. friend has mentioned, a fiction is created of conferring legislative power on the council, but if one reads Clause 21 (1), it appears what that legislative power amounts to. As I see it, the position is that the legislative powers under 21 (1) vested in this so-called parliament will be hamstrung to the following extent: Only if the State President has issued a proclamation that the council may legislate on a specific issue and only if the Minister of Coloured Affairs and the Minister of Finance have approved of a proposed Bill on that issue, and only if the State President has assented to this measure, and only if that measure is not in conflict with any laws passed by this Parliament, then and only then will that measure become law, after publication in the <i>Gazette.</i> That is the extent of the powers that this Coloured parliament will have under Clause 21 (1). The State President, who in this case is the Minister himself&#x2014;his name is used <i>ex officio</i>&#x2014;may reject any measure passed by the council. The effect of all this, as I see it, is that the council in terms of this Bill will have no legislative powers whatsoever. It will only be able to advise on specific matters referred to it by the Government and when requested to do so. It will only be permitted to make recommendations on planning which may or may not be acted upon by the hon. the Minister. Only when the State President&#x2014;the Minister himself&#x2014;assigns powers in regard to specific matters, will the council have restricted legislative powers to deal with those restricted matters in the way I have indicated. Is this the type of parliament that the hon. Prime Minister had in mind when he addressed the representatives of the Coloured people in December 1961&#x003F; Is this &#x201C;the full control&#x201D; of their own affairs as envisaged by the hon. the Prime Minister on that solemn occasion, when for the first time in the history of this country, the Prime Minister declared what his views were in regard to the future of the Coloured people&#x003F; How can this Bill possibly be reconciled with the solemn promise made by the hon. Prime Minister to the Coloureds that they would be in full control of their affairs with their own parliament and their own cabinet&#x003F;</p>

<p>As I see this Bill the powers vested in this council amount to virtually nothing, and even when additional legislative powers are assigned to them, the position will be that the hon. Minister of Coloured Affairs will be able to dictate to the council which Bills they may pass and which they may not pass. He will be able to have the most innocuous Bills of his own choosing passed by the council instead of by this Parliament. In case some of the hon. members there think that I am giving my own interpretation of this portion of the Bill, I want to refer the hon. Minister to what appeared in the <i>South African Digest,</i> a Government issue, on 5 March 1964 on page 6&#x2014;this is what the hon. Minister himself says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Although the powers of the council will be mainly advisory, it may eventually have legislative powers when the State President assigns such powers to it on specific matters.</block>

<p>Should such powers be assigned, the Minister of Coloured Affairs will be able to have Bills of his choosing passed by the council instead of by Parliament.</p>

<p>This is the Government&#x2019;s own declaration of what the powers of the council are going to be.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I will pass it to the, hon. the Minister. He can read it himself. To my mind this Bill is a mere illusion. It in no way confers upon this so-called parliament the legislative powers promised by the hon. the Prime Minister when he announced his scheme of creating a state within a state. On the contrary I say that in terms of this <span class="col_4103-4104" refersTo="page_0744"/>Bill legislative powers have been denied to the Representative Coloured Council. With regard to the consultation at high level, about which we have heard so much from the hon. the Prime Minister and the Minister himself, it must be clear to everyone that the consultation envisaged in this Bill&#x2014;that is consultation without power to enforce decision&#x2014;cannot be any real consultation at all. This type of consultation without the power to enforce the considered opinions of the council is only complete illusion. Right through the Bill we get merely illusions for the Coloured people. The council in terms of this Bill will moreover have no powers to tax their own people, even within their own areas. Even in respect of the Coloured people&#x2019;s own contribution to the national income, either by way of direct or indirect taxation, this council will have no powers to deal with these contributions. Can anyone imagine any worse example of taxation without proper representation&#x003F; Even in regard to the freedom of speech in this Coloured parliament, a strong limitation is placed upon the powers of this council. Here again the right of free speech is a mere illusion. In terms of Clause 16, the members of the so-called parliament will not have the defence or protection of privilege in respect of anything said or done by them in regard to the Senate, the House of Assembly, a provincial council or a court of law, or a statutory body, or a member thereof or an officer of the public service. This means in effect that this so-called Coloured parliament will not have the right under the cloak of privilege to criticize the Government or the action of any Member of Parliament, or indeed even the action of a policeman because the latter is an officer of the Public Service. They could not even discuss or criticize the actions of a policeman because he is an officer of the Public Service. What freedom of speech is this&#x003F;</p>

<p>Wherever one looks in this Bill, one comes up against restrictions and reservations which virtually place a muzzle on this so-called parliament. For instance, in Clause 21 of the Bill you will note that the State President by proclamation may confer upon the council powers to make laws in respect of any specified subject set out in Clause 17 (6) (a). Then it says that the council shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the same powers to make laws in regard to such subjects as are vested in Parliament. Have you ever heard of such hypocrisy, Sir&#x003F; It is an absolute delusion of the Coloured people. The words &#x201C;subject to the provisions of this Act&#x201D; are so wide, in that they bring into operation the limitations and restrictions contained in this Act, which virtually render meaningless these powers to make laws. To my mind this is one of the biggest illusions in the whole Act.</p>

<p>It may be said that the purpose of this Bill is merely to cover a transitional period, and I am sure that some hon. members will say so, but nowhere in this Bill is this made clear. This Bill purports to become a permanent piece of our legislation. If it is intended to cover merely a period of transition, why does the Bill not say so&#x003F; We must therefore take it that this Bill has been introduced for the purpose of remaining as a permanent piece of legislation of the country; or is it intended that these restrictions and reservations will be imposed on this Coloured body in order to test them, in order just to see how sycophantic this body can be to the Government&#x003F; I am driven to feel that that is the real purpose behind this Bill. I am afraid that one is led to that conclusion by the Prime Minister&#x2019;s own words when he told the Coloured people on the occasion I have mentioned that all this would be accomplished for the Coloured people within ten years, but added, &#x201C;Everything depends on the co-operation of the Coloured people; the fuller the co-operation, the quicker will the changeover take place&#x201D;. I want to ask the Minister whether this is the real reason for imposing all these restrictions and reservations on the council, so as to see what measure of co-operation can be obtained from the representatives &#x2018; of the Coloured people&#x003F; There are many more shortcomings to the Bill. We will have an opportunity at a later stage to deal with many more shortcomings, but I think I have said sufficient about this measure to condemn it in no uncertain terms as an unnecessary piece of sectional legislation which can only have the effect of further alienating the Coloured people from us. and of widening the gulf between the Coloureds and the Whites in this country. In all seriousness, how can this Bill be regarded as compensation for the loss of the political rights which the Coloured people have suffered at the hands of this Government&#x003F; To my mind, when the Coloured people have had an opportunity to study this Bill&#x2014;and I doubt whether they have had that opportunity up to now&#x2014;they will realize its many shortcomings and how they have been led up the garden path by the Utopian promises made to them by the Prime Minister. Sir, I have read a report which was recently presented to the International Labour Conference in regard to South Africa&#x2019;s continued membership of that organization, and in it the following statement appears&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The committee is convinced of the existence in South Africa of a legislative system applied only to the indigenous population and designed to maintain an insuperable barrier between those people and the inhabitants of European origin. &#x2026;</block>

<p>To my mind, this Bill falls into the pattern of the legislative system referred to in that report. This Bill is another step by the Government designed to maintain an insuperable barrier between the indigenous Coloured people of this country and the Whites. It can only have the effect of widening the gulf which has unfortunately been created by this pattern of legislation which has taken place over the last 15 years.</p>

<p><span class="col_4105-4106" refersTo="page_0745"/>There is another aspect I should like to deal with very briefly. The impression was created by the hon. the Minister in the course of his speech that the present Coloured council at its private meeting on 24 February had unanimously approved of this draft Bill. In a report in the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 5 April there appears a statement by Mr. M. D. Arendse, an elected member of the council, in which he first of all refutes the claim made by the Minister of Coloured Affairs that as far as the future of the Coloured people are concerned the sky is the limit, and then he denies that the council at its private meeting had approved the draft Bill unanimously, as was reported. He disclosed that when the meeting was summoned, not a single member had a draft copy of the Bill. They only had copies of the recommendations which the council itself had made. These recommendations were approved practically unanimously, and for the rest, Mr. Arendse says that the following resolution was adopted by 14 votes to five&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in view of the fact that councillors were not provided with printed copies of the Bill to constitute a representative council for the Coloured people of South Africa, the council agrees that a deputation be appointed to discuss with the Minister various aspects of the Bill which were not brought to the notice of the council when the special meeting of the council was called on 24 February, and that further the members of the council feel alarmed at the restrictions placed on the contemplated new council with regard to the initiation of legislation which may have a direct bearing on the interests and desires of the Coloured group.</block>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS</person>:</from>

<p>I am surprised at the attitude of the United Party. They wish to return to the old set-up under which they could use the Coloured vote as their ally. What surprised me was the attitude of the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) when he referred in a belittling way to the statement made by the Prime Minister. His entire speech from beginning to end was belittling. He does not fall into the same category as other Opposition members because he represents the Coloureds. No matter how small he regards the start to be, he ought to be a little more appreciative, and show a little more gratitude for the fact that a beginning is being made somewhere to hold out something new to these people. On the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the birth of William Shakespeare I want to tell him that he reminds me of a passage from &#x201C;As You Like It&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Blow, blow, thou winter wind,</block>

<block name="quote">Thou art not so unkind as man&#x2019;s ingratitude.</block>

<p>The hon. member over-emphasized the importance of the words &#x201C;on request&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;The council shall have power on request to advise the Government&#x201D;, but he skipped sub-section (b) which says &#x201C;and to make such recommendations to the Government in regard to any planning calculated to promote the best interests of the said population&#x201D;. He has not furthered the cause of those people to-day by dissociating that which can be done for the Coloureds in future from that which can be offered for public consumption. That is as far as a Government can go and as fast as the electorate will allow it to go. He need not kiss the feet of the Minister but it is his duty to say: Although we do not see eye to eye, it is nevertheless a small beginning; it is not as good as that which was offered in the Cape Colony from 1852 to 1872 but it is nevertheless something in that direction. Surely all young nations which are under guardianship have to start somewhere. I shall leave the hon. member at that because he has made himself ridiculous by trying to ridicule the motives of this legislation. Professor Edgar Brookes said the following about the franchise: &#x201C;The franchise is a right that must be seen relative to the recipient&#x2019;s ability to use it.&#x201D; I support this legislation for two reasons, firstly, because it rectifies a position which requires to be rectified, namely, the discrimination between the provinces. We who are undergoing this development, both industrially and constitutionally, are hampered by the fact that throughout the years there has not been greater uniformity than there is to-day as far as that is concerned. The second reason why I support the Bill is because it introduces a new principle and confers new rights on people. It does not disfranchise anybody, but gives the franchise to a class of people who have not had it before. Any democrat and anybody who pretends to be idealistic about this sort of thing should show a little appreciation of this. Let us see what pattern was followed in the provinces in that century &#x2014;and I take the liberty of referring to the past because every speaker who has spoken so far has referred to the &#x201C;rights existing for over a century&#x201D;. Two yardsticks were always used. All attempts to extend the Coloured franchise to the northern provinces have come up against difficulties, both in the Convention and under the first Hertzog Government. Even before Union a distinction was drawn between the franchise in the Cape Province and Natal. No distinction was made in granting the franchise to the Bantu and at one time even the Indians had the municipal vote in Natal. That shows that different yardsticks were used. Here we have a measure which, although elementary and perhaps insignificant, is sowing the seed of equal treatment in all the provinces of the Republic. Surely this new principle of an unqualified vote is a step forward in the process of withdrawing our guardianship, as the hon. the Minister has stated, and when you use the words &#x201C;withdrawing our guardianship&#x201D; you surely admit that you subscribe to the principle of guardianship, and if you subscribe to the principle of <span class="col_4107-4108" refersTo="page_0746"/>guardianship you have to admit that guardianship is not something to last for ever. The word &#x201C;guardianship&#x201D; itself carries within it the quality of change and of growth and development. That is why the process must of necessity be adapted to the ability and the competence of those people who receive those new rights to use them, to handle them and to appreciate them. How will you develop a sense of responsibility in a person if you do not confer responsibility on him&#x003F; How will you develop a sound sense of values in a person if you do not allow him to acquire a knowledge of those values&#x003F; That reminds me of the mother who strictly forbade her son to go into the water until he could swim. The world around us offers us many examples of what happens when political rights are injudiciously conferred on people before they are sufficiently mature to receive them. When you look at a country like Indonesia, where Russia and America are competing to see who can pour the most money into it, we realize that there is hardly a place in the world where inflation and corruption are as rampant as there. Nobody appreciates anything handed to him on a platter; you must work for it. The injudicious granting of rights may destroy your very object. Lord Milner and Lord Asquith exchanged many ideas in correspondence on how the Boer and the Britisher could be united in the old Cape Colony. Before the Boer War Lord Milner wrote to Lord Asquith that it would be easy to unite the Boer and the Britisher; you only have to protect the non-White injudiciously then you will unite them, but you will unite them against yourself. That, Sir, is to-day still the kernel of the matter. Wherever you act injudiciously it has a boomerang effect. Any party who lavishly confers political rights on people who are not ready to receive them, will be up against the voters. Because of their attitude towards the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll the United Party has on every occasion managed to unite the White electorate of this country against them. The White voters reject this attitude of a Common Roll to such an extent that I can call as evidence what staunch old supporters of that party say, when you tell them that you yourself do not know where you got your own majority from, namely: We are voting for you people until such time as our party changes its policy; then we shall again vote for them. They want to turn to the days when, as Mr. D. K. Long wrote, the Coloured vote was &#x201C;surreptitiously up for sale&#x201D;. I am sure there are many members in this House who did not stand as candidates in those days when we still had the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, but some of the older members will remember them and they will know what that term &#x201C;surreptitiously up for sale&#x201D; means; and was it &#x201C;surreptitious&#x201D;! The hon. member for Peninsula said that was not a reason for the bitterness. Surely he knows he is talking against his better judgment. We who live together as neighbours and friends and who. differ from each other are sufficiently mature and well balanced not to hate each other tomorrow but when the Coloured, whom you taught in the dark only the other day how to sign his name, is called in to act as arbiter between you and me in order to settle a difference we could have settled ourselves, bitterness follows.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment see what the history of the qualified vote is. I want to tell hon. members on my right, who so often expatiate on &#x201C;the right of a century&#x201D;, how often changes were effected and with what object. Those rights were granted in 1854 and they were changed in 1887 by raising the occupational qualification; that removed 30,000 from the roll. That is disfranchisement. Listening to hon. members one would say that in terms of this measure people were being taken off the Voters&#x2019; Roll and disfranchised. In 1892 when the educational qualification was introduced and the occupational qualification raised from &#x00A3;25 to &#x00A3;75 the object was not to get a brighter type of voter or to raise the level of education. We know what the object was. The object was to disfranchise the non-Whites, and that was done. When you read the correspondence between Jan Henrik Hofmeyr and Cecil John Rhodes you see what happened between the parties before that legislation was introduced.</p>

<p>I think the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs made one mistake the other day. He said that over the past 100 years a Coloured person had never sat in this Parliament or was never elected as mayor. After Union that could not happen, but before Union, nearly 60 years ago, I know of a case here in Cape Town where a Malay stood as a candidate for Parliament. His name was Ahmed Effendi. Effendi is a title similar to &#x201C;sir&#x201D;; he was not an ordinary Malay therefore. He was referred to in those debates as &#x201C;an eminent gentleman of very high standing&#x201D;. In 1893 when the old Cape Parliament met for the last session before an election, there was already talk that he would be nominated. Under the old principle of the cumulative vote where all the Malays could have voted for this candidate, he stood a good chance of being elected. But a certain Mr. Orpen hurriedly piloted a Bill through this House to do away with that system. It was called the Constitution Ordinance Amendment Bill, Act No. 16 of 1893. Both parties worked together and even a person like Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr who said he would not mind sitting in this House with Effendi nevertheless voted for that legislation. Here I have the Hansard of that session in which a person like Mr. Schreiner said this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">He hoped they would never establish the doctrine in this country that all men were equal. (Hear, hear.) The exercising of a vote was in his view a privilege and not a right. Had he been in the House when the compromise was made on the Franchise Bill, he would have opposed it. There was no vested right in a vote. Let them vote on this cumulative question now, aye or nay. (Hear, <span class="col_4109-4110" refersTo="page_0747"/>hear.) It was said they were going in for class legislation while the Statute Book was full of class legislation. The sooner they recognized that class legislation was necessary, the better.</block>

<p>Mr. Schreiner differed from Professor Brookes. Whereas the latter said &#x201C;The franchise is a right&#x201D;, he said &#x201C;the franchise is not a right, but a privilege&#x201D;. That was one instance over that whole period of 100 years where a Coloured person wanted to stand as a candidate but he was not allowed to do so. When they realized he stood a chance of being elected, they hurriedly passed legislation to prevent that. On each occasion when the franchise legislation was changed over that 100 years the object was to compensate the Whites for their lack in numbers. Let us admit that. Throughout the 100 years, whether it was by &#x201C;hook or by crook&#x201D; or not, it was to compensate the Whites for their lack in numbers. Even after Union with the removal of the qualification in the case of the Whites and its retention in the case of the non-Whites there was discrimination. They also discriminated later on when the franchise was given to the White woman but not to the non-White woman and the source of the struggle was removed and bitterness ended when the Coloured was placed on a separate roll. Unlike the leader of the Coloured Representatives who belittles everything the Minister does, I do not wish to belittle the way they normally act in this House, but to compliment them on it. If they do not allow themselves to be influenced by the people on their right, when they take up the cudgels in the normal way on behalf of the people they represent here, they act without prejudice and in the interests of their voters, and that is why I say relationships have improved since they have been receiving instructions from their own people without the Coloured being used as arbiter between White and White.</p>

<p>The attitude of the United Party is simply like the dead hand of the past. I actually expected them to say this measure was not really what they expected, or that it did not go far enough. But by saying &#x201C;We are going to act in a radical way&#x201D; and moving that the second reading be taken this day six months, they are only putting the clock back and putting a stop to all development and growth. I am sorry my neighbour and constituent, the hon. member for Green Point, has left the Chamber and that the Leader of the Opposition is not here either. I fought them in elections with the Coloureds on the Voters&#x2019; Roll and off it. They held meetings for them behind closed doors so that I had to ask on one occasion: What does a White man say to a Coloured that another White man may not hear&#x003F; [Interjections.] I am not talking about the time when the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) was the election agent of the hon. member for Rondebosch. I can only say that he was successful on one occasion and of the other occasion I can only say &#x201C;Do not shoot the man at the piano; he&#x2019;s doing his best&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Before I sit down I just want to put this question to the United Party. This measure is going through and it will be ridiculed and belittled, just as the present Coloured council is to-day, but on the other hand they say: &#x201C;We respect them and they have always respected us.&#x201D; It may perhaps be belittled for a short time but when the registration and the delimitation is complete one envisages a situation where the 30 elected members who will serve on the council will be nominated and where there will be organization. Perhaps they will carry a label. Perhaps the one will have the sign of Taurus and the other one not, but they will wear labels. There will probably be candidates who will be well disposed towards the Government and there will also be candidates who will be hostile to the Government. I think it is normal to expect that; surely there must be organization to win an election; surely a person must adopt an attitude; you have to decide where you fit into the pattern. I want to put this question to the United Party this afternoon. If there are candidates who are well disposed towards the Government and there are no candidates who are hostile towards the Government will they ensure that such candidates are nominated&#x003F; The hon. member for Gardens may reply to that; he is their leader in the Cape Province. Let us assume the time arrives to elect these so-called &#x201C;stooges&#x201D;; there is a Voters&#x2019; Roll; the delimitation has taken place and nomination day dawns. Supposing a candidate is nominated who is well-disposed towards the Government and its policy. Will the United Party endeavour to nominate somebody to oppose that candidate&#x003F; The hon. member need not reply immediately, he can first think about it and reply to me later on when this debate is over. Will the hon. member for Gardens and his party endeavour to nominate a candidate to oppose such a person&#x003F;</p>

It is no good belittling the first elementary step which is taken here to place a group of people on the road to promote their own interests. Even if this measure is a weak instrument it is nevertheless an instrument that can be used in that direction; it is no good belittling and ridiculing it. You must not only be prepared to co-operate when you can derive some benefit for yourself out of it. Well, I take it that the United Party will not do so; surely that will not be cricket.

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has set out the case fairly and squarely as to what the Government is actually setting out to do, in direct contrast to what the hon. the Prime Minister undertook to do in terms of a speech which he delivered before the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. Sir, I also took the trouble to read the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s second-reading speech in detail, and here again I must say that I was surprised to find very little to justify the measure which he has placed before the House and much that has nothing to do with the Bill here. First of all, let us ask ourselves whether this Bill finds favour with the Coloured community. Reference has been made to the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. Let me say here and now that the Coloured community, with very few exceptions, is 100 per cent against a Bill of this kind.</p>

<p>They reject it, and I would like the House to know that no amount of camouflage, no amount of sweet words, will alter the fact that this Bill does not do what the Prime Minister told the Union Council for Coloured Affairs would be done. After 1951, when the Separate Representation of Voters&#x2019; Bill became law, provision was made for a Coloured advisory board, which never saw the light of day because there was the controversy and the circus of the High Court of Parliament Act. Sir, one must look at this thing objectively. I can assure you that it is the wish of the Coloured people to be recognized as part and parcel of the West. They are part; they want to be with us; they want to be friends with us, and when I hear talk about bitterness, and bitterness creating hatred, I shudder, because there are 1,500,000 people involved. These people have been pushed aside; they have been the victims of all the legislation introduced by this Government. By way of interjection the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) mentioned the Group Areas Act. I would like to urge Government members to find out for themselves what the Coloured people think of that piece of legislation. They will be amazed; I think they will even be shocked.</p>

<p>Well, I was going to say &#x201C;ashamed&#x201D; but that will take a little time to take effect. Sir, I work amongst the Coloured people; I know them, and I say that no man in the Cape, and even in the Transvaal, can for one moment suggest or even hope that the type of treatment which is being meted out to the Coloured community will bring any credit whatsoever, anywhere: it simply will not do it.</p>

<p>Let us deal now with the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. I do not call the members of that body stooges. The Union Council for Coloured Affairs has a majority of nominated members. As a member first of the provincial council, for many, many years and now as a Member of Parliament, I thought it would be to my advantage to ascertain what these people discuss; what recommendations they make to the Minister; to find out whether the Minister acts upon those recommendations and what results flow from them. I wrote a letter to the Department asking if I could have that information. The reply I got was that according to Section So and So the proceedings are confidential. They are confidential even as far as we Coloured representatives are concerned. I would say that if there is one group that should know what these people want, then it is the representatives of the Coloureds sitting in this House. I think many men on the Union Council for Coloured Affairs are maligned by their fellows because they are not trying to put up a fight, but their hands are tied; and their tongues are tied by the Minister, because the proceedings are confidential. They may not speak. We find therefore that the members of this council, which we are led to believe was originally set up, according to the Prime Minister, to devise ways and means of preparing the ground for this new type of Council, are frustrated people. We are told that they have been consulted and that the Coloured people have been consulted. Sir, I have yet to meet a Coloured person who has been consulted on any of this legislation&#x2014;and I meet many of them. I would say to the hon. the Minister that the direction in which the Government is proceeding is wrong; the attitude of the United Party is the correct attitude. We should take these people with us; they want to be with us. I am not impressed by what was said in 1909. We are living in 1964. I suggest and I urge, even at this late hour, that the terms of this Bill should be so amended as to make it an effective measure, although I, personally, and my party feel that this is an entirely wrong process; that it will not achieve anything that we are setting out to do, because the consultations are all <i>vis-&#x00E0;-vis</i> the Minister via the Secretary for Coloured Affairs with the Council. Sir, we have seen the pattern unfolding over the years. Those of us who have been in close contact with the Coloured people know that their attitude is that this is simply another piece of legislation following the same pattern. The hon. the Prime Minister was faced with a difficulty in dealing with the <span class="col_4113-4114" refersTo="page_0749"/>Coloured people, because he had no homeland for them. We therefore find ourselves with this type of hybrid organization where we are going to have a sort of provincial council, almost a Parliament, within the Republic. This council was going to have powers which, according to the reports that we saw before we saw the Bill, were going to cut across the functions of administrators and Cabinet Ministers, because the Prime Minister said in his address to these people in 1961 and in 1960 when a similar address was made&#x2014;that the Ministers &#x201C;would have to consult&#x201D; this council at least once a year. So I take it that for the rest of the 12 months they are to be left to their own devices, and there is nothing that they can do without consultation with somebody, without the permission or authority of somebody or by way of proclamation. Sir, I give the hon. the Minister of Community Development credit for being well aware, through his long political career, of the feeling of the Coloured community. He knows them; he knows them as well as many of us do and perhaps even better. I can say here quite frankly, this afternoon, that the Coloured community is distressed. There is no question of bitterness, but they are distressed, hurt and offended because they are being insulted at all turns and on all levels: They are being told that they are a menace and a danger whereas they are nothing of the kind. They are the friends, the allies and the partners of the White man.</p>

We have had these advisory committees in many fields, set up by well-meaning people who thought that they could achieve something by seeking advice.

I would say that after his experience over many years with the Union Council for Coloured Affairs he should know precisely what these people are expected to do. But on the Minister&#x2019;s own admission the thought had not crystallized as to what the functions of this council are going to be.

There are other groups of people in this country who are Coloured. Are they not going to have a chance to nominate members&#x003F; I ask the Minister that and I should like to hear his reply. I go further. In examining the Bill in detail one finds that it is very carefully designed to see that the council will be ineffective. In the first place the Voters&#x2019; Roll is going to be on a voluntary basis, not on a compulsory basis. The hon. the Minister gives a rather extraordinary reason for making it voluntary. He says that by placing it on the voluntary basis he is going to eliminate undesirable elements. Surely the man who is an undesirable element in the eyes of the Government, or anybody else, is going to see that he is nominated and he is going to-make a lot of trouble. I would say that for a Voters&#x2019; Roll to be effective it must be properly compiled, and I ask the hon. the Minister to reconsider that particular aspect of this legislation. Another point is this: A candidate must reside for two years in the province in which the electoral division lies in which he hopes to stand. Why&#x003F; If he is a Coloured individual and he is on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, why must he reside for two years in the electoral division in which he hopes to stand&#x003F; I will tell you why. I was going to say in parenthesis that it would be a sorry day for many members on the Government side if they had to live in their constituencies for two years before they could be elected to Parliament.</p>

If a Coloured person interested in the welfare of his people decided that the place for him to be was in Natal or the Free State or the Transvaal so that he could carry his people along with him, why, if he has the necessary qualifications and he is on the roll, should he not be able to stand for election&#x003F; After all, he is a South African. What is the object of this provision&#x003F; I do not want to impute ulterior motives to the hon. the Minister. I simply say to the hon. the Minister that he could not have thought of the implications of this. We are often told that the Coloured people in the other provinces are not as experienced as the Coloured people in the Cape. Surely we want the most experienced <span class="col_4115-4116" refersTo="page_0750"/>people in a council of this kind. Sir, what is going to happen in the ultimate result&#x003F; In ten years&#x2019; time, as the hon. the Prime Minister said, these people can be masters in their own house, controlling everything in which they are interested. Five items are mentioned; let us just run through them quickly. Take finance, for example. Where are they going to get the money from&#x003F; It is going to be handed out to this council on much the same basis as the province gets a subsidy from the Central Government. I am just wondering to what extend they are going to be hamstrung, as the province was hamstrung in Coloured education for years, by the withholding of money. The result was that they could not get education for Coloured people in the Cape Province in particular, where compulsory education has been the law for some years but has never been carried out, although Nationalist Administrators have wished to do so. Where are these people going to get their money&#x003F; That is a question which I put fairly and squarely to the hon. the Minister. Once they have developed to the stage where they are all on their own, are they still going to have to come along cap in hand as Administrators have to do&#x003F; Will the Administrators of the four provinces and the Administrator of the Coloured council all have to sit together and ask for money, or will this council first have to obtain the approval of the Minister of Community Development and the Secretary for Coloured Affairs&#x003F; These are the points on which I should like to have an answer. Let us take local government. It is a well-known fact that the Coloured community is most unwilling to set up local authorities; in fact they do not act where they are asked by town councils to set up local authorities. What local authorities are going to be responsible to the Minister, and who will be responsible for the setting up of new authorities&#x003F; It is an easy matter to talk about Athlone; and you might be able to do something in a portion of the Transvaal and in Johannesburg. But I want to know who is going to be responsible for the Coloured people in a place like Beaufort West. Are they going to have their own town council there&#x003F; There are 13,000 Coloureds and 5,000 Whites there. Are the Whites going to move&#x003F; There are all these small villages on the West Coast. Are those councils going to be Coloured councils, because the Coloureds are in the majority there&#x003F; [Interjections.] That is what the Bill provides. Take the question of education. Education is now being handled by the Minister of Coloured Affairs. He has a lot of money and I hope and trust that he is going to spend it well. Sir, it took about eight years, if not longer, for the Nationalist Party majority in the provincial council to be persuaded to pass ordinances and resolutions to get the Government to take over Coloured education. How long is it going to take to transfer Coloured education from the Coloured Affairs Department to this new Coloured council&#x003F; Because that is what the Bill says. The Bill says that they are going to be the masters in their own house. Take the question of community welfare and pensions. Does the Minister for one moment think that the Minister of this council who is responsible for the implementation of ithe Group Areas Act in Coloured areas is going to act expeditiously&#x003F; I put these questions to the Minister because I know from experience, from the hard fact of experience, that the Coloured people resent these things. They do not know how to express their resentment; they express it through their representatives here in this House. The hon. member for Malmesbury was very quick to talk about increasing the number of Coloured representatives in proportion to the increase in the number of Whites. Sir, there are Coloured people in the Transvaal who think they should have a Member of Parliament here. Why should they not have one&#x003F; If the Coloured representatives are going to stay here, surely there should be a Coloured representative for the Transvaal. What about the Coloureds of the Free State and the Coloureds of Natal&#x003F; All four gentlemen who sit here represent the Coloureds of the Cape Province. I think the hon. the Minister must give very serious thought to the implications of this measure. Sir, we say that we must take the Coloured man with us; he belongs with us; he wants to be with us. Here we have a group of people who have lived with us, who have been our friends for 300 years, who have never caused any trouble, who have never been involved in revolts or strikes, and who are law-abiding people. But the Government Party is afraid of them. Sir, I have listened to many speeches about the Coloured people from hon. members opposite, but I have yet to hear the good old English word &#x201C;kindness&#x201D; uttered. The whole attitude of the Nationalist Party is one of fear. The hon. the Prime Minister is a very good psychologist in reverse. Psychology is supposed to get the best out of everybody. The idea of psychology is to get rid of complexes. I think the hon. the Prime Minister might devote his attentions to the members of his own party to get rid of some of their complexes and particularly their fear complex.</p>

<p>Finally I would like to make an appeal. I want to say to the hon. the Minister of Community Development that there are many people who are prepared to help. The Coloured people are prepared to be reasoned with, but they must be reasoned with by people in whom they have confidence &#x2026;</p>

<p>&#x2026; and I say to the hon. the Minister that the four members who represent the Coloured community should know a lot more about what goes on in the Department than we do. Sir, I say to you quite frankly that I can speak with absolute knowledge, as can the other members who represent the Coloureds in this House; they may have different <span class="col_4117-4118" refersTo="page_0751"/>points of view on other subjects but on these fundamental points they are at one, because they are in touch with the Coloured community; they meet the leaders, the self-appointed leaders as well as the genuine leaders of the Coloured people. They meet people at all levels and in all sections of their society, and they know exactly what the Coloureds think. The Coloured man can be made a very happy man, a most useful member of the community if the Government would leave him alone for five years, and allow him to get on with the job of living, and, if the Government would direct its legislation away from the Coloured man, away from the humiliations which are being thrust upon him, away from all these compulsory moves to which he is subjected, where he is not permitted to trade, where he is uprooted here and uprooted there. I do hope that what I have said this afternoon, even at this late stage, will influence the Minister. I think he can be influenced and I think the Coloured people would like us to influence him. They would like him to know that they do not approve and that they do not accept this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) told us that we were introducing this Bill because we want to abolish Coloured representation in this Parliament. The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden), who has just sat down, also said that it was just a question of time. Mr. Speaker, when one listens to this type of speech, it becomes quite clear to one that no fault can be found with the merits of the separate representation of the Coloureds in this Parliament but that the fault lies with the representatives of the Coloureds in Parliament. Take, for example, the hon. member for Karoo. He is a member of the United Party. He was elected under United Party colours; he is a member of the United Party caucus. How can he be objective in respect of any legislation which deals with the Coloureds&#x003F; He has to obey the caucus of the United Party, otherwise he will be thrown out of the party. He cannot adopt an independent attitude. Even though he may feel that this legislation is in the interests of the Coloureds, he must nevertheless vote against this measure. I am sorry to have to ask this, but what about the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg)&#x003F; What about the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett)&#x003F; They are both members of the United Party and they are both supporters of the United Party. Although they are not members of the United Party caucus, they are nevertheless enrolled members of the United Party and they vote for the United Party at every election. During all the years that they have been members of this House they have never adopted an objective attitude in respect of any legislation affecting the Coloureds.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula quoted to us what Councillor Arendse had to say, according to a <i>Sunday Times</i> report, namely that they did not know the contents of this Bill. Unfortunately for the hon. member I myself was present and I know what happened on that occasion. I have here an explanatory memorandum on the proposed Bill which was submitted to them.</p>

<p>Now suddenly the hon. member wants to see it, although they practically accused me of not being honest with the Coloureds. Why did they not first approach me before making that accusation&#x003F; Here I have the explanatory memorandum in which the whole Bill is explained. I went through the whole of the proposed Bill, which at that stage had not yet been introduced, with them clause by clause, and when we had gone through all the 31 clauses the chairman stood up and said that he would like somebody to move a motion in connection with this Bill. A motion was then moved to the effect that they approved of this whole Bill, and that motion was adopted unanimously. There was one problem. A few of the councillors adopted a certain attitude. Councillor Arendse, for example, asked for certain things which it was impossible for us to agree to. He wanted a portfolio of Foreign Affairs. That was quite out of the question. We were not even prepared to do this for the Transkei. His argument was that Coloured people travelled abroad&#x2014;by this he probably meant the Williams family and their piano! He wanted a portfolio of Foreign Affairs; he wanted a portfolio of Justice; he wanted portfolios of Posts and Telegraphs and Transport. One of the other councillors, Councillor Fortein, wrote as follows in the March issue of the <i>Banner</i> &#x2014;March comes after February in case hon. members do not know it&#x2014;after I had explained this whole Bill to them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Miniature model parliament: Strong political instrument in the hands of the Coloureds. The Bill now before Parliament to establish a Coloured Representative Council is yet another important outcome of the Second World War which has underlined the urgent need for social reconstruction throughout the world.</block>

<p>The Opposition talk about a Common Roll, but this is what Councillor Fortein had to say in his article&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our cherished vote only had sudden importance at general election times. Then it was artificially inseminated to swell White political parties&#x2019; seats in a privileged White Parliament. So it lost its significance and it did not bring to the Coloured masses general prosperity, progress and happiness.</block>

<p>These are strong words, Mr. Speaker, and they were written by one of the councillors to whose arguments we have always been prepared to listen, although we have differed from him in many respects. For example, the <span class="col_4119-4120" refersTo="page_0752"/>Proposal that (there should be 18 elected members from the Cape came from him. The original idea was that the Cape should have 12 elected members. He then said that because the Cape had almost 1,000,000 voters and the other provinces had fewer voters, this would not be fair. He then suggested that the Cape should have 18 elected members. I do not want to quote this whole article but I would just like to read out this further quotation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The tempo of Coloured development will from now onwards depend on the degree of co-operation of the Coloured community with the Government which is prepared to uplift them.</block>

<p>That is what he had to say.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the hon. member for Karoo, who objected to the fact that provision was being made in this Bill for the representation of the Griquas and Malays. Does he not know as a Coloured Representative that provision is also made on the present Union Coloured Council for separate representatives for the Griquas and the Malays&#x003F; There is one Griqua and one Malay representative on the present Union Coloured Council and we are now simply making provision in this Bill for two Griqua and two Malay representatives. But this principle is already being applied in the present Coloured council. The hon. member for Karoo went further and said that none of the Coloureds supported this Bill. He told us that he had fought an election on this issue, but the hon. member for Karoo did not discuss this Bill specifically with the Coloured people. Although he made that allegation, at no time during his election campaign did he submit this Bill to the Coloured people.</p>

<p>I want to come now to the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) who objects to the fact that the Chairman of the Executive Committee will be appointed by the State President. The Chairman of the Council will be like the Speaker in this House and the Chairman of the Executive Committee will be like an Administrator. The four Administrators of the Republic are appointed by the State President. Are our Administrators &#x201C;stooges&#x201D; of the Government&#x003F; The same principle is being applied here and the chairman will be appointed by the State President, just as the Administrators of the various provinces are appointed by him.</p>

<p>Hon. members of the Opposition have made a plea here for their race federation policy and the hon. member for Gardens has once again made a plea for a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. According to a statement made by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition which appeared in the <i>Cape Argus</i> of 16 November 1963 he had the following to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am often asked whether each race &#x2026;</block>

<p>meaning the four race groups in South Africa &#x2014;Bantu, White, Coloured and Indian&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; would be represented in the Central Parliament by its own people. My answer is that the present United Party policy &#x2026;</block>

<p>You see, Mr. Speaker, he calls it &#x201C;the present United Party policy&#x201D;. He keeps the door open in case of a possible change&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">My answer is that the present United Party policy provides that the representatives in the Central Parliament will be Whites or Coloured.</block>

<p>I remember that during the Joint Sitting in 1954 the hon. the Leader of the Opposition moved an amendment which, amongst other things, embodied the following objections (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It may lead to the formation of a solid anti-White front against the Whites in South Africa.</block>

<p>This was in connection with the separate Voters&#x2019; Roll. He said that under his race federation plan only Whites and Coloureds would be able to sit in this House. Does this mean that the Coloureds will be able to represent the Indians here, that they will be able to represent the Bantu and the Whites here besides representing the Coloured people!</p>

</speech>

<p>That does not form part of the federation plan.</p>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it does. This is what the hon. the Leader of the Opposition himself had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am often asked whether each race will be represented in the Central Parliament by its own people. The answer is that the present United Party policy provides that the respresentatives in the Central Parliament will be Whites or Coloured.</block>

<p>That is perfectly clear. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In practice this will mean that councils will be established for the various races in South Africa but the Cape Coloured people will be grouped with the Europeans.</block>

<p>In other words, the Coloureds will be able to represent the Indians, the Natives, the Whites and their own people in this House. That is the solid bloc that will be formed.</p>

<p>It has also been said by hon. members opposite that the Coloureds reject the separate Voters&#x2019; Roll. That may have been so. They say that as a result of this fact the relationships between the Coloureds and the Whites in this country have deteriorated. Is that the case at present&#x003F;</p>

<p>The hon. member says &#x201C;definitely&#x201D; without adducing any proof in support of her statement. Mr. Speaker, that <span class="col_4121-4122" refersTo="page_0753"/>is not so. The hon. the Minister enjoys the full co-operation of the Coloured group today. The people who are actually in favour of a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll are not the conservative Coloured people; they are the Coloureds who want equality. Dr. van der Ross told the Select Committee on the Separate Representation of Voters Bill that the Coloureds people wanted a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. He said this in pursuance of a question put to him by Dr. D&#x00F6;nges, the chairman of the committee. Dr. van der Ross: &#x201C;We want eventual equality and we want to use the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll in order to obtain eventual equality.&#x201D; In terms of the race federation plan of the United Party it seems to me that Dr. van der Ross was right in saying that eventual equality would be the end result.</p>

<p>It has also been said here that we must win the goodwill of the Coloured; that we must make him our ally. I fully agree with those views. I agree that we must win the goodwill of the Coloureds, I agree that we must make him our ally. But that is what this legislation has in mind. Hon. members must tell me why it will be easier for the Coloured to become the ally of the White man once he is on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. Will he become the ally of the White man simply because he is on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll&#x003F; Why did the Native in Rhodesia, who had a seat in Parliament and who was on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll with the Whites, not become an ally of the Whites&#x003F; Why do we have a Notting Hill in England where the Coloureds are able to vote together with the Whites&#x003F; Why do we have a Little Rock in America where the Negroes are able to vote together with the Whites&#x003F; Has the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll there promoted better relationships between White and non-White&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, that is not what they want; they do not want an alliance; they want a piebald society in South Africa. The National Party regards the vote as part of the programme of upliftment of the Coloured. The United Party regards the vote as something apart; it regards the vote as something which is separate from the economic, financial and educational development of the Coloured. I remember that during the 1954 Joint Sitting the present President of the Other Place, Senator Naud&#x00E9;, moved an amendment to the effect that the vote should be regarded as part of the plan of uplifting the Coloured. That is also what we have in mind with this legislation. That is what the Coloureds want. The Coloured council, by a majority decision, adopted the principle that the vote should be given to 21-year-olds, and do you know what their argument was, Mr. Speaker&#x003F; I do not think anyone is prepared to say that the age limit should be fixed at 21 years of age for all time to come. But a very interesting argument was advanced in this regard. They said that they first wanted their people to be uplifted; that this would be achieved through the education given to the Coloureds, and that the Voting age could then be reduced to 18 years. In their original plan which we submitted to the Cabinet, they asked for a qualified vote. The argument which they advanced was that those people would then have something to strive for; that they would know that the vote was something which they could strive for and that in that way they would uplift themselves. The Cabinet did not accept the proposal of a qualified franchise. I just mention this in passing. The Coloureds do not regard the vote as something separate; they regard it as part of the work of upliftment that must be done amongst the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Reference was also made to the two-year residential qualification. Some of the councillors said that a member should be resident in his constituency. The argument which they advanced was that their people were not yet sufficiently mature; that they needed leaders and that because the member of the council was their leader, he should reside in his constituency. This shows how strongly they felt that the vote formed part of the process of uplifting them. But it was not possible to agree to this because if no capable person can be found in a certain constituency, it will be necessary to bring in someone from outside. But the principle underlying their argument is important and that is that they regard the vote as part of the work of upliftment that must be done throughout the whole of the Coloured community.</p>

<p>As the hon. the Minister correctly indicated in his second-reading speech&#x2014;this has already been accepted by the Coloureds&#x2014;this is not the final stage of their development because no national or political development is ever final. Let us consider the political development that has taken place in the Republic. Our own political situation has changed and developed during the past 50 years. Consider the development that has taken place within the Commonwealth. Was there any Englishman 25 years ago who thought that one day there would be a Kingdom and a Republic within the same Commonwealth&#x003F; That development has taken place. The hon. the Prime Minister correctly stated&#x2014;and his words are completely distorted &#x2026;</p>

<p>I withdraw that word; I did not mean it seriously. The hon. the Prime Minister said that this was not the final answer. He drew up a plan for the future and he sketched the portfolios which we have to-day. He said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The development of a Coloured cabinet to handle all Coloured affairs presents a great problem. It is not something that can be organized in one day; the control must be handed over gradually in a sensible way and on the basis of good co-operation. It should be possible within five years to make a great deal of progress with the construction of the framework for the take-over and full control must be in Coloured hands within ten years.</block>

<p><span class="col_4123-4124" refersTo="page_0754"/>We are still only in the initial stages, Mr. Speaker. This is virtually an interim stage during Which development still has to take place.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I cannot understand the attitude of the United Party. The Coloured people are now for the first time being enabled to take this most important step forward and the only reason why the United Party is opposing this Bill is because they know that the Coloured people throughout the whole of the Republic will eventually give their support to this new programme. The United Party know that the Coloureds will give their support to this programme; they are already doing so. I should like to know from the hon. the Minister or from anybody else whether any complaints worth mentioning have thus far been lodged by the Coloured community&#x003F;</p>

<p>Just let me finish my argument. The United Party issued a booklet entitled &#x201C;The Cape Coloured Vote&#x201D; and the persons who were responsible for drawing up this booklet were Sir De Villiers Graaff, Mr. Gray Hughes, Mr. Jackson, Mr. H. G. Lawrence and Mr. D. E. Mitchell. On page 58 of this booklet the United Party themselves say that they do not regard the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll as the solution to the whole problem, but in this House they try to suggest that the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll is the Alpha and the Omega in this whole problem to establish better relationships in South Africa. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It must be freely admitted that Common Roll representation is not a panacea for all ills, overcoming all grievances.</block>

<p>They go on to point out what transpired in Ceylon and they say that it did not prove to be the solution there.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#suzman">

<p>But they are members of the Western group.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>Just listen to that! That is not mentioned in this booklet. They refer to what Sir Herbert Stanley, who gave evidence before the Select Committee, had to say. He said that the committee had investigated the position and that a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll in Ceylon was not the solution to the problem. On page 68 of the committee&#x2019;s report they say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any event, however, your committee has stressed that it does not consider the Common Roll to be the panacea.</block>

<p>In his booklet, Sir De Villiers Graaff refers to Ceylon and Cyprus. The hon. member for Gardens does not know his policy. He says that the Coloureds are not mentioned at all in the race federation policy. This is what Sir De Villiers Graaff said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I can refer to Cyprus and Ceylon too but I am quite content if our policy is regarded as a unique solution to a unique problem in South Africa.</block>

<p>The hon. member for Bezuidenhout (Mr. J. D. du P. Basson) is to-day a member of the United Party. Three years ago his policy was still that of separate representation in this Parliament; he felt that the Coloureds should be represented by their own people in this Parliament. He is now a member of the United Party and I should like to know what his present attitude is in this regard. Is he still in favour of separate representation&#x003F; Three years ago, in 1961, the hon. member for Bezuidenhout supported a candidate in the Port Elizabeth (North) constituency and the policy which they advocated was one of separate representation on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll but they advocated that the Coloureds should be represented directly by their own people in this Parliament. The hon. member for Bezuidenhout is now a member of the United Party and I should very much like to know from him whether he has changed his attitude in this regard or not. I challenge him to stand up during this debate and tell us what his attitude is. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) can now ask his question.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) had a great deal to do with the drawing up of this legislation. He has told us that originally the Coloureds asked for a qualified vote but that they were then told that they could have an unqualified vote. I want to know whether the Coloured people also asked for the vote to be given to Coloured women&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#nel">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. F. NEL</person>:</from>

<p>This memorandum which was submitted to the Cabinet was the work of the Coloured council. The proposal <span class="col_4125-4126" refersTo="page_0755"/>which they submitted to the Cabinet was that all Coloured persons, men and women, should be given the vote, but that it should be a qualified vote. The Cabinet approved of the proposal that Coloured men and women over the age of 21 years should be given the vote throughout the Republic, but it did not approve of a qualified vote, and I can appreciate the reason for that. I do not know how the Cabinet argued but I take it that they argued in this way&#x2014;and this is how the Coloureds accepted it: The Cabinet did not want the Coloureds to be placed in a position different to that of the Bantu in the Transkei or different to that of the Whites in the Republic. I think that was possibly the attitude adopted by the Cabinet. The hon. the Minister will be able to tell us how they argued. But I can tell the House that the recommendation of the Cabinet to the effect that the Coloured vote should not be a qualified one was received with acclamation. The entire council cried out &#x201C;Hear, hear&#x201D;! when they were told that the vote would not be a qualified one. That specific clause was approved of. It was not even discussed again. It was simply put to them and they all agreed to it. I do not know what the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) wants. Does he want to revert to a qualified vote&#x003F; [Time limit.]</p>

<p>Very well. I could not believe that he was an adviser. I expected him to explain the provisions of the Bill and give us reasons for those provisions but instead of doing so all he did was to make a political speech, and a poor one besides. He quoted from a United Party publication and accused us of seeking a solution to the problem along certain lines. He also said that things in Cyprus had gone wrong. Does this mean that when a leader of a party makes a statement and uses as an example a country in which things have not worked out as they should have worked out, the policy of that party is completely wrong&#x003F; [Interjections.] I am very pleased because I have here a statement that was made by the late Dr. Malan when he was leader of the Nationalist Party. In that statement he said that there were only two countries which had the solution to the colour problem. The one was New Zealand where they had a separate voters&#x2019; roll and where the Maoris could be represented by their own people, and the other country was Kenya where, he said, there was stability and contentment amongst the various races. Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard such nonsense&#x003F;</p>

<p>Dr. Malan said it in this House in 1936. The hon. member for Vereeniging (Mr. B. Coetzee) should not talk so much.

<p>Mr. Speaker, to my mind this Bill is more important than the talking that is being done here. I come from the Western Province where we know the Coloureds intimately, not the Bantu.

<p>I had the privilege for many years as a member of the provincial council of representing a constituency in which there were a large number of Coloured voters. Mr. Speaker, let me say this: The Coloured community cannot be regarded as being one community. There are numbers of Coloureds who have as yet not reached the stage of development that has been reached by many of the Coloureds in the urban areas. Does the hon. the Minister still remember the Coloured people who helped me when the hon. the Minister stood against me&#x003F; The hon. the Minister and the Nationalist Party must not come along here and tell us that this Bill has been introduced out of affection for the Coloured people. There has never been a community in South Africa which has, so undeservedly, had to endure as many insults as the Coloured community has had to endure from the Nationalist Party. Let me mention a few examples. The hon. member for Prieska (Mr. Stander) was a member of the provincial council at that time and he will remember how Mr. Jan G. du Toit, who was at the time member of the provincial council for Calvinia, lodged an official objection on behalf of the Nationalist Party because a clerk in the provincial administration was asked by the Administrator to address Golding as Mr. Golding. They objected to the use of the term &#x201C;Mr.&#x201D; and they said that a White man should not so lower himself as to address a Coloured as &#x201C;Mr.&#x201D;.</p>

<p>Hon. members ought to be ashamed of themselves. Let me give another example. Where is the hon. member for Fort Beaufort (Dr. Jonker)&#x003F; Does he still remember the time when he had to write an article objecting to remarks made by a certain Mr. Brill who was a member of this Parliament at the time and who said at Gansbaai that the Coloureds should be put into camps guarded by machine guns and that all who tried to escape should be shot dead&#x003F; At <span class="col_4127-4128" refersTo="page_0756"/>that time the hon. member for Fort Beaufort was editor of the <i>Suiderstem</i> and he had to write an article protesting against this statement. That was the language used by the Nationalist Party. I am pleased to know that this is no longer the attitude of the Nationalist Party. I am pleased to know that. But hon. members opposite must not detract from the value of their conversion by trying to make us believe that this has always been their attitude. Can I believe that they are doing this out of affection for the Coloureds and out of a desire on their part to assist the Coloureds&#x003F; Have they not had a change of heart because of circumstances&#x003F; Are these concessions being made out of affection for the Coloureds or are hon. members opposite afraid for the future&#x003F; I want to deal briefly with another matter. We have heard the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) explain to us that the Chairman of the proposed Executive Committee for the Coloured people and an administrator fall into the same category and that that is why the chairman will be appointed. I accept that statement. But why are the administrators appointed&#x003F; They are appointed because they are the administrators of provinces, but I am quite sure that they have never been told: &#x201C;The sky is the limit.&#x201D; But these Coloured people have been told that there is no limit to the constitutional development that they can enjoy. The hon. the Minister has told them: &#x201C;The sky is the limit.&#x201D; I do not think that the sky will be the limit because we have already been told that one of the members of the Coloured Council asked the hon. the Minister to set up a portfolio of Foreign Affairs. The hon. the Minister will never permit that to happen. The sky will never become the limit in this regard. Or will it&#x003F; No one will tell me. The hon. the Minister knows very well that that is not so. Why then be dishonest with these people; why then say something that he does not mean&#x003F; Why make statements of that nature&#x003F; The hon. member for Malmesbury (Mr. van Staden) objected to the fact here this afternoon that we in the United Party say that the Coloured belongs with us. We are not ashamed to say it. Not very long ago the Nationalist Party said that the Coloured belonged with them. Does he still belong with them&#x003F; The hon. member has nothing to say. Because world conditions are what they are to-day, I am sorry to say that when South Africa is facing a crisis, then the Coloureds belong with us, but when everything is peaceful and everything is going well and the Nationalist Party want to exert their authority, then the Coloured no longer belongs with us. In 1960 the then Minister of the Interior, the present President of the Senate, Mr. Naud&#x00E9;, stated in this House (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I am pleased that the Coloureds conducted themselves so well during the disturbances at Sharpeville and Langa. This can only be an acknowledgment that they belong with us. We welcome them with us and we want to make proper provision for them.</block>

<p>At that time they belonged with hon. members opposite. The Minister was right. Listening to speeches made by hon. members of the Nationalist Party this afternoon one would swear that their only purpose was to establish good relationships between the Coloureds and the Whites, but what of the relationships between the Whites and the Coloureds&#x003F; What were these relationships in the past&#x003F; I want hon. members opposite to listen to what Minister Naud&#x00E9; had to say in this regard (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa has taken note of this good behaviour of the Coloureds and I personally feel convinced that this has made an important contribution towards the promotion of good race relationships.</block>

<p>In other words, the Minister said that the good behaviour of the Coloureds contributed towards establishing good race relationships between the White man and the Coloured. If those relationships were good, how could the Minister have made a statement of that nature&#x003F; We must not tell the Coloured people that they belong with us every time we need them and then when we no longer need them and feel safe, tell them: &#x201C;Go your way&#x201D;.</p>

<p>No, that is the truth. Concessions that are made out of fear are not concessions at all. They do more harm than good. These concessions are being made out of fear and not out of affection for the Coloureds. We who have been in politics since 1943 know all too well how the United Party were accused of being &#x201C;Kafferboeties&#x201D; and how the Coloureds were insulted and berated because they supported the United Party. But what was the reason for separate representation&#x003F; The hon. member for Malmesbury told us that the Nationalists were chained to principles. What principles&#x003F; Is one of those principles the principle upheld by Dr. Hertzog who said that the Coloureds belonged with that party&#x003F; They had the Coloured National Union. Coloureds attended their congresses and what happened then&#x003F; In the years 1943, 1944 and 1945 the Nationalist Party started a strong agitation to place the Coloureds on a separate roll. And what did they give as their reasons for doing so&#x003F; What reason did Dr Malan give at Paarl&#x003F; He said: &#x201C;If we put the Coloureds on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll, we may even win the Paarl seat.&#x201D; It was not done to save White South Africa but to win the Paarl seat!</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>I want to draw an analogy between this position and a similar position which we find recorded in a Book for which I have great respect. I think that we can all take this story to heart because I feel that it is analogous to the position as it exists to-day. When the Coloureds were placed on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll, what was the attitude of the Nationalist Party&#x003F; They said: &#x201C;You have the vote amongst us.&#x201D; Dr. Malan negotiated with the Coloureds and said that he would give them better representation and a larger vote, a vote which would mean more to them, but a separate vote. What did the Coloureds then say&#x003F; They said that they did not want it and the reason which they gave was that this vote had been the inheritance of their fathers over the years. Because the Nationalist Party said that Parliament was sovereign, they used their majority in Parliament as a steamroller to remove the Coloureds from the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. We warned them that they would find themselves in the critical position in which they are now and that they would lose the goodwill of these people. They have lost that goodwill. We can use an analogy from the Good Book. Hon. members will remember that the Bible tells us that King Ahab, the husband of Jezebel, coveted a certain vineyard but the owner of that vineyard, Naboth, stood between Ahab and the vineyard. The Nationalist Party were in the same position. They said: &#x201C;We want this vineyard; we shall give the owner a separate vineyard.&#x201D; So the owner was given his separate vineyard. They gave him a separate vineyard but first they said: &#x201C;We will give you a larger vineyard, but it will be a separate vineyard.&#x201D; What was the answer&#x003F; &#x201C;We do not want a larger vineyard because this vineyard is the inheritance of our fathers.&#x201D; The Coloureds said the same thing to the Nationalist as Naboth said to King Ahab. What happened then&#x003F; King Ahad returned to his wife Jezebel who told him: &#x201C;But are you not King of all Judea&#x003F; Are you not sovereign&#x003F;&#x201D;&#x2014;like the Nationalist Party in this Parliament! The Prophet Elija told Ahab&#x2014;and this is what the United Party tells the Nationalist Party to-day&#x2014;&#x201C;You are misusing your powers. The dogs will lick your blood in the streets.&#x201D; And turning to Jezebel he said: &#x201C;You, Jezebel, will find no resting place on earth.&#x201D; Elija was right; the dogs did lick the blood of King Ahab. I say that if we do not conduct ourselves properly and pass legislation in order to get the Coloureds on our side, it may well be that, our blood will be licked up in the streets of Cape Town! We need the support of all the Coloureds. No matter what the Nationalist Party may say, Mr. Speaker, they do not have the support of the Coloureds to-day. The Coloureds do not support them and do not trust them. Let us look at the result of the election in the Karoo constituency. What happened there&#x003F; Two thousand two hundred postal votes were issued. It was stated in the <i>Burger,</i> and Mr. Scholtz and Mr. Eden both agreed, that Mr. Scholtz was far in the lead and that Mr. Eden had only won 600 of those votes. All the rest were votes for Mr. Scholtz. But we do not know how they voted. What was the result&#x003F; Mr. Eden had a majority of 390. In other words, of the 1,700 votes that Mr. Scholtz received, he received, according to his own estimate, less than 300 of those votes at the polling booths. Does this indicate the confidence of the Coloureds in the Nationalist Party&#x003F; I do not want to discuss the question of postal votes; hon. members opposite will be sorry if I say what I want to say. In any case, I say again that the Coloureds have no confidence in the Nationalist Party. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) can go on telling the Coloureds how Mr. Long apparently told the Coloureds that the United Party were exploiting them. The Coloureds know us and we know them.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. L. BASSON</person>:</from>

<p>The provisions of this Bill form part of the general pattern that the Nationalist Party is trying to establish; one more thread is being added to the spider-web in which they are already so enmeshed that they can never escape from it. The Government is creating chaos by passing legislation under which future generations will suffer for many years. What is happening here has become quite clear to me since listening to the hon. member for Malmesbury. In this case it is not a question of what is in the interests of South Africa. There is not one member here who can tell me that the Coloureds were placed on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll because they constituted a danger to White South Africa. They were placed on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll because they constituted a danger to the Nationalist Party. What do we find to-day&#x003F; The hon. member for Malmesbury made the position quite clear to us and the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) agreed indirectly with everything he had said. The hon. member for Malmesbury made a very interesting speech. He tried to prove that the United Party were in difficulty because we are now apparently following a policy of &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D; and he wanted to know what the United Party was going to do about the Coloured woman who still did not have the vote. He was so pleased because they had <span class="col_4131-4132" refersTo="page_0758"/>discovered something which they thought would place the United Party in a difficult position; in other words, he wanted to know what the United Party was going to do in order to place the Coloured on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll again. But what has now become apparent&#x003F; The fact remains that this clause was not asked for by the Coloureds. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) told us so. This was a trick played on the Coloureds. They were told that the principle of one man, one vote would now be forced down their throats. Anyone would compliment the Coloured Council on having the sense and the responsibility not to ask for a policy of one man, one vote. They advanced good reasons for not having done so. They said that the Coloured people were as yet not all capable of accepting that great responsibility. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) and the hon. the Minister have nothing to laugh about. Apparently the hon. member did his work badly. He said that the Coloureds did not want to give the vote to the 18-year-olds. It seems to me as though the hon. the Minister also wants to force this down their throats. What is the trickery behind this&#x003F; It is that the Government hopes by means of this legislation to place the United Party in an invidious position. This Bill is being introduced not for the sake of the people of South Africa or of the Coloured community but simply with the idea of promoting the interests of the Nationalist Party; to frighten the people of South Africa with phantoms conjured up by the Nationalist Party and to force these down the throats of the Coloured community in order to see what will happen.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, we cannot go on in this way. A Government cannot continue to act so irresponsibly! Sooner or later this sort of thing is going to catch up with us. I know that I cannot use the word &#x201C;mean&#x201D; (gemeen) but did you notice, Mr. Speaker, the tactics used by the hon. member for Malmesbury&#x003F; He contended that the United Party were opposed to separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls and to separate development simply because we wanted the Coloured trade. May I say, Mr. Speaker, that this is a shameful accusation&#x003F; Is the accusation made by the hon. member not really a shameful one&#x003F; Does he not want to trade with the Coloured&#x003F; If it is the policy of the Nationalist Party to have two economies in the country, then I want to challenge the hon. the Minister to introduce legislation to provide that no Coloured may henceforward buy anything from a White man. It will be very easy to introduce legislation of this nature. Or is the hon. the Minister going to stand by and allow the hon. member for Malmesbury to incite the Coloureds against the White man by making statements of this nature&#x003F; Is that what the Nationalist Party want&#x003F; Are those the tactics that they are following&#x003F; It is the easiest thing in the world for the hon. the Minister to stand up and say that he is going to be consistent in regard to his policy of two separate parallel developments and is therefore going to introduce legislation to prevent Coloureds making purchases from White shopkeepers, and <i>vice versa.</i> He can do this easily, but will he do it&#x003F; No, he will not do it, and the hon. member for Malmesbury will not suggest that he do anything of this nature either.</p>

<p>This colour question has been exploited in South African politics for years. We did not drag it into the political arena. On the contrary. We asked that it should be removed from the political arena. On each occasion that the Nationalist Party has dragged this matter into politics, reckless politicians in the Nationalist Party have exploited this question in order to win elections. But at the same time, South Africa has lost something. The hon. the Minister of Justice objected to the fact that my hon. colleague, the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) said that the Nationalist Party will not initially be destroyed by the electorate. But I want to state as my honest opinion that if we continue on this road on which we are at present long enough, it will not be something that destroys the Nationalist Party; the Nationalist Party will destroy itself! And that stage does not lie in the distant future either. As long as we continue to promote the interests of each section as a group and not as a part of the whole, we will be doing something which will mean the end not of the Coloured or of the Bantu but of the White man himself.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to discuss this legislation in the same lighthearted way in which the hon. member for Sea Point discussed it. What I have mentioned here is sufficient to show that no one will expect me to deal with his arguments.</p>

<p>This legislation is in conformity with the policy of the National Party as declared and published in an election manifesto issued before the 1948 election. In this manifesto we read the following under the heading &#x201C;A Representative Council&#x201D; (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A Coloured representative council must be established with Coloured members elected on a basis of constituencies. The head of the Department of Coloured Affairs and other persons will be nominated by the Government to serve on the council.</block>

<p>In other words, it was to be a council, some of the members of which would be elected on a constituency basis and others appointed by the Government. The National Party fought an election on this policy in 1948 and in accordance with this principle the hon. the Prime Minister made a statement in December 1960 a statement to which this Bill gives effect. In that statement the hon. the Prime Minister said this (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It is the aim of all of us who seek a bright future for South Africa to give every man his due rights. The question is how to do so without adversely affecting the rights of others.</block>

<p>We have a situation to-day in which the Coloured has limited political rights. He can elect four representatives to represent him in this House and two in the provincial council. We also have the situation, according to the evidence given before the Select Committee on the Separate Representation of Voters Bill in 1951, that the Coloureds have continually demanded that the franchise be extended to the northern provinces and that the vote should also be given to Coloured women. The question is: If we want to give the Coloured man and woman an unqualified vote, as is the case of the Bantu in the Transkei, if we want to extend the Coloured vote to the Coloureds in the northern provinces and if our aim is to give every man his rights without adversely affecting the rights of others, on what basis must we do so&#x003F; We have these two bases: The one is the basis on which the policy of the National Party is founded, that of parallel development in terms of which we do not want to allow any increase in the political rights of the Coloured as far as this Parliament is concerned. They will retain the right which they have&#x2014;the Indians have the same right&#x2014;to vote for the Coloured Representatives. But on the other hand, the National Party is prepared, without imposing electoral qualifications, to give equal political rights, equal in all respects, to all Coloureds throughout the country including Coloured women, in a Coloured representative council. In contrast to this policy of the National Party we have another policy, the policy of the United Party, which is to have a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and a mixed political society.</p>

<p>In discussing the policy of the United Party, I just want to mention that over the past ten years during which the Coloureds have been on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll under the new setup, the United Party has changed its policy on no fewer than three occasions as far as the Coloureds are concerned. I want to mention these three changes of attitude for a specific reason. In the first place there was their attitude just after the Coloureds had been placed on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll. This phase could be called: &#x201C;The phase of lack of policy on the part of the United Party.&#x201D; The United Party did not want to tell us then whether they wanted to restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll; Dr. Friedman resigned from the party to register his protest and the <i>Natal Mercury</i> of 20 November 1952 attacked the United Party in the following damning words&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The man in the street regards the political crisis in the Union almost entirely as a moral one. Yet, what do we find&#x003F; In two fundamental aspects of its non-European policy the United Party is being&#x2014;and let us face the fact&#x2014;politically dishonest.</block>

<p>Here we have the first instalment of the policy of the United Party in regard to this matter. Then subsequently, in 1958, the policy of the United Party assumed another shade; it now formed part and parcel of a policy known as the &#x201C;Key to Constitutional Safety&#x201D;. In terms of this policy the Coloureds in Natal and in the Cape Province could be restored to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll on the strict understanding that they had to be represented in Parliament not by Coloureds but by Whites, and higher electoral qualifications were laid down for new voters. Mr. Speaker, there was the first stage therefore when they did not want to restore the Coloureds to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and then there was the second stage, the 1958 policy, in terms of which the Coloureds could be restored to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll but had to vote for <span class="col_4135-4136" refersTo="page_0760"/>Whites. Then we had a further policy statement in May 1962 by Sir de Villiers Graaff at De Aar in which he explained the race federation plan of the United Party and stated, <i>inter alia</i> (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An example of the community federation as envisaged in the plan of the United Party was recently set up in Cyprus.</block>

<p>The Coloureds therefore also got something out of the Cyprus policy! The United Party said: &#x201C;Not only will we restore the Coloureds to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, but in the Cape and in Natal they will be able to vote for their own people in Parliament.&#x201D; But they went on to say&#x2014;and this is interesting&#x2014;that the Coloureds in the Free State and the Transvaal would be placed on separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls to elect members of the Senate. It is clear from this in which direction the United Party was heading. In 1954 the United Party were opposed to Common Voters&#x2019; Rolls, or else they were too cowardly to admit that they were in favour of Common Voters&#x2019; Rolls. Four years later, in 1958, they were in favour of Common Voters&#x2019; Rolls but opposed to Coloureds here in Parliament. Four years later still, in 1962, they said: &#x201C;Now we are also in favour of Coloureds in Parliament.&#x201D; Sir, I predict that in another four years, in 1966, when we again have a parliamentary election, the United Party will come forward with another instalment of this integration policy and in all probability they will say: &#x201C;We will now also establish Common Voters&#x2019; Rolls for Coloureds in the northern provinces.&#x201D; I do not know how the United Party can regard separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls for the Coloureds as immoral in the Cape and Natal and yet find moral justification for them in the Transvaal and the Free State. The election of 1966 will probably mean the end of the United Party. But when the United Party dies its off-shoots will come to the fore. The liberal elements which the United Party harbours in its bosom to-day will devour it from within just as the young of a puffadder devours it from within, and they will then announce the last instalment of the United Party policy: No discrimination; Common Voters&#x2019; Rolls with an unqualified vote for all Coloured men and women. Indeed, this will be the logical result of United Party policy. This is the road on which they have set foot and the road which they have been following systematically for the past ten years. If this becomes a political reality in South Africa, it will be the beginning of the end of the authority of the White man in this country, an authority on which the survival and the future salvation and welfare of the Coloured depends just as much as that of the White man.</p>

<p>Let us analyse for a moment the present Colour policy of the United Party. The United Party like to create the impression that if there is one matter on which they have a policy which has been worked out to make provision for future development and to provide for every eventuality, it is their Colour policy; they are fond of pointing an accusing finger at the National Party and saying: &#x201C;You have your Bantu policy which makes provision for future development, but you have no policy for the Coloureds; you have not worked out a policy in their case to provide for future developments whereas we have.&#x201D; Let us discuss this policy of the United Party for a moment.</p>

<p>What is the first conclusion that we must draw from this latest policy statement made by Sir de Villiers Graaff in 1962&#x003F; The first conclusion is that the United Party is prepared, as far as political rights are concerned, to do more for the Bantu than for the Coloured. Notwithstanding the fact that the Coloured has a far higher standard of living than the Bantu and that he has been far closer and will continue to be far closer to the White man politically than the Bantu, in terms of their race federation policy the United Party give all the Bantu in the Republic an equal vote as far as the election of their representatives in this House is concerned, whereas only the Coloureds in the Cape and Natal are given the vote to elect people to represent them in this House. You must remember. Sir, that the Bantu had only three representatives in this House and they could only be elected by the Bantu in the Cape. But in terms of their Cyprus policy the United Party are prepared in the future to guarantee the Bantu a minimum of eight representatives in this House, plus six in the Senate, whereas, as far as the Coloureds are concerned, all that will be done for them is that those who had the vote in the Cape and Natal prior to 1951 will be restored to the Voters&#x2019; Roll and those who qualified for the vote after 1951 will have stricter electoral qualifications imposed upon them to disqualify them as voters for members of this House.</p>

<p>I want to issue this challenge to the United Party to-day. They say that they have a Colour policy. I challenge them to answer these frank questions in connection with their policy. The first question is this: Will the vote of these Coloured voters whom they want to place on separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls in the northern provinces be subject to electoral qualifications and, if so, what are those qualifications going to be&#x003F; I would like the United Party to give us a straightforward answer to this question in the course of this debate. Secondly, how many members will these Coloured voters in the northern provinces be able to elect to the Senate&#x003F; Can those Senators be Coloured people&#x003F; Are the United Party going to keep the Coloureds in the northern provinces on separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls permanently and thus prevent them from ever electing members to this House&#x003F; My next question is this: Will the Coloureds in the Cape and Natal who were on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll prior to 1951 henceforward have to comply with higher electoral qualifications in order to enable them to be restored to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll&#x003F; Are the United Party going to maintain the <span class="col_4137-4138" refersTo="page_0761"/>present qualifications for Coloureds at their present level indefinitely&#x003F; Are the United Party never going to give Coloured women and the Coloured 18-year-olds the vote and if they are going to give them the vote, will it be on separate Voters&#x2019; Rolls or on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll&#x003F; And once they have placed the Coloureds on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, are the United Party going to allow them to become members of their party within the same branch as the Whites&#x003F; These are fundamental questions. They are simply, straightforward questions. If one is honest in one&#x2019;s desire to give political rights to all the Coloureds in South Africa without discrimination, one ought to be able to answer these questions. If the United Party cannot answer these questions frankly, they must not accuse the National Party of not having worked out the details of their policy to cover future developments. The United Party have changed their attitude in regard to their Colour policy three times over a period of ten years and the position to-day is just as unclear as it ever was. All that we know is that, in terms of the policy of the United Party, any developments in regard to the Coloured vote will take place according to the pattern of political integration. The policy of the National Party is that any development or adjustment which may take place in the future as far as the franchise is concerned&#x2014;for example, giving the vote to 18-year-olds or substituting elected members for nominated members&#x2014; will take place on the basis of the policy of separate development.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the choice with which we are faced at this stage is perfectly clear. The Government has bound itself irrevocably to the political development of the Coloured on the basis of parallel political rights&#x2014;two streams which can never flow into one another&#x2014;whereas the Opposition on the other hand, have set their foot on the road of political integration with all the unpleasant consequences that will flow from it. Why do we prefer the policy of the National Party, the policy of this party, in connection with the development of the Coloured, and why do we reject the United Party&#x2019;s policy of a mixed political society&#x003F; We do so, firstly, because the old system that we had, was a hopeless failure. I need only refer to what hon. members have said here about B. K. Long, a leading member of the United Party and editor of a leading English-medium newspaper. But I can go further and mention the infamous &#x201C;sjambok&#x201D; pamphlet which the United Party issued at the time. During an election campaign the United Party published a pamphlet bearing the picture of a Coloured man bent over and bound with chains and with a naked torso, about to be struck by a White man with a sjambok while in the other corner of the picture there was a school on which the words &#x201C;Whites Only&#x201D; were printed. That pamphlet stated: &#x201C;This means slave labour. For you it will mean that you will not be allowed to own your own home or land. You will have to live in Kaffir camps that have been specially selected for this purpose. This means that your children will receive no education. This means that there is no hope for you for the future.&#x201D; That was the sort of propaganda that the United Party used against the National Party at the time. Sir, I do not want to discuss this matter any further. I just want to say that it is unfair once again to let loose this flood of improper, questionable political propaganda upon the Coloureds. On the other hand, the Afrikaner Nationalist profoundly dislikes and loathes the election methods which have been used against him in the past, with the Coloured vote as a passive instrument. To revert, therefore, to those old tactics will be tantamount to committing a crime against the Coloureds as well as the Whites. We reject the United Party&#x2019;s policy of a mixed political society because it proved a failure. It proved to be of no value for the Coloureds. It gave him nothing. It got him nowhere in politics. Although for more than 40 years the Coloured had the right to elect his own people to the Cape Provincial Council, during that period only two Coloureds were elected as members of that provincial council. Since 1940 the number of Coloured voters in the Cape Province has grown to about 50,000, but since 1940 no Coloured has had the honour of taking his seat as a member of the Provincial Council of the Cape, and the same thing has happened in other spheres. Take the city councils. There are hundreds of city councils and thousands of city councillors in the Cape but only about 12 Coloureds have ever seen the inside of a city council chamber, and the position has been far worse in regard to divisional councils. Although there are far more Coloured children at school in the Cape than White children, only about half a dozen Coloureds have ever been members of a school board. It was for this reason that B. K. Long said (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In any case, I have grave misgivings as to whether the vote on the same roll as the White man was not really a curse to the Coloureds. It gave them a semblance of power which was never definitely but a sham.</block>

<p>That is why we say very definitely that the political integration of the Coloureds with the Whites brought the Coloured nowhere in politics. He was only recognized at elections, and that was the case ever since 1910. I have managed to dig up an old pamphlet dating back to the years when the Coloureds still voted for the Unionist Party and in this pamphlet I find the following&#x2014;</p>

<p>Our point is that in the past we Coloureds have slavishly supported the Unionists who made all sorts of extravagant promises which they never fulfilled, and it is high time that we should realize the truth of the proverb, &#x201C;Once bitten, twice shy&#x201D;.</p>

<p><span class="col_4139-4140" refersTo="page_0762"/>The position continued in this way for 40 years until the National Party Government put an end to it, and then the words of B. K. Long were borne out. A tremendous fuss was made about it at first. (But what he had said further was also borne out: He said: &#x201C;Apart from the shock to their dignity the Coloureds will gain far more than they lose when the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll is abolished and something more honest&#x2014;even though at first glance it may seem less impressive&#x2014;is put in its place.&#x201D; That is what the Coloureds are realizing more and more to-day&#x2014;that the old system of the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll and a mixed political society was an abject failure; that it was completely worthless to them. I would like to quote what the Coloureds themselves think of the political situation as it was. I want to quote, firstly, what C. I. R. Fortein said according to the <i>Banner</i> of 9 September 1963&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured leaders have learnt through bitter experience in the past that the United Party, and for that matter any White political party, is only out to use the Coloured people as their political football.</block>

<p>It was not B. K. Long but a leader of the Coloured people who said this. I also want to quote what S. Dollie said according to the <i>Banner</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This Common Voters&#x2019; Roll business went on from 1910 to 1953, when the Separate Representation of Voters&#x2019; Act freed the Coloured man of this menace. He was freed of a menace because under the Common Roll system his vote was &#x201C;sold&#x201D; to a political party which gave nothing in return. Every five years at election time he was remembered.</block>

<p>Mr. T. R. Swartz, Chairman of the Coloured Advisory Council, had the following to say, according to the <i>Banner</i> of April 1962&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of the partial integration of the Coloured people which has been followed in this country for many years has failed to bring the Coloured people any substantial benefits. It does not matter where you examine it&#x2014;in the political field or on the civic level. The Coloured people were mostly treated as poor relations who were always kept in the background.</block>

<p>And according to a Sapa report in the <i>Argus</i> Mr. Swartz also had this to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Common Roll representation resulted in the neglect and the bluff of the Coloured people.</block>

<p>That is what the Coloureds themselves think of the old system. It is also true that political equality between the Whites and the Coloureds greatly hampered the progress of the Coloured population, firstly, because they were neglected in the socio-economic sphere and, secondly, because they were deprived of their leaders, the people who could encourage them to be uplifted. The better class of Coloured deserted their people and left them to their fate. That is why we believe that the policy of parallel development, in the political sphere as well, will not only keep the Coloured vote out of the political struggle of the Whites, will not only eliminate the malpractices that were rife under the old system, but will also result in establishing and maintaining better relationships between the Coloureds and all sections of the Whites. What is more, it will enable the Coloured to exercise his political rights more in his own interests and in the interests of his own national group. As the hon. the Minister of Finance put it at the time when the 1951 Act was introduced, &#x201C;it puts the Coloured vote outside the danger zone so that the White man can more readily devote himself to the upliftment of the Coloureds&#x201D;.</p>

<p>This brings me once again to the ideal visualized by the hon. the Prime Minister, which makes it possible for everyone who is striving for a bright future for South Africa to give every man his due rights in every sphere, including the political sphere, without adversely affecting the rights of anybody else. Because we are at the cross-roads to-day; we have to choose between the two streams that can never meet&#x2014;in the policy of parallel development, and, on the other hand, the United Party&#x2019;s policy of a mixed political society. In conclusion I can sum up the situation no better and give the Coloured people no better advice than to quote what was said by one of their own leaders, Mr. Fortein, according to the <i>Banner</i> of February 1964&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Here then will be the closing of an old chapter and the opening of a new chapter in the history of our people. The Coloured people will come to realize that in their own interest they must live side by side with the Whites, but as an Afrikaner leader once said, &#x201C;refuse to get under the same blanket&#x201D;. They must from now onwards make up their own socio-economic bed and sleep under their own political blanket.</block>

<speech by="#timoney">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TIMONEY</person>:</from>

<p>Listening to the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;), I do not think he referred to the Bill once during his whole speech. He lived up to his reputation of a party organizer selling his party&#x2019;s policy. I think most of us in the House were convinced towards the end of his speech that he believed in the policy of his party. I think it is common cause that the Nationalist Party policy, way back in 1948, was to remove the Coloureds from the Common Roll. The history of the process of the removal of these people from the Common Roll is really a black history, of which this country cannot be proud. It has probably done us more harm than good overseas, and since that happened we have been trying to live down this background of removing these people from this House and from the Common Roll.</p>

<p><span class="col_4141-4142" refersTo="page_0763"/>The hon. member for Parow referred to what has been done for the Bantu in the Transkei, where they have one man, one vote, and to what they were going to do here for the Coloureds, but he stopped there. He did not tell us that this proposed council was very different from what exists in the Transkei. He was very frightened of United Party policy. I should like to tell him that from 1854 the Coloured man was on the Common Roll until this Government removed him. I do not know what he has to be frightened about. He should not be so worried about what the United Party is going to do. I should like to tell him that the United Party accepts one fact which the Government refuses to accept, and that is that this is a multiracial country and that the laws that we make for the people of this country have to take care of that. The policy of the Nationalists, their so-called two-stream or four-stream policy, or total apartheid for all the groups&#x2014;I will not call it separate development&#x2014;which they propose to implement will bring this country to a state where I do not know what will happen.</p>

<p>I listened to the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel). I understand he is one of the authors of this Bill, although he denied it. But it is peculiar that he only just touched on the Bill and then set up a smokescreen to protect the Minister against attack from this side of the House. He said in his final remarks that this was a great step forward, but I can only tell him that this Bill is a great step backwards, making the Coloureds completely blindfolded and dumb. That is the effect of this Bill. The Minister has introduced this Bill, but he has no real mandate to bring this Bill to the House. When you introduce a measure which affects a certain class of person in the country, one would think that there would have been some form of consultation. We have heard about the Coloured Advisory Council, but I want to talk about the consultation that took place recently. There was consultation between the Coloureds and the Government. The Government had a sponsored candidate there, in the recent Karoo by-election, where the Government was defeated. One wonders what the Minister would have said if that candidate had been returned to this House. He would have acclaimed it as a mandate from the Coloured people to introduce this legislation. But he has no mandate. He comes here without a mandate and without having had any consultation. But we are used to the Government coming forward with measures without any mandate from the people for whom they pass legislation. There is absolutely no mandate from the Coloureds to come forward with a Bill like this. This Bill is just a continuation of the long drawn-out battle to deprive the Coloureds of their rights. It is a deprivation of their rights, to push them back further and further. They will have no real say in their destiny in future in this council. It is nothing, really.</p>

<p>In setting up this council where they propose giving one man, one vote, one wonders why, in view of the fact that the Coloured man in the past has always had more rights than the Bantu, the Government did not have the courage of its convictions and introduce a Bill similar to the Transkei Bill, and allow them to set up their own Parliament with their own Chief Minister and the various departments. Why introduce a Bill of this nature which gives them absolutely nothing&#x003F; This Bill conveys no powers at all on this council. They cannot initiate legislation or criticize the actions of the Government. One wonders what they will really do. They will have their sittings in public. One wonders what the Minister had in mind with this Bill.

<p>No, the Minister said that his thoughts were still crystallizing and that when he comes to a decision he will tell them what they can do. Why are the Coloureds being treated secondary to the Bantu&#x003F; Why cannot they have their own national anthem and a flag&#x003F; [Interjection.] The Bantu do not have to swear an oath of allegiance to this country. We know what the background of this Bill is. The party opposite have had the fear all the way through that they would lose power through the Common Roll vote. The Minister tells us that he aims at the socioeconomic uplift of the Coloured, but in 1948 that Minister was the secretary of a party and he lodged objections against Coloured voters and went out of his way to remove them from the Common Roll, and he was doing his best to deprive these people of their rights. Then later on, after the present hon. member for Sea Point was returned to the Provincial Council for Vasco, it was quite apparent that the Government got a shock as a result of the provincial council elections of 1949. A deputation came to see the then Minister of the Interior to get the Coloureds off the Common Roll, and then we had the unsavoury battle which lasted for years to get the Coloureds off the Common Roll, and finally a measure of which this Government should be ashamed was passed in terms of which the Coloured voters were put in an inferior position to that of other voters in this country. Sir, when one looks at the measures passed by the Government <span class="col_4143-4144" refersTo="page_0764"/>in regard to the Coloureds one would think that they were foreigners in this country. I would like to remind this House that the Coloureds have no other country to which they can go. They are part and parcel of this country of ours. They have fought for the right to live here as South Africans; they went overseas and fought in World War I and they fought in World War II. They have fought for their stake in this country, and it is tragic to think that we have come to the stage where the Coloureds have to accept a measure such as this which gives them second-class freedom and which permits them ho say in their own future. That is what this Bill means.</p>

Imagine a member of the United Party of the Cape, and not only of the Cape but of the Peninsula, and of an area where traditionally so many Coloured people have always lived and still are, making such a speech in this House! One is simply astounded; one can hardly believe it. The fact that the hon. member resumed his seat so suddenly was undoubtedly the highlight of his speech.</p>

<p>Sir, if we wish to deal with this piece of legislation in the manner in which it deserves to be dealt with, we have the difficult task of going to the root of the relationship between the two sections of the Western civilization community in South Africa, the numerically and otherwise dominant section, the Whites, on the one hand, and the Coloureds on the other hand, who also constitute a part of the Western civilization community in South Africa. It is an extremely serious and <span class="col_4145-4146" refersTo="page_0765"/>difficult question, and it is nothing less than a tragedy that this legislation has been chosen by the United Party in this debate as an opportunity for petty politicking. For instance, the hon. member who resumed his seat so suddenly asked whether there had been consultation with the Coloured community as such. Is not the basis upon which the parliamentary institutions of the Union of South Africa existed, and upon which these of the Republic exist, that this White community, as the politically dominant community, accepts the responsibility as guardian to make laws for the Indian community, the Bantu community and the Coloured community, in which we have to bring to bear our own consciences&#x003F; The principle of consultation with these non-White communities has never yet been a constitutional feature of our legislative process. Now the hon. member asks: Where was the consultation and where was the mandate of the Coloureds&#x003F; and then he comes along with the ludicrous story about the election in the Karoo. The hon. member refers to the Transkei legislation and he seeks to make the cheap politcial point: Why are the Coloureds not dealt with on a basis parallel with that for dealing with the Bantu&#x003F; Mr. Speaker, in any case we are surely not children, but we should certainly not behave in a childish fashion when dealing with this delicate matter of White/Coloured relations. Surely we know there is no parallel between the Coloureds, who are a part of the Western civilization community, who have always lived among us and will continue to live among us, and the Bantu nations who formerly lived apart from us, then intruded among us and now are once again to an increasing extent being placed in their separate residential areas.</p>

<p>The first crucial point in connection with this matter to which we have to find a reply is this: What form of political representation can be given to a section of the community which is subject to certain legal differentiations&#x003F; Everybody in South Africa, except the Liberalists, I think even the Progressives, will still say to-day that they believe in certain legal differentiations between Whites and Coloureds. As the United Party says, for instance: We believe in residential separation; we believe in separate schools. They probably also believe in separate army units, although one never knows to what extent they still believe in separate institutions, but even the United Party still believes in a few separate institutions. Our problem is this: What are you to do about political representation for a group which is subject to certain legal differentiations&#x003F; The first submission I wish to make is that history has shown in our country and elsewhere that one cannot confer homogeneous political rights upon a community and then again introduce differentiation in their political rights. You cannot, as was done in South Africa for almost a century from 1854, give the Coloured people practically the same political representation as that of the White man and say, &#x201C;Notwithstanding this political similarity with the White man, there still are certain distinctions. In spite of your political sameness, you may not enter the same Public Service; you may not live in the same residential area; your children may not attend the same high and primary schools.&#x201D; If you treat them as a homogeneously similar section of your body politic you cannot make the other distinctions. The United Party indeed wish to restore the Coloureds to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, and make them part of the homogeneous body politic and then maintain differentiations in that body. That is the whole point. It is logically impossible, and historically it has proved to be unsuccessful.</p>

<p>I should like to mention three examples. In the first place that of South Africa. The attempt of South Africa to give the Coloureds the same political rights as those enjoyed by the Whites, and in other respects to draw legal distinctions against them, led to three conflicting forces. The one force was that which sought to give the Coloureds increasing general civic rights, in other words, the urge to equality. There was that group which felt that the Coloureds and their voting power should be utilized to bring about complete equality for the Coloureds. There was another group which felt that the Coloured vote would lead to equality, and because they were unable to accept equality they did not want to accept the Coloured franchise itself. Between these two standpoints of support or repudiation on the Coloured vote, the Coloured man as the third force continued to hover between heaven and earth and that franchise which was valueless to him.</p>

<p>It is not only our own history, Mr. Speaker. Let us look at this history of the United States of America over the past centuries since their Civil War. At that time the slaves and their descendants received the franchise in principle and federally but the American States proceeded to make laws limiting the legal rights of those Negroes in the U.S.A. Thus, for instance, we had legislation prohibiting mixed marriages, legislation against admission to the public service of the States, the militia and a hundred and one other discriminations or differentiations, call them what you wish. What has happened in America&#x003F; In the long run you cannot maintain a position where a man, in this instance the Negro, has the vote, enjoys civil rights, and yet distinctions are drawn against him. From the nature of the situation there, the solution sought by America is the converse to that sought by us. They say the other distinctions existing against the Negroes have to be done away with. Logically they are perfectly correct. They wish to take the equal rights granted to them by law to the ultimate conclusion. In other words, they say that if a man has the vote, he should also be entitled to live where he wishes; he must be eligible to become a member of the army, of the Public Service, etc.; his children should be able to <span class="col_4147-4148" refersTo="page_0766"/>attend the same schools as those attended by the children of the Whites, etc. America accepts, as the fruit of history, that it is logically impossible to maintain a distinction in respect of a community in which homogeneous political rights exist.</p>

<p>The final example I wish to quote to hon. members is the matter which at the present time is receiving international attention, namely the situation on the island of Cyprus. On this island, also, equal civil rights have been granted to the Greek community on the one hand and the Turkish community on the other. However, as against this, certain separate rights have been created for each of these communities. In other words, the position they wish to maintain there is similar to that which the United Party hopes to maintain here in South Africa, namely that you can have a Coloured person and a White man together on the same Voters&#x2019; Roll, but in other respects the White man may do A, B and C, whereas the Coloureds again may do D, E and F. We know of course that this hope, in the case of the island of Cyprus, has led to speedy explosion and failure. And with reference to this, I should like to say&#x2014;and I hope that every man in the United Party who is honest with himself will admit this&#x2014;that history has shown that it is logically impossible to grant uniform political rights to a community, but at the same time to differentiate between the constituent sections of that community in other respects. It simply cannot be done. In such a case political rights are granted merely as a cloak to disguise other forms of discrimination within the community. If hon. members argue that it is logically defensible for the Coloureds to be on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, and that at the same time certain distinctions may be made, it may as well be argued that the fair-haired people on our Voters&#x2019; Roll, for instance, may not join the public service or become officers of the defence force, etc., while the dark-haired people again may not do something else. Then you will find that those people who have the vote and feel that there is discrimination against them will use their votes for nothing else but for the purpose of setting afoot a process of equalization throughout the whole community, that is to say, in respects other than the political sphere.</p>

<p>Thus we come to the first premise of this legislation. The National Party accepts as a fact that placing the Coloureds on the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll offers no solution unless we wish to accept the further concessions, namely that the Coloureds in all other respects should be placed on a footing of equality with the White man in South Africa. Because the National Party does not accept this last consequence, we cannot accept the first solution either. [Interjections.] Ask the hon. member for Maitland why we cannot agree to the Coloureds being placed on an equal footing with the White man in South Africa in all respects.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, this hon. member first asked me why we are unwilling to give the Coloureds equality with the White man in all respects. By doing so he intimated by implication that he and his party wish to do so.</p>

<p>Then the hon. member should not make such interjections. I have stated a simple proposition. We regard it as a social impossibility to accept the Coloureds and the Whites as absolute equals in one community. That is why we reject as a possible political solution a state of affairs where the Coloureds share political rights with the Whites. That then is our point of view. As against that we say that the granting of political rights, as urged by the United Party, does not offer a solution. Therefore we have to seek another solution. It is very difficult because we are unable to find examples of solutions of this nature in the history of the world.</p>

<p>As regards our own solution, we accept it as a permanent feature of our political system that the Coloureds will enjoy representation in the Central Parliament. But that is not the subject of debate to-day. However, passing reference has been made to that. In any event, I think we can rightly say that the four representatives of the Coloureds we have here to-day in this House give the Coloureds more effective representation than they have had during the preceding century. As far as I am concerned, even though the voice of the hon. member for Boland may not perhaps sound so elegant to me, I nevertheless feel that it is the authentic voice of the Coloured community, for the Coloureds have elected the hon. member and as such one can listen to him because one assumes that he represents and expresses the views of the Coloureds. That, therefore, is the first thing we feel the Coloured community should have namely representation in this House.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Speaker; there has never been any doubt about that.

<p>The Prime Minister has repeatedly stated this as the point of view of the National Party. Now, we have been told by the other side of the House, and we ourselves have noticed, that this measure of representation <span class="col_4149-4150" refersTo="page_0767"/>for the Coloureds is not quite adequate. There must be something more. In recent times the Coloured community has increased tremendously numerically. Apart from that they have, under the policy of this party, advanced tremendously as regards their cultural development, their standard of education and their economic development. Therefore they must get something more. Now we are offering this something more by establishing a representative council for them, which will from time to time be able to promote their specific interests in respect of a specified number of aspects under delegated powers. The least an honest critic can say about this is that this contains the germ of a solution. It may be considered that this progress is not sufficient as yet, that for instance, there should not be 16 nominated representatives, but none. But this at least is a step forward. As far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that we are hereby taking an important step in the direction in which the final solution to the political development of the Coloureds lies. This idea of a &#x201C;State within a State&#x201D;. &#x2026;</p>

<heading>MOTION FOR THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE</heading>

<p><i>Ruling by Mr. Speaker</i></p>

<speech by="#speaker">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SPEAKER</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition gave notice to-day of a motion for the adjournment of the House in order to discuss a matter of public importance to-morrow, viz.: The judgment delivered on Saturday, 11 April 1964, by the Judge-President of the Orange Free State Provincial Division of the Supreme Court in the Bultfontein murder trial.</p>

<p>Shortly before the hon. member gave notice of his motion, I was officially informed that one of the accused found guilty in the trial, G. A. Rossouw, had applied for leave to appeal and that the application had been set down provisionally for 21 April 1964.</p>

<p>The notice of motion of the hon. member in general terms seeks to discuss the judgment as a whole, but in view of the fact that the judgment so far as it relates to Rossouw is so closely linked with and inseparable from the rest of the judgment in the Bultfontein murder trial, I have come to the conclusion that the matter which the hon. member now seeks to make the subject of debate, must again be regarded as being <i>sub judice.</i></p>

<p>In the circumstances I regret I cannot allow the Notice of Motion to be placed on the Order Paper.</p>

<p>I want to point out to the hon. member that after the appellant&#x2019;s case has been disposed of, I shall be prepared to reconsider the matter.</p>
