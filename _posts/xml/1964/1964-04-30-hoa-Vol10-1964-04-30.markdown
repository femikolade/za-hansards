<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the object of this Bill is to restore the legal basis for the granting of participations in mortgage bonds which was recently upset by the Appeal Court in its judgment in the case of Lief, N.O. v. Dettmann. I may explain to the House that, based on a series of judgments of the Supreme Court starting as early as 1869, the impression had been created that a real right under a mortgage bond, i.e. the right to have recourse to realization of the property in satisfaction of the debt, could be obtained by an unregistered cession. Acting on this interpretation of the law the system of participation in mortgage bonds, whereby portions of the secured claim were informally made over to a number of participants, had become fairly widely established in the country. The rapid development of this system has taken place more particularly during the past two decades which is a clear reflection of the present-day need for investment channels in our economy. According to a conservative estimate R150,000,000 is at present invested in this manner in the country.</p>

<p>In the aforementioned case the Appeal Court decided that persons who participated in mortgage bonds in the manner which I have outlined had no secured claims and, in the instant case, were merely concurrent creditors in the insolvent estate of the registered bond-holder. The court found that a participation in a mortgage bond represented a real right only where there had been a cession registered as such in the Deeds Office. The judgment therefore removed the entire basis which had been accepted as affording security for this type of participation and the position has therefore arisen that all the holders of participations in mortgage bonds, which is quite a considerable number as I have pointed out, do not have the security which they supposedly had when the investments were originally made. The position requires to be remedied as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Firstly, we can never allow a body of investors of this magnitude becoming restive in regard to their investments and, may be, starting to demand repayment which may mean the calling-up of numerous bonds in the country. Moreover, the funds of many trusts have been invested in participations because it was thought that this type of investment complied with the special standard of care and diligence prescribed by the Courts for trustees&#x2014;with which standards an unsecured claim would not comply. It is estimated that approximately 25 per cent of the total investments in participation bonds fall in this latter category. It is also obvious that if the facility of this type of investment were not restored, the small investor would be deprived of a very desirable form of investment and on the other hand the financing of many building projects&#x2014;especially large buildings in our developing cities&#x2014;would be either impossible or much more difficult. For these reasons this proposed legislation is rather urgent.</p>

<p>The way in which we propose to remedy the position is to follow fairly closely the precedent which exists in our law in respect of secured debentures, whereby the holder of a debenture gets a real right in fixed property mortgaged as security. This precedent is embodied in Sections 91 to 93 of the Companies Act. The system there provided for requires a debenture bond to be registered in the name of a trustee as nominal mortgagee who holds such bond on behalf of debenture holders. Each debenture holder is entitled to enforce personally his rights under the bond against the mortgagor, unless the trust deed provides otherwise. A register of debenture holders has <span class="col_5209-5210" refersTo="page_1297"/>to be kept by the company issuing debentures. Our proposals in this Bill bear a close resemblance to the various particulars of the system applicable in securing debentures by means of the mortgage of fixed property. We propose creating a special type of mortgage bond, called a participation bond, which will be specifically described and registered as such in the name of a nominee company. Clause 2 of the Bill deals with this aspect. The nominee company which will be the nominal mortgagee will be subject to certain definite requirements and restrictions, the most important of which is that it will not be able to incur any liabilities other than those to the persons on whose behalf it holds assets to the extent of their respective rights to and interests in such assets. All the expenses of management of the nominee company will be paid by the company or person who manages the scheme, referred to in the Bill as the manager. Our object is to make the nominee company a safe holder of the bonds outside the estate of the manager. Its position is analogous to that of the trustee in the case of secured debentures.</p>

<p>From the registration of a participation bond, which will be recognizable as such by anybody by mere reference to the Deeds Registry, certain legal consequences, which are in the nature of exceptions to the general position of the conventional mortgage bond, will flow; the most important being that a register of participants, indicating the extent of each participant&#x2019;s interest in the bond, will be maintained, not in the Deeds Office, but in the registered office of the manager or at some other approved place. This register, which corresponds to the register of debenture holders, will be maintained by the manager in accordance with certain definite requirements of the law which are all prescribed in some detail in Clause 5 of the Bill. Clause 5 further provides that, like the records of the Deeds Office, this register will be open for inspection by the public.</p>

<p>The second important legal consequence which will flow from the registration of a participation bond is the removal of the common law right of the mortgagor to object to, what has been called, fragmentation of the bond. This provision, <i>inter alia,</i> is contained in Clause 6 of the Bill. I may mention that it is basic to the concept of a participation bond that the mortgagor will not be able to object to the granting of participations. It should be regarded that in agreeing to the registration of this special type of bond the mortgagor automatically waives his right to object.</p>

<p>In Clause 3 we propose provisions to the effect that a manager will only grant participations equal in their aggregate value to the amount of the bond. I will deal later with the safeguards which there will be against fraud in this connection. Clause 3 also provides that a manager will be able to accept money in terms of a written agreement 60 days in advance of granting participations. This facility is considered necessary in order to marshal the funds in anticipation of arranging the registration of a participation bond. In order, however, to distinguish acceptance of moneys for this purpose clearly from accepting deposits under the Banking Act we provide that it shall only take place in terms of a written agreement and that repayment shall be made after 60 days if a participation is not granted within that period.</p>

<p>Clause 4 provides that every participant shall get a notification which will, <i>inter alia,</i> indicate the extent of his participation as a sum of money and state the conditions on which the participant may transfer, cede or encumber his rights. Like in the case of the ordinary mortgage bond, the participant will have the right to make his interests over to somebody else&#x2014;even to the manager who may also hold participations&#x2014;but he may not as of right demand of the manager the encashment of his participation. This arrangement corresponds to the position of the mortgagee under the ordinary mortgage bond. Clause 6 provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that a participant must obtain the prior written consent of the manager to the transfer, cession or encumbrance of his rights under a participation. This is necessary to ensure that a participant will not exceed his rights and interests at the time of transfer and moreover this procedure is very desirable from the point of view of the needs of our economy. It will serve as a brake on the negotiability of participations which is desirable and is, moreover, quite in line with the long-term nature of a mortgage investment. Clause 6 further provides that a participant shall have the right, unless otherwise provided in the rules of the scheme, to enforce his rights against the mortgagor. This is the basic provision in the Bill which gives the participant the real right, under a participation bond which has been removed by the Appeal Court judgment.</p>

<p>The question may be asked how this legislation handles the position of participation bonds issued in the past. The mere passing of an Act is no guarantee that the rights of a participant acquired in the past will be safe. The participant may share in a scheme which may be in a chaotic state. The way in which we propose to deal with this problem is briefly as follows: Each scheme will have to have rules for its operation which will have to be approved by the Registrar of Unit Trust Companies. I may mention in passing that a participation mortgage scheme is somewhat analogous to a unit trust scheme and for that reason the Unit Trusts Control Act provides that the Registrar shall exempt such schemes from the provisions of that Act on such conditions as he may deem fit. Now, in putting his conditions to a scheme the Registrar will require all past participation bonds to be included in the scheme of which he has approved the rules. This will ensure the orderly inclusion of such bonds and the proper maintenance of the register of participants to which I have referred earlier. Thereafter such participants will enjoy the rights conferred in this <span class="col_5211-5212" refersTo="page_1298"/>Act. We provide in Clause 2 that the Deeds Office shall make the necessary endorsements on such past bonds, in order that they may be included in a scheme, without the payment of any transfer duty or other fees.</p>

<p>Clause 9 of the Bill contains provisions in regard to the rules. It provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that every condition imposed by the Registrar shall form part of the rules which have binding force and a contravention of which will be a punishable offence. One of the conditions which the Registrar will as a matter of policy impose on every scheme, and which will thus have binding force, will be the requirement that the manager must take out adequate fidelity insurance in respect of all the members of his staff who handle money of or administer a scheme. This will be the safeguard against possible loss on account of fraud on the part of the manager, say, for instance, where more participations than the value of the bond, to which possibility I have referred earlier, are granted.</p>

<p>In Clause 10 we propose provisions concerning the auditing of the register and books of account relating to a scheme. This is an additional safeguard. The auditor will have to report every irregularity or undesirable practice, if necessary to the Registrar, and a copy of every auditor&#x2019;s report will be available in the office of the Registrar for inspection by any interested person. This, together with the register which will be open for inspection, as I have mentioned earlier, should afford full disclosure of the position of a scheme to the public.</p>

<p>The remaining clauses in this Bill contain provisions in regard to the inspection of schemes in terms of the Inspection of Financial Institutions Act, the furnishing of information to the Registrar, offences and a small amendment of the Unit Trusts Control Act&#x2014; all provisions which are necessary for the better achievement of the objects of this Bill.</p>

<p>I may add that I intend to move two amendments in the Committee Stage. They are not of very great importance. The one is merely to apply the Unit Trusts Control Act also to South West Africa. If hon. members will follow the provisions of this Bill, they will see that the provisions are very closely interwoven. Quite a number of the clauses refer to the Unit Trusts Control Act of 1947, and that Act is not applicable to South West Africa. This Bill is applicable. Therefore it is necessary that the other Act should also be made applicable, and I will move accordingly in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>There is one other amendment that I will move and that is in the last clause. I shall move an amendment to the effect that this Act will commence as from a date to be fixed by proclamation by the State President in the <i>Government Gazette.</i> There is a practical reason for that. It cannot come into operation immediately. There are administrative difficulties, and when it comes into operation we must be able to function immediately. Those two amendments I propose to move at the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I wish to state that my Department has had wide consultations with interested parties in order to be quite sure that we are recommending a practicable scheme. We have closely followed the precedent in regard to debentures, and apart from that we have followed one guiding principle and that is to place a participant in a mortgage bond in all material respects in exactly the same position as an ordinary mortgagee under a mortgage bond. In that respect we are merely restoring the position which by many judgments everybody thought was the correct legal position until the recent judgment in the case that I have mentioned.</p>

<p>I am aware, however, of the attitude of certain interests who are not particularly enamoured of this measure, but having regard to the interests of the vast number of existing investors which are affected because of the considerable period this type of business has actually been conducted in the country and the general sound and straightforward principle on which this measure is based, I do not hesitate in commending this Bill to the consideration of the House.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>We support the second reading of this Bill. We appreciate that this Bill has become necessary because of a recent court case which placed the fortunes of many persons who thought they were safe in jeopardy. While we support the Bill, I think we should make it clear to the hon. the Minister that we are well aware that there are certain interests who are opposed to this Bill. I am informed that the law societies of both Natal and the Free State are opposed to this Bill. They feel that all participants should be registered with the Registrar of Deeds. I understand that the Transvaal Law Society is in favour of the Bill and that the Cape Society is divided, and that therefore the South African Law Society as a whole have not expressed an opinion about this Bill. While it may be desirable from the point of view of the person who wants all participants to be registered in the Deeds Office, I think the hon. Minister has quite rightly said that we should recognize the impracticability of having every participant registered in the Deeds Office. Having regard to the amount of money which is involved and the number of persons concerned with this type of investment, it is better to look for the most practical way of ensuring that the investing public is adequately protected, and I think the investing public is adequately protected if the form of registration in the various nominee companies&#x2019; offices is properly maintained. For that reason I think it is essential that there be adequate inspection. It serves no purpose the Minister having an inspection office if the inspection office is only going to be an office to receive forms from time to time, only making an inspection when difficulties arise. Mr. Speaker, while I cannot refer in detail to the matter <span class="col_5213-5214" refersTo="page_1299"/>which was discussed yesterday, we know from the discussion we had under another Department of the hon. the Minister yesterday, when we discussed supervision in that Department, how careful one has to be. We indicated the danger of inadequate supervision. I think it is essential that where the hon. the Minister is introducing a system of inspection, that inspection should be adequate, it should be efficient and at the same time it should be sympathetic. It is going to take time for the various interests to acquaint themselves with this Bill, it is going to take time before the Minister&#x2019;s Department is fully cognizant of the ramifications of the companies concerned with the type of investment. It would be a great tragedy if the public gained the impression that as a result of this legislation they are protected because there is the Minister&#x2019;s inspection department and if that department did not properly operate. I think sometimes when we appoint under our statutes inspection departments there is a danger of those department becoming receptacles for numerous Government forms; most forms are not looked at and only when an insolvency occurs or when a fraud is perpetrated does the inspectorate come alive. The essential part of an inspection department is to prevent difficulties and not just to tell the public about them when the difficulties have arisen. We would like to see the Minister giving careful attention to this. We see the reference to the form of certificate the hon. the Minister has referred to, the audit certificate. I think that should be defined in more detail than it is defined in this Bill. The Companies Act, as the Minister knows, sets out a form of certificate. I draw the hon. Minister&#x2019;s attention to Clause 10 which provides in (3) (b) (ii) &#x201C;that the latest valuation of the immovable property mortgaged appears to cover adequately the interests of the participants&#x201D;. That appears to give some safeguard, but when we examine this matter in the Committee Stage we would like the hon. the Minister to give us some information as to what is meant by the &#x201C;latest valuation&#x201D;. Is it contemplated that sworn Valuations will have to be made from time to time or is it contemplated that in every case there must be a sworn valuation before a bond is granted&#x003F;</p>

<p>Then the way in which the register is kept. Clause 5 provides for the rules and there is also provision for a register to be kept and various requirements in respect of that register. Mr. Speaker, the hon. Minister will appreciate that in modern times a register may not just be a book to which a clerk commits certain details to writing. A register could be a loose-leaf system of cards, and I think that before we reach the Committee Stage the hon. Minister should give some consideration to this matter. Many of these financial institutions have quite a considerable number of participants. I know of one office in my own city that has 5,000 participants and those participants are registered on cards. Now if the hon. the Minister will examine the definition of the Bill regarding the rules for the registered office of a nominee company, he will see that there is provision not only for the name and details of all participants, but there is provision that there must be a copy of the rules. The Minister will appreciate that it is quite impracticable to have a copy of the rules on the back of every card concerning every participant. Yet at the same time there must be some arrangement whereby the rules can be brought to the notice of the participants concerned so that a participant is well aware of the rules. These are practical difficulties which we will examine during the Committee Stage of the Bill, but I do suggest to the hon. the Minister that when introducing a Bill of this kind which, as the Minister says, has as its objective the protection of the investor, it should be practical and at the same time the investor should have not only the protection of audit, but also the protection of the Minister&#x2019;s Department.</p>

<p>The hon. Minister&#x2019;s reference to the Unit Trusts Control Act was brief, but we appreciate that the Unit Trusts Control Act does not apply to South West Africa and therefore it has to be extended so that these partition bonds which are already known in South West Africa can be registered under the Unit Trusts Act.</p>

<p>As we know, there are people who object to this form of registration because they feel that the maximum security can be obtained only if each person&#x2019;s name is registered in the Deeds Office. But as the hon. Minister has said a debenture holder does not have his debenture registered in the Deeds Office. A debenture holder has his debentures registered in the company&#x2019;s office in terms of the Companies Act, and his title is shown in the appropriate company&#x2019;s register. So too in this case a participant&#x2019;s certificate and a participant&#x2019;s rights can be properly shown in the register of the participating company. I think consideration also should be given during the course of the Committee Stage, or alternatively a later date, for a form of certificate which has the Department&#x2019;s approval. I think it will be much better to standardize the certificate and have a standard wording on a certificate so that as far as possible the public can become acquainted with the standard form of certificate. There is a tendency on the part of certain companies to have a very attractive certificate, a certificate to convey the impression that all is well because the certificate is done on the best modern paper and with the best modern printing and looks very impressive. As the hon. Minister will know quite often some of the most impressive certificates are the least valuable, particularly when you have some of these ambitious gentlemen trying to sell something quickly to the investing public. I would suggest that having regard to the very unfortunate experience which we have had over the last three or four years with certain financial institutions, here, while we are providing for adequate control over a particular type of investment, <span class="col_5215-5216" refersTo="page_1300"/>we should take all possible steps to ensure that there is maximum security for the public and that the investing public can have the assurance from the Minister&#x2019;s Department and from the Minister that adequate control will be maintained of those concerns which are going to come under this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>There is no doubt that the practice whereby several investors participate in one mortgage bond has grown very extensively throughout the years, until to-day there is the vast sum of R150,000,000 invested in this way, as was pointed out by the hon. the Minister. This practice is undoubtedly a desirable one but it is also economically necessary, because on the one hand many bonds to-day are of such a magnitude that one investor alone cannot cope with the amount, and on the other hand there are many people with a limited amount of money who wish to enjoy this type of investment. That being so, the large number of persons involved are entitled to the protection of our law, and the type of protection to which they are entitled is that their investments should be as secure under a participation bond as under an ordinary mortgage bond. There are of course several methods in practice at present under which persons may participate in one bond, and on the basis of several judgments referred to by the hon. the Minister it was thought that these various methods did provide the type of protection which I suggest these persons are entitled to. The Appellate Division has decided otherwise in the case of Lief, N.O. v. Dettman and has found that a mortgage bond gives a real right, that is to say a preferential right, only to persons who are on record in the Deeds Registry as being participants. In the case of a company which invests the moneys of a number of clients in a bond which is registered in its own name, that money or those moneys are safe under the law as it is held to be by the Appellate Division only for as long as that company remains solvent, and this of course is a most undesirable situation which must be remedied by legislation as soon as possible.</p>

<p>At the same time I think it is important to see this in its proper perspective. Although R150,000,000 is invested in this type of investment, there is no need for panic, as has been suggested by the hon. Minister, because on the one hand the vast majority of this money is invested by trust companies which are very sound and which operate by the most conservative methods, and on the other hand there are many companies that have already adopted the practice suggested under this Bill whereby their participating bond investors are registered in the name of the nominee company which does not incur any liabilities. The object of this Bill has been stated by the hon. the Minister and has been referred to by the hon. member for Pinetown and I do not wish to elaborate on it. It is quite clear that its object is to provide the type of security which I suggested investors were entitled to and it has been drafted along similar lines to the legislation applying to debenture bonds. In the view of this side of the House, the Bill deals with this subject as well as is possible. There are some suggestions which will be made in the Committee Stage and to which reference has been made by the hon. member for Pinetown, but in the main we agree that this subject is adequately dealt with and well dealt with in the Bill which is now before us.</p>

<p>I should like to just deal briefly with the subject of registration which has already been referred to in some respects by the hon. member for Pinetown. I do so because it is the case that there is a difference of opinion on this subject. The suggestion is that the Bill should provide for registration of the participating interests in the Deeds Registry. There are of course arguments both for and against it, but we on this side of the House agree that on balance it is better to adopt the approach suggested under this Bill for, among other reasons, the following: Investors clearly want this type of investment; it suits them that participants can be substituted for each other fairly readily, subject to the restrictions which are being suggested&#x2014;I do not suggest that they should be able to substitute other people indiscriminately, but in the main it is a satisfactory practice that substitution should be fairly readily granted. Thirdly, I suggest, that it would not suit persons who like this type of investment to bear the cost of registering changes in participations as and when they occur. So on balance we think the system suggested by this Bill should be adopted in preference to the other whereby all the participations must be registered in the Deeds Register.</p>

<p>There is one final point which I would like to deal with and that is the question of making the provisions of this Bill retrospective. As the hon. Minister is well aware, efforts were made to try and make this Bill retrospective in some way so as to protect those investors who invested in the particular company which was the subject of the Appellate Division decision. I am aware of the discussions on the subject and that there again on balance it has been decided that this cannot be done. I would suggest to the hon. the Minister respectfully that it might be in the interest of the persons concerned that the hon. the Minister should explain for the purposes of the record the reasons why this Bill is not being made retrospective for the purpose of covering this particular group of investors.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank hon. members very much indeed for their contributions to this debate. This is the sort of legislation in regard to which one Would like as much assistance as possible from people who have to deal with some phase of it or other. I shall be pleased if hon. members will discuss their ideas or any proposals <span class="col_5217-5218" refersTo="page_1301"/>which they want to put forward at the Committee Stage with the representative of the office of the Registrar of Financial Institutions who will be here until to-morrow.</p>

<p>This legislation restores the position to what it was before that Appeal Court judgment was given, but with this difference: Under the old set-up there was no security. The various safeguards for which provision is made in this Bill were not complied with. We did not merely want to restore the <i>status quo</i> we wanted at the same time to give greater security to the people who participate in these participation bonds. The hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) spoke about regular inspections. That is quite correct, but I do think that in their own interests one can expect the participants to inspect the registers from time to time themselves and, if there is anything which gives them cause for suspicion, to bring it to the notice of the office. They must see to it that the money given out under any particular participation bond does not exceed the total amount of the main bond. They can ensure that the rules are applied properly. If there is a certain amount of co-operation on the part of the participants themselves, they can greatly simplify the task of the Department and enable it to take more effective action. I would like the participants to take more interest in the register in their own interests so that they can see what is happening to the scheme of which they are members. I just want to say that one of the conditions will be that sworn valuations will have to be made. As far as the certificate referred to in Section 10 (3) is concerned, the Auditors&#x2019; Board has been consulted in regard to the auditor&#x2019;s certificate and they feel that the present wording of Section 10 (3) is in conformity with the duties of an auditor as laid down in the Public Accountants and Auditors Act of 1951. Then there is the question of the participant&#x2019;s certificate. I agree with the hon. member that one should try to make it a document which will not only have the appearance of a valuable document, but which will also be fairly durable. Our idea is to make the participants&#x2019; certificates uniform so that there will not be different forms for the different schemes. This will have to be approved by the Registrar as part of the rules.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Durban (Musgrave) (Mr. Hourquebie) spoke about panic. I had no intention of holding out the prospect of a possibility of panic. What I did have in mind was that if this legislation was not introduced, there would be panic; that people would begin to have their doubts in the light of that judgment. It was precisely in order to avoid any possibility of panic that I stated a month or two ago that I was going to introduce this legislation. I made that statement with the express purpose of avoiding any possibility of doubt or panic. But I think the other idea which he put forward that the persons affected by the judgment should be informed as to why they cannot be included, is one that I can convey to the Registrar to see whether that cannot be done. Perhaps the hon. member can also convey that to those people if he knows any of them. The reasons given by him were perfectly correct. We actually came up against the same difficulty. I thought originally that this would be a very simple Bill. All we are doing is to restore the position to what it was before the judgment. But what was the position&#x003F; We had no legislation; we were faced with a series of judgments and the first difficulty we experienced was to bring them up to date. But we also experienced another difficulty. What about the existing schemes which do not have these safety-valves for which we are making provision here&#x003F; We felt that by passing this legislation, which will be retrospective to a certain extent, we would enable the older schemes to adapt themselves to the conditions that we are laying down here and to enjoy the same protection as the others. I think this is the only practical solution to this problem which has given us quite a number of headaches.</p>

<heading>HOUSING AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>Second Order read: Second reading,&#x2014;Housing Amendment Bill.</p>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>I move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the fact that I have to introduce this Bill to amend the Housing Act, 1957, does not mean that the Housing Act is bad legislation, it rather proves that conditions in the Republic are changing so rapidly that the arrangements in connection with the provision of housing out of State funds in terms of the Housing Act have to be adjusted from time to time to cope with the special needs of the present time.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Bill now before the House is therefore to bring the powers which the principal Act confers into line with present-day requirements and to streamline procedures which tend to militate against its effectiveness. I am sure that hon. members will agree with me that with the great demand for housing being experienced at present no encumbering factors based on minor niceties can be permitted to thwart our endeavours to speed up housing.</p>

<p>The amendments proposed have this object in view and fall into two categories, namely, those which will result in important additions or modifications to some provisions of the principal Act and provisions required to bring the Act up to date as well as consequential amendments and provisions of an administrative nature.</p>

<p>In my remarks to the House on this Bill I propose to deal only with the more important <span class="col_5219-5220" refersTo="page_1302"/>provisions which embody questions of principle or the extension of existing principles since: the other matters can be dealt with adequately during a later stage.</p>

<p>With the exception of one clause the principles involved or the extension of already accepted principles envisaged in the other clauses are of a minor nature and need not be dealt with at length now as I will deal with them fully when dealing with the various clauses which need elaboration.</p>

<p>The one aspect that needs special mention is that contained in Clause 4 of the Bill in terms of which powers are created for the Housing Commission with the consent of the Minister and the Minister of Finance to amend the conditions or to substitute conditions or to impose new conditions in respect of already approved housing schemes out of the fund with or without the consent of the administering local authority or utility company.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I must warn against any wrong impressions as far as this clause is concerned. It is simply an enabling measure for application generally or in a particular case if it becomes evident to the Department of Housing that by adhering to conditions initially laid down anomalies are created, such as, for instance, when identical dwellings in the same township or scheme have to be let at different rentals due to the fact that the cost of erection of the dwellings varied as a result of tender prices received at different times. Powers are necessary in such cases to equate costs and accordingly also the rentals, as tenants compare the dwellings and rentals and not the tender prices.</p>

<p>Another type of contingency that has to be provided for is the reserve funds which local authorities are enabled to build up out of percentages allowed in the rentals by the commission for a bad debts reserve maintenance fund, etc. It has come to the notice of the commission that a large number of local authorities have built up substantial funds of this nature which are far in excess of the amounts which they may ever require to meet expenditure of the type intended. In such cases it may be desirable to cease the collection of such funds, or to reduce the approved percentage and thereby benefit the tenants by charging lower rentals or giving more elaborate services and amenities.</p>

<p>As the Act now stands such funds may not be used for any other purpose than that for which they were originally instituted. When the amendment becomes law the commission could authorize a local authority which has such funds to utilize it for other purposes, such as, for instance, the improvement of the scheme in question or the provision of additional amenities. Mr. Speaker, I am sure that hon. members will agree with me that such powers are urgently necessary in the interests of tenants who usually are not well-to-do people and should only be required to pay the minimum rental which will suffice to meet any expenditure incurred by a local authority in connection with the administration of the accommodation provided.</p>

<p>The first of the other provisions which I must mention is contained in Clause 1 in which the definitions of the terms &#x201C;approved dwelling&#x201D; and &#x201C;approved scheme&#x201D; are expanded to include also a dwelling or scheme approved by the Administrator. The effect of this amendment will be that when a local authority with the approval of the Administrator borrows money from sources other than the National Housing Fund, the dwelling or scheme it may construct therewith does not necessarily have to comply with the conditions and standards, etc., laid down by the commission, but must comply with standards laid down by the Administrator which may be higher than the standards of the commission. However, the scheme or dwelling still has to be technically examined by the commission to ensure that such dwellings or schemes will represent good value for the money to be spent.</p>

<p>This provision is desirable to enable local authorities which experience a demand for housing by a possibly higher income group than that catered for out of the Housing Fund, to meet that demand if they are so inclined, and the persons involved cannot obtain assistance elsewhere.</p>

<p>The substitution of a new Section 40 by means of Clause 6 of this Bill has two main objects, both of which are not inconsistent with the provisions of the existing section. In the new clause the principles contained in the original section are merely expanded or amplified for the sake of greater clarity. The only new principles contained therein are that the Minister may after consultation with the Administrator authorize the transfer of a scheme erected by the commission to a local authority, the old section provided for the prior consent of the Administrator to such transfer;</p>

<p>The new sub-section provides adequate safeguards as it cannot be envisaged that the Minister will without special reasons act contrary to the advice of an Administrator. However, not all local authorities support the State&#x2019;s policy that all families should be adequately housed and that slum conditions should be eliminated. Some actively oppose, for instance, the rehousing of members of their community in areas demarcated for specific groups or are so dilatory in carrying out their functions under the Slums Act that the Department of Housing may of necessity have to step in and provide the required housing, possibly in areas where the Department will have difficulty in administering such housing schemes owing to their situation in relation to the Department&#x2019;s regional offices; In such cases it may then be in the interest of the community and the Department to transfer the housing which has been provided to the local authority for administrative purposes. Where provision is made for such transfer <span class="col_5221-5222" refersTo="page_1303"/>to be effected without the concurrence of the Administrator who may have reservations as regards the financial ability or stability of the local authority to undertake such administration, the Minister is empowered by the new provision to stipulate terms and conditions regarding such transfer, whereby he will be able to render such assistance to such local authority as he may deem necessary to enable it to undertake the required administration.</p>

<p>The other new provision is contained in sub-clause 2 which enables the Minister in certain circumstances to direct the commission to undertake a scheme in any locality which he considers necessary. This provision is necessary to expedite the provision of housing for persons who require accommodation as a result of the application of State policy or other legislation in areas in which the commission would not normally undertake housing schemes on its own initiative.</p>

<p>Since, introducing the Bill a defect in the original as well as in the new Section 40 relating to the persons to whom dwellings erected by the commission may be sold or let has become apparent. The commission and the Department have always viewed and acted since years ago on the assumption that the categories of persons to whom it may sell or let dwellings erected by it were the same as the categories determined in respect of housing loans, in terms of paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the Act, viz. persons with a monthly income not exceeding R180 per month at present. It now appears that no provision exists in the Act for dwellings sold or let by the commission itself to be made subject to the same conditions as those applicable in respect of housing loans.</p>

<p>I therefore propose, during the Committee Stage, to introduce an amendment to subsection (5) of the proposed new Section 40 to make dwellings sold or let by the commission subject to the same conditions as those applicable in respect of persons to whom housing loans may be granted. The practical effect of the amendment will be that the same limitations in regard to income, etc., will apply in respect of all dwellings financed by the commission by way of housing loans or erected by the commission itself and sold or let.</p>

<p>A further amendment of import is that contained in Clause 7 of the Bill: In terms of the new provision the Minister is empowered to appoint an Executive Committee and Regional Committees of the National Housing Commission. This function could previously be exercised by the commission itself. It is, however, viewed that with the coming into being of a Department of Housing with seven regional offices which are fully equipped to deal with matters of a day-to-day nature, with a consequent diminution of matters falling to be dealt with by the commission that an Executive Committee and Regional Committees with limited functions will suffice, and that the Minister who is responsible for the administration of the Housing Act should be empowered to appoint such committees as are required to deal only with matters as cannot be dealt with adequately by the Department of Housing. The National Housing Commission fully supports the provisions contained in: this clause.</p>

<p>By the insertion of sub-section (1 )<i>bis</i> in Section 49 as contained in Clause 9 of the Bill an anomaly existing in the present legislation is removed. According to an interpretation of the relevant section of the Act, as it now reads, a utility company which erects a dwelling for sale to a natural person, I may state for the information of members that according to the Housing Act a natural person is a human being, and a person, then presumably a statutory body or corporation on land which is registered in its name is unable to grant to such person credit facilities in excess of the cost of erection of the dwelling as the cost of the land may not be included for loan calculation purposes. Such facilities are then usually less than those available to natural persons who may obtain 90 per cent loans calculated on the value of the land plus improvements. As a result, a person purchasing a dwelling from a utility company has to find a greater deposit than the 10 per cent which an applicant for a loan ordinarily has to find. The amendment proposed makes provision for the granting of a loan to a utility company which will enable such company to grant credit facilities to the purchaser of a dwelling erected by it, which will equal the facilities available to other borrowers, subject, of course to the maximum loan available which is the same in respect of all types of loans out of the National Housing Fund.</p>

<p>Clause 10 inserts sub-sections (55)<i>bis</i> and (55)<i>per</i> in the principal Act. The proposed subsection (55)6/.$ is of an administrative nature and needs no further comment. Sub-section (55)<i>per</i> whilst, it contains no new principles is also one of the important provisions contained in this Bill. It extends the powers already conferred on the commission by Section (30)<i>bis,</i> to acquire immovable property including existing dwellings and to use such property for the purposes of the Act also to local authorities. This provision will enable local authorities to acquire existing dwellings and other property out of advances out of the National Housing Fund, where such acquisition is necessary to facilitate the resettlement of persons in any area which has been demarcated for their occupation or to acquire existing dwellings in an area where a scheme is to be erected if such acquisition, would facilitate the proposals of the local authority. Any dwellings acquired in terms of this section may then be used for the purposes envisaged in the principal Act and may be sold or let on an economic or sub-economic basis in accordance with their nature and the nature of the demand.</p>

<p>Another important provision is contained in Clause 12 which inserts sub-section (59)<i>bis</i> <span class="col_5223-5224" refersTo="page_1304"/>Powers are created in this new sub-section for the Department of Housing to obtain a measure of control over housing moneys advanced to local authorities to acquire land in terms of the Slums Act, 1934. Cases are known where local authorities have possessed land acquired in this way out of sub-economic funds for about 20 years without putting it to any beneficial use or even clearing the slums existing thereon. This provision empowers the Minister and the Department to take action to cause local authorities to use such land for the purpose for which it was acquired or to dispose of it and to repay the housing funds tied up therein. It also provides that when a local authority makes a profit on the sale of such land that a reasonable share of the profit should accrue to the National Housing Fund.</p>

<p>Clause 13 inserts Section <i>60bis.</i> The object of this section is to expedite the provision of housing where such provision is delayed by the inability of the local authority which has to supply it, to provide any services required in connection therewith. This section empowers the Minister to instruct the Secretary for Housing to direct any adjoining local authority which is able to provide the required services to provide such services as may be necessary to make the carrying out of a scheme possible in the area of the first-mentioned local authority. Any local authority supplying services in this manner will be allowed to charge the usual tariffs applicable in the same area for any services made available by it. Fears have been expressed regarding this provision but I wish to give members the assurance that it will only be applied in cases where housing is urgently required but cannot be provided because of the inability of the local authority who has to provide it to make such services available timeously or at reasonable cost, its application need not be permanent or cost the supplying local authority anything as it will be permitted to cover its costs.</p>

<p>Whilst it is not anticipated that use will be made of these powers in many cases, it is nevertheless considered that such powers are desirable in times of a housing shortage that has to be coped with in the least possible time on a national basis, surely petty jealousies should not be allowed to stand in the way of national interests.</p>

<p>Clause 14 substitutes a new Section 65 for the existing section which has proved to be inadequate. The object of the new section is the curbing of certain malpractices being perpetrated by a few individuals. It has come to the Department&#x2019;s notice that there are persons who buy up debts of persons to whom the commission has granted housing loans, either directly or through a local authority or building society, and then, although that person may not be in arrear with his payments in respect of the dwelling, obtaining an order of court attaching such dwelling when the borrower is unable to meet such debts and selling the dwelling in execution. Such persons very often then buy the dwelling themselves at sales in execution at low and unrealistic prices. In this way the borrower is often ruined and the Housing Fund, the local authority or the building society as the case may be exposed to financial loss. The amendment contained in sub-section (1) of Section 65 endeavours to curb this practice by providing that before a dwelling may be sold in execution, the mortgagee must either agree in writing to such sale or the balance of the bond must be guaranteed by the person seeking the sale in execution.</p>

<p>A further undesirable practice being experienced is that certain persons are registering orders of the court attaching properties against the title deeds of dwellings in respect of which the commission, building society or local authority is the mortgagee in terms of the Housing Act. Should it then happen that the commission, local authority or building society has to take any action under their bond they find that they first have to obtain a release of the property by either paying the amount involved in the attachment or having it set aside in the Supreme Court. Both these methods involve the mortgagee in extra expense. The provision contained in sub-section (2) stipulates that any attachment shall lapse whenever the holder of the first mortgage bond has to exercise his rights in terms thereof.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that hon. members will agree with me that the security offered by a first mortgage bond should not be subject to malpractices of this nature as the whole object of obtaining security for a debt by a first mortgage bond is thwarted thereby.</p>

<p>As I said initially one of the objects of this Bill is to remove anomalies. The amendment of Section 72 of the principal Act by Clause 15 is such a case. It appears that in terms of the rents legislation a landlord who wishes to undertake a reconstruction scheme can give his tenants six months&#x2019; notice to vacate. In terms of Section 72 of the Housing Act, 1957, however, an owner wishing to carry out a reconstruction or conversion scheme is required to obtain the Minister&#x2019;s prior consent.</p>

<p>It now happens that an owner of leased property gives his tenants six months&#x2019; notice to vacate in terms of the Rents Act and only towards the end of the period of notice approaches the Minister in terms of the Housing Act. The result is that the tenants have vacated in the meantime and are caused hardship unnecessarily as the owner has no certainty that the Minister will in fact give his permission to the demolition or conversion of the dwelling or building in terms of the Housing Act. The amendment now proposed removes this anomaly by providing that a landlord shall not give the six months&#x2019; notice required by the rents legislation until he has obtained the Minister&#x2019;s written prior permission under the Housing Act. I am sure that members will agree with me that this is a very necessary amendment, especially in times of a great demand <span class="col_5225-5226" refersTo="page_1305"/>for accommodation such as we are experiencing at present.</p>

<p>The amendment proposed in Clause 16 has as its object the rectification of an error which inadvertently occurred in the Bill to Amend the Housing Act passed in 1962. At that time it was considered that the wording of the section as it now stands, viz. that &#x201C;Fees charged by a local authority in respect of properties of which the commission is the owner, shall not be subject to penalties&#x201D;, was wide enough to include &#x201C;taxes levied by municipalities&#x201D;. It appears that this supposition was wrong as according to legal advice &#x201C;Fees&#x201D; do not include taxes and the matter is accordingly being put right now by specifically mentioning also taxes.</p>

<p>Before concluding I want to inform the House that since introducing this measure I have had some very fruitful discussions with the Administrators of the four provinces and that an agreement has been arrived at on several matters which should contribute greatly towards facilitating the provision of housing and the removal of obstacles standing in our way at present.</p>

<p>The agreement arrived at with the Administrators embraces the following:</p>

<block name="quote">Firstly, a method of expediting the approval of townships where such townships are to be developed out of housing moneys. In terms of this arrangement it should be possible to complete all the formalities in connection with the approval of a township within a period of three months. However, should it happen that after the expiration of a period of three months from the date of its submission to the Administrator that a township cannot yet be approved, but that it had nevertheless proceeded to a stage that satisfies the Administrator and the Minister of Housing that it could be satisfactorily developed, the Minister of Housing can authorize that the township be laid out and developed and housing provided thereon in anticipation of final approval of the township.</block>

<p>Secondly, as the Housing Act now provides local authorities are bound by the provisions of any by-law or regulation which is operative in their area of jurisdiction as well as the conditions of a township prescribed by the Administrator relating to the type of dwelling to be constructed or the value thereof or the materials to be used in the construction thereof, whereas the National Housing Commission is exempted there from. The effect of this is that whilst the commission may for instance erect wooden houses or houses of wood products, the local authority itself may not do so, although it was granted a loan by the Housing Commission. In terms of the agreement referred to, the Administrators have also agreed that they will consent to the waiving of any such restrictive conditions at the request of the Minister of Housing, where a housing scheme is to be financed out of the National Housing Fund. Hon. members will agree with me that such an arrangement is very necessary, because as far as building itself is concerned there has been a revolution not only in the materials available but in their use, and I think it is most important to make possible the application of new techniques to carry through the programme of housing.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the agreement provides for reciprocal representation of the Department of Housing on the Townships Boards or the Townships Commission and of the Provincial Administrations on the Regional Committees of the National Housing Commission. This could lead to much closer liaison between the various bodies concerned with the provision of housing.</p>

<p>I intend, therefore, to move further amendments during the Committee Stage to embody the effect of the matters which I have just referred to in this Bill and to make the necessary provision therefor. The amendments have already been Tabled.</p>

<p>Apart from these matters which require legislation I can also announce that the Administrators have also agreed as an administrative measure to put an official of the Provincial Administrations well versed in the establishment of townships at the disposal of any person or persons wishing to establish a township, to help and guide them with the intricate procedures involved. This step should greatly assist township developers and should appreciably reduce the time required for the establishment of townships in general.</p>

<p>Since the Bill was read a first time the Group Areas Development Board was transferred from the Department of Community Development to the Department of Housing. This transfer also necessitates a small consequential amendment of the Housing Act. With the leave of the House I shall therefore during the Committee Stage of the Bill also move a small amendment to Section 30<i>bis</i> of the Act in this regard.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, in recommending this Bill to the House, I want to reiterate that there are very few new principles involved. Actually all that is aimed at is the adjustment of a number of sections of the principal Act to meet present-day conditions and requirements. The few clauses of the Bill which I have not specifically mentioned, namely 1 (b), 2, 3, 5, 8, 10, 11, sub-section 3 of Section 6<i>Obis</i> as inserted by Clause 13 and Clause 17 are all of an administrative nature and their effect is merely to streamline the Act and any questions arising there from can be dealt with adequately during the Committee Stage.</p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hansard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the amendment which I propose to move at this stage is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To omit &#x201C;now&#x201D; and to add at the end &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I do that at once because of the limited time for discussion at this stage in connection with this Bill. I want to say at once that in my approach to the Bill I was greatly influenced by a remark once made by the Minister of Finance when he spoke of possible threats to South Africa. He spoke of what had been done for the Bantu people and he then referred to the rest of the population and indicated that he believed that in the event of South Africa being in danger there would be 5,000,000 hearts beating as one. It is quite clear that in that 5,000,000 he intended to include not only the Asiatic population but most certainly also the Coloured population, and in looking at this Bill, as it is now before us after the Committee and Report Stages at its third reading, I cannot but ask myself what will be the effect of the provisions of this Bill upon the creation of a block of 5,000,000 hearts beating as one. Sir, if I am to judge at all from the policy statements which have given rise to this Bill, it is clear that it is meant to be and has been publicized as the first step in a process of evolution for the Coloured people, a first step which in the view of the hon. the Prime Minister will lead one day, by way of a four-stream policy, to a Commonwealth relationship, to consultation by way of a Commonwealth relationship, between the various racial groups in South Africa. This Bill has to do with the most advanced group, the most Westernized group, the group that has always been the appendage of the European population, has stood by the European population in peace and war and has been anxious to move ever closer towards it. We now find before us a Bill creating a council for that group, a Bill which gives that group, the most Westernized group amongst the non-European peoples, a definitely inferior type of council, a council with lesser powers and fewer powers than the Legislative Assembly now being created in the Bantustan, in the Transkei. It is inexplicable, if the approach is that outlined, that a Bill of this kind should come before us in which so little is given to people so well advanced, so well developed and with such a long political history. The Bill is publicized also in one of the Government <i>Digests</i> as a means, if legislative power is given under the Bill by the President to the Assembly in terms of Clause 17, whereby the Minister of Coloured Affairs will be able to have Bills of his choosing passed by the council instead of by Parliament. Admittedly those Bills will have to do only with Coloured people and will have to do, in terms of Clauses 17 and 21, only with a limited number of matters, but it is also possible that their ideas may not be entirely in accord with the ideas of this Parliament, and one wonders therefore just what it is that this Bill portends for the Coloured people. It has other provisions which we find difficult to accept but which we have tried in most cases to remedy by way of amendment but without any success. It is extraordinary that at this stage for this group, which has exercised political rights for 100 years, we should have <span class="col_5229-5230" refersTo="page_1307"/>a council created in which one-third of the members are nominated, in which the position is that the nominated members plus approximately 25 per cent of the elected members will have a majority in the council, so that with the support of approximately one-quarter of the elected members, the nominated members could run that council, and those members, Sir, are nominated by the Government of the day. One wonders of what value their advice will be and of what value their representations will be unless those nominations are very carefully made. One wonders if you can ever have a council in which so large a proportion is nominated, which can really express the views of a group of this kind.</p>

<p>Sir, there is another matter which has worried us and that is that in the debates in the council there will be no real provision for privilege. There will be privilege in certain matters but there will be no privilege when Government servants or officials are criticized or when the actions of this Parliament or of the Minister are criticized. How are these people going to have free and open discussion if they do not feel that they are properly privileged and that they can speak their mind&#x003F; I can well imagine what debates in this House will be like if there were no privilege and one was faced with some of the difficult situations with which every opposing group and every Government is faced from time to time, and yet there is no adequate provision for privilege in this Bill, nor is official consultation with the Coloured Representatives provided for. It leaves one wondering exactly what the relationship between the Coloured Representatives and this council is going to be. The Coloured Representatives sit here in Parliament; they are elected by a certain group of Coloureds, and the Minister has pointed out that in this province Indians are registered on that roll as well. But, Sir, there is not a large number of them, and the roll which elects these Coloured Representatives has always been regarded as representative of the Coloured people qualified to vote. The Minister and the Secretary for Coloured Affairs may appear in this council; they may address it but the Coloured Representatives are not. given that privilege, and one wonders what the association is going to be between the Coloured Representatives and this council, and how often we will find them giving perhaps different advice to the same Minister.</p>

<p>Then there is another provision which we regard as extraordinary and that is that every member coming forward for election must have been resident for two years at least in the constituency in which he seeks election. I wonder how many members in this House would have been elected if that provision had been applied to this House&#x003F;</p>

<p>Sir, looking at the Bill as a whole, examining the various powers granted and bearing in mind that legislative functions is subject to proclamation by the President and bearing in mind that Bills have to be introduced with the approval of the Minister concerned, one is constrained to ask oneself what this move portends for the Coloured people. I have said that I believe it is part of the four-stream policy outlined by the hon. the Prime Minister and mentioned by the hon. the Minister in respect of this matter. But, Sir, where is it leading&#x003F; It is supposed to be leading to something in the nature of a Commonwealth arrangement. This is the foundation which is to lead to a Commonwealth arrangement. Sir, when we come to this Commonwealth arrangement, who are representing the Coloured people&#x2014;the people coming from this council or the Coloured Representatives elected to this House&#x003F; We must know what the hon. the Minister has in mind because it seems to me that at the moment the Government is taking a shot in the dark with this Bill. It does not really know where it is going. It has outlined its objectives but even its own newspaper, the <i>Burger,</i> admits that it is bound on a course the end of which it does not know. Sir, when one is faced with steps of that kind, when one is faced with a new direction from that which we support, one is constrained to ask what one&#x2019;s attitude should be. I have no doubt that I must be against this Bill, and I must be against this Bill because in my opinion it is a further attempt to compensate for the wrong done to the Coloured people when they were removed from the Common Roll and given, originally, the Union Advisory Council and now the second stage in an attempt to compensate them for what is being taken away, but there is no attempt to make restitution. You see, Sir, when you look at it in that way you cannot help thinking of what Dr. Malan said in 1928 when he voted against an Opposition Bill to give the vote to women. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5231-5232" refersTo="page_1308"/>If I Vote for this Bill as it now stands I shall vote for the restriction of the vote to European women only. Then I come into direct conflict with the policy which I have hitherto published on platforms that a dividing line must be drawn between the Native and Coloured people and that the political rights of the White man shall be given to the Coloured people.</block>

<p>Sir, is this the first step in giving the political rights of the White man to the Coloured people&#x003F; What did General Hertzog say&#x003F; He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">As far as the Coloureds are concerned we have no right to separate them from us on political, economic or industrial lines.</block>

<p>Sir, there are other statements along the same lines by leading statesmen in the past, Here we have a Bill creating a council of a purely advisory nature which does not even have the moral justification of creating homelands for the Coloured people. Sir, the hon. the Minister sought to justify it by saying that the fact that there was an advisory council in the old days when the Coloureds were on the Common Roll is a justification of the fact that this council is being brought into being; it shows that Common Roll representation was a failure. Sir, every time an advisory council is appointed to advise the Prime Minister or anybody else, does it mean that representation in this House is a failure&#x003F; That is a most extraordinary argument which to my mind does not hold water at all and I ask myself how with this Bill we can keep the Coloured as our allies&#x003F; The hon. the Minister earlier in the debate quoted from the book by the late Senator Fagan, &#x201C;Co-existence in South Africa&#x201D;. He quoted some interesting passages, but, of course, I think he left out the most important one and that was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Can it be a good spirit which is driving us at the same time to estrange the Coloured people and the Asiatics and try to kraal them off into states within a state&#x003F;</block>

<p>Sir, is this not part and parcel of the policy of creating a state within a state&#x003F; Is this not the Prime Minister&#x2019;s idea of the beginning of a state within a state&#x003F; Does this not cut the Coloured people off from their political past, a political past in which they were always interwoven with the White man&#x003F; I think anybody who thinks seriously about this matter will realize that.</p>

<p>Then, Sir, there is a third reason why I am opposed to this Bill. To me it is an inevitable step towards the abolition of the Coloured representation in this House. It leads inevitably in that direction. I know that I will be told at once that the Prime Minister has said that that is not the intention, and I know the hon. the Minister has said that that is not the intention. But this Government has changed its mind about a number of things over the years. It changed its mind about the Indians. First it was going to repatriate them and now they are a permanent part of the population. It changed its mind about immigration; it changed its mind about these very Coloured Representatives. When the first proposal came for the Coloureds to be put on a separate roll their representatives, elected on that separate roll, were going to be second-class Members of Parliament; there were certain things on which they were not going to have the right to vote. The Government changed its mind in that regard. Even fairly recently the hon. the Prime Minister, speaking in 1961 on this very issue, made a most interesting statement&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">This means, after all, that if the separate development of the Coloureds should advance beyond the stage of a Coloured council and should take place in the form of a state within a state, in the direction of a parliament of their own, it might be that they will not be represented here, because we would then have two Parliaments next to one another, and they would have the fullest representation in their own parliament. If this development should move along different lines a different answer might have to be given. I therefore said that I did not want to give any answer to that question at that stage. That is a matter which must be considered at a later stage.</block>

<p>In all fairness let it be said that at a later stage the Prime Minister said that as far as he was concerned the representatives of the Coloured people are going to stay in this House. What is their position going to be&#x003F; Because under this legislation members of the executive of this Advisory Council, through the Minister, are going to have access to members of the Cabinet which serves this Parliament. There is not the slightest doubt that they will be approached by members of their legislative assembly and that the members of that legislative assembly will be approached by their electors, some of whom will be the electors of these Coloured Representatives in this House. So you are going to have two channels to the Minister, one through the Coloured Council, its executive, the Minister of Coloured Affairs, and one through these Coloured Representatives, to the Cabinet. It seems inevitable that there will be conflict. It seems inevitable that the one will try to act as the official machine and stand on its position, and that the other will be moved out. There is no doubt that the hon. the Minister will be the person who will influence the direction in which that development will take place. And if I know&#x2014;and I know his appetite for empire building&#x2014;I believe there will be a move in that direction. I believe it will be taken further by subsequent Ministers. The stage will be reached when these Coloured Representatives will be told, perhaps by members of that Coloured council, that they no longer represent the Coloured people but that the council represent them.</p>

<p><span class="col_5233-5234" refersTo="page_1309"/>You see, Sir, we are here creating the machinery for conflict; we are here undermining the position of the Coloured Representatives in this House.</p>

<p>There is a fourth reason why I believe this Bill must be rejected and that is that I do not believe the Coloured people themselves want it. I do not propose to enter into the controversy between the hon. the Minister and other representatives in this House as to what the Union Advisory Council on Coloured Affairs said or did not say or what Bill was before, when and how. What I do say is that the existing council can by no stretch of imagination ever be regarded as being representative of the Coloured people. And I think the Minister agrees. The majority of them are nominated. Those who were elected were elected at elections in which they were all virtually unopposed. The Coloured people boycotted the election. So I cannot say that they are representative of the Coloured people at all. In my view there is not the slightest doubt that the Coloured people are not in favour of development in this direction. The fact that this council opposed this Minister and this Government on occasions and criticized them is no proof to me that they are representative. I think it just proves that they are ordinary human beings. I think almost anyone would criticize this Government in due course, especially its treatment of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>There is a fifth reason why I am opposed to this Bill and that is that if it is the foundation of the four-stream policy what would one expect if that four-stream policy were to be honestly applied&#x003F; Would one not expect indications that homelands would be created&#x003F; Would one not expect indications that there would be an elected leader of the executive instead of a nominated one&#x003F; Would one not expect the possibility of their own citizenship as in the case of the Bantu people&#x003F; Would one not expect the Minister of Coloured Affairs to indicate that the development in his Department is going to be in the direction of a minister of external affairs as, we have heard, will be the position of the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, acting between two independent sovereign groups&#x003F; Would one not expect the foundation to be laid in this Bill of a system indicative of the future independence and sovereignty of these people&#x003F; Sir, there are sound reasons why we should oppose this Bill. But I think the soundest of them all is that it moves in a direction diametrically opposed to that in which the Opposition wishes to move. It moves in a direction which is diametrically opposite to that which the hon. Senator Fagan hoped we would move in&#x2014;and which the hon. the Minister also failed to read out&#x2014; and that was this: Having spoken about consultation, which the hon. the Minister has characterized as being the foundation of this Bill, he then went on&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">And if the mutual trust and common loyalty engendered by it &#x2026;</block>

<p>The hon. the Minister also spoke about common loyalty&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; should in course of time lead to a readiness on the part of a substantial majority of the Whites to ask the non-Whites to hold the reins with them and join in control at the highest level, that would, in what must be the prevailing atmosphere when that readiness manifests itself, be sure to be hailed as the ultimate triumph of the policy of promoting goodwill and unity.</block>

<p>In other words, political rights to these people of a different kind. That is why we have always hoped, in the case of the Coloured people, we could move in a direction of their being accepted as part of the Western group. We have always hoped that they would be accepted as part of the Westernized people of the Republic. We have hoped to see movement in the direction of their restoration to the Common Roll in the Cape and in Natal. We have hoped to see movement in the direction of their being allowed to sit in this House, if they could get themselves elected. We have hoped to see a movement in the northern provinces where they have had no representation in the past other than to participate in elections for the old Senate elected by the Bantu people&#x2014;if they were prepared to be treated as Bantu for that purpose&#x2014;in the direction of their being represented in the Other Place by elections on a separate roll and if necessary, and if possible, by their own people. That was what we had hoped. I know the hon. the Minister will say that on the other hand he is giving all adult male and female Coloureds in the Republic the vote; that he is giving them something they have never had before under this Government. But I think if the question were to be put to the Coloured people in the Transvaal and the Orange Free State what they would choose, representation in the Other Place by their own people on a separate roll, or representation in this Council by nine representatives, knowing what its powers will be, I have no doubt what their answer will be.</p>

<p>What is the position in respect of Natal&#x003F; They vote in Natal at the moment but there is no new registration; their political rights will disappear. We offer to restore them to the Common Roll. I cannot believe there can be any doubt in the minds of the Coloured people as to what they will choose when it comes to a choice of that kind. Then there are the Coloured women. What would their view be if they were asked throughout South Africa: Would you like to be on a Common Roll to vote for this council which may or may not be given legislative functions by the State President, this council where every Bill introduced must have the quasi-approval of the Minister, or would you prefer that your menfolk only should have the right to elect members of this Parliament on a Common Roll in the Cape and Natal and on a separate roll in the case of the Transvaal and the Free State for the Senate&#x003F; I have no doubt what <span class="col_5235-5236" refersTo="page_1310"/>their answer Would be. I have no doubt that their answer would be that they would prefer at least one section of the Coloured community to have real political rights instead of purely advisory rights of the kind envisaged in this council. [Interjections.] Hon. members ask &#x201C;For how long&#x003F;&#x201D; I do not believe for all time. I believe this that we have given an undertaking that we shall not change the political rights of the non-Whites otherwise than stated by us in our policy statement without reference to the public by way of a referendum or, a general election. What guarantee has that side of the House given&#x003F; And that. Sir is a matter for the future just as the hon. the Prime Minister thinks the question of the Coloured Representatives is a matter for the future.</p>

<p>There is another criticism. What happens if an educated man from the Cape Province moves to the north&#x003F; He has the vote here but if he goes to the Transvaal or the Free State he loses his right to vote for a Member of Parliament under the proposals we have made. But he gets the right to vote on a separate roll or to stand for election for the Other Place. What does he get under the proposals of the present Minister&#x003F; Under the Minister&#x2019;s proposals he loses his right to vote for these Coloured Representatives and what does he get in return&#x003F; A right to vote for representatives to that council. Put the choice before him and which one will he choose&#x003F; I have no doubt which he will choose. When I say the Coloured people do not want this Bill then I say the only way to put this matter to the test will be by way of a referendum of all the Coloured people in South Africa. And if the Minister is afraid to put it to all the Coloured people of South Africa let him put it to the registered voters amongst the Coloured people. The result will be the same. There will be no doubt whatever what that result will be. That is why I say this Bill is not wanted by the Coloured people and it is no good pretending that it is. I do not believe it is in their political interests. Above all, Sir, I do not believe it is in the political interests of the White man in South Africa; and I do not believe it is in the political interests of the White man because by moving in the direction in which the hon. the Minister is going, I believe, the White man is in danger of losing his greatest ally in South Africa, the Cape Coloured people.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The speech of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition really consisted of three parts. In the first part he dealt with particular clauses of this measure. Then he raised a couple of general complaints against the Bill and thirdly he came to the most interesting part, the effort to sell his federation policy in this House. I do not believe he achieved any success in that, and I do not believe he had any greater success outside. I should like to deal with his speech as he made it. He referred to something the hon. the Minister of Finance had said; namely that if there were to be a threat to our security from Black Nationalism, there will be 5,000,000 hearts that will beat like one. From that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition drew the inference that the Minister of Finance wished to break down all the colour barriers and wanted to build a united group of the Whites and the Coloureds in South Africa. That of course never was his intention. It has never been the intention to break down the colour barriers between the two groups and to make one group of them. The position has always been that if you are menaced you will have a good neighbour who will stand by you. The idea has always been that the Coloured man can be our good neighbour if he wants to share with us in the defence of the White people. He may then take his stand with us as a good neighbour, without being a henchman.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition says &#x201C;lesser powers&#x201D; are being given to this council than to the Transkei. There is no analogy at all between these two cases. The Xhosa in the Transkei have always enjoyed political rights as a separate group for the past century. They have their various councils under the various tribal chiefs. That developed during a century, and they have undergone that development as a separate group. The Coloureds have never yet undergone such separate development. Efforts have always been made to link them up with the Whites, but that has never proved a success. &#x201C;They have exercised political rights for a century.&#x201D; I admit that, but only a part of the Coloured community exercised political rights for a century, and as a part of another group and not as part of their own group. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also objects to the nominated members of this council. I do not think it is necessary even to reply to this again. Wherever constitutional rights are granted to a particular group, it is the custom to have nominated members, as a guide to those particular groups. Permit me to refer in this connection to what is now being done by Great Britain in Swaziland and Basutoland, In; both instances there are a large number of nominated members on those councils. It is nothing new in constitutional development; when you wish to develop a separate group, to have nominated members on that council.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition once again complained that the council will not enjoy any privileges. Such a great man as the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;or does he just imagine he is a great man&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>He is great; he does not imagine it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Let us assume he is a great man; but then, he must not come here and make such a foolish and senseless remark as to say there is no privilege. Of course there is privilege. But can you only debate and criticize if you defame&#x003F; The only thing against which they are met protected is defamation of officials, the Government and <span class="col_5237-5238" refersTo="page_1311"/>Government bodies. In those cases they do not enjoy privilege. One does not expect such a statement from a Leader of an Opposition. He behaved naively by saying they enjoy no privileges. He says they cannot criticize. Can one then criticize only be defaming&#x003F; These hon. members can no longer oppose; they can no longer criticize unless they defame. And if they cannot defame the Government, they defame the people of South Africa. They frequently do so in this House. Is that their conception of opposition&#x003F; Is that their conception of criticism, that they have to defame&#x003F; And when they are unable to defame anybody in this House, then they defame their country and their people in the eyes of foreign countries. That is the sum total of the Opposition we have here in South Africa; they can do nothing but slander and defame.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also made a remark in connection with the Coloured Representatives who will allegedly disappear now. The hon. the Minister. in charge of this Bill, and the hon. the Prime Minister have already given an assurance that there is no intention of abolishing these Coloured Representatives in this House. The assurance has been given, but that is not enough for the Leader of the Opposition. I shall tell the Leader of the Opposition what will abolish these hon. members: It is that if they continue to permit themselves to be taken in tow by an Opposition that sets about things in a negative way, like this Opposition we have to-day. That will abolish them in this House, and they will not be abolished by the Government, but by the Coloured people themselves.</p>

<p>I should like to mention some figures in this connection, Mr. Speaker. In 1948 there were about 48,000 Coloured voters on. the Voters&#x2019; Roll. That was in the days when the Opposition constantly went around registering Coloureds in order to win elections against their White opponents; those were the days when they ran schools for the Coloureds in the evenings, to teach them to sign their names. But since the Coloured vote no longer has any value for the Opposition, they no longer teach the Coloureds to sign their names, and they no longer register the Coloureds on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. In 1952 there were more than 1,000 in Caledon;. 1,300 in Hottentots-Holland, the constituency represented by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition at the time; almost 3,000 in Paarl. What do we find to-day, now that they no longer can be taken in tow by the United Party&#x003F; In 1958 there were 23,800 of those 48,000 left on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. At the present time there are only 9,800 left and. they have four representatives in this House. [Interjections.] No, we are not responsible for putting them there. If the Coloured man attaches any value to his right to vote for this House, he will see to it that he is registered on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, will he not&#x003F; That is what one must infer, and the inference is necessarily that he no; longer attaches value to that vote. That really proves the opposite of what the Leader of the Opposition said here this afternoon. He said the Coloureds do not want this Coloured council. If they had attached so much value to the Common Roll, they would not have had 9,800 voters on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, but there would have been 90,000, which is not the case.</p>

<p>Then the hon. the Leader of the Opposition asks: &#x201C;What does this Bill portend for the Coloured people&#x003F;&#x201D; I wish to say this only to that: I should like to put the negative side first. That is what this Bill does not portend for the Coloureds and in this connection I should like to read an article by a Coloured leader&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured leaders have learnt through bitter experience in the past that the United Party, and for that matter any White political party, was only out to use the Coloured people as their political football.</block>

<p>That is what this Act does not portend for the Coloureds. Mr. S. Dollie, a well-known member of the Malay group, says&#x2014;and this is what the Leader of the Opposition now offers them&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Common Voters&#x2019; Roll business went on from 1910 to 1963 when the Separate Representation of Voters Act freed the Coloured man from this menace. He was freed of "a menace because under the Common Roll system his vote was sold to a political party which gave nothing in return. Every five years at election&#x2019; time he was remembered. The only thing the party did was to create more and more Coloured leaders so as to make the bargaining cheaper. If asked whether we want to be in Parliament, our answer is certainly &#x201C;yes&#x201D; as long as our affairs are in the hands of the White Parliament.</block>

<p>Then he comes to this conclusion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But allow us to manage our own affairs and then we shall have no further interest in your Parliament.</block>

<p>I could quote further extracts to show you what this Act does not portend for the Coloureds. I should like to quote only what Mr. Schwartz said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The policy of the partial integration of the Coloured people &#x2026;;</block>

<p>That is what the Leader of the Opposition was advocating here this afternoon&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; which-has been the policy in this country for many years, has failed to bring the Coloured people any substantial benefits. it does not matter where you examine it&#x2014;in the political field or at civic level; the Coloured people are mostly treated like poor relations who must always be kept the background.</block>

<p><span class="col_5239-5240" refersTo="page_1312"/>That is what the Leader of the Opposition promises them.</p>

<p>I have a whole lot of similar extracts, things said by Coloureds about the system, and which are now advocated by the Leader of the Opposition. I have here a book to which reference has been made also, but which has never been quoted, namely the book of Mr. B. K. Long. I think it is as well for me to read a small extract from it&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured vote in the same constituency and on the same register as the White vote has been little but a sham all the years that it has existed. There is no future for it.</block>

<p>But that is the future the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is promising the Coloureds and which he advocated here again this afternoon. It is inconceivable why the does this.</p>

<p>The value of this Act may be judged from two angles. You may judge it from the angle of two philosophies. There is the one philosophy that man is a social being, that every human being only has value as a member of a group, the group from which he derives his language, his culture and his way of life. Every human being, once he is severed from that language, that culture and that way of life, actually loses his value. If he is not a member of a group, he becomes merely a number in a meaningless mass of human beings. That is the one philosophy. Then there is the other philosophy which is the converse, and that is namely that of the humanism which has since the war spread over the world like a bushfire, the humanism which is being propagated by the liberalists with all their might all day long, that idea of &#x201C;one world&#x201D; and &#x201C;one humanity&#x201D;. That is the other point of view one could adopt in respect of this Act. And that is what the liberalists and the United Party are trying to propagate from day to day. The debate on this measure has assumed the pattern which other debates also have assumed in this House, namely that the Opposition are not really trying to get something for the Coloureds because they are not interested in the Coloureds or in their group as such. They are interested in the &#x201C;one world idea&#x201D;; they are interested only in the idea of all being the same and equal. That is the point of view of the Opposition. That is what they are advocating here. They are not pleading for anything for the Coloured group as such. The Coloureds themselves in fact regard themselves as a separate group already. Mr. Fortein says in a statement that they already are a group, a representative group. He says this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In such a growing complexed struggle confusion and lack of direction on the part of the Coloured leaders was bound to occur. They invariably clung to the dead hand of the past. They lost sight of the fact that like the Afrikaner people the Coloured people had already developed into a new nation with its own distinct racial identity.</block>

<p>That, however, is not the only thing upon which I am basing my submission. There is other evidence of that. I should like to quote from the evidence given a few years ago before the Select Committee on the Separate Representation of Voters&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Q. You really wish to retain your own identity, and you wish to encourage your children to be proud of that and to honour it&#x003F;&#x2014;Yes, that is what I mean.</block>

<p>A Coloured person gave this evidence. Now I come to the Malays&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Q. You as Malays are very race con-, scious&#x003F;&#x2014;Yes.</block>

<block name="quote">Q. Your great desire expressed here by you is to preserve your own group unit&#x003F; Is that correct&#x003F;&#x2014;Yes.</block>

<p>That is the evidence given before that committee, but even the &#x201C;Coloured People&#x2019;s Organization&#x201D; of that time also gave evidence. The question was this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Did I understand you correctly, that you object to any measure seeking to treat the Coloureds as a separate identity, even when it is established to promote the particular interests of the Coloured community&#x003F;</block>

<p>This was the reply&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Yes, then one has no objection to it, in the sense that it ought not to be necessary.</block>

<p>Then he continues and says this on behalf of the Coloured People&#x2019;s Union&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured people are so diverse in origin, in economic attainment and individual characteristics that they cannot easily be classified.</block>

<p>But he adds this&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured people have no desire to be considered anything but as a distinct community. Their great desire is to make their own contribution to the nation of which they peculiarly are a part.</block>

<p>That is the Coloured People&#x2019;s National Union which surely cannot be regarded as well disposed to the Government. They also adopted the view that they are a separate group, their own group. Now, if you are a separate group, then you can only have value and attach value to it if that group is developed, and that is what this legislation seeks to do. It seeks to give this separate group their own pride, their own ideal for the future, and it aims at their development as a separate group, not as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition tries to suggest here, by saying that they are going to be only an advisory council. That was his principal criticism, that at the moment this Bill has no <span class="col_5241-5242" refersTo="page_1313"/>significance. But, Mr. Speaker, surely the hon. the Leader of the Opposition knows that as we are concerned here with a separate constitution for a separate group, that the first 1,000 paces surely begins at the first step, and the first step is being taken here and consequently, as we are now establishing this first stage of the development, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition surely cannot expect the final stage to be included in this legislation now already. Surely it is very unreasonable to expect that. Even in South Africa, as regards its own development and history, we did not write the final chapter, we did not draft a republican constitution when a settlement was established here under van Riebeeck. We did not get a republican constitution at that stage already. It was a process of evolution, of slow development, and that development has to have a starting point and here a serious and a good start is being made for this Coloured group as a group. I wish to emphasize this, as &#x201C;a group, separately&#x201D;.</p>

<p>I now come to the third criticism of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, in which he really stated his own policy, and I should like to dwell for a while upon their policy. What is the policy of the Opposition as stated here by them&#x003F; I have said before that they want to restore the Coloureds in the Cape to the common list. They want to return to all the evils in connection with which I have read certain quotations here. But if that is going to be the only constitutional say the Coloured man is going to get in South Africa, namely that there is going to be a Common Voters&#x2019; Roll, are they going to be satisfied with it&#x003F; That was a question put to him, and his reply was: &#x201C;Yes, they will be satisfied, and if they are not satisfied and the United Party consider there should be a change, they will hold a referendum.&#x201D; Now I should like to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition a few questions in this connection: Who is going to vote in that referendum he is going to hold&#x003F; Are the Coloureds going to vote with the Whites in that referendum&#x003F; And the second question is this: Which Coloureds&#x003F; Only the Coloureds who will then be on the Voters&#x2019; Roll, or will all the Coloureds have a vote to decide their own destiny&#x003F; Will all of them be eligible to vote&#x003F; Now the hon. the Leader of the Opposition does not reply.

<p>But that is what he asked for. He said their fate was being decided by that referendum, and that they might not wish to be taken out of the Commonwealth of Nations. He said the non-Whites of South Africa should have a joint say in that referendum. At that time we could not get the Leader of the Opposition to define which non-Whites should vote either. We should like him to tell us now, specifically, which non-Whites or which Coloureds will participate in the referendum they are envisaging.</p>

<speech by="#froneman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">FRONEMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. members persist with their referendum. If we were to hold a referendum at the present, time, there will be 9,000 Coloureds who will be able to participate on their own basis, the basis of the United Party as to who will be eligible to vote. On your basis there will be 9,000 Coloureds who will be eligible to vote, with the White people, on their future. The hon. members attach greater value to the 9,000 Coloureds than to the 900,000 Coloureds in the country.</p>

<p>I say therefore that the statement of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition, that the Coloureds prefer his policy to that of the Government, is completely without foundation. He sucks it out of his thumb, for the evidence available at the present time actually proves the opposite.</p>

<p>What this Bill portends for the Coloureds, is that they may have a great future. I should just like to take you back for a moment to 1948, when we had the system now advocated by the United Party. At that time it was said i.a. in a pamphlet of the United Party, that if the Nationalists were to come into power, the Coloureds would hot have homes, that they would be enslaved and they would be squeezed into a Native compound. That was a pamphlet published by the United Party here in the Western Cape in 1948, to induce the Coloureds to vote for them. But what have the coloureds received under this regime&#x003F; Where are the Natives compounds into which they have been, squeezed&#x003F; On the, contrary, great housing schemes. Have been &#x2019;tackled where the Coloureds are now treated h community They are making great progress in the field of local Government. They have started to regain their own pride and their own value, and through this legislation they will now be getting, constitutionally, their own value and their own significance, because they will then be serving their own group.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Normally I would not have thought of wasting any of my limited time in this debate to deal with the questions raised by the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman). But as he has in the course of his speech used some statements purporting to come from certain Coloured people, I feel constrained very briefly to deal with him. Before I do that, however, I want to deal with the final assertion made by the hon. member when he said, that during the past three weeks he has not been able to find any protest emanating from any Coloured people in the Press against this Bill. I do not know what Press the hon. member for Heilbron reads, but if he had read any of the English language papers in Cape Town, he would have observed a host of protests coming from Coloured people against this measure. I have not got the time to deal with the whole lot of them, but I want to refer to one of them which speaks in succinct language and which reflects the views of the Coloured people This was written on the 16th of this month, and it is headed &#x201C;The Cape Coloured Community&#x2019;s Humiliation&#x201D;. &#x201C;Botha&#x2019;s Bill is the Final Insult.&#x201D; It says here that&#x2014; &#x2019;</p>

<p>The Coloured Representative Council Bill is the final insult, the final humiliation, the total rejection of the Coloured community as an integral part of the South African nation.</p>

<p>This is typical of many letters of protest that had been written by responsible Coloured leaders giving the Coloured people&#x2019;s reaction to the Bill.</p>

<p>I want to leave that because unfortunately one is limited in one&#x2019;s time in this debate. I want to deal with another aspect. The hon. member for Heilbron had the temerity to tell the hon. Leader of the Opposition in effect that he had no right to speak in criticism of this Bill because one Mr. Tom Swarts, the chairman of the Council for Coloured Affairs, could speak in the name of the Coloured people and he supported this Bill Now let m&#x00E9; read what Mi. Tom Swartz said in relation to this Bill and I am quoting now from the <i>Banier</i>&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Tom Swartz, chairman of the Council for Coloured Affairs, called for more real power for the proposed expanded council in. his opening address to the council. &#x201C;We are hoping,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;that the proposed expansion or the Council for Coloured Affairs will in some measure meet. the aspirations of the Colourd people and compensate them for their loss of political status in the <span class="col_5245-5246" refersTo="page_1315"/>body. politic of the country, and that the expanded council will exercise some real power in the conduct of their own affairs&#x201D;.</block>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Where in this Bill does the Government compensate the Coloured people for their loss of political status in the body politic of this country&#x003F; That is the answer to this Bill and that is the answer that comes from the mouth of the man, Tom Swartz, who is quoted by the hon. member in support of this measure! There is another point of the hon. member&#x2019;s speech with which I should like to deal but I will do that in the course of my speech, and that is the support which the hon. member thinks he is getting from Mr. Fortein. With that I shall deal in a moment. At this stage I wish to record my final protest at the passing of this Bill. I cannot see this Bill as being anything other than, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition quite rightly said, an additional apartheid measure which must have the inevitable effect of widening the gap which unfortunately exists between the Coloureds and the Whites of the country. This Bill under the pretext of creating a Coloured Parliament really does nothing of the sort. It falls very far short of the glowing promises made by the hon. the Prime Minister to the Coloured people when he first adumbrated his scheme of a &#x201C;State within a State&#x201D;. The Bill does nothing more than establish a new council which will have no powers whatsoever worth speaking of. This I say advisedly. Any impartial man who examines the contents of this Bill must conclude that it confers upon the Coloured people no powers worth speaking of and certainly, by no stretch of imagination, measures up to what the chairman of the present council asked for, i.e. real power &#x201C;to compensate them for the loss of political, status in the body politic of this country&#x201D;, and &#x201C;to deal with the conduct of their own affairs&#x201D;. The Government might just as well have left the present council in existence and have extended it$ powers by means of an, administrative edict. Parliament&#x2019;s time would then not have been wasted by having to consider this measure.</p>

<p>This Bill can, to my mind, serve no real useful purpose and cannot, with any stretch of imagination, be regarded as creating a Parliament in the real sense of that word. All that will happen under this Bill is that a larger number of members will get together on the council with power to discuss such matters as the Government will allow them to discuss but without being able in any way to give effect to any decision they may arrive at as a result of their discussions. This Bill has already been stigmatised, as I quoted here this afternoon from opinions expressed by prominent Coloured people themselves, as the final insult to the Coloured population. What is the gravamen of my objection to this Bill is that it will create the unfortunate impression in the minds of our Coloured people that the Coloured community has now been finally rejected as an integral part of the South African nation. That is the unfortunate impression that is going to be created by this measure.</p>

<p>I am quite sure that despite everything the hon. the Minister has had to say about this Bill, despite the fact that he has assured this House that the Bill has received the unanimous approval of the present council, despite all the canvassing which was done in the Department and in Government circles for Coloured support of this Bill, despite all this I am-certain&#x2014;and here I agree wholeheartedly with the Leader of the Opposition&#x2014;that if a referendum were to be held amongst our Coloured people, the overwhelming majority would unquestionably reject the Bill <i>in toto.</i></p>

<p>That ought to be the test.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, that is the test. And if the hon. member for. Heilbron is so certain that this Bill has the backing of the Coloured people, why not put it then to them&#x003F; Why not put it to them so that they can determine whether they are prepared to accept it as compensation for the grievous insult they have suffered by being deprived of their political status in this country&#x003F;</p>

<p>Time does not permit me to deal with the claim made by Government supporters, i.e. that the continuance of the Common Roll has led to great bitterness between the Coloured people and a large section of the Whites of this country. I say this claim is completely devoid of all truth because until 1948 there existed a spirit of respect and goodwill on the part of the Coloured people towards the Whites. There was also a peaceful co-existence which even agitators&#x2014;and there were many communist agitators&#x2014;could not upset. Since 1948, however, Mr. Speaker, as a result of the multitude of discriminatory laws which have been passed against the Coloured people, there has been a rapid deterioration in race relations. Barriers have been created with the effect that year after year and session after session our Coloured people were further being alienated from us. These unfortunate barriers which have been created and which are being allowed to continue unchecked, even in this Bill, will to my mind create the unfortunate impression amongst the Coloured people that they have now been finally and totally rejected as an integral part of the South African nation. I repeat that this Bill-has been rejected by every responsible section of the Coloured &#x201C;community.&#x201D; But I want to go even further. I want to say that there was a time when the views which we front this side-of the House have expressed in relation to this <span class="col_5247-5248" refersTo="page_1316"/>measure, were supported by the hon. the Minister himself. In this connection I want to quote from a statement which the hon. the Minister himself made in 1957, i.e. before he assumed the elevated position of Minister for Coloured Affairs and still was the M.P. for George. In the latter capacity he contributed an article to the <i>Kruithoring</i> in which he said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">It will be stupid to regard separate representation as the solution to the poor relations between Nationalist Afrikaners and the Coloured people &#x2026; The Afrikaner must take stock of his own attitude, must decide whether his own prejudices are still justified, and whether he is prepared to scorn the potential alliance of a million Coloured people &#x2026; For the Afrikaners and the Coloured people comprise two national groups which should be united by bonds of culture, religion, language and manner of living.</block>

<p>These were the views he expressed &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#bloomberg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BLOOMBERG</person>:</from>

<p>I know, but these are the views the Minister held in 1957, i.e. that the Coloured people should be united with the Whites by bonds of &#x201C;culture, religion, language and manner of living&#x201D;. May I ask the Minister to explain to this House how the Coloured people can be united with the White by bonds of &#x201C;culture, religion, language and manner of living&#x201D; and at the same time be regarded as a separate group&#x003F;</p>

<p>But there is another claim made by the hon. the Minister as well as by his supporters with which I should like to deal, namely that this Bill has received the unanimous approval of the Union Council for Coloured Affairs. In this connection I want to read to the House, so that it can go on record, a resolution which was passed after this Bill was published and after it had been seen by the council for the first time. The resolution reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That in view of the fact that councillors were not provided with printed copies of the Bill to constitute a representative council for the Coloured people of South Africa, the council agrees that a deputation be appointed to discuss with the Minister various aspects of the Bill which were not brought to the notice of the council when the special meeting of the council was called on 24 February 1964.</block>

<p>I should like to ask the Minister whether or not he has received this deputation&#x003F; I have every reason to believe that he has refused to see this deputation and that he has, consequently, refused them to ventilate their grievances in regard to this measure. The resolution went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The members of the council feel alarmed at the restrictions placed on the contemplated new council with regard to the initiation of legislation which may have a direct bearing on the interests and desires of the Coloured group.</block>

<p>These then are the terms of a specific resolution which was adopted by the present council. It states that they feel alarmed at the restrictions which it is proposed to place on the new council in regard to the initiation of legislation. Has the Minister done anything at all to meet the complaints, the legitimate complaints, lodged against this Bill by the members of the present council&#x003F; Up to the present we have not heard a single word of how the Minister proposes to deal or has dealt with these objections. Let me now ask the Minister whether he, in the light of the terms of this resolution which stands on record, still wishes to contend that this Bill has been approved by the present council&#x003F; I think this House is entitled to have from the Minister a reply to these serious allegations.</p>

<p>I was here and I heard the answer. But I say that that in no way measures up to the terms of the resolution I have read. I was here, right throughout the debate, and heard everything the Minister said. So how can the Minister possibly explain this resolution which states that councillors were not provided with copies of the Bill and that they were alarmed at the restrictions to be placed on the new council in connection with the initiation of new legislation&#x003F; How can the Minister reconcile the terms of this resolution with the statement he has made and has allowed his supporters to make, i.e. that this measure received the unanimous approval of the present council&#x003F; Therefore I say that this House is entitled to hear from the hon. the Minister his explanation of the way in which he can reconcile his version to the version of the present council as outlined in this resolution.</p>

<p>There is another matter with which I should like to deal. The hon. the Minister himself has used in this House, and has allowed other hon. members on his side including the hon. member for Heilbron this afternoon to use, a published statement by Mr. Fortein in support of this Bill. Now I should like to ask the Minister the simple question, i.e. how he can sit in this House and allow this published statement from Mr. Fortein to be utilized when the Minister all the time had in his possession a letter from Mr. Fortein in which he protests against the terms of this Bill after he had seen it&#x003F; The Minister has that letter and I was given to understand that Mr. Fortein, who is one of the leading lights in the present council and upon whose statements the Government relies for support, has received the following reply to his protest:</p>

<block name="quote"><span class="col_5249-5250" refersTo="page_1317"/>As a teacher in the employ of this Department you are expected and required to use the recognized channels of communication. Failure to comply with this procedure in future will be viewed in a serious light.</block>

<p>This is the reply he received from the Secretary for Coloured Affairs and is the only one received by him. Now, this is the reply this man has received from the Minister&#x2019;s Department, a man upon whose Press statement the Minister and every member who has spoken so far rely for support! This is the letter he received when he wrote, protesting against the provisions of this Bill. Now I want to ask how the hon. the Minister can sit in this House and allow his followers to utilize Fortein&#x2019;s statement when the Minister all the time had in his possession a letter from Mr. Fortein in which he protests against this Bill&#x003F; I also want to ask the hon. the Minister how he can justify this threatening and intimidating reply which this well-respected Coloured man, a professional man received&#x003F; I will tell you who he is. He is the principal of the Mount Currie High School at Kokstad. He holds the degree of Bachelor of Arts. He is a member of the Union Council of Coloured Affairs, and he is also a member of the executive committee of that council, and he is also chairman of the Coloured People&#x2019;s Organization, as well as chairman of the Coloured people&#x2019;s section of the B.E.S.L. This man writes protesting against the Bill. He says he would never have written this article in the <i>Banier</i> if he had known the contents of the Bill, and all he gets is this peremptory and cheeky reply to his normal protest against this Bill. I think the Minister owes it to the House and to the country to explain how he can allow this state of affairs to continue.</p>

<p>How can the Minister reconcile his statement in this House With the fact that the Coloured council has now declared publicly their sense of shock at the contents of the present Bill and the enormous restrictions which have been placed on this new council&#x003F; Those restrictions were never explained. Another thing in regard to which I think the Minister owes an explanation to the House is this. How can the Minister reconcile his claim that the provisions of Clause 29, which deals with the powers the Minister has to extend the period of office of any member of the council&#x2014;how can he reconcile his first explanation in this House, when I raised the subject for the first time, that this Was due to the drafting of the law advisers, with all his subsequent explanations given during the course of the debate&#x003F; When he was tackled by members on this side it appeared clearly that this was his own calculated intention which was never explained to the council. The House and the country are entitled to have satisfactory replies and I can only hope that during the course of his reply to the third reading, the Minister will give us those replies.</p>

<p>Sir, I was struck very forcibly the other day by a considered statement presented by the Government to the International Labour Organization. In that statement it was claimed that it was not South Africa&#x2019;s intention to maintain discrimination for all time, but that it was merely a matter of evolution. Those are the words used in that statement. How can the Government possibly explain this Bill in the light of that statement&#x003F; Can one imagine anything more designed to maintain discrimination and to keep people apart than this Bill&#x003F; In the Bill the Government is establishing a so-called parliament, entirely separate and distinct from he White Parliament of this country. Surely nothing can be more designed, and designed more carefully, than this Bill for maintaining and perpetuating discrimination against our Coloured people. Instead of bringing the Coloured people closer to us, this Bill reinforces the Government&#x2019;s policy of apartheid and perpetuates the strong intention of discriminating against our Coloured people and rejecting them as part of the integral population of South Africa. No, I am convinced that in addition to all the grave shortcomings of this Bill we would be doing our country incalculable harm by trying to establish a sectional form or system of legislature. If the Government really wants to do the honest and decent thing by the Coloured people, and if it really wants to restore South Africa&#x2019;s image in the outside world to the wonderful one that existed some 15 years ago, the Government should restore to the Coloured people their common franchise rights as ordinary citizens of this country, and enable them to be directly represented in this Central Parliament as full citizens of South Africa in common with their fellow Whites, in terms of what the hon. the Minister himself said in 1957 and which I read out to the House this afternoon. This Bill can only have the effect of perpetuating the status of our Coloured people as second-rate citizens in their own country. It is indeed a poor substitute for common citizenship and participation which our Coloured citizens are entitled to in the Central Government and local governments of their own country. If the Government intends to ensure racial harmony, it should avoid at all costs sectional systems of legislation. Surely the ideal for which all of us are striving is to obtain from all our citizens a common loyalty to the Republic. This is absolutely essential if we want to attain and retain racial harmony, but to my mind this sectional system of legislation can only lead to the destruction of that common loyalty and can only result in more friction between the Coloured people and ourselves. For all these reasons I propose to vote against the third reading of this Bill.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg), in a very theatrical manner, referred to various letters he had receiv&#x00EB;d from &#x201C;responsible Coloured leaders&#x201D;, as he called them, letters which appeared in the Press, and in which they protested against this legislation. It so happens that I have a number of clippings of what the leaders, to whom he has referred, have said. In the first place I wish to refer to one of the leaders he has referred to, Mr. Tom Swartz. In this connection he referred to what the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) had said. I want to read the following from the first edition or the <i>Banier</i> of April 1964, in other words, after this Bill had been made public and after those leaders had had it at their disposal&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Mr. Tom Swartz, Chairman of the Council for Coloured Affairs, said in his opening address that while the proposed legislative powers of the new council appear to be severely restricted &#x2026; perhaps wisely so for a beginning, the extension of the franchise to all Coloured men and women over the age of 21 years throughout the whole Republic would certainly be an important achievement.</block>

<p>This is definitely in conflict with what the hon. member has said. He also referred to Mr. Fortein. I have two other clippings from the same publication the <i>Banier,</i> the second edition of January. Under the heading &#x201C;New Opportunities for Self-realization&#x201D;, Mr. Fortein says the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Each Coloured person must be regarded as a worthy end in himself. The policy of the positive parallel development of the Coloureds with the Whites generally aims at establishing good race relations and encouraging a genuine spirit of mutual respect and trust which must lead to harmony and co-operation.</block>

<p>His whole article is devoted to that. The same councillor writes the following in the <i>Banier</i> of April 1964, under the heading &#x201C;Let us Co-operate with the Government&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">South Africa must accept the sound and statesmanlike policy of encouraging gradual, positive evolution to freedom for all the racial groups in the country &#x2026;. The present policy of positive parallel development for the Whites and Coloured people in South Africa is a great challenge to our leaders.</block>

<p>How do you reconcile that with the allegations dished out to us by the hon. member concerning those leaders&#x003F; In any case, Sir, I supipose there are different groups of leaders. There are amongst others, the self-appointed leaders amongst the Coloureds, that group of people who do not want to promote the interests of their own people but whd&#x2019; always threaten to break through the colour bar to the Whites. I do believe there are some of those amongst those and the previous speaker must have been referring to them.</p>

<p>I wish to return to the United Party. The United Party can be accused of various things, but there is one thing they cannot be accused of, and that is that their policy and their actions are logical, particularly as far as their colour policy is concerned. Not so long ago, in connection with the Bantu legislation, we had the phenomenon that the United Party was prepared to oppose that legislation to the bitter end. They wanted to do that in the second reading. We then reached the Committee Stage and the hon. Leader himself introduced the Committee Stage and said they would not propose any amendments. We now have the phenomenon that the same party which opposed the legislation before us at the second reading moved a whole series of amendments in the Committee Stage. That is the logic we get from the Opposition. During the second reading they condemned this legislation as being without any force, as being a bluff and as being useless. However, we know why that party has moved amendments in the Committee Stage. It has penetrated the minds of the Opposition that this legislation is of particular importance and that it will play an important role in the political and constitutional future of the Coloureds and the Opposition may perhaps try in future to make political capital out of it. Logically we could have expected the Opposition not only to criticize the legislation but to give us an assessment of their own policy. But except for a few remarks here and there the Opposition remained quiet, yes, as quiet as the Sphinx. In this connection the policy of the Opposition is, in the first place, without any logic, and, in the second place, anomalies dominate that policy, and thirdly, discrimination is blatantly applied under their policy. We have read the policy of the Opposition in this Guide to Better Race Relationship in which they say, as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition again said this afternoon, that when they come into power they will restore the Coloureds to the Common Voters&#x2019; Roll. We have already often asked them which Coloureds they Will restore to the Common Roll, the 9,000 to whom the hon. member for Heilbron has referred, or are they going to place other qualified Coloureds on it&#x003F; To what qualifications must the people they are going to put on the Common Roll comply&#x003F; We have not yet had any answers to these questions, and we trust that when the hon. member for Gardens, who is apparently going to be the next speaker, gets up he will provide us with the replies,. We want to know whether mew voters will be added art what their qualifications will be. We have already disked them whether they are going to put: the Coloured women on that roll. The Leader of the Opposition told us a <span class="col_5253-5254" refersTo="page_1319"/>moment ago that that would not be the case. We have at least had that reply but it was accompanied by a very peculiar argument which I could not understand at all. We on this side of the House are perhaps not sufficiently intelligent to understand that type of argument of the hon. the deader. I cannot understand for what reason they do not want to place the Coloured women on the Common Roll. We want to know this: Are they going to allow the Coloureds who will get on the Common Roll to become members of the United Party&#x003F; As far as I know a Coloured person cannot join the United Party. Those who are members will remain however &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#otto">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OTTO</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, I referred to that in my second-reading speech and perhaps the hon. member for Gardens can tell us more about that episode. We on this side of the House maintain that the United Party is trying to pull wool over the eyes of the Coloureds. I maintain that no Coloured person can be elected to this House under the present policy of the United Party, not even under the new policy they have announced, firstly, because there are so few of them that if they have to fight a party nomination against a White United Party member they would lose. I say that is a big bluff on the part of the United Party and the Coloured leaders are wise to it. Their eyes have opened and I want to quote from a letter written in the <i>Burger</i> of 28 April 1964 by one J. G. Forbes. I think the hon. member for Gardens will know him because he lives in Beaufort West. He is convener of the Karoo Voters Association, Extension 5, Beaufort West. The hon. member now has the full address if he wishes to go into the matter. I do not have the telephone number at the moment. This Mr. Forbes writes as follows. He extends his hearty congratulations to the Government and Minister P. W. Botha on the Coloured Persons Representative Council Act&#x201D; and he writes&#x2014;</p>

<p>It shows once again that the Government means it well with us Coloureds.</p>

<p>He is also a leader because he is a convener. He goes on&#x2014;</p>

<p>When the JJnited Party was in power it was not so much concerned about the interets of, the Coloureds as about the vote of the Coloureds, those Coloured votes which had to keep the party in power. After every election the Coloureds with all their problems were stored away in the lumber storeroom of the United Party until the next election. &#x2026; There are still some within our ranks who have to be guided. They are the people the United Party use to disseminate their propaganda. I appeal to those Coloureds who can see and think for themselves to draw the attention of the less enlightened and less privileged Coloureds to these facts.</p>

<p>The same councillor, Mr. Fortein, to whom the hon. member for Peninsula referred a moment ago, also wrote about the position which obtained when the United Party was still in power and when the United Party could still derive benefit from the Coloured vote. He writes&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Our cherished vote only had some importance at general election times. Then it was artificially inseminated to swell White political party seats in a privileged White Parliament. So it lost its significance as it did not bring to the Coloured masses general prosperity, progress and happiness. Our socio-economic position remained in the political doldrums.</block>

<p>That is sufficient evidence against that party as to how they acted in the past.</p>

<p>However, I now wish to deal with the Coloureds in the Transvaal and the Free State. As a Transvaler I am naturally much more interested in that portion of the Coloured policy of the Opposition which relates to the Transvaal. The Opposition say in this pamphlet of theirs that the Coloureds will be represented in terms of a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll. In other words, they too are going to have a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll in the Transvaal and the Free State. I want to know whom they will allow to vote on that separate roll&#x003F; Are they also going to allow the Coloured women in those provinces to vote&#x003F; But in the Transvaal and in the Free State they will be placed on a separate roll and they will be represented in the Senate by their own people if they prefer that. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us just now that if educated Coloureds went to the Transvaal it would probably be possible to elect all of them as Senators. We find that in terms of the United Party policy&#x2014;this shows how inconsistent and illogical they are and how they discriminate&#x2014;the Coloureds in the Transvaal are politically too immature to vote for a member of the House of Assembly, but they can vote for a politically immature Senator. What nonsense, what discrimination! I said in the second reading that the-average Coloured person in the Transvaal did not only maintain a higher standard of living because he as <span class="col_5255-5256" refersTo="page_1320"/>economically better Off but that in the educational field he had also reached a higher level than the average Coloured in the Cape Province. I base my statement on the fact that 89 per cent of the Coloureds in the Transvaal live in the cities where there are better opportunities for employment. Because I had a great deal to do with Coloured affairs on the Pretoria City Council I know there is no unemployment worth mentioning amongst them. In the Cape Province only 60 per cent of the Coloureds live in the urban centres and 40 per cent on the platteland. Surely it is clear that the educational facilities for a small group, like the group in the Transvaal, ought to be better than for a large group. We know the Coloureds in the Transvaal have better educational facilities than those on the platteland of the Cape Province. We also know that the Coloureds of the Transvaal constitute a more homogenous group. Most of them have come from the Western Province whereas the Coloureds of the Cape Province are a heterogenous group consisting of Malays, Cape Coloureds and descendants of the old Hottentots and of the Griquas. That is why I say the standard of living of the Coloureds in the Transvaal is higher.</p>

<p>I now come to another point. Not only are those people who maintain a higher standard of living and who are better educated discriminated against but they are also discriminated against in another respect. As far as the Bantu are concerned the United Party&#x2019;s policy is that for the time being they can be represented in this Parliament by eight White representatives but the Leader of the Opposition said he would rather see eight Bantu in this House than that there should be eight Bantustans. Just look at this discrimination. Sir. The Coloureds who are more advanced in the Transvaal and in the Free State may not vote for a member of this House but the Bantu of the Transvaal and Free State, together with the Bantu in the rest of the Republic, may vote for eight members of the House of Assembly. Have you ever heard of greater discrimination&#x003F;</p>

<p>In the past the United Party have never really been interested in the vote of the Coloured people in the north because they could not use those votes; the Coloured vote could not win seats for them in the north. They were also afraid they might lose the support of some of their party members in the northern provinces and that was why they have never yet dared to advocate that the Coloured franchise should be extended to the northern provinces.</p>

<p>By opposing this legislation the United Party is once again following its well-known policy of trying to wriggle out of things when serious legislation is under discussion. They oppose the legislation for selfish motives only and in order to make political capital out of it. What is more, the United Party is trying to hide its political bankruptcy behind its opposition to this Bill, and to postpone its complete insolvency indefinitely. This pathetic performance by the United Party does not only harm the party&#x2014;I do not care two hoots about that&#x2014;but the trouble is that it does not promote the welfare and progress of the Coloured community as a whole; it clouds the thinking of some Coloured leaders and is not conducive to furthering the good relationships (which already exist between White and Coloured.</p>

<speech by="#oonnan">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">OONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>It is seldom that I have heard a member blow off so much steam as the hon. member for Heilbron (Mr. Froneman) did this afternoon. Methinks he protested too much, and I think all the vehemence and the steam we heard was only to cover up his uneasiness about this Bill. I think he is most unhappy. He made several points and I should like to refer to some of them. According to him, the Coloured man will be an &#x201C;agterryer&#x201D; of the White man, in terms of our policy. Sir, that is not so. The Coloured man will have his rightful place in this country alongside the White man. We will free him from job reservation. We will give him his place where his dignity is restored to him. He also made the point that the Leader of the Opposition had said that according to this representative council they are getting much less than the Transkei Legislative Council got. Of course they are getting less, and the fact that he says that those are the Bantu and these are the Coloureds has nothing to do with the matter. This Bill provides very much less for that section of the community which is far more advanced and civilized than that other section. One is sorry that with all this vehemence he stooped to belittle the Leader of the Opposition by saying that he is trying to be a big man. That is not worthy of him and we will not take any notice of it. He makes the point that we on this side of the House do nothing but &#x201C;belaster die Regering en belaster die volk van Suid-Afrika&#x201D;. Sir, we on this side of the House have the interests of all the peoples of this country at heart more than any other party, and we have proved that in the past; we have fought for our country and we have done everything we can to promote the welfare of our country and our people. The hon. member tried to suggest that if the Coloured Representatives ever disappear from this House it will be at the request of the Coloured voters themselves. Let me say at once that the elections have not proved that. The elections have not proved that the Coloured people are at all prepared to vote for anybody who leans towards the Nationalist Party. Those candidates who have stood as independents and who have been Nationalist have mostly lost their deposits. Once the Coloureds found out that a candidate was a Nationalist he was immediately rejected. His point was that in 1948 there were 48,000 Coloured people on the Common Roll and that there are now only 10,000. He says that that shows that the Coloureds are not interested in the <span class="col_5257-5258" refersTo="page_1321"/>Coloured Representatives. Sir, it shows nothing of the sort. Large numbers of them are completely dissatisfied with the Government&#x2019;s policy of taking them off the roll. That is why they are not re-registered. Secondly, the Government has made it almost impossible for a Coloured man to become registered. The hon. member makes great play of B. K. Long&#x2019;s book. Sir, I know that the hon. member is not an admirer of Mr. B. K. Long, yet he quotes the one point in Mr. Long&#x2019;s book which he finds suits his book. The hon. member is an admirer of the late General Hertzog and the late Dr. Malan and I would have expected him therefore to have quoted their views on this question as well.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Pretoria (East) (Dr. Otto) has read out several letters here from what he called fairly prominent Coloured people to show that they support this Bill. I think the attitude of the Coloured people is proved clearly by the fact, as the hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) said, that they sent a deputation to the Minister because they were not satisfied with the Bill. Sir, during the course of the speech of the hon. member for Pretoria (East), the hon. the Minister referred by way of interjection to a debacle that took place at Beaufort West. I do not know whether he was referring to the conference that took place there or what he was referring to.</p>

<p>As I say, there was complete unanimity and the spirit which was exhibited there augers ill for the Nationalist Party.</p>

<p>Sir, we have also heard how our friends on the other side sometimes interpret our policy. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (North) (Mr. J. A. F. Nel) tried to suggest the other day that large numbers of Coloured people could form a block in this Parliament, according to our policy, and he went on to say that the Bantu could elect eight Bantu to sit in this House. Where he finds that I do not know because our policy distinctly provides that there must be eight White people. He tries to make out that according to our Federation policy the Coloureds will be a separate group. Sir, the Coloureds will not be a separate group; they will be on the Common Roll with the White people in this country. There is no doubt as to what our policy is; it is stated in perfectly clear terms for anybody who cares to read it.</p>

<p>Sir, at this stage of the Bill I want to say at once that there are very few people who want this Bill. It is not wanted by the United Party; it is not wanted by 48 per cent of the White electorate in this country; it is not wanted by the Coloured Representatives in this House and they represent the vast majority of the Coloured electorate in this country. It is not wanted by the Coloured people, it is only wanted by the Nationalist Party and they want it simply to enable them to apply their policy of separate development one step further to the Coloured people in order to achieve their so-called &#x201C;state within a state&#x201D;. Despite everything that has been said, this Bill remains the penultimate step in the ultimate denial to the Coloured people of their traditional rights as a political appendage of the White man in South Africa. The ultimate step, as my leader has rightly said, will be the removal from this House of the four Coloured Representatives who sit here to-day. I want to say at once that I accept the assurances given by the hon. the Prime Minister and the hon. the Minister of Coloured Affairs that it is not their intention to do away with Coloured representation in this House, but I still say that ultimately they will go. The passing of this Bill will inevitably bring about their ultimate removal from this House if the Nationalist Party remains in power long enough. You, see, Mr. Speaker, a man&#x2019;s political heirs and successors, when faced with assurances given by him which conflict with the logical consequences of the very policies laid down by him, tend to discard the assurances and follow the policies. This Bill means the political emasculation of the Coloured Representatives here in Parliament, because its whole policy <span class="col_5259-5260" refersTo="page_1322"/>direction is to leave them without any force or effectiveness. The Government has no use for them and will by-pass them whenever they can. That is, of course, perfectly in line with Government policy, which is entirely opposed to any &#x201C;mixed&#x201D; legislative body, that is, a legislative body consisting of the representatives of White and non-White races sitting together. And once the Coloured Representatives have been politically emasculated by the passing of this Bill, will not that very fact be used to move for their abolition&#x003F; I fear that inevitably it will. Sir, the Transkei Legislative Council is a council which represents the Bantu only. The tens of thousands of Europeans or Coloured people" there have no representation in the Transkei Legislative Council. Under this Bill only the Coloured people will be represented on this new council. Under the policy of this Government I expect that in the near future they will establish a similar council for the Indians in this country. I think that is a logical conclusion to be drawn from their policy.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">CONNAN</person>:</from>

<p>I am dealing with the policy. They will establish a council for the Indians identical to this council but there will be the difference that the Indians will not have representation in this Parliament like the Coloured people. I am quite certain that the policy of this Government will be and must be to remove the representatives of the Coloured people from this House as soon as they find it practicable to do so. One asks oneself why they still keep the Coloured Representatives here-, why is it their intention to keep them here&#x003F; I think it is because they are afraid of the Coloured people themselves. They are afraid that if they remove the Coloured Representatives, the Coloured people will regard that as the last straw and that they will never again believe the White man. I think it is because they feel that the outside world will kick up such a row that they are afraid to remove them from this House, and I think they are also afraid of many Nationalists who would be entirely against it. It is for those reasons and those reasons alone that they keep the Coloured Representatives in this House.</p>

<p>Sir, this Bill is a bad Bill and it has bad features. We on this side move an amendment that the Bill be read this day six months, and let me just say in passing that &#x201C;this day six months&#x201D; means that we do not want a postponement so that we can get advice in the interim, as suggested by the Minister.

We have done our best to try to improve a very bad Bill. This Coloured Council, if the Minister had accepted some of our amendments, would have been at least a little more democratic in its structure and functions; as it stands now it holds the ill promise of being used simply as the Minister&#x2019;s instrument. In all these circumstances, and for the reasons given, we are opposed to this Bill and We are going to vote against it at the third reading.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) and other hon. members opposite who spoke before him have on various occasions objected to this Bill because they allege that it offers less to the Coloureds than the Transkei constitution offers to the inhabitants of the Transkei. I cannot understand their logic in respect of this matter at all. We have already on various occasions said in this House that those two cases were, in the first place, not analogous at all. I myself tried to explain that in my second-reading speech. But there is another angle of that objection I wish to refer to and it is this. The main objection of the Opposition to this Bill is really being met to a great extent by fact that we give the Coloureds less in this legislation than we give the Bantu in the Transkei. The objection of that side of the House is that under our policy we do not take the Coloureds with us, but at the same time they want to compare the council of the Coloureds with that of the Transkei. Although they say the Coloureds should be treated on an equal basis as the Whites they say we must give the Coloureds what we have given the Transkei. But if we gave the Coloureds what we gave the Transkei we would be directing them completely away from the Whites.</p>

<p>If the hon. member for Salt River (Mr. Timoney) thinks it is a weak argument I am afraid I cannot give him the brains to understand it. Whether hon. members on that side of the House want to admit it or not the fact of the matter is that in the case of the Transkei a geographically separate portion of the country was given to the Bantu, an area in which it is envisaged they will ultimately enjoy complete political independence. Politically that really amounts to this that those people have been completely removed from the White section.

The very reason why we do not give the Coloureds what we give the Natives is because we know the Coloured people are much closer to the White community The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) quoted what the hon. the Minister said in 1957. We still say that today. We still say to-day that the Coloureds have the same way of life as we have; they dress the way we dress; they eat the food we eat; they speak our language. [Interjections.] Hon. members will get an opportunity of speaking. I am not trying to hurt them. I am only trying to advance arguments and if they do not agree with me they can get up at a later stage and say so, but I would ask them please to give me an opportunity of making my speech. We admit the Coloureds are much closer to the Whites and for that very reason we do not want to give them a Transkei; for that very reason we provide them with their own representatives in this House. While I am on this subject I just want to say this to the hon. member for Gardens: The hon. member says the disappearance of the Coloured Representatives from this House will be an inevitable consequence of this legislation.

<p>No, I am asking that hon. member. I shall be pleased if he would say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; to that question. Does he believe the Government envisages the disappearance of the Coloured Representatives from this House&#x003F; The hon. member does not want to say &#x201C;yes&#x201D; nor does he want to say &#x201C;no&#x201D;. In that case I take it he does not believe it is our intention to remove them. Surely he must believe either the one or the other. It is either the intention of the Government to keep the Coloured Representatives here or it is the intention of the Government of removing them at some time or other in the future. I think hon. members opposite ought to be satisfied at this stage with the assurances they have had from the Government. The Prime Minister has asked them in this House whether they want him to give them the assurance that it will never happen in all eternity. One day when we are all dead and a brand new House has been constituted, that House may decide differently; we cannot bind a future House to-day. Let us have clarity as far as that point is concerned. We cannot bind future legislators in this House. I think the hon. member for Gardens must accept that it is the honest intention of the Government to keep the Coloured Representatives in this House. The hon. the Minister and the hon: the Prime Minister have already given the assurance that there is no idea of removing those members from this House, now or in future, but we do not know what future legislators may decide in this House. In any case that is not our intention and I trust this matter will not be raised again.</p>

<p>Sir, I should like to analyse the merits of this Bill on the occasion of its third reading and ask myself the question whether it is in the interests of the Coloureds or not. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition spoke about the possibility of a referendum so as to give the registered voters an opportunity of deciding on this. Sir, if it were possible to put this question objectively and completely impartially to the Coloured people I would have accepted that offer with open arms. But hon. members opposite know as well as I do what tragic and unpleasant circumstances anything like that will create, not only for the Whites but also for the Coloured community.</p>

<p>That is what the Opposition is trying to make of them. They were a political football and they will become that again if the United Party were to come into power and if they were to carry out the policy they hold out in prospect in this House to-day. In that case the Coloureds will indeed be a political football. We all know that the Coloured people, a large percentage of whom are uneducated and not sufficiently advanced, are much more susceptible to agitation and to be stirred into hostility towards another group of the population than they are to suggestions aimed at the promotion of their own interests. If an agitator, for example, were to approach the Coloured community with the object of stirring up their feelings against another group of the population, like the Whites, the Whites who live in much better economic and social circumstances in South Africa than they, he will be much more successful, and achieve that success more easily than the other person who discusses with them suggestions, purely on their merit, and aimed at promoting their welfare and progress. We know that is the position and that is why I say if such a referendum were to be held amongst the Coloureds it would only create chaos. If they could consider the question on its merits alone, from the point of view of what is in the interests of the Coloureds, I would have welcomed such a suggestion. Sir, hon. members on that side of the House make the mistake of viewing this legislation from a political angle.</p>

They are more inclinied to consider the political implications of the Coloured vote. Hon. members opposite have told us <i>ad nauseum</i> what they intend doing for the <span class="col_5263-5264" refersTo="page_1324"/>Coloureds. They want to restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll. They want to use him, as the hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) has said as a political football.</p>

<p>I want to be fair towards the hon. member. He did not intend it to be with reference to his own party. I think in a discussion on this Bill we must accept the basic fact that the Coloureds are on a separate Voters&#x2019; Roll to-day. At the present moment they have separate representation in this House, and I say with respect to their Representatives in this House that the Coloureds are getting a squarer deal to-day than they got when they were still on the Common Roll. Those hon. members at least talk in the interests of the Coloureds. I do not hesitate to say that I have the greatest measure of respect for them. They are doing their duty towards the Coloured people. I am not saying that they are always doing what is best for the Coloured people because they are inclined to follow the popular ideas of the top layer of the Coloured community, those people who are actually on the borderline and who want to join the White community. They are too inclined to follow that popular idea and I think it is there where they make the mistake, but in general I wish to say to their credit that they are doing their best for the Coloureds and I say the Coloureds are to-day getting a squarer deal than they got before. There are people in this House to-day who specifically look after their interests; here are people who specifically plead their cause; we have a Government and a Minister who are sympathetic towards their interests, and hon. members who represent the Coloureds in particular will agree with me when I say that the Coloureds are to-day progressing much faster in all respects than they did when they were still on the Common Roll and when there was nobody in this House who specifically pleaded their cause.</p>

<p>This is legislation which we must not only regard from the political angle but which we must also regard from the point of view of what is in the best interests of the Coloureds themselves and from the point of view of promoting their political rights in this country. It is true that this Bill does not provide unconditionally that they will have legislative powers. The Opposition&#x2019;s great objection is that they are not given legislative power immediately but it does not follow that they are not getting any legislative powers at all. The foundation for legislative powers is laid in this legislation. Even if they were never to get any legislative power they are still getting a great deal in this legislation. This legislation is a major initial step to promote the interests of the Coloureds and their development in the political field.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the Coloureds were the most advanced group of all the non-Whites in South Africa. I think we should not exaggerate that statement. I do not argue with it but when we say they are the most advanced group we immediately create the impression that they are really advanced. Mr. Speaker, if you knew the Coloured people of the platteland as I know them, not only the top layers with the white collars, but the ordinary Coloured people, you would realize what they still were and how backward about 70 per cent or 80 per cent of them still were; how undeveloped they still were; how little respect they still had for anything they possessed; how little respect they had for nationhood in any form and how low their moral values were. Sir, you must go to the platteland to realize what the Coloured still is. Although I do not argue with the statement of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition I wish to emphasize that when we talk about the most advanced section of the non-Whites we must not conclude from that that they are of necessity very advanced. No, Mr. Speaker, they are still at a very low level of development in every respect. I am not saying that to the discredit of the Coloureds. They themselves say it and you will agree with me, Mr. Speaker. That is why I say, that being the position as far as the Coloureds are concerned, we cannot expect them to start at the top rung of the ladder in the political field. Let us start from the bottom; let us give them the opportunity of gradually gaining political experience so that they can develop gradually. They are now given an opportunity in this legislation to organize themselves in the political field. This is the first time they are getting this opportunity; they are getting a Voters&#x2019; Roll and they can register on it. I wish to emphasize that it is not only the rich and educated ones who can register, but the most humble Coloured person can register. That right he and his wife are now given will sow in them the germ of an appreciation of the value of moral things; an appreciation of the value of their share in the country in which they live. He is not excluded because he is poor or illiterate. I think of my garden boy at Robertson, for example. He has never had any education; he cannot read or write. But now he will realize, for the first time, that he has a share in the administration and in the promotion of the interests of his own people.</p>

<p>Hon. members opposite, however, want to deny the Coloured people that; hon. members opposite do not wish to give the Coloureds that privilege. They allege this means retrogression to the Coloureds; that this is not pro-, gress. Let us be reasonable, Sir, let us be grateful. This is indeed a tremendous step forward, even if we do not get everything we want. This legislation makes provision for them to have their own council to which they will be able to elect their own people and eventually they will have legislative power in respect of their own affairs.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition talked about the four stream policy of the Government in respect of the rural areas. I <span class="col_5265-5266" refersTo="page_1325"/>have already dealt with that. It is for the very reason that we wish the Coloureds to develop as part of the White community that we do not want to apply that four stream policy, as it is being applied in the Transkei, to the Coloureds. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also asked why we did not give them separate citizenship. How can you reconcile those two arguments, Sir&#x003F; You must not remove him from the Whites but you must confer separate citizenship on him! That is sheer nonsense, surely. That is how the hon. the Leader of the Opposition argues.</p>

<p>Very well. Let us accept that he did not say it, but then he should ask us to do so. It is for the very reason that we wish him to develop as part of the White section that we do not wish to give him his own citizenship, particularly here in the Western Province.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Gardens wishes to restore them to the Common Roll, but he remains a Coloured; he remains a member of a separate group or is the hon. member advocating that we should no longer distinguish between White and Coloured&#x003F; As long as we wish to distinguish between White and Coloured, something which the member for Gardens advocates, we must admit that he still belongs to a separate group. It is no good saying that because you place him on a Common Roll you are doing away with all differences between the Coloured man and the White man.</p>

<p>Now for the first time we are giving an opportunity to the most humble Coloured man, to the poorest and the least educated Coloured man, of having a say in his own administration and eventually in the legislation affecting those matters which will promote his own interests. They all share in it. I think this is a very important step forward.</p>

<p>I understand why hon. members opposite are concerned about this legislation. When the hon. member for Green Point (Maj. van der Byl) spoke during the second reading he said he was very concerned about this legislation. We realize that but we cannot help that. We think what we are doing is in the best interests of the Coloureds. The hon. member must simply accept that. The hon. member for Green Point said we knew only too well that once this legislation was on the Statute Book it would not be possible for them to restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll. That is true because if they do restore the Coloureds to the Common Roll they will have to disenfranchise the Coloured women and that they will not be able to do or will not wish to do. That is the reason why they are so worried. They are worried because this legislation is bringing them to the end of the road under their policy. Once this legislation has been disposed of the United Party will have to formulate a new policy.</p>

<p>The hon. the Minister has accepted a considerable number of amendments moved by the other side of the House, particularly by the hon. member for Peninsula. The Minister has accepted those amendments in order to improve the legislation to the satisfaction of the hon. member for Peninsula and to our satisfaction. I think at this stage we should all co-operate in order to make it a success in the best interests of the Coloureds.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I have not the time to reply to the hon. member for Ceres (Mr. S. L. Muller); in fact there is nothing to reply to. The hon. member for Peninsula (Mr. Bloomberg) has very ably dealt with the main points of the Bill so I shall not cover any of the points he has already made. I just want to say that, in my opinion, however sad the Coloured people may have been when they were taken off the Common Roll, to-day is probably the saddest day in their political lives. All the hopes and aspirations they may have had, while this Government is in power, to be restored to the Common Roll, where they belong, are made impossible, forever, by this Bill. There is a message which I as a Member of Parliament, representing the Coloured people, want to give to them&#x2014;and I am sure my friends join me in this&#x2014;and it is this: Do not despair, the time will come; there is a silver lining in the cloud, politically, for you and you will still be restored to the Common Roll in the not too distant future, despite the actions of this Government.</p>

<p>I now want to deal with one aspect of this Bill in the few minutes at my disposal and that is Clause 29. I regard Clause 29 as the most unfortunate clause in this Bill. I want to tell the hon. the Minister that everyone, even the people of the Coloured Council themselves, believed that the council as at presently constituted, would be extended until this so-called Parliament came into being. Even the Secretary for Coloured Affairs said the following in a public statement&#x2014;</p>

<p>I know the point the Minister wants to make; it is just as clever as some of the other points he has made and they, were stupid. Everybody believes that the word &#x201C;council&#x201D; means the council as presently constituted, the council with its members, not the shell, but the substance. How can a council continue without anybody serving on that council! There was a leading article in the <i>Banier</i> in which the same opinion was expressed&#x2014;</p>

If that explanation is correct then the Minister wants us to believe that every member of the Coloured Council was prepared to commit political suicide by consenting to this clause.

<speech by="#suzman">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SUZMAN</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the hon. the Minister may have observed that I took no part in the Committee Stage of this Bill. I did not for a very good reason. It was obvious that, once the second reading had been passed, no alteration in principle could be agreed to by this Committee. No amendments could be introduced in this House which could in any way extend the legislative scope of the Bill. The Opposition called it a hollow mockery and it seemed to me that no amendment could make it less hollow or less of a mockery. The second reason why I took no part in the Committee Stage was that no amendment could alter the fundamental fact that this Bill was an extension of the separate roll representation system. Therefore, because I object basically to separate representation, it seemed again that no amendments could make any difference. It makes no difference to me whether it needs a two-third majority in order to unseat a member, of the council or just a simple majority. It makes no difference to me whether there are more elected, than nominated members on the council. For these reasons I took no part in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>I agree with the hon. the Minister and other members that the old Common Roll system was not a success as it operated&#x2014;and these are the important words &#x201C;as it operated&#x201D;. But I want to say, as I have said before, that the remedy for a system that did not work was not simply to substitute for a Common Roll system, a separate roll system nor, may I add, is the remedy simply to return to the old Common Roll system. To me it is as fatuous to replace the Common Roll system with a separate roll system, hoping that that will engender better race relations (where it has been proved all over the world that separate representation does nothing but to increase racial friction) as it is simply to offer, as the official Opposition offers, to restore the Common Roll system as it existed before the Coloured were taken off it, with a few changes, such as the extension, on a separate roll (thereby undermining the principle of Common Roll representation) representation to the northern provinces. To me that is no answer, either. The answer is to be perfectly logical. If one does not think the old system worked and if one believes that the Common Roll basis is correct, the answer is to extend the Common Roll system throughout the country and to allow everybody who has qualified, everybody who has reached a certain stage of educational development, to come on to the Common Roll. In other words, to judge on merit and not on colour. To me the whole Opposition argument is undermined by the fact that Coloured women will not come on the roll and that only the males of the Cape Province will be restored to the Common Roll. It makes a nonsense of the whole argument unless this is carried to it logical conclusion. Otherwise, as far as I am concerned, there is no point in arguing against the principle of separate representation.</p>

<p>I believe if one says the Coloured man is one&#x2019;s brother and one must take him along with the White man, one must also say that the Coloured woman is one&#x2019;s sister, otherwise, as I say, there is simply no logic in this argument. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition said the reason why the United Party was not prepared to go further at this stage and say it would put the Coloured women on the Common Roll or that it would extend Common Roll representation to the northern provinces, was because it was his party&#x2019;s policy to go to the country first for a referendum before it adopted any changes in racial policy. Is this setting the lead&#x003F; Surely if one believed ethically that it was right to have a Common Roll system for the Coloured people, if one believed ethnically that the Coloured people belonged alongside the White people, then it is the duty of the Leader of the Opposition to set a lead to the country. He announced this <span class="col_5269-5270" refersTo="page_1327"/>as his official policy: To try to win elections on the basis of his official policy, and to say that ethnically the Coloureds belong alongside the Whites, that we believe Common Roll representation is the right form and then say: We leave it to the electorate to tell us when it is the right time to introduce this policy. The job of the Official Opposition is to present its policy to the country and not leave it to the electorate to tell it what its policy should be.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) says &#x201C;hear, hear&#x201D;. There is another anomaly in this whole argument that has struck me throughout this debate and it is this: The Coloured Representatives in this House, other than the hon. member for Outeniqua, are official members of the United Party. Now, Sir, do they believe that the Coloured women should have the vote&#x003F; Do they believe in extending Common Roll representation to the other provinces&#x003F; This is important because if they are official members of the United Party they have to preach United Party policy. When I was a member of the United Party I had to do so. One could plead for changes in the policy at congresses and that was what I did consistently for many years until it dawned on me that I was not going to get very far in so doing. So these members are official members of the United Party and they should therefore be preaching the official policy of the United Party. I think it is perfectly relevant to ask these hon. gentlemen, particularly the one sitting behind me (Mr. Eden), who belongs to the caucus of the United Party, whether it is their policy to extend Common Roll representation to the north and whether it is their policy to put Coloured women on the roll&#x003F; There can be no argument about this: There are many Coloured women, Coloured teachers, Coloured nurses etc. who are absolutely fitted to exercise the franchise in this country. You find them in every province in the Republic&#x2014;not only in the Cape. I would like to get a little logic in the whole argument otherwise, as I say, all this talk about a &#x201C;hollow mockery&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Coloured people belonging to the White people&#x201D; does not really mean one row of beans. It would be very nice to get some official announcement on this policy from the Official Opposition.</p>

<p>In the three minutes left to me I want to say this: Having set out my policy and that of my party, which is Common Roll franchise on a qualified basis for everybody, for males and females, who are over a certain age (we believe that should be 21), who are citizens of this country, irrespective of colour, race, creed or sex throughout every province in South Africa, I want to turn to the Government. As far as this Bill is concerned it does just the opposite of what the hon. the Minister thinks it is going to do and the opposite of what the hon. the Prime Minister said when he spoke to the Coloured Council in 1961, when he said this would bring happiness to every Coloured person. I believe it will do no such thing. It cannot possibly satisfy the Coloured people for their needs cannot be separated from those of their fellow White-citizens, and their needs are to lead a full participatory life in the integrated life of this country. They want to enjoy opportunities of education, opportunities to use their abilities to the very best extent possible. They want to enjoy opportunities of employment and they want to enjoy rights and responsibilities in the government of this country and in the formation of the laws which regulate their lives, laws such as group areas, separate representation, separate amenities, job reservation etc. These are the laws which basically affect the Coloureds; laws that decide that they may not be members of mixed trade unions, laws which set aside separate trade unions for them. These are the things which really and truly affect the lives of the Coloured people.</p>

<p>Therefore, as far as I am concerned, this Council does nothing for. the Coloured people; it is certainly no substitute for playing a full part in the life of South Africa; it is no substitute for Common Roll rights which, as I say, should not simply take the form of restoration but a vastly extended form.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>The new direction we are following with this legislation creates an opportunity for the Coloureds of exercising their own political rights to a greater extent in future in their own interests and in the interests of their own nation. As the Coloureds exercise more and more political rights through the channel this legislation creates for them they will lose their interest in the Parliament of the White man. If we do not create this channel for him he will in the ordinary course of events aspire to exercise his political rights in this Parliament. If you were to ask a Coloured man, in present circumstances, and without the channel we are creating here, whether he was interested in entering the Parliament of the White man he would say &#x201C;yes&#x201D;. He would say: As long as my affairs are controlled by the Parliament of the White man I am interested in that Parliament, but give me my own legislative body, give me my own political institution in which I can attain my political aspirations in due course, then I shall lose all interest in the Parliament of the White man.</p>

<p>We are creating an institution here which will enable the Coloured to exercise his own political rights more in his own interests and in the interests of his own people. We are definitely embarking on a road of parallel political development along which the White man need not be afraid of the power of the Coloured in the political field. We are creating a position where we shall be able to maintain better race relations between the Coloureds and all sections of the White people. By satisfying the White man that the Coloured man will no longer constitute a political danger in future by reason of the fact that he has the right to compete with the White man in the political field, you also create a state <span class="col_5271-5272" refersTo="page_1328"/>of mind in the White man which will enable him to be more willing to devote himself to the upliftment of the Coloured man, which is something we are all aiming at.</p>

<p>I believe this legislation on which we are to-day putting the official stamp, is in the best interests of the Coloured community. This new direction we are following will ensure that as far as the Coloured vote is concerned we do not again have the abuses which took place in the past. It is also a guarantee that there will not be a fresh struggle between the White man and the Coloured man and between the White sections in the political field over the political rights of the Coloureds. Mr. Speaker, all this taken together can only bring about better race relationships between the Whites and the Coloured. If the White man wishes to continue to exist and if these two sections wish to live in a spirit of good neighbourliness in this part of South Africa it is important that there should be a good understanding between the White man and the Coloured man. It is important that every vestige of suspicion should be wiped out of the mind of the Coloured man as far as the Whites are concerned. It is important that the Coloured man realizes that what the White man claims for himself in the political sphere he is willing to give to the Coloured man in his own institutions.</p>

<p>I think once we have finalized this legislation it will in time also satisfy the Coloureds. The hon. member for Peninsula said this afternoon that a certain Coloured person was opposed to this legislation and that he had written to that effect to the Minister but that same person wrote the following in the latest issue of the <i>Banier.</i> I do not know whether the hon. member for Peninsula is prepared to interpret what I am going to read as meaning that Mr. Fortein is opposed to this legislation&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The tempo of Coloured development will from now on depend on the degree of co-operation of the Coloured community as a whole with the Government which is prepared to uplift them. Coloured goodwill and co-operation will, however, be actively stimulated by the degree of gradual legislative and administrative powers vested in the Coloured Representative Council as a token of goodwill and faith on the part of the Government.</block>

<p>I think this Government has shown that it is well-disposed towards the Coloureds. I also believe that more and more Coloured leaders are realizing that their salvation in this country is only to be found along the road of parallel political development.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>Certain points made by the hon. member who just sat down I hope to deal with in the course of my speech. I should at this stage like to say a word about what was stated by the hon. member for Houghton who unfortunately is not in the Chamber at the present moment. I do not intend replying to her in full, but I only want to point out to her that when she talks about logical conclusions of the different policies, she must bear in mind, as the country has borne in mind, that her Leader, Dr. Steytler, has admitted that the logical conclusion of the policy of the Progressive Party is &#x201C;one man, one vote&#x201D;. It is for that very fact that the hon. member&#x2019;s party is continually losing ground. She asked the Coloured Representatives who are members of the United Party what the United Party&#x2019;s policy was for representation of the Coloureds in this House. Now, our Leader dealt with this very point again this afternoon. We have also stated our policy on many occasions and, consequently, I do not intend stating again what our policy is in regard to the representation of Coloureds in this House. Every member of the Nationalist Party knows what it is as well as we do. They have heard it so often and it is set out in our booklet. But yet they keep on raising the point here in order to get away from the implications of this Bill. It is, in other words, brought up as a red herring. The only point the members on the Government side can make in this debate is to attack us on our policy and that because they cannot possibly justify this measure.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Ceres (Mr. S. L. Muller) said the United Party wished the Government to treat the Coloureds in the same way as they have treated the Bantu of the Transkei. He went so far as to say that my Leader asked this afternoon why the Coloureds were not being given a separate citizenship or all the rights to citizenship which were given to the Bantu of the Transkei, why they were not being given their own homeland, etc. The hon. member then said that my Leader advocated that this be done for the Coloureds as well.

<p>Sir, the hon. member is quite right when he says that we must do the one or the other &#x2026; that if they wished to go ahead with their policy of separate development and treat the Coloureds as a separate group, they should then give them their separate citizenship and their own homelands. What my Leader was trying to point out was that you could not have a State within a State and if the Government intended giving the Coloureds full self-government, then they should go the whole hog and do the same for the Coloureds as they have done for the Bantu in the Transkei. The hon. member for Ceres has now admitted that too. We in the United Party are not complaining because the Government is not giving the Coloured people separate citizenship, or their <span class="col_5273-5274" refersTo="page_1329"/>own flag, or a promise for independence. We do not object to this because to do that would be contrary to our policy. Our policy was stated this afternoon by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan).</p>

<p>We treat the Coloured group as part of the civilized group of people in this country. In this connection we still adhere to the policy stated by General Hertzog when he was our leader. He then said that the Coloureds were an appendage of the White group. When General Hertzog was leader of the Nationalist Party he said that there were numbers of Nationalist Party members of Parliament who regarded the Coloureds as being on an equal basis with the Whites as far as economics and political rights were concerned. In these respects, then, they placed the Coloureds on an equal footing with the Whites. So, it is still our policy that the Coloureds should not be separated from us into a separate group politically or economically.</p>

<p>Coloureds were allowed to join the United Party and since that time our constitution has not been altered. But when the Coloureds were taken off the Common Roll, they no longer took any interest in becoming members of a White branch of the party. That is so because they no longer had any say in the election of candidates. The idea behind the Nationalists, including the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s questions, when they know that Coloureds were allowed to become members of the old Nationalist Party &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hughes">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>It is not a question of whether they were members of a White branch or not. The question is whether they were allowed to become members of the party. And my reply is that they were allowed to become members. [Interjections.] As far as I know the only people who could not become members of the Nationalist Party were the Jews in the Transvaal. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>What we on this side object to on behalf of the Coloured people is that the whole attitude of the Government is one of gratuitous insult towards them. They are being thrust into an inferior position. The hon. member for Ceres dealt at length with the Transkei, and he told us why there had to be a difference between the Bantu in the Transkei and the Coloureds. He said that the Coloureds had to be treated on a separate basis because they were not getting their own homelands nor were they being promised eventual independence. But these reasons are not the same as the reasons given by the hon. the Minister in his replies to debates on this measure. Let us deal with this whole difference in the approach of the Government towards the Bantu of the Transkei on the one hand and the Coloureds on the other hand. Why, in other words, are the Bantu in the Transkei given their independence but the Coloured people only this proposed council&#x003F; After all, this is fundamental to the Government&#x2019;s policy of separate development, i.e. the Bantu are going to have their own Bantustans which will be developed to independence and the Coloureds are going to get their own council. We do not yet know what is going to happen to Indians but I assume something similar will also be given to them. The idea is, in any event, that each group will develop separately.</p>

<p>I now should like to come to the hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;). He said that Coloureds would continually desire to come and sit in this Parliament as long as this Parliament controlled their destinies. On the other hand, he said, once they have their own body controlling their destinies, they will no longer want to come here. But now I should like to ask anybody on the Government side whether it is the policy of the Government to give the Coloureds their independence too so that this Parliament will no longer need to control their destinies&#x003F; Remember the hon. member said that as long as this Parliament controlled the destinies of the Coloured people, the Coloured people would want to have representation in this House. Now, that desire can only be removed by giving them complete independence as it is <span class="col_5275-5276" refersTo="page_1330"/>intended to give the Bantu in the Transkei. But let us again look at the difference in the approach to the Bantu of the Transkei on the one hand and the Coloureds on the other. There is no doubt that it is the policy of the Prime Minister to keep Bantu as well as Coloured from having any say in the Government of the country. But he realized that that was amoral and accordingly he proposed giving the Transkei its independence under its own Government and to the Coloureds this council. Now, as far as the Bantu are concerned, the Prime Minister was forced to act. Why&#x003F; Because the Bantu have powerful friends abroad. The Prime Minister himself admitted that what he proposed for the Transkei he was forced to do by world opinion. So he was forced to take action on behalf of the Bantu. And how did he set about it&#x003F; In 1962 he made an announcement what the Government&#x2019;s intention was in regard to the Transkei. That same year they consulted the Territorial Authority concerned and a constitution was drawn up by that body itself. As a matter of fact, it was stated by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Bantu Administration that the Territorial Authority itself drew up that constitution. At any rate, that constitution was approved by that Territorial Authority and soon after Parliament met the next year, the Minister introduced a Bill to give the Transkei its constitution. This Bill was passed and became law on 30 May. The Transkei had their own Parliament elected by the end of the year and, similarly, a chief Minister and a Cabinet. But as against this what is happening to the Coloureds&#x003F; We have heard for some time that the Coloureds were going to get this council. Now the Minister has come forward with this Bill which was prepared by him and his Department. What is more, we are told that it will take effect only from 1966. There is, in other words, no hurry at all, whereas in the Transkei it was all done within the space of one year. But the Coloureds have to wait for two years. And what is more, in the Transkei there were open discussions in the Territorial Authority. The Press were there and so was everybody else. But what is the position in this regard with the constitution for the Coloureds&#x003F; The position is that we do not know who drafted it and we had charge and counter-charge of perfidy as to whether it was placed before the Coloured council or not and whether that council approved of it. The Minister swore that the council saw the Bill and approved of it, while the Coloured Representatives in this House, on the other hand, swore that that was not the case. Let us look at the difference between this constitution and that proposed for the Transkei. Now, if hon. members on the other side had said that they could not allow the Coloureds to have their own cabinet, or to allow them to govern themselves, or to enjoy privilege in their discussions simply because they are not given a separate state, then I say that that might be good reasons. But the Minister has told us that they are not being accorded privilege in their discussions, and that they are not being given the same administrative powers as those given to the Transkei, because they are not fitted for it. He said in this connection that less than 70 per cent of the Coloureds were suitably educated and capable of accepting responsibility. What an insult to offer them! The Bantu were given the right to govern themselves and they were given power to make their own laws. The relevant Act contains two pages of small type setting out the powers of the Transkei to legislate for themselves. But what can the proposed Coloured council do&#x003F; It can merely advise when their advice is sought, or it can recommend &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HUGHES</person>:</from>

<p>&#x2026; and the State President by proclamation can set out what it can do. But as far as the Bantu in the Transkei are concerned, they have no doubt as to what their Government can do. And what is more, they do not have to go to Ministers for approval before they want to introduce a Bill, but can do so on their own initiative.</p>

<p>We in the United Party say that this is not the way to treat the Coloured people. They deserve better of us. They have stood by us in the past and they have been law-abiding citizens. Whenever there has been trouble or threats of trouble in the country, whether internally or externally, the Coloureds have stood by us. They are a minority group. Let us face that. They do not have the same power as the Bantu have and that is why they are being treated in this way. We say it is wrong. They are in fact the people who should be protected by us and who we should take along with us. The Minister has no idea of the extent of the resentment which has been caused amongst the Coloured people by his mere remarks. &#x2026;</p>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>This clause, particularly in respect of sub-section (1), provides for registration of participation bonds. There is no doubt that the intention is that registration should be in the Deeds Registry, but that is not stated in the clause, and it seems to me that it ought to be so that the matter is put beyond doubt. I therefore move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 11, after &#x201C;such&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;in the deeds registry&#x201D;.</block>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It is quite obvious that the participation bond itself, that is the main bond, must be registered in the Deeds Office. I have got no objection to the addition of those words to make it quite clear, as that was the intention.</p>

<p>Amendment put and agreed to.</p>

<p>Clause, as amended, put and agreed to.</p>

<p>On Clause 5,</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">In line 15, after &#x201C;register&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;in a form approved by the registrar&#x201D;; and in the same line, after &#x201C;to&#x201D; to insert &#x201C;periodic and&#x201D;.</block>

<p>The object of the first amendment is to provide that the form of the register must be approved by the Registrar. This clause provides for a register to be kept in the registered office of the participation bond company and it requires that the register shall contain the following particulars: In regard to each participation bond the amount owing from time to time by the mortgagor under such bond, the names of the participants and the extent of their participations from time to time and the rules of the scheme in which such bond is included. Mr. Chairman, a register can have various forms. In modern practice it is quite possible to imagine a register which consists of a file containing the particulars of the client whose funds are held, a ledger card in the form generally used by a bank where machines are used, and this bank form not only contains certain particulars but also transactions affecting a particular person&#x2019;s account, the original of which would be retained as part of the record to the nominee company, a duplicate being sent from time to time to the customer, that is the participation bond holder. As the clause now reads it is not clear whether the whole register should be a single document, a single book, or whether a loose-leaf form would be approved, and whether a form of record which would contemplate modern mechanical methods would be allowed. I suggest that if this first amendment to insert &#x201C;in a form approved by the Registrar&#x201D; is inserted then it will be for the company concerned to submit its form to the Registrar and once that form has been approved of. those records would then be in the approved form in terms of this clause. As the clause is worded now it does not indicate what kind of register will be approved, and one can very well understand a departmental official&#x2014;I hope there are none of that type in the Minister&#x2019;s Department&#x2014; demanding that the register should be in the form of a book in which all the particulars are collected together. I have in mind one particular company which has over 5,000 participation bondholders and all those certificate holders&#x2019; records are in a form of loose-leaf cards. They contemplate changing over to a mechanical form, and it will be quite impracticable to have on that form all these details. It would be auite impracticable to have on one card that is filed all the particulars in regard to each participation bond, the extent of the amount owing from time to time by the mortgagor under such bonds, the names of the participants in such bond and the rules of the scheme in which such bond is included. Those would be collated in a series of documents, depending on the form of accounting, the form of records obtaining in that particular office. There will be other cases where they may not have mechanical aids, where they would have written documents. I am thinking there of a small organization where everything can be contained in one register, one document. For that reason I suggest that the Minister should accept my amendment. Then the onus would be on the company concerned to submit their form of register to the Registrar and if the Registrar is satisfied, then that form of record will be an approved form.</p>

<p>I now come to the next amendment in favour of periodic and annual inspections. The clause as it now reads says, &#x201C;A register, which shall be subject to annual audit, and in which shall be recorded &#x2026;&#x201D;. If my amendment is accepted it will read &#x201C;subject to periodic and annual audit&#x201D;. The object of this is to allow the auditors to do periodic audits as well as the annual audit. If there are any difficulties in a company, quite often timeous inspection by auditors can prevent deterioration in the compliance by the company of the requirements of the Act. If there is an annual audit, one can imagine a state of affairs where the auditor will not be required to appear and perform the audit until after the end of the company&#x2019;s financial year, and one could imagine a state of affairs particularly in a company which is exoeriencing difficulties, asking the auditors to delay their audit because the books are not yet ready. I feel that the auditor should be in the position to call on a company at any time to do a periodic audit, so as to satisfy himself that the affairs of the company are being conducted in a manner contemplated by the <span class="col_5289-5290" refersTo="page_1337"/>framers of this Act. For that reason I hope the hon. Minister will accept both amendments.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the first amendment is concerned, the clause reads &#x201C;every manager shall keep at its registered office or its or his place of business or such other place or places as the Registrar may approve, on such conditions as he may determine, a register which shall be subject to annual audit &#x2026;. In other words, as I read it, the register must be kept on such conditions as the Registrar may determine. That would include the form of the register. The form must be approved by the Registrar, because that is one of the conditions which the Registrar may impose. These words must clearly refer to the form as well. Perhaps if the words were placed after &#x201C;a register&#x201D; it might have been clearer. The hon. member will see that in the Afrikaans it says &#x201C;elke bestuurder moet op &#x2019;n plek wat die Registrateur goedkeur op die voorwaardes wat hy bepaal &#x2019;n register hou&#x201D;. In other words, one of the conditions which he can impose is the form of the register. I think the whole matter is covered.</p>

<p>The hon. member then wants to insert the word &#x201C;periodic&#x201D; in regard to audits. Here it seems to me that the hon. member has not taken into account Clause 12, which provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A manager shall within a period of 30 days after receipt of a written request from the Registrar or within such further period thereafter as the Registrar may allow, furnish to the Registrar such information in relation to a scheme managed by him, as the Registrar may request, together with a report thereon by the auditor, if so requested.</block>

<p>So the annual report is not the only report. There may be other reports during the course of the year if circumstances demand it. I think that is covered too, by the wording of Clause 12. But again I want to ask hon. members, in a technical matter of this nature, instead or arguing the matter over the floor of the House, it would be so much better to go into it with the office of the Registrar. It is very difficult for me. I am giving my opinion as I read the clause, and I can promise to go into it further, but I do not see that we can debate it over the floor of the House. I cannot see that any good purpose is served by that. I appealed to hon. members yesterday, if they had any difficulties in regard to this matter, to discuss it with me or with Mr. Louw on behalf of the Registrar&#x2019;s office. As far as I am now informed, both of these amendments could really have been disposed of by seeking explanations, and if the explanations were not satisfactory, by a further investigation of the matter. At present I am merely saying that I, reading this clause as it is, together with Clause 12, think that both these matters are already covered, and if we provide for a matter which is already covered it amounts not only to inelegant drafting but it may lead to other difficulties.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I agree with the Minister to a certain extent that it might be helpful to discuss these matters with the Department, but I want to point out that the second reading of the Bill was only held yesterday and the Minister&#x2019;s officials were busy on another Bill. So I think the Minister is a little unreasonable to suggest that we should have got into touch with the officials concerned. The Minister draws my attention to Clause 12 with regard to the special audit. The auditor is only called in when the Department raises the matter with the manager of the institution. What I am trying to ensure is that the auditor shall have the power to call in on that business at any time of the year, and I am doing it to help the Minister, and not to make matters difficult for him. If the Minister wants a good Bill which is adequately administered, surely it is to his advantage and that of his officials if the auditor could visit that company during the course of the year, because of the psychological effect of regular visits or even irregular visits by the auditor; it will have the effect of keeping the staff up to date if they know that the auditor can come in at any time to perform a portion of his audit to ensure that the requirements of the Act are being carried out.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#hourquebie">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOURQUEBIE</person>:</from>

<p>The point made by the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell) is in my view not met by Clause 12. The point, as I see it, is this. Clause 5 gives the power to auditors to audit the register of participants in bonds. That was pointed out by the hon. member for Pinetown in his second-reading speech yesterday. We consider this to be very important, because that is really the only protection which participants will have. The point is this, that if you do not have the participants registered in the Deeds Registry, in the participation bond which is registered, then you must ensure that the register of participants kept by managers is properly kept, because the rights of participants to a large extent stem from that register of participants. Now if the manager of a trust company is not doing his job properly and is a little lax about registerins the substition of participants, those participants who ouput to have been substituted are prejudiced, and the only way of protecting them is to allow the auditor to audit periodically at his discretion.</p>

<p>Clause 12 deals with a different situation. It obliges a manager to furnish information at the request of the Registrar. That is a necessary and good provision, but it does not deal with the point raised by the hon. member for Pinetown. So I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</p>

<p>In regard to the first amendment moved by the hon. member for Pinetown, the English version of Clause 5 (1) is not as well worded as it could be and I think it requires some <span class="col_5291-5292" refersTo="page_1338"/>change. Perhaps what would meet the position would be to say that every manager shall keep a register in a form approved by the Registrar at its registered office, etc. I suggest that as it is worded at the moment, the portion dealing with the approval of conditions is out of place, and therefore it does not make clear the point which is intended to be made by the clause, namely, that it is the register that has to be approved. I suggest that it should be reworded.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>As far as the periodic inspection by the auditor is concerned, as I have said, I have no objection to it, but my difficulty is that if we have those words here there is no provision as to how that audit is to take place. In Clause 10 there is provision for the annual audit, but this thing will hang in the air. May I suggest that, bearing in mind what the hon. member wants and that Clause 12 relates only to an audit initiated by the Registrar, and that the hon. member wants the auditor himself to have the right to go in, that I consider it and perhaps move the necessary amendments in the Other Place. I have no objection to more than one report by the auditor, but you have to provide what he has to do in that audit, as is provided in Section 10 in regard to the annual audit. I will go into the matter.</p>

<p>If the Minister is prepared to consider it in the Other Place, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment in regard to the periodic audit. I want to make it quite clear that I am not asking for additional audits; I am only asking that the auditor should be allowed to go there at any time in order to protect the investor and to assist the Minister in maintaining adequate control. That is the whole object of this amendment. If the Minister would consider that, so that the auditor will not be kept out of the place until the end of the year but can do a portion of his audit during the year, that will meet the purpose of my amendment.</p>

<speech by="#hopewell">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>I should like the Minister to give us his views on sub-section (3) (b) (ii), which says that where he is unable to satisfy himself that the latest valuation of the immovable property mortgaged appears to cover adequately the interests of the participants, he must report in writing to the manager. I should like the Minister to explain what he contemplates by &#x201C;latest valuation&#x201D;. There might be the case of a bond being granted and the valuation may have been done five or seven years before. Most of these bonds are for a five-year period. Will the Minister regard a valuation done five years before as satisfactory&#x003F; Does he contemplate those bonds being examined by the directors of the company, and does he contemplate independent valuations&#x003F; It is not clear. It just requires the auditor to report that he has satisfied himself that the latest valuation appears to cover adequately the bond holders. The auditor is virtually being asked to give an opinion as to the value of the property and whether he regards it as adequate. I can imagine a state of affairs where the bond was R75,000 and the valuation was R100,000, and within a matter of a year or two there may have been a new determination under the Group Areas Act which may materially have affected the value of that property. Is the auditor expected to give an opinion as to whether he thinks that adequate, or is he expected to ask for a later valuation&#x003F; Values can fluctuate considerably from one year to another, particularly where a municipality has rezoned an area. I asked the Minister to clarify the position. It appears to us that the wording requires further explanation.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to speak on the same point, what the &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; means from the practical point of view. Normally a bond is granted after the directors have agreed on the value of the property. The word &#x201C;valuation&#x201D; would have to be expanded here, because what normally happens in practice is that periodically the property is inspected by directors and inspectors employed by these companies, and the report comes back either confirming the valuation or not, and when the property is inspected, it is inspected from the point of view of whether it is being kept in order or whether there are a lot of vacancies or whether the neighbourhood has deteriorated. I feel personally that it would be an impossible burden to put on the auditor to ask him to <span class="col_5293-5294" refersTo="page_1339"/>satisfy himself as to the valuation. I suggest that this should be amended somehow. I have not drafted any amendment. I agree with my colleague that we certainly have not had time to discuss these matters with the officials since yesterday.</p>

<p>Another matter which arises when considering this question of valuation is that payments may have fallen into arrear, and that would probably be reported on by the auditor under (c). But it is very difficult to fathom what the use of this particular section will be if an independent valuation has to be given and payments have not fallen into arrear. There is normally no provision in the bond for calling up the money, as, as long as the borrower meets his payments, the bond stands. That point is probably covered by (c), but I suggest that this question of valuation be given further consideration. I think it should be a valuation by the board of the company, and it would not be a bad idea if it stipulates that each property must be inspected annually to see that it has not deteriorated to any great degree. But as the clause now stands I foresee all sorts of difficulties.</p>

<p>We are now discussing sub-section (3) (b) (ii), which says that the latest valuation of the immovable property mortgaged appears to cover adequately the interest of the participants. This form of wording has been specifically requested by the Auditors&#x2019; Board, as it is in accordance with their duties under the law. They have asked for it in this form, and I think the reason is this. When the first bond is registered by the Registrar of Deeds, there is a valuation. There is no provision for periodic valuations, but in many cases, as the hon. member for Benoni has pointed out, there may be a later valuation and the auditor can then have regard to that later valuation, and not the original one on which the bond was registered.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>Not necessarily by the company itself. I do not know. It refers to any later valuation that may be available, and it will of course have to be a sworn valuation. That is the condition that will be made. I mentioned yesterday that the idea is that whenever valuations are mentioned here it means sworn valuations. The auditor will consider the most recent valuation of that property.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Unfortunately the matter is not as simple as that. Let us take the case of a building bond. The ground is valued, maybe at the purchase price. The officials of the lending company work out the costs, if there are no tenders, and there never is a sworn valuation. The valuation is made by the board of directors of the company lending the money and in many instances there is no sworn valuation. I suggest that a sworn valuation gets us nowhere. If you do not fix a date, the sworn valuation might be ten years old, or in the case of a building bond it might not be in existence. Then you are forcing these people to incur additional expense. The sworn valuators will of course be very pleased, but I repeat that the normal and essential method is for the board of directors to have the original valuation, either a sworn valuation or one based on the purchase price of the land plus the cost of the building, before them. When they go out to inspect they know what it has been valued at by the company. If you say there must be a sworn valuation, you will force these properties, absolutely unnecessarily, to be valued by sworn valuators, which is quite expensive, and I do not see where it gets us. Why must it be a sworn valuation&#x003F; That property is valued on its return or on its sale price. That is the initial valuation. Why must you have a sworn valuation on top of that&#x003F;</p>

<speech by="#van_zyl">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN ZYL</person>:</from>

<p>The clause as it stands here has been framed quite satisfactorily. I think it beloves any firm of auditors to accept such a valuation. If an auditor has a sworn valuation before him, and he is not satisfied with it, he is at liberty to obtain another sworn valuation. There are circumstances in which I would not accept a sworn valuation which is higher than the valuation of the directors because the directors, as a result of their superior knowledge of conditions and other factors, are able to make a valuation which is just as good as or even better than the valuation placed upon property by a sworn valuator. I do not think we should lay down that it must be a sworn valuation because this might hamper one in practice. Sworn appraisers are sometimes not available. That is why I think hon. members should agree to leave the clause unchanged. Auditors are responsible people. If the value of the property is not what they certify it to be, action can be taken against them. That is why I think this sub-section should remain just as it is.</p>

<p>The difficulty in regard to this clause is that it does not contemplate many buildings which are financed by companies dealing in this type of business. In most of our big towns you find a development company buying an old house or piece of ground and erecting shops and flats because they anticipate that that will be a good investment. But afterwards that district may change, but so far as these people are concerned who bought the original property, they have called for tenders and built a substantial building, and by the time the bond has been raised and the building has been completed there still has been no sworn valuation at all, because they are satisfied with the returns they can expect.</p>

<from><span class="col_5295-5296" refersTo="page_1340"/>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HOPEWELL</person>:</from>

<p>The Minister obviously does not follow the practice. The company granting the mortgage is this company. They have a whole lot of clients and they have told them that this is a good proposition. Take the Foreshore. If the Minister goes to the Foreshore, he will see a building completed and almost the whole of the ground floor which consists of shops has been vacant for the last two years. When those people built that property they did not expect the shops to stand empty. Now the finance company will say to their various participants: We have a proposition here to build this block of flats and offices and shops in this particular area and it will cost R500,000, and we expect the shops to yield so much revenue and the offices so much and the flats so much. They get the various investors to participate in the bond and they raise a bond of R350,000, and subsequently the district changes. The shops are not let and therefore the directors are reluctant to spend any more money than is necessary to keep the property in order. A whole period of ten years may have gone by, and after five years new participants have come in, and still there has been no valuation. Now you are throwing on the auditor the responsibility of saying he must take the latest valuation, but there has been no valuation for ten years. Is the auditor in the clear now because he has accepted a valuation, being the original cost of the land plus the cost of the building&#x003F; That is our difficulty. The auditor is not required to get an independent valuation himself. All he needs to do is to say that the latest valuation he has available is that the land was bought ten years ago at such a figure and the building cost so much, for which he has the architect&#x2019;s certificate, but that may not be the latest valuation because the locality has changed and there has been deterioration of the building, and the building may possibly be worth less than it was ten years ago. There have been cases like that, and I suggest that there are difficulties in this clause, difficulties which were perhaps not contemplated by the people who drafted it.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I come back to the point I was making, but, before doing so, Sir, I want you to remember that this Bill is being introduced to protect the rights of the individual participant in the bond, to see that the portion of the asset which is bonded is there as his security. I will take that a little further: If he is unfortunate enough to have put his money into what turns out to be a bad bond&#x2014; it does not happen very often&#x2014;then, in the ordinary course of events, he is unlucky; we in this House cannot protect him against that, because mistakes can be made and will be made, but they do not happen very often in these big institutions that we are dealing with. We are trying to protect the individual, but now we are getting to the stage where it is not appreciated that the initial valuation is done by the board of directors of the lending company concerned. They value the property before they grant the bond. They will not grant a bond which is more than a certain proportion of the value of the property. In the building societies it is laid down that it is 70 per cent and 75 per cent. They will not grant a bond of more than 70 per cent or 75 per cent or 60 per cent of the valuation that they themselves put on the property at the date on which they grant the bond. Surely that is their responsibility, and you are not going to interfere with business to that extent. Why should there be a subsequent sworn valuation&#x003F; To me it is utterly absurd. You trust these people to make the initial valuation, and you authorize them under the law to take money from other people and lend it out in this manner; you have brought this Bill into being to see that they keep a correct register to protect the interests of individuals who are participating in the bond, and now you are putting all sorts of difficulties in the way; you say that the people who originally made the valuation are not capable of making the valuation, under this clause, if you do not allow the auditor to accept their valuation. To bring in a sworn valuation, to my mind, is utterly ridiculous. It is cutting across the whole idea of this Bill. You are not setting out to prove the value of the property; you are setting out to see that the individual&#x2019;s right is protected, that the right of the participant is protected. I repeat that the people who agreed to give the bond are the ones who valued the property originally, and the methods they adopt do not have to be enlarged upon; they are the same everywhere. They are good enough to value the property initially and to decide whether this money belonging to other people should be lent, and now the proposition is to bring in a sworn appraiser. What for&#x003F; Surely, if they report that the property has been inspected and that the valuation is confirmed, that is all that is necessary, without putting the companies to additional expense and trouble.</p>

<p>I do not know whether we are at cross-purposes or whether we just do not want to understand one another. The hon. member who has just sat down made an insinuation which I do not like, but I would rather not go into it. This clause provides&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The auditor shall report in writing to the manager on every such annual audit and such audit shall state&#x2014;(b) whether he has been unable to satisfy himself&#x2014;(ii) that the latest valuation of the immovable property mortgaged appears to cover adequately the interests of the participant.</block>

<p>I ask myself: What is the function of the auditor&#x003F; Take the case of a mortgage bond in which quite a number participate, but they do not know whether the money invested by them is adequately covered or not. It is the function of the auditor to audit the books and to ensure that the man who invested his money has adequate security. The clause provides that if the auditor is not satisfied with <span class="col_5297-5298" refersTo="page_1341"/>the latest valuation, whether it is a day or a year or ten years old, if he is not satisfied that the security offered is adequate, he must report that fact to the manager. What is wrong with that&#x003F; That is the duty of the auditors; that is why one has an auditor. The auditor acts on behalf of all the shareholders or interested persons. That is why one appoints a professional person who has the knowledge to be able to ascertain what the position is. Let us assume that there are five participants in a mortgage bond. If one of them had the right to go through all the books himself and to ask all the questions that the auditor would ask, I am sure he would say: &#x201C;I have invested my money in this mortgage; is the valuation that was made ten years ago the correct valuation; are the circumstances still the same; has the value of the property increased or decreased&#x003F;&#x201D; He would ask precisely the same questions and he would then say to the manager: &#x201C;This shop has been standing empty for a certain length of time&#x201D;, or &#x201C;This property has depreciated in value as a result of the proclamation of this area as a group area&#x201D;. He would ask precisely the same questions that an auditor would ask. I think hon. members opposite are viewing this matter in the wrong light. After all, it is the function of the auditor to protect the interests of the participants. I do not want the clause to be amended in such a way that less responsibility will rest on the shoulders of the auditor. I think what we are doing here is to protect the public.</p>

<p>I just want to say that I am very loath to depart from a form approved by the Auditors&#x2019; Board. They want the clause framed in this way, and I am not impressed by what hon. members opposite have said here. The hon. member for Pine town (Mr. Hopewell) has outlined all the risks. But, Sir, those are risks which are identical with those in the conventional mortgage bond. Depreciation of your property for various reasons over the years is an ordinary risk that you take when you give a bond. As far as the question of valuation is concerned, I should have imagined that it gives the individual greater protection by insisting that the initial valuation must be a sworn valuation. If I have to give a bond over a new building I will certainly say that, before I decide what amount I am going to give, I want a sworn valuation, which might be my own valuation. I am not simply going to accept the facts given to me by the mortgagor&#x2014;the owner of the buildings.</p>

<p>I take it that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is destroying the National Party by sending his recruits over to join it! But I leave the matter at that. I want to deal with a few of the arguments raised here by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. I asked myself why the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should participate in the debate on the third reading. This is something completely out of the ordinary. He did not participate in the discussion on any of the previous stages of this Bill; in fact, he was very seldom here. But he suddenly decided that he wanted the third reading of this Bill to be taken as soon as possible so that he could participate in the discussion on it before he left. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition was followed&#x2014;not by the hon. member for Gardens (Mr. Connan) because it was quite by chance that he again participated in the debate yesterday&#x2014;by the hon. member for Transkeian Territories (Mr. Hughes). He was also suddenly precipitated into the debate. It then became very clear to me that the Opposition felt that unless they did something at the third reading in order to save face, they would not be able to look the country squarely in the eyes after their actions here. I am afraid that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition did not succeed in removing that impression simply by participating in the debate; and the hon. member for Transkeian Territories to whom I shall also devote some time in a moment, did not succeed in removing that impression either. Their participation in the debate therefore did not change the impression which the country has gained because of their conduct in this connection.</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to do what hon. members opposite have done&#x2014;to quote letters and to read out what has been said by some Coloured leader or other. I just want to tell hon. members that while this debate was in progress I had the occasion one week-end to visit certain towns in the Western Cape for various reasons. I was asked by the Coloured communities of those towns to give them a hearing although I had visited those towns for other reasons. I wish hon. members could have seen the reception that I was given by hundreds of Coloureds at each one of those places! Not only was I received enthusiastically there but they were most profuse in their thanks to the Department of Coloured Affairs for what it is doing. In other words, this tale about the unfair treatment of the Coloureds and about the stirring up of hatred is just so much nonsense. The Coloureds themselves no longer believe those hon. members and I want to tell them that they are not doing South Africa a service by trying to stir up a spirit of this nature. Nor are they doing themselves a service; they are only harming their party by acting in this way.</p>

<p>But in the second place, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition omitted to reply to important questions which were put to him during the course of this debate. I think the fact that he participated in the debate imposed an obligation on him to give us the answers to those questions, but he omitted to do so. What was his attitude&#x003F; He rejected completely the policy of the Government through the medium of the hon. member for Gardens who said: &#x201C;We reject the policy of parallel development.&#x201D; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition told us that his policy was the only sound policy <span class="col_5301-5302" refersTo="page_1343"/>in South Africa. But if we have to accept their point of view, if we have to depart from our policy which we are consolidating and accept United Party policy, then I want to ask the question again which I asked during my reply to the second-reading debate, and I hope that the United Party will give South Africa a very clear answer in this regard. Not only do they owe it to themselves; not only do they owe it to the Government but they owe it to the country as a whole; and not only do they owe it to the Whites but they also owe it to the Coloureds. My first question is this: The United Party wants to integrate the Coloured people with the Whites; they want to make the Coloureds part of White society, as the hon. member for Transkeian Territories told us again yesterday. How are they going to identify those Coloureds&#x003F; How are they going to determine who a Coloured person is&#x003F; I fail to see how they are going to be able to determine the Coloureds to be absorbed in the White communities in South Africa because they reject the Population Registration Act. They reject that Act which classifies Coloureds and which distinguishes Coloureds from White and Bantu. The United Party must now tell South Africa how they want to identify the Coloureds; how they are going to determine who these 1,500,000 Coloureds are whom they want to absorb in White society. Not only do they reject the Population Registration Act but they also reject compulsory separate residential areas.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is trying to conceal our point of view. The question is, how are they going to protect the Coloureds from penetration by the urban Bantu and how are they going to prevent the Coloured from being the means by which the urbanized Bantu will eventually take over that common voters&#x2019; roll&#x003F; As long as the United Party is unable to reply to South Africa in this regard, so long will the country not believe them. In the third place I want to ask the hon. the Leader of the Opposition how he justifies his common voters&#x2019; roll which, according to him, is the solution to the problem&#x003F; How can he justify it when he lays down qualifications in regard to the common voters&#x2019; roll&#x003F; What is his attitude then&#x003F; If he lays down qualifications for his common voters&#x2019; roll, it will mean that the wealthy Coloured will become part of White society but that the poor Coloured will be cast out into the darkness. Does he want to throw them to the Bantu&#x003F; He must answer those questions before he tries to destroy the policy of another party. How does he justify his common voters&#x2019; roll if at the same time he excludes the Coloureds in the Northern Provinces from it&#x003F; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity to reply to me when I asked him this simple question during my reply to the second-reading debate: If Mr. Golding qualifies for the common voters&#x2019; roll in the Cape and he becomes an inspector of schools in the Transvaal, why should he no longer qualify there&#x003F;</p>

They are elected by those Coloured voters who were already registered voters when the principle of separate representation was adopted. The voters&#x2019; roll by means of which they are elected was not brought into being by this Government It is a voters&#x2019; roll which dates from the previous colonial era.

Sir, as long as the hon. the Leader of the Opposition cannot answer these questions he must not come along here and say: &#x201C;The Government is taking a step in the dark.&#x201D; All I can say to that is: &#x201C;The hon. the Leader of the Opposition is leading South Africa into darkness with his policy.&#x201D; By means of his policy he is preparing the way for a bloodless take-over of the common voters&#x2019; roll by the Black masses.</p>

<p>That hon. member must be careful when he makes interjections. I think that he should remain in this House for a few more years before he starts making interjections: In the second place, the hon. the Leader of the Opposition objected to Clauses 17 and 21 and he again quoted from a pamphlet issued by the Department of Information, a pamphlet in regard to which I have already replied. In the first place I do not want either to deny or repudiate that pamphlet but I must say that neither the hon. the Minister of Information nor I have ever seen that pamphlet in the form in which it appeared here. [Interjections.] Of course not. A Minister in South Africa has far more to do than to write pamphlets and articles. I do not reject that pamphlet but can you imagine, Mr. Speaker, that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition should quote a pamphlet of that nature here! The legislative powers of this council are very clearly defined in Clause 17, and the Opposition acknowledged that fact in the Committee Stage. In the Committee Stage they suggested that these legislative powers should not be granted by the State President because that would be too dangerous. They moved an amendment to the effect that this House should grant those legislative powers. In other words, they wanted to have a stronger guarantee that legislative powers would not be granted to this council. By their action they admitted that this council does have legislative powers. That is very clearly set out in Clause 17. This council will have legislative powers in regard to local authorities, rural areas, finances, welfare services and so forth. These things are defined, and in my introductory speech I stated emphatically that this was basic legislation. I said that other legislation would have to follow upon it, legislation which would be passed not by this House but by this Coloured Council which is to be established. We are giving the Coloured Council these powers under this basic legislation. We say that it will have specific legislative powers in regard to these matters that I have mentioned.</p>

<p>The second reply that I want to give is a reply which I find in the United Party&#x2019;s own policy. Listen to what they have to say in this &#x201C;Handbook for Better Race Relations&#x201D;&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The most important thing about the United Party&#x2019;s plan for a race federation is that there will be room for different ways of life.</block>

<p>That is precisely what we are making provision for here&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">All people like freedom to manage their own affairs as much as possible.</block>

<p>What are we doing here&#x003F; We are making provision whereby the Coloured people, in their own circle, will be able to handle their own affairs. But the hon. the Leader of the Opposition stands up and says that this is an evil thing. [Interjections.] I listened to hon. members opposite in silence; I hope that they will save their reactions till later. What does the hon. the Leader of the Opposition have to say further&#x003F; He says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The present representative council is not representative of the Coloured people.</block>

<p>I agreed with him. I have never said that it is representative. If it had been representative, we would not have changed it. We are amending the composition of the present council because we want to set up a more representative council. What is the point&#x003F; They are now opposing the fact that we want to set up a more re-resentative council. As far as the argument of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, I want to ask him whether these four Coloured representatives <span class="col_5305-5306" refersTo="page_1345"/>are representative of the Coloured people in that sense of the word&#x003F; Some of those hon. members were elected unopposed. The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) wanted to stand against the hon. member for Outeniqua (Mr. Holland) but he did not. But is the fact that the hon. member for Outeniqua did not have to fight an election any reason for saying that he is not representative of that constituency&#x003F; I say that he is representative of that constituency because the United Party had the fullest opportunity of opposing him. I say the same thing of the present members of this House who were elected unopposed. They were not opposed but is that any reason to say that they do not represent their constituencies&#x003F; In that sense this present council is representative of a section of the Coloured voters and these four Coloured representatives in this House are representative of a section of the Coloured voters. The largest section of the Coloured population in South Africa is. however, unrepresented. There I agree with the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. What we are doing is to create a mouthpiece by which the whole of the Coloured population will be represented.</p>

<p>The hon. the Leader of the Opposition also quoted from the book written by the late Senator Fagan. He said that I did not quote it fully. I want to read some more quotations. I went over what I had said during the Second Reading debate. I think that in my reply I said that I admitted that the late Senator Fagan was an opponent of the policy of this Government. I admitted that. I did not try to use him in support of the policy of this Government. What I did was this: I quoted what he had to say in regard to two specific matters. The one was in regard to consultation in connection with which he adopted the attitude that the common voters&#x2019; roll&#x2014;one man, one vote&#x2014;was not necessarily the only way to have consultation. Secondly. I quoted him in regard to the present Coloured Council, and I want to do so again. I think that this is very important. The hon. the Leader of the Opposition rejects the Union Coloured Council. I should like to quote to him what the late Senator Fagan had to say about this council, about the present council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The Coloured people still have some mouthpieces, though they have to be White in Parliament and in the Cape Provincial Council. The Council for Coloured Affairs started unpropitiously by being presented to the Coloured people as a substitute for the voting rights which they lost by removal from the Common Roll. Resentment at this change and at the apartheid policy generally led to a boycott of the elections by important sections of the Coloured people. The result is that the council which moreover has a majority of nominated over elected members cannot claim to be truly representative of the Coloured community.</block>

<p>This is the present council&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Its usefulness is also greatly limited by the fact that its deliberations are secret. That means that it can speak only to the Minister and his officials, and cannot, save for such news items as are officially released, exercise the all-important function of influencing public opinion. If these shortcomings are removed, as may, I hope happen in course of time, and better co-operation can be obtained from the Coloured people, the council would seem to me to be the kind of institution which may well play a very valuable role.</block>

<p>That was the opinion of the late Senator Fagan in regard to the attitude of the United Party. What are we doing now&#x003F; We are doing away with secret sittings. These sittings are now going to be held in public. Secondly, we will have more elected than nominated members on that council. Thirdly it is a council which will represent Coloureds throughout the whole country, and not only a few who have certain qualifications. In other words, we are removing those features of the present council to which the hon. Senator Fagan objected. He went on to say&#x2014;</p>

<p>The hon. member must not try to think up answers now. I raised this matter in my reply to the Second Reading debate and although the hon. the Leader of the Opposition has had every opportunity to reply to me, he has not done so. He has remained silent. He has laid down smoke-screens! The hon. the Leader of the Opposition has another objection because he says: &#x201C;There will be two channels to the Government representing the Coloured people&#x2014;four Parliamentary representatives and the Representative Council. This will create chaos.&#x201D; Why will it create chaos&#x003F; These four hon. members can make themselves thoroughly acquainted with the point of view of that council. If they agree with them they <span class="col_5307-5308" refersTo="page_1346"/>can support that point of view in this House; if they do not agree with them, then they can oppose it in this House. It will then be so much easier for the Government to decide because it will be able to consider these two points of view. I do not think we will then be killing democracy! The hon. the Leader of the Opposition objects to the fact that we have various channels for hearing and debating certain points of view. What chaos will there be&#x003F; Is there chaos in this House because various hon. members adopt various attitudes&#x003F; The hon. the Leader of the Opposition must not put up such smoke-screens which only serve to reveal his lack of policy. He has asked me why I do not accept his challenge to hold a referendum. But was that the attitude of the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and his party when they moved an amendment to the motion for second reading&#x003F; Did they then, through the hon. member for Gardens, move that we should first hold a referendum before we established this council&#x003F; No, Sir, they said they wanted to have nothing to do with this &#x201C;mockery&#x201D;. They rejected it without a referendum. Why does he ask me to hold a referendum&#x003F; Since when have they been so much in favour of a referendum&#x003F; When we held a referendum on the question of a Republic for South Africa they opposed it right from the start.</p>

<p>The pamphlet was issued after they had been defeated in regard to the referendum. The important question is not the referendum; the Opposition have an important question to answer. The attitude of the Government Party is this: The National Party does not permit Coloureds to become members of the party. In the second place, we do not appoint official candidates of the National Party to represent the Coloureds. We would welcome it if candidates come forward who are, broadly speaking, in agreement with our policy, but we do not want the Coloureds to become involved in our White party politics. That is our attitude. I want to put this question to the United Party: Are they going to put up candidates for this council&#x2014;for this &#x201C;mockery&#x201D;&#x003F; Are they going to participate in the elections for this council&#x003F; They must reply to us. Even if they do not reply to us to-day, they must reply to the country soon in this regard. If they are going to participate then I say that it will be the height of political impropriety. I shall tell you why I say this, Sir. In the first place, they say that they reject this council. In other words, I must take it that they will abolish it if they come into power. I am sure they will not deny that they are going to participate in these elections and are already making arrangements to nominate candidates for election to this council.

<heading>HOUSING AMENDMENT BILL</heading>

<p>Third Order read: Resumption of second-reading debate,&#x2014;Housing Amendment Bill.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of Housing, adjourned on 30 April, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, when the debate was adjourned yesterday I had indicated to the hon. the Minister that we were going to accept this Bill because its main aim, in our opinion, was to provide houses. I think everybody will realize that there is such a shortage <span class="col_5309-5310" refersTo="page_1347"/>of housing for most groups of the population at the moment that housing is something that we must really get on with. But that does not mean that we accept every provision of this Bill. There are some provisions to which we would like answers from the hon. the Minister. There are some to which we shall move amendments which can be discussed in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>At this stage I should like to say that in some ways the Minister&#x2019;s approach to this problem, as outlined in this Bill, is a little unfortunate. I think he should have looked for co-operation rather than coercion. The first question I should like to ask the Minister is in connection with Clause 2. In terms of that clause it is no longer a &#x201C;must&#x201D; to appoint a woman to the National Housing Commission. As the hon. the Minister knows at least one member had to be a woman in the past. I shall quote the section to the Minister&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>2. (c) by the deletion of paragraph (b) of the said sub-section.</li>

</ol>

<p>A woman has always had to be a member of this commission. Women are particularly adept at making suggestions and knowing what is required in a house which must accommodate a family. We in this House have accepted that fact; we have called in a woman to reorganize our own catering section. From the building point of view, I am quite sure it would be a very good thing indeed if that compulsion to have a woman on the commission were to remain. That is my reading of this sub-section; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>In Clause 4 we do not like the provision which enables the hon. Minister to alter the conditions of a loan with or without the consent of the local authority. The hon. Minister dealt with that to some extent in his introductory speech but it is a point which, we think, could perhaps be approached in a totally different manner. We are going to move an amendment to Clause 7. This clause provides for the appointment of regional committees and their constitution. This clause gives these committees the same powers as the main commission itself. Provision is made here for any decisions of the regional committees to be rescinded by the commission. That seems a peculiar attitude to adopt because if a regional committee has reached a decision which is as good as the decision of the commission itself, surely the Minister hopes that that decision will be acted upon as quickly as possible; the whole intention of this Bill is to have things implemented as quickly as possible. What is he going to do in cases where the commission rescinds those decisions, decisions which have already been acted upon&#x003F;</p>

<p>We also do not like the provision in Clause 13, at least not in its present form, whereby the hon. the Minister can direct one local authority to supply services to a scheme which is being developed in the area of another authority. There is no reason why one local authority, which is able to provide services when another one is not, should not perhaps do so. Obviously a new scheme must have services. But surely, Sir, this could be done by way of co-operation rather than by way of a direction from the Minister. I think the Minister has many examples of co-operation before him where problems have been overcome other than by the method of directing people to do something. The provision of water, that all-important thing, is mentioned in this provision. What about water&#x003F; Where a local authority is having difficulty in providing water for itself and the hon. the Minister decides to embark upon a scheme in an adjoining local authority, and finds that adequate water is not available for his scheme, is it right that he should have the power to direct the first local authority, which already has an inadequate water supply, to provide water for that scheme&#x003F; Surely those are things that are investigated before a scheme is planned&#x003F; If proper planning took place and the provision of these services was planned at the beginning and not at the end, because that is what this clause appears to provide for, surely it would have been quite unnecessary to have a provision such as this in the Bill.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the question of co-operation rather than coercion. The hon. the Minister, in his introductory speech, said that generally speaking there was co-operation but that a few local authorities and representative bodies did not agree with the Government&#x2019;s policy and were not co-operative enough and that he wanted all these powers to overcome that lack of co-operation. In my experience on a local authority&#x2014;it was not long, but long enough for me to get experience&#x2014;the delays that took place were mainly caused by the Government and not by the local authority. We have a classic example of that. During my period of office on the City Council of Durban we had a case where the hon. the Prime Minister as Minister of Native Affairs held up the building of the Umlazi Bantu Township for 12&#x00BD; years. When permission came through the houses were provided. The local authority wanted to provide those houses. I believe, generally speaking, all local authorities, who are concerned with the housing of their people, people of all racial groups, are keen and willing to supply housing for the various groups. But those are factors they have to take into consideration in their town planning. If the hon. Minister comes along and wants to superimpose a scheme which has not been considered in the Town Planning Office, he must expect that there will be a little arguing and negotiation and a little delay when the whole of the town-planning scheme of that local authority is altered to fit his scheme. You see, Sir, many of these schemes that the hon. Minister is envisaging now were never provided for in town planning, and so obviously there is going to be a difference of opinion. But surely that is a matter for negotiation and not a matter for coercion. That is my opinion, and I believe that <span class="col_5311-5312" refersTo="page_1348"/>the examples of what has been achieved in the way of housing of Bantu is something to be proud of. The hon. Minister of Bantu Administration is here. He knows that in a place like Johannesburg, which has a United Party town council, a lot has been achieved in the way of providing housing for the Bantu. I think the hon. Minister of Bantu Administration will agree with me that the bulk of that achievement has come about by way of co-operation and negotiation. Everybody wanted to build those houses and they have been provided to such a degree that it has become the show-piece of the Minister of Bantu Administration&#x2019;s Department and visitors to this country are taken there and shown over that scheme, to show the outside world what has been achieved. There have been differences of opinion, but in the long run and on the overall picture, with the willingness on all sides and everybody aiming at the same objective, namely to provide housing, a lot has been achieved. But I believe that this unfortunate approach of the hon. Minister whereby he takes unto himself powers, because of the few who he says resist, to use coercion and the big stick, puts more obstacles in the way than it removes. You know, Sir. we have still ringing in our ears the threat of this hon. Minister last year to the Natal Provincial Council when he said that he was going to force them to do these jobs which he wanted them to do on the question of the group areas proclamation. He could have achieved that. He knows why there was a delay. The hon. member for Natal (South Coast) (Mr. D. E. Mitchell) told him. It was this question of town planning &#x2026;</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>No, it was in connection with local authorities.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes. and also the holding up of the proclamation of group areas. I believe that this hon. Minister could achieve far more on a subject on which we are all agreed, the provision of housing, if he did it by co-operation rather than to incorporate these measures of coercion in this Bill.</p>

<p>Another aspect of this Bill I want to deal with and which I think is very important&#x2014; and it is a reason, too, why we welcome the Bill&#x2014;is that provision is made in this Bill to transfer to this Department of Housing those Acts which previously were administered by the Group Areas Development Board, in dealing with houses after a proclamation under the Group Areas Act. I think this is very important and I welcome the change, because in my opinion, and the opinion of most people who have had contacts with the G out Areas Development Board, the Group Areas Development Board has failed and has failed completely, and we sincerely hope that this change-over from the Group Areas Development Board in the handling of houses and schemes when once they have been proclaimed. will mean that we will now go ahead and get decisions made, which will save the country a lot of money, money which is being wasted at the moment. We hope they will get on with the job of providing houses and dealing properly with those houses. This side of the House has always asked for the development of this Government&#x2019;s policy of group areas by housing schemes rather than by the force of a Group Areas Development Board. I believe this is a wonderful opportunity for this hon. Minister to employ these powers in regard to housing correctly in order to get a great deal more co-operation from all of the people affected by these proclamations. But there is one question in my mind and that is this: I want this hon. Minister to give us reasons why, having failed in the administration of group areas development as Minister of Community Development, he thinks that he is going to succeed in his capacity as Minister of Housing. I think he should give this House the reasons for the change-over. Secondly, he should tell us why he thinks that it will work under his Ministry of Housing where he could not make it work under his Ministry of Community Development. I want to deal with a couple of aspects. I have made this statement that I believe that the Group Areas Development Board has failed. I believe that it has been a very expensive failure, not only in dealing with housing units which are so vitally required, but I believe also that it has cost this country a lot of money. Let me try and give one or two examples. There are very many more I can quote, but I want to give this House a sufficient idea of what I mean when I say that this board has failed.</p>

<p>Let us take the question of &#x201C;letting&#x201D;. This Bill empowers the housing section now to handle the question of letting. To get this in true perspective, what happened when an area was proclaimed and a member of the disqualified group wanted to dispose of his property&#x003F; He got an offer. When he had that offer, it had to be submitted to this board and then they decided whether they wanted to exercise their pre-emptive right or not. It is rather a strange feature. Sir, that in areas such as Isipingo Beach, for example, they exercise that pre-emptive right in almost every case, which means that although that area has been proclaimed for Indian ownership and occupation, very few Indians have been able to buy houses. The figures I got in Durban at the beeinning of this week show that approximately 24 houses had been sold to people who have made offers, but some 67 houses have been bought by the Group Areas Development Board. I may be a little out either one way or the other, but the point is that something like two-and-a-half times the number of houses that have been sold to private individuals have been bought in by the Group Areas Development Board. I do not know why that is so. But I want to put this to the hon. the Minister, that a practice has developed in the Group Areas Development Board that I hope will be stopped forthwith by the Department of Housing. That practice is that when they exercise their pre-emptive right there are cases <span class="col_5313-5314" refersTo="page_1349"/>in which the Group Areas Development Board has gone back to the person who made the offer to purchase and has re-offered him that same property at a higher price. This is a practice which I think is a shocking practice, because the Group Areas Development Board was not created for that purpose. I do not know who in future is going to make the decision whether the pre-emptive right should be exercised or not. Is it again to be the Group Areas Development Board or is that also going to be taken over by the Housing Board&#x003F; But the point is that the Group Areas Development Board takes half the profit, in other words, the amount over the determined value of the house&#x2014;they share half the profit with the seller of the house. If they exercise their pre-emptive right, they still get half of the profit. But when they resell it they take all the profit above the purchase price which they have paid for it, and which they have sold, in some cases perhaps to the same purchaser. So they have it both ways, and I think this is something to which the hon. the Minister should apply himself, and it should be stopped forthwith.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of letting. Let me quote a practical example which has just been brought to my notice. It is the case of a pensioner in the same Isipingo Beach area. His pension is R50 a month. He had purchased a home of his own and on that R50 per month he could afford to stay in it because he did not have to pay rent. Now the proclamation has come along saying that he is a disqualified person and he has to get out of Isipingo Beach at some time or another. Maybe he has not to get out immediately. But obviously he has to sell his house if he gets an offer which is reasonable. He got an offer and he took it along to the board, and they exercised their pre-emptive right and purchased it. Why they purchased it, I do not know, because they told him that he could stay in it, but the rental they wanted from him was R40 a month.</p>

<p>Can you give me the details&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I will get all those particulars for the hon. Minister. That rental is determined on the basis of recovering the capital outlay, I understand, in a period of 12y years. That man could afford to stay on under the old circumstances, but obviously he cannot afford to pay R40 a month, leaving him RIO a month for food and clothing, and what have you. So he said &#x201C;No, I have to get out, although I would like to stay&#x201D;. Because, Sir, in Durban this week the price of cement has gone up from 7s. 4d. a bag to 10s. a bag. Bricks are almost unobtainable. And in any case, from the price realized by him he cannot afford to build another house. So he approached the authorities in Durban, and he said: &#x201C;Look, when I move out of here, vandals are going to break the windows of this house, they are going to tear down the guttering and in a very short time it will have depreciated considerably in value. Why not let me stay on at a nominal rental, because you obviously have no use for this house at the moment. Let me stay on at a nominal rental and I will act as a caretaker and see that this house is not knocked about! &#x201D; They refused to do that. They said that their hands were tied and that they had no powers to do so. He had to get out and the very first week-end after that, every window in that house was smashed by vandals and a considerable amount of damage was done. Now this is not an isolated case at all. If you go and look at almost any property that is in the hands of the Group Areas Development Board, you will find that those houses are deteriorating at a rate which must be costing this country a lot of money. Why are they empty&#x003F; Surely the proclamation is the-e to rehouse a group which needs housing. But the change-over is just not coming.</p>

<p>Now the Bill provides for the selling of these properties. What is happening and what has been happening in cases of sales of these properties&#x003F; The board will not even take a client to see the house, because they say they are not allowed to transport people in Government motor vehicles. So they make an arrangement to meet the intending purchaser at the property. They will not give him the key to go and view the property himself. So this gentleman may drive out in a car, or has perhaps to catch a bus, and he meets them at the property. Have you ever heard of a business trying to sell property on that basis&#x003F; And then when they get there, vandals have probably knocked the windows out of the house, torn down the guttering, etc. Sir, you know as well as I do the damage they can do to a house. And this is the property that is offered to this gentleman to purchase. When they took it over it obviously was worth the money that the board paid for it. But when it is offered for sale on the same price-basis, of course it is not worth that money at all.</p>

<p>There is another aspect I want to bring to notice in regard to the question of selling. This hon. Minister&#x2019;s Department under this section took over a block of flats in Durban. This case was reported in the estate agents&#x2019; &#x2022;monthly journal. They took over a block of flats by exercising their pre-emptive right. What did they do&#x003F; They immediately put the rental up because they do not fall under rent control. Having done that, they reoffered those flats for sale and they found a purchaser, because it is a good block of flats in a good area. Fortunately for the intending purchaser at the last moment he found out that the moment he bought them they would fall back under rent control, and that the price that he was being asked for them would no longer be an economical price. I think those are aspects that the hon. Minister might also put right in considering this switchover.</p>

<p>Then we come to this question of rebuilding. I have already touched on it. I hope that the hon. Minister is going to concentrate on <span class="col_5315-5316" refersTo="page_1350"/>the resettling of people. I hope under this section the Minister is going to pay greater attention to people who are being moved out of their homes, whoever they may be. The question that should receive attention is whether they are able to re-establish themselves on anything like the same basis they are now living under. You see, Sir, if a man bought a house 20 years ago, he paid on the values of those days. When he sells now, he sells on the basis of a valuation which is laid down by the Department. I am not allowed to go into that now, but I will bring it up under the Minister&#x2019;s Vote, because I think the method and the manner in which valuations are being done is completely wrong.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Your valuators. But what happens&#x003F; He is getting a price for it to-day which is based in general terms on local valuations, more or less. Between that local valuation and present-day market values there is a margin, and that price he is offered, but the board takes half of that profit. So that a man who sells his property to-day for &#x00A3;2,000, making say &#x00A3;500 above the valuation, is actually getting back &#x00A3;1,750 and the board gets &#x00A3;250. I am taking the figure of &#x00A3;1,750, because in Isipingo to-day you find old houses. They cannot get a lot of money for them. Where is that man to-day going to re-establish himself on a home-ownership basis for &#x00A3;1,750&#x003F; Now if he has got a good job, the Housing Commission will finance him on an economic basis if he is earning under R180 a month. I accept that. But what about the man like this person who is getting a pension of R50 a month&#x003F; How is he to make up the difference between what he has got for his old-fashioned house and the house that he has got to build to re-establish himself and the price he has to pay for the land&#x003F; He cannot do it. This hon. Minister knows that you cannot even buy the smallest house in a White area to-day for much less than &#x00A3;3,000. And where is a pensioner with an income of R50 a month going to find the difference between &#x00A3;1,750 or even &#x00A3;2,000 or &#x00A3;3,000&#x003F; He cannot do it. So what is going to happen to him&#x003F; He has to live the rest of his life under conditions he never planned to live under. He has got to go into board and lodging or take a room somewhere. I believe these things should be dealt with.</p>

<p>The last point I want to make is the question which the hon. Minister himself raised, namely that he had introduced the amendment to allow for different types of houses to be built and to provide largely for wooden houses. I personally have no objections to wooden houses. At one time I was considering building one for myself, because I believe that built to the specifications that I would want, a wooden house would be very good. But there have been questions raised with me as to whether if they are built on this economic standard, which the hon. Minister will have to do obviously in most of his schemes, whether those houses are going to be 100 per cent from the point of view of verminproofing, fire-proofing and the like. I know the C.S.I.R. and the Department of Forestry are going into these matters, and I want to ask the hon. Minister to satisfy himself on that particular aspect before he embarks upon wooden houses. As I say, I personally have no objection. I believe that from an insulation point of view a wooden house will probably be much warmer in winter and it will probably be much cooler in summer, and it has certain advantages, great advantages, for instance that it can be erected very quickly and that it can be easily maintained.</p>

<p>The only house I possess is a wooden house.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#lewis">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>I do not want to go too far into these angles, but there is one aspect in regard to the type of house that I do want to go into. You know, Sir, in many of these schemes houses of concrete blocks have been erected, in others concrete houses have been erected because they are quick on the travelling mould idea, and in some cases brick houses have been built. But I think the hon. Minister should remember that more especially the poor groups, funnily enough, are not sharing equally in our present wave of prosperity and they have to buy houses on the basis that the hon. Minister in all seriousness is trying to provide for them, and I give him credit for that. But one of the things that worries me is that some of the houses I have seen in these schemes definitely will not last very long. I am sure that by the time the purchaser has paid for them in approximately 30 years&#x2019; time, they will have fallen down. Some of the concrete block houses that I have seen built in my opinion cannot stand for 30 years. The Minister may differ from me, but that is my opinion. So this person who is going to spend 30 years struggling on a small income to pay off a house of this type, which I think is shocking, and I refer particularly to the concrete block houses at the moment &#x2026;</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">LEWIS</person>:</from>

<p>Well, they are in the Minister&#x2019;s scheme. These people are purchasing these houses. They may be sub-economic. But I also want the Minister to go into the health aspect of those particular houses. That aspect will be dealt with more fully by a later speaker, but I have seen the conditions after a rainy period, especially in the Indian housing schemes in Durban, where the houses are shocking from a health point of view. A concrete block house tends to be damp and remain damp, because it holds the moisture and one of the biggest problems with a concrete block house is to waterproof it properly. If you go down the South Coast of Natal, you <span class="col_5317-5318" refersTo="page_1351"/>will see some very fine houses built of concrete blocks, but the walls have been tarred and blackened in an attempt to waterproof them. I personally believe that the brick house is the best house of all, but of course in certain cases of sub-economic schemes it is obvious that the Minister cannot go to those lengths. But I would ask him to pay particular attention to those particular aspects of housing.</p>

<p>The other aspects of the Minister&#x2019;s introductory speech to this Bill will be dealt with quite fully by speakers on this side and I do not intend to take up any further time of the House. So I would say in conclusion that we are going to support this Bill although we are not satisfied with various aspects and perhaps with the Minister&#x2019;s approach, and we will put amendments in the Committee Stage to try and put right what we think is wrong.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#van_rensburg">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN RENSBURG</person>:</from>

<p>The most important points of criticism raised by the hon. member who has just sat down in regard to group areas were the very reasons for his supporting this Bill and I am sure that he will therefore forgive me if I devote my time to the Bill which is now before the House.</p>

<p>Up to the end of the First World War we had no State support for housing in South Africa. National housing only started in 1920 on the coming into operation of the Housing Act which was placed on the Statute Book in that year and that was when national housing made its debut in South Africa. Since that time appeals have been made to the State from time to time and facilities for housing have been increased more and more in order to supply the growing housing needs of the country. During the Second World War the provision of housing practically came to a standstill. This resulted in a backlog as far as housing was concerned which was to take years to make up. Since the end of the Second World War industrial development in South Africa has taken place on an unparalleled scale and this fact has obviously increased the demand for housing in our industrial centres and our cities. This happened at a stage when we already had a very great backlog as far as housing in our urban areas was concerned. Since that time enormous amounts, which have often been mentioned in this House, have been spent on housing in South Africa. Housing is certainly a matter of real importance to the people, and it is regarded and dealt with as such by the State.</p>

<p>In 1957 a consolidating Act was placed on the Statute Book, an Act which at the same time also made provision for better and more extensive facilities to supply the growing need for housing in our country. The fundamental principle of the Housing Act of 1920 as well as the Housing Act of 1945 was that the provision of housing for the lower and middle income groups was the joint responsibility of local authorities and of the State. This principle was also extended by the 1957 legislation and it remains the most important principle of this amending measure which we are discussing here to-day. This legislation is now being adapted to the changed circumstances of these growing needs in respect of housing in the Republic of South Africa. The State is indicating in no uncertain terms by means of this Bill that it fully realizes its responsibility in regard to the increasing housing requirements of the people. But this legislation goes a step further. Its purpose is also to make local authorities realize their joint responsibility, a responsibility which they bear together with the State in regard to housing needs. In the meantime, the realization of the importance of housing and of the growing housing requirements of the people increased to such an extent that a separate Department of Housing was brought into being in, I think, 1961. As our economic growth and economic development has continued unceasingly under this present Government, care has been taken to ensure that the housing requirements of the people are met. This measure which is before us to-day is the fruit of the work of the Department of Housing which was established in 1961 and the fruit of the zeal of the National Government to comply with the housing needs of the people of South Africa. Indeed, there is progress in the country under a go-ahead Government, and when there is progress and growth in a country, it is just as obvious that this must lead to some extent to a shortage of housing.</p>

<p>This Bill once again evidences the earnestness with which the Government is tackling the housing problem in the country. As the hon. the Minister quite correctly stated, the purpose of this Bill is also to hasten the building of houses. It has in mind the elimination of all stumbling-blocks and obstacles standing in the way of the swift supplying of housing, obstacles which can result in delay in the implementation of housing schemes. The necessity for this is apparent from a recent statement made by the hon. the Minister to the effect that the Department of Housing is engaged upon an intensive campaign to encourage local authorities to supply the housing requirements of the people in their areas. In the eight urban centres of the Republic, schemes have been drawn up which are either already under construction or are still in the planning stage or in regard to which negotiations have still to be entered into with local authorities. These schemes made provision for the construction of more than 8,000 houses for Whites and more than 55,000 for non-Whites. All these schemes will be financed by the National Housing Fund.</p>

<p>Because the Department of Housing is occupied with these imaginative plans and because it has made this planning so thorough, I am sure hon. members will realize that it is necessary for the hon. the Minister and his Department to be given such powers as will be of assistance to them in the implementation of their task. These powers are given to them in terms of this Bill.</p>

<p><span class="col_5319-5320" refersTo="page_1352"/>It is true that the provisions of this Bill are such that there may be considerable interference in the sphere of local authorities. Nobody can or wants to deny this. But I say that there may be interference and I emphasize the word &#x201C;may&#x201D;. It does not have to take place. If local authorities realize the responsibilities which they bear together with the State as far as the provision of housing is concerned, and if they realize and do their duty in connection with the supplying of plots and necessary services, there need be no interference at all. In the event of its being contended that the aim of the hon. the Minister with this measure is to interfere deliberately with the affairs of local authorities, I want to deny it now. That is definitely not the purpose and the aim of the hon. the Minister. But if there are local authorities which neglect their duty, which are unwilling to do their duty or which delay unnecessarily the implementation of these building schemes, I am sure that hon. members will realize that the hon. the Minister will make use of the powers given to him by this Bill. No matter how unpleasant it may be for him and his Department to have to make use of those powers, he will simply have to make use of them. One can lead a horse to water but one cannot force it to drink. For that reason, and for that reason alone, will there be interference. They must be made to do their duty. I want to emphasize the fact therefore that there may be interference but that this does not necessarily have to happen. If local authorities are jealous of their rights&#x2014;and I take it that they are&#x2014;and want no State interference, then they must also act as the protectors of those rights and powers. To do so they must realize their duty in regard to housing and fulfil their obligations. I am sure that if they do this there will be no interference with their rights. The responsibility in this regard, therefore, rests squarely on their own shoulders.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) said that the Opposition do not like the provisions of Clause 4 although he did not elaborate in this regard. I find that Clause 4 has certain advantages in mind for the public and I really cannot understand why the hon. member has said that the Opposition are not particularly pleased about this clause. In terms of this clause the commission can now also amend the conditions in the case of existing schemes or make new conditions in connection with the utilization of large reserve funds which may have been built up in terms of these schemes. The purpose of the clause is obviously to assist local authorities to make use of these reserve funds in the interests and to the benefit of the people living under those schemes. Loans for various contracts in a city or town can now be consolidated and this may lead to a reduction in the rentals which tenants have to pay. This is actually to the advantage of those tenants. It may also eliminate the anomaly in that varying rentals are asked for the same type of house, as the hon. the Minister indicated yesterday, rentals which can be asked under various schemes in the same city or area, as is the case now. I think that the purpose is to eliminate these anomalies. But certain other services such as building a library or a clinic, to mention only one or two examples, can also be provided out of these funds in the interests of the people concerned. I cannot understand what the difficulty of the hon. member for Umlazi and the Opposition is in connection with this matter. I want to make it quite clear, if they have any difficulties in connection with the redemption period under the scheme or the rate of interest in regard to loans, that they must realize that those matters are not affected at all by these provisions; they remain constant.</p>

<p>I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on this legislation. I think it is a good measure which will enable the hon. the Minister to implement housing schemes in our country as soon as possible, and it is necessary that this be done. We know that a shortage of housing exists in certain areas in regard to certain groups. I am convinced that this measure will give the hon. the Minister the power to have these schemes implemented as soon as possible in the event of there being any deliberately unfair or unnecessary delay on the part of certain local authorities.</p>

<p>The point of view expressed by a member of this side of the House that, whilst one should not derogate from the value of the effort which the Minister is making in introducing some changes in the Housing Act in terms of this Bill in order to accelerate the provision of housing, his approach has nevertheless caused a certain amount of misgiving, in the view of this side of the House; and I am afraid that that is accentuated by what we have just heard from the hon. member who has just sat down. If the objective is to make use of the amendment to this Act by providing a whip which the Minister can hold over the backs of local authorities in order to whip them up or to take certain action on his own because of the fact that they are not carrying out their duty, then I think it is quite clear that there is very much more in some of these amendments than meets the eye. In fact, I take a very disturbed view of what the hon. member has said, disturbed in the sense that far from paying a tribute which the hon. the Minister somewhat grudgingly did in his opening speech, the hon. member who has just sat down has indicted local authorities for not having played their full part in the housing development of this country.</p>

<p>That interjection substantiates that I am justified in making the point I have made. There is no question that the Minister has found himself obliged&#x2014;and we commend him for the effort&#x2014;to take some steps to accelerate the provision of housing, but I do not think, as one listened to the review <span class="col_5321-5322" refersTo="page_1353"/>given of the history of the provision of housing by the State since 1920, that the position is any worse to-day than it was in 1945, when certain other amendments were passed, also with the object of accelerating housing. I do not think the position to-day is any more serious than it was then, because at that time we had a considerable number of young men who returned from the war, a large number of whom had married during that time and whose families had been looked after by their families during the absence of the breadwinner, and a considerable number of houses had to be found for those young men and women who required accommodation in the immediate post-war period. That was one of the objectives of the 1945 amending Act. In addition, we were faced with a considerable demand for housing in the industrial field to accommodate the hundreds of thousands of workers who had flocked into the various cities and towns in the country as the result of the tremendous industrial revolution that took place after the war. We were faced with considerable difficulties then because there were shortages of materials and manpower on an unparalleled scale. My criticism of the Minister is that, knowing what his Cabinet was planning in regard to immigration, knowing what it was planning in regard to Government works in order to put some vitality into the economic setbacks which this country had had for some years, knowing of the necessity for the internal reinvestment of moneys which had accumulated for some years and was lying idle in the banks and the other financial institutions, knowing of the tremendous schemes with regard to the provision of water which the Government intended to institute, knowing all this, and knowing of the shortage of both manpower and materials, the Minister has woken up a little bit late; although nevertheless one must at least commend the fact that he has woken up to the necessity for providing housing.</p>

<p>I say that a lot of what the Minister is now accusing the local authorities of failing to do is something which he might have planned himself. About a year ago there was no question of a shortage of housing in this country. In fact, I remember that a year ago flats were being provided in Johannesburg on lease for a year or two, with the first two or three months free of rental to the tenants, because it was difficult to fill the numerous flats that had become available because of certain setbacks the country had suffered. But the country did not at that time know what steps the Government had taken in order to bring about this tremendous revival economically, and also to provide additional immigrants.</p>

<p>As I was saying, this side of the House welcomes the steps taken to accelerate the provision of housing, but strongly deprecates the provisions in the Bill which emasculate still further the freedom and the work of the local authorities and the part they have played. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister, who seems to be unhappy about my point of view, firstly to the remarks of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East), who went out of his way to talk of the necessity to encourage the local authorities to provide housing, but said at the same time that the Bill provided certain powers for interference by the Minister in case they did not carry out their duties satisfactorily. There is a quotation from a decision of the Supreme Court in the Free State in 1941 in the case of Rex v. Bethlehem Municipality, which reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">A municipality is not merely a corporation like a company. It is a phase of government, local, it is true, but still government.</block>

<p>This particular quotation was made use of by no less a person than the very colleague to whom the Minister is now chatting, the Minister of Finance, in the very early stages of his authoritative book on municipal law. Well, we believe that local government has an important part to play, and we deprecate the provisions of this Bill which emasculate it of a great deal of its powers. The Minister also was not very happy about my reference to the question as to what the attitude of local authorities was with regard to housing and the part they played, and also in regard to the housing position just over a year ago.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, you looked very miserable. In February 1964, when we discussed the Rents Bill, the Minister made certain allegations in regard to local authorities, and said that he had sent circulars to councils in August 1962, and again in February 1963, urging them to give special attention to housing. The Johannesburg City Council, which was implicated by an interjection in that debate, and which obviously will be the subject of attack a little later, replied through its leader as follows. I quote from a Johannesburg newspaper&#x2014;</p>

<p>Mr. Widman to-day produced a letter sent to the council by the Secretary for Housing six days after the second circular (of 20 Febuary 1963) saying: &#x201C;In order to obviate inquiries, you are hereby notified that this circular does not apply to you.&#x201D;</p>

<p><span class="col_5323-5324" refersTo="page_1354"/>Then he proceeded to give a review of housing&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The council had responded to the first circular three months earlier with a review which pointed out what had been done about housing in the city. At that time there were 3,000 vacant flats in Johannesburg. In the five previous years 330 blocks of flats and 2,422 houses were built for a population increase equivalent to 2,600 families. During the period 622 houses were built, economic and sub-economic units, bringing the total of this type of housing in the city to 2,034.</block>

<p>What I would like to make clear is that there was at that time no actual shortage of housing. The local authorities had done their share. I think the local authorities of South Africa have made a most remarkable contribution in this field, and in fact the 1957 Consolidating Act, which consolidated and amended the Housing Acts which existed at that time, did nothing more than merely bring them together, with some slight amendments, and it received the approval of all sides of the House, because it was part of the State&#x2019;s policy for a period of nearly 40 years, and during all that time, with shortages even more severe than now, the local authorities have fully played their part. What is disturbing is that the Minister, instead of inviting the continued co-operation of local authorities, is virtually saying to them. &#x201C;Either, or&#x201D;, and I think that is not a sound approach by a State Department. The Minister is obviously a little unhappy about certain of the machinery of the Group Areas Act.</p>

<from>The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>Now tell me where you get that from.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#miller">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MILLER</person>:</from>

<p>Well, it is quite clear. The Minister himself referred in his speech to the fact that some councils did not approve of the rehousing of people and he referred to some of the difficulties under the Group Areas Act. We know that he has taken many functions of the Group Areas Development Board under the wing of his Housing Department, but if he is going to use this Bill to give him further powers over municipalities, it is certainly not a satisfactory feature of the Bill. It seems to me part of an ever-increasing process to bring the whole of the life of a community under the complete bureaucratic control of a Department, and to diminish and destroy the content and purpose of local authorities, which after all represent a taxpaying electorate and a parochial community concerned particularly with its own interests.</p>

<p>Just to deal with some of the clauses of the Bill, in Clause 4, which the Minister says has as its purpose the possibility of being able to divert reserve funds which have accumulated over long periods to reduce rentals and to provide additional facilities, we think that, after having entered into an agreement providing the specific terms and conditions under which a loan is granted for a scheme, and the scheme having been carried out and the terms of the agreement having been complied with, it is wrong that the State should be able unilaterally to change any of the terms and conditions of the agreement. First of all, it is an unheard of thing in our law that there should be unilateral action in doing these things. Sir, if you enter into a bilateral agreement, both sides should consent, and if the hon. the Minister finds that there are reserve funds which have accumulated over a period under certain provisions of that agreement, I cannot conceive that any local authority would not be prepared to co-operate with the State Department in bringing about a change in those provisions if it is to the advantage of its citizens and in the interests of the scheme. To ride roughshod over a local authority if it does not comply with the Minister&#x2019;s request is, I think, high-handed. There are other ways of doing it. For instance, one might conceive of the hon. the Minister wishing to change certain things with the consent of the Administrator, who himself is very often a party to the housing schemes and who has to give his approval to whatever the council wishes to undertake in this field. But he does not even provide for that; he only provides that after consultation with the Administrator he has the right, without the consent of the local authority, to do these things. The same criticism applies to Clause 6. Formerly, if the commission carried out a scheme and wanted to hand it over to a local authority, it could only do so, should the local authority refuse, after the consent of the Administrator had been obtained. The hon. the Minister now changes that. He will now be able to do it after consultation only with the Administrator. He is removing all obstacles which may prevent him from dealing with local authorities as he wishes to do. We think that this is a very unsavoury feature of this legislation. The same criticism will apply to Clause 13. At the present moment local authorities enter into a bilateral agreement to carry out certain services for each other, but in terms of this Bill the Minister, if he feels that certain conditions prevail which do not permit of the provision of services, will be able to direct the Secretary to instruct a local authority to carry out those services. Sir, in the course of his speech the hon. the Minister talks about &#x201C;normal tariffs&#x201D; and, strangely enough, in his amended clause he talks about &#x201C;reasonable tariffs&#x201D;. In other words, the tariffs will fall largely within the Minister&#x2019;s own discretion. This amendment is in line with the suggestion made in the course of his speech by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg) that it is necessary for the Minister to hold a whip-hand over local authorities so that nothing can stand in his way.</p>

<p>I would like now to spend a few minutes dealing with the question of wooden housing, which is not entirely a new idea in South <span class="col_5325-5326" refersTo="page_1355"/>Africa. It is an idea which was very fully canvassed in South Africa after World War II, but nevertheless I want to commend the Minister for having the courage to proceed with this idea. In the immediate post-war years wood could not be treated properly against an infestation of insects, but it is possible to do so nowadays. I remember that after 1945, when there was a tremendous demand for housing for ex-servicemen, a wooden housing scheme was contemplated but unfortunately the local authorities at that time could not take the risk of allowing wooden houses to be erected because of the risk of fire and the risk of termites. To-day, however, we have the experience of other countries to guide us in this connection; we can benefit from the experience of Australia, which has had 1,500,000 immigrants over the last 15 or 16 years, and we can benefit from the experience of Canada which has had nearly 2,500,000 immigrants over the last 15 or 16 years. The Minister will find, however, that houses will not be constructed entirely of wood. In the countries to which I have referred there is quite an interest in the building of what is known as brick-and-wood houses. Portions of the house are constructed of brick but there are also large portions, particularly the inner walls, which are constructed of wood. These brick-and-wood houses present a very pretty sight and they have contributed a great deal to the aesthetic beauty of housing in those countries. I sincerely hope that the same thing will apply in South Africa as well.</p>

<p>At this stage I would like to indicate to the hon. the Minister that we intend to move amendments to this Bill, not with the object of hindering him in his object to accelerate the provision of housing but with the object of leaving the local authorities the dignity which they have enjoyed over the many years and with the same opportunity to render services to the community, without constantly feeling that they are under the whip-lash of the Government. Sir, the hon. the Minister said in February when the Rents Bill was before the House that his experience was that it was not Nationalist-controlled councils that did not co-operate with him but councils which were dominated by other political groups. That remark leaves one with the unpleasant feeling that much of this type of legislation is intended to curb still further any opposition that the Government might encounter, even to its thinking, in local authorities. One feels that this is an endeavour to make local authorities virtually the slave of the statutory demands of the Government.</p>

<speech by="#bezuidenhout">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BEZUIDENHOUT</person>:</from>

<p>I am very grateful for the fact that we can pride ourselves on having a Minister of Housing who has the capability to deal with this important matter of housing. We are also very grateful for the fact that he undertook a very extensive tour abroad to study housing problems there with a view to applying the results of his study in this country. We are also very grateful for the fact that the two partners in this matter, the Housing Commission and the local authorities, have been doing such excellent work in coping with the housing problem in this country. If it had not been for the fact that the Housing Commission co-operated with the local authorities we would certainly never have been able to solve the housing problem. It is a great pity, however, that there are certain local authorities which are adopting a very stubborn attitude and creating problems for the Government. I am sorry, Sir, that I have to refer here to the hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) because I do not want to attack that hon. member or the Johannesburg City Council, but I think the hon. member for Florida did the wrong thing here in trying to misrepresent the words of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) (Mr. van Rensburg). He alleges that the speech of the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) created the impression that this legislation was going to be used as a stick with which to beat the local authorities. The hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) stated very clearly that if the local authorities were stubborn and refused to co-operate with the commission in tackling the housing problem, the Minister would be able to make use of the powers granted to him in this Bill. Sir, I think the hon. member will concede that if there is one person who can speak with authority on the application of this Act on the strength of experience in connection with this matter, it is I.</p>

<p>I want to come back to Clauses 4 and 13, the two clauses to which the Opposition have the strongest objection. The hon. member who has just sat down asked why the hon. the Minister wanted to incorporate Clause 4 in this Bill. Sir, the hon. member served for years on the Johannesburg City Council, and I want to put this question to him: Is the position not that the city councils are frequently unable to make up their mind&#x003F; They postpone the matter from meeting to meeting; they quarrel and they arrive at no decision, and in the meantime this problem grows from day to dav. The public does not look to the city council to solve the housing problem; it looks to the Minister. That is why I think it is absolutely essential for the hon. the Minister to have the powers contained in Clause 4 so that he will have a weapon which he will be able to use if he thinks it is in the interests of the community and of the country and so that he will be able to say to the local authority, &#x201C;If you refuse to co-operate I am going to take over this work myself&#x201D;. We must not regard the housing shortage as a local problem but as a national problem, as a problem which affects the whole nation, and I think those two hon. members are too parochial in their outlook as far as this problem is concerned.</p>

<p>But I want to come to Clause 13. Sir, the greatest curse in our country to-day is this question of municipal boundaries in our large industrial complexes. In Clause 13 the power is now being given to the hon. the Minister, <span class="col_5327-5328" refersTo="page_1356"/>when a housing project is being tackled within the boundaries of one local authority, to intervene if the water and the power for such a housing project can be supplied more cheaply by a neighbouring local authority. The hon. member for Florida knows that there are such cases. He knows that there are many cases on the Witwatersrand where municipal areas are separated just by a street or streets. The water and power supplies of the one local authority may be very far away from the housing project which is being undertaken in that particular municipal area. It is in cases of that kind that the hon. the Minister will be able to make use of this power. The hon. member knows that one local authority cannot exercise its powers within the area of jurisdiction of another local authority. That power is now being given to the Minister specifically in this clause, and as we know the hon. the Minister we know that he is not going to use that power in an autocratic way. He will use this power in consultation with the city councils. Sir, it is not only under the r&#x00E9;gime of the National Party Government that difficulties have been experienced with city councils which refuse to carry out the Government&#x2019;s policy. I think we must all admit to-day that never before has there been such fine co-operation between all city councils in the Republic of South Africa, whichever party may be in the majority in the council, and the Government of the day. But problems do arise from time to time and it is necessary to have legislation to be able to deal with those problems as and when they arise. So much with regard to Clauses 4 and 13. I would even go so far as to say that the hon. the Minister should substitute the words &#x201C;the cheapest tariff&#x201D; for the words &#x201C;reasonable tariff&#x201D;. We want the cheapest tariff to be applied because we are dealing here with the nation&#x2019;s housing and not with purely local government matters. Sir, there is not such a tremendous shortage of housing at the present time as hon. members on that side try to suggest. If we want to talk about a shortage of housing, then we must go back to the war years; there was a great shortage of housing at that time, but we are not going to blame the Opposition for it. The hon. member says that there was no shortage of housing a year ago, but what has the private sector been doing&#x003F; The private sector has been building luxury flats only, and the worker has simply not been able to afford to have a house built for himself. What the National Housing Commission is doing now is to make the necessary provision so that the workers can acquire their own homes. We can pride ourselves on the houses which have been erected in recent times for our people by these two partners, the local authority and the Government, with the National Housing Commission acting as the Government&#x2019;s agent. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister on the fact that he held discussions with the Administrators of the four provinces to expedite the laying out of new townships. Hon. members who have served on local authorities know how we struggled to have townships proclaimed. They know what problems there were in connection with this matter. To-day the hon. the Minister comes along and tells us that he obtained the co-operation of all four Administrators and that the proclamation of townships will be expedited in the future. Sir, is that not a great forward step&#x003F; Is that not something of which we can be proud&#x003F; It only shows once again what can be achieved through co-operation. But I should also like very much to sound a warning note here to the hon. the Minister. In embarking upon this planning I just want to warn against poor planning. We are told that this planning will be completed within three months. We know that this planning is urgent and essential but I do want to ask the hon. the Minister to see to it, when townships are laid out, that they comply with all the modern requirements of town planning. We must not make the mistake which was made after the war years when there was also a housing shortage in this country and when certain townships were laid out without proper planning. Those townships have degenerated to-day into White locations where we are faced with great problems and difficulties. I want to urge upon the hon. the Minister therefore to see to it that new townships which are laid out comply with the modern requirements of town planning. We must see to it that they also comply with the requirements of the various Government Departments and with the requirements of trade and industry.</p>

<p>Finally I want to make just one further appeal to the hon. the Minister. I do feel that the time has come when a commission of inquiry should be appointed to investigate the various aspects of the provision of housing. Take the question, for example, of the maximum income which has been laid down at R180 per month. I feel that that figure is too low and that it should be increased considerably. Then I want to ask the hon. the Minister whether the amount of money which is made available for the building of houses is not too low. After all, we do not want to build houses which in a few years&#x2019; time will no longer adorn the neighbourhood but which will change new townships into White locations.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>This Bill, I think, provides an opportunity to discourse upon the question of housing and to put forward propositions and suggestions which will fall in line with the propositions put forward by the hon. the Minister in the Bill and bring about a more rapid development in the construction of housing. Sir. it has been my good fortune to visit many countries in the world to go into this very subject and I hope to-day that the hon. the Minister will take some cognizance of the points I raise because after spending over 20 years dealing with the provision of housing I do know what the snags are and I think I can assist the Minister in getting some of these difficulties out of the way.</p>

<p><span class="col_5329-5330" refersTo="page_1357"/>I propose to deal first of all with the question of substitute materials. Much has been said here in favour of wood. I would like to put it to the Minister that in exempting local authorities from their own by-laws, rules and regulations in connection with standards, he is only tackling half the problem because there are many people in private enterprise who are quite willing to build and who have some very good ideas as to what can be done with substitute materials and with modern methods. Last year when the hon. the Minister was in the city of which I was then the mayor I hoped to be able to show him what had been done, not what we hoped to do or what we proposed should be done. A tremendous programme spread over 20 years had been embarked upon and the result is that a new city has arisen in the place of one which had fallen on difficult days. I want to take one or two examples because I find that an example is the best way of illustrating a point. I can show the hon. the Minister properties built in the divisional council area of Kimberley where the brickwork is single-row brick reinforced with steel and flat sheets and steel mesh. These have been built with the express purpose of bringing the price down. The hon. the Minister and the Department of National Housing are trying very earnestly to bring the cost of construction down, and we have got to the stage now where we are in what we might call the sub-economic group where substitute materials in the shape of cement blocks, ash-concrete blocks and suchlike have been used profusely. But these houses are really not suitable because they have no ceilings, no inside doors, no washing facilities, and the tap is a long way down the road. In constructing houses for Bantu that particular aspect was noticed a long while ago, and the Minister himself said in a very short statement in the House last year that the Department had reached the stage where they could now build economically and that sub-economic housing would only be undertaken in special cases&#x2014;or words to that effect. I want to put it to the Minister that the real method of tackling this problem is not to get the cost of construction down but to use the methods and the materials which are used by private builders. I think it is a mistake to confine the building of houses exclusively to the local authorities and to the commission, except perhaps in the case of the very low income groups. My reason for saying that is this. The hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) spoke a moment ago about White locations. The great difficulty is the tremendous number of houses of exactly the same type and standard, row upon row. When we bring down the costs and push down the standards we create a very fruitful field for the identical conditions we are hoping to eliminate. Sir, let us trace what happened because of delays, and here I want to defend the municipalities. In my experience municipalities are as conscious of the need for housing as the Government and they are prepared to do their stuff. Sir, a municipality wishes to build a township on a given piece of land. This business of a housing shortage is not new; it dates back to 1920, as the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) pointed out: It is nobody&#x2019;s fault: We are a growing country and houses are necessary. What happened in the old days&#x003F; A local authority lays out a plan, and it used to take a very long time to get the surveyor-general to approve of the diagram. That has now been eliminated. Now the plan is presented to the provincial administration. I think I can say on the very soundest grounds that the delays in this province&#x2014;I do not know anything about the other provinces&#x2014;have been shortened to a considerable extent, largely due to the fact that ten years ago the Townships Board was streamlined and was made part and parcel of the local government section in the province. If it has deteriorated since then the hon. the Minister will know exactly where to look for the reason. But the provincial administration finds itself in the position, as does the local authority, that these plans have to be submitted to a number of Government Departments, which take ages to indicate their requirements. I think that is the reason why the Minister is asking for this power. I notice that in introducing the Bill he said that he was amending the law to provide that he and the Administrator will consult. We will discuss the details at the Committee Stage. Sir, the State Departments camp out on these plans, and I think the Minister might do well to look into that aspect before acting on the assumption that the plan is in order. We have had many examples where planning has been overridden by authorities and where we get a botched-up job. Well, the plan is approved now and the local authority decides to proceed with the building of the houses. Here the hon. the Minister can short-circuit the procedure considerably if he would arrange for standards to be set by his Department within which the local authority could work, because under the present circumstances, although there are local officers who deal with housing schemes and housing plans and do act as vets in the preparation of plans, they really have no authority. All these plans are submitted to Pretoria. Subsequently tenders are called for and the municipality recommends what should be accepted. It then goes back to the commission. Although the commission protests that they realize that the costs are different in the various centres in the Republic, they ignore that fact, when it comes to the consideration of tenders. Because of difficulties on the site and other difficulties, prices vary. The proposition is then put forward that some modification should be made. My suggestion, for the consideration of the Minister, is, that when the plans are drawn, within specifications which are laid down by his own Department, within limits which can be followed by the local authority, tenders should be called for and the complete scheme should then be submitted to the commission <span class="col_5331-5332" refersTo="page_1358"/>for approval, because the lowest tender in the case of public tenders is the best price. I wish to digress here for one moment to explain an interjection made by the Minister the other day. Two years ago a scheme was suggested at the request of the Housing Commission. The commission decided that they would acquire the land, which was sold to them and there was no argument. They subsequently came back and asked for the price to be reduced, which was done. Two different men did the negotiating. The reduction was granted by a man whom the Minister chose to attack. Tenders were called for; it was a matter of urgency; it was a housing scheme for aged people. The municipality had agreed to waive its regulations to keep the price down. The cost that was set upon the houses was R2,000 per house. When tenders were called for the tender price was R2,200. There were three tenders. The one man withdrew because of an error and the other man packed up for some other reason, which may have been that he did not have the finance, and the last man was asked to stand by but the plan was never proceeded with. This was done as a matter of urgency; everybody pitched in to help. Everybody thought we would have this housing scheme under construction in double quick time. The thing is dying. I want to be fair and reasonable. There may be other reasons. The other, day the hon. the Minister told me that in the particular city I know so well only his Department had &#x201C;built for White&#x201D;. I want to defend that city. For over 20 years that city has had the happiest of relations with the Government Department responsible for Housing. There have never been any arguments or disputes. That particular city has spent on housing no less a sum than R13,000,000 over the last few years. Some of this was provided by the National Housing Commission and some by private enterprise.</p>

<p>The group earning R180 and under, mentioned by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout) was the subject of an investigation by the Church. That Church reported that it was necessary to make provision for these people. Within a matter of months two blocks of flats were under construction and we hope they will be ready for occupation before very long. It is no good starting tilting at each other about whose fault it is without a full knowledge of the facts. I have the minutes of the particular council meeting where the Housing Commission admitted that the city council had done a good job.</p>

<speech by="#eden">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EDEN</person>:</from>

<p>That will be the appropriate time. What I am trying to establish is this: There are local authorities who have had every possible type of experience in the construction of houses, in the building of townships and in planning. They can give good, sound and solid advice. There is nothing much wrong with the Bill. It needs a little amending here and there. The amendments will be introduced and we shall have some very interesting discussions. But the point at issue is this. We in this country will persist in talking about sub-economic housing when what we really have are sub-economic tenants. The sub-economic tenant is the problem not the sub-economic house. Where we have sub-economic housing the local authorities must of necessity be careful because the losses of those schemes have to be met by their general funds and by their rates. That means that the urban area, as such, is providing all this housing, at a considerable cost to itself and carrying all the losses.</p>

<p>I want to put this to the Minister: When the Minister of Bantu Administration and Development, at that time decided to do away with sub-economic housing in the case of the Bantu, a tremendous step forward was taken. The result has been that schemes have been constructed: Thousands and thousands of houses have been built and they are economic. The hon. the Minister says he is taking power to level the rents. That is also a point that needs very careful examination, because the problem is that it is extremely difficult to average rents on account of the fact that some townships were built when costs were different. Some local authorities have already tried to average their rents, but they found themselves in the position that there were housing schemes built in bygone days, schemes where the rents were low, and newer schemes where the rents were of necessity higher, although not very much. I shall therefore be pleased to learn from the hon. the Minister how he is going to do the averaging and whether the averaging will always be on the downward basis at the expense of the local authority&#x003F; I can assure you, Sir, that housing, from a local authority point of view, especially sub-economic housing, is a very costly business. Local authorities are saddled with all sorts of expenses and when sub-economic housing falls upon their shoulders many of them find it impossible to carry the burden.</p>

<p>In the Karoo towns the housing made available to Coloured people is mostly of the two-roomed type, with a galvanized iron roof, and is an oven in the summer and a refrigerator in the winter. There are no inside doors, no ceilings and no floors. It sometimes happens that the man has a bigger family than anticipated. In a circular from his Department the hon. the Minister says that if a survey is taken of people with big families additional money can be provided. It happens, Sir, that a township is built to accommodate a particular group of people, particularly in <span class="col_5333-5334" refersTo="page_1359"/>view of the Group Areas Act under which people are forced out of the White areas. [Interjections.] I do not want to get mixed up in the political aspect. This is actually what is happening. When a local authority applies for additional funds I think the Minister will find that money is available at economic rates.</p>

<p>One final observation. I want to make a special appeal to the hon. the Minister to discuss the following point with the Administrators: When the Bureau of Standards sets a standard of materials, it should be applicable to all sections of the community and not only to local authorities and National Housing townships.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#schlebusch">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. A. SCHLEBUSCH</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, it is true that there is a serious housing shortage in some parts of the country. We realize how essential it is to provide the people with proper housing and that is why everything possible should be set in motion to provide that housing. All stumbling blocks should be removed. I therefore regard this legislation as one of the most important pieces of legislation we have ever placed on the Statute Book. We know that unnecessary delays in the erection of housing schemes often take place; sometimes the necessary co-operation on the part of a local authority is lacking. We must do everything in our power in every respect to do away with all the red tape and the stumbling blocks which are in the way of providing the necessary housing. Housing is definitely a matter of national importance. There is no question about the autonomy of municipalities being affected here. The Bill is very clear on that point; it is only where there is unnecessary delay in connection with the laying out of a township and the planning and such like that notice will be served at a certain stage.</p>

<p>This Bill contains two important provisions. The one will do away with unnecessary delays and the other provides that as far as existing schemes are concerned more favourable arrangements can be made with tenants. That is Clause 4. There is another matter I wish to raise. The first has been explained very fully by the hon. member for Bloemfontein (East) and I shall accordingly not cover the same ground. The matter I wish to touch upon is the following: Our urban areas often have small-holding areas adjoining them. These peri-urban areas often have the necessary water and they can often become fine residential areas in all respects, residential areas that will serve the urban area well, in that the labour forces serving that urban area can be accommodated there. We know that special and favourable conditions apply to such peri-urban small-holding communities for which we are very grateful to the Minister. However, I wish to ask the hon. the Minister whether it will not be possible to increase the amount of the loan in connection with areas which are very closely situated to municipal areas, areas where they have the necessary water facilities and the like, so that those loans are similar to the Housing Commission loans. I am only asking for this to be done in respect of those areas which are closely situated to a municipal area and areas which may perhaps ultimately be brought under the control of that municipal area. I think the best type of house should be built there and that is why I am asking the Minister whether it is not possible to include them in the urban areas for loan purposes. The question has now been approached from all angles and I regard it as a privilege to be able to say that I believe this will be an improved Act on our Statute Book. We gladly give it our support.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, I support the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) (Mr. J. A. Schlebusch) in his plea that attention should be given to the peri-urban areas, especially those near the larger cities. It has been found, in the case of Johannesburg, that the very lack of such facilities as water and power, is the obstacle which prevents the local authority from incorporating such a peri-urban area. It is just not economic. Unless the State is prepared to assist by way of globular grants-in-aid to enable a local authority to incorporate the kind of peri-urban area that the hon. member for Bloemfontein (District) is thinking about in relation to Bloemfontein, and the kind that I am thinking about in relation to Johannesburg, that local authority will not be prepared to do it. I have seen that over and over again. The fact is, that as a rule, these areas are now in a position where water has to be provided by a borehole, etc., but if they are incorporated in a municipality they expect the same facilities as those provided to all the other ratepayers in the municipal area. That means that the local authority is compelled to extend to them all the facilities, such as power, water and transport, and as far as Johannesburg is concerned it is such an uneconomic proposition that, with the best will in the world, they cannot do it unless the State is prepared to make a capital grant-in-aid and say: &#x201C;Now you take in this particular peri-urban area and we shall provide the capital costs so that you will not be unduly burdened&#x201D; which means the ratepayers will not be unduly burdened.</p>

<p>I would like to reply to two points raised by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Bezuidenhout). I am sorry he is not in the House at the moment. He asked for a commission of inquiry into the question of housing with special reference to the provision of housing for the income group below R180 per month. I support that too, Sir; I think we all support that. But I must say, having regard to the fact that we on this side of the House have&#x2014;during this week&#x2014;asked for two commissions of inquiry and have had both turned down, I do not fancy the hon. member&#x2019;s chances&#x2014;unless it is going to be a <span class="col_5335-5336" refersTo="page_1360"/>case of &#x201C;third time lucky!&#x201D; I do not think the hon. the Minister will give him the inquiry he asks for any more than the other Ministers gave us the inquiries we asked for.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Brakpan asked for a special commission of inquiry. If the Minister does not like that, I think he must direct his distaste of the idea to the hon. member for Brakpan.</p>

<p>The other point the hon. member raised was in connection with the boundaries of municipalities. He said, in effect, &#x201C;the curse of the country were the boundaries of municipalities.&#x201D; He went on to point out that in many cases one municipality ended on one side of the street and the contiguous municipality began on the other side. That is perfectly true, particularly in the Witwatersrand-Pretoria complex. I wonder whether that argument of his in support of Clause 13, which I for one reject, should not have been considered in regard to the repeated requests of the local authorities in that same Witwatersrand / Pretoria complex that that complex should be considered as one area for other purposes, such as influx control and the free movement of Bantu from the one municipality to the other. This has been a long-standing problem. The Government is not prepared to listen to any plea on that score; so I would be very interested to know he can justify this complete disregard for the boundaries of the local authorities and the municipalities in the case of the intrusion that the Minister&#x2019;s Department will make into the affairs of those local authorities when the Government refuses, for different reasons entirely, to allow that same kind of uniformity to operate over these areas.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSHEL</person>:</from>

<p>You cannot separate the one from the other. I do not think I am at all mixed up about this. I want to put it to the hon. the Minister that however much this Bill will assist in the provision of housing, it is not going to help to the extent that it could have helped, had the policy of his Department and of the Commission taken a different direction. I have urged on the Minister before today, more particularly before he went on his European trip, that he should seriously consider the provision of the multistorey type of dwelling rather than the single unit type, on the ground. As far I can make out, Sir, the attitude is that we in South Africa&#x2014;more particularly the Afrikaner&#x2014;like to have that little piece of earth: he likes to live on the ground, so we must build houses under the policy of one to a certain area of land. But the hon. the Minister himself pointed out in March last year, in para. 4 of a circular headed &#x201C;Facilities for the Provision of Housing out of State Funds for Families in the Lower Income Group&#x201D; that&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The lack of suitable residential erven at reasonable prices appears to be one of the main causes of the housing shortage in most centres where shortages exist.</block>

<p>This is known to the Minister and his Department. Surely the hon. the Minister knows that, unlike others this shortage cannot be alleviated by increased productivity or stepping up the production of a commodity&#x2014;the ground, the earth, is there; you cannot expand or stretch it. I would say that since World War I we have moved out of the agran economy in which South Africa then was. We are very definitely in the industrial era of our expansion, and in the industrial era of our economy. So, whether we like it or not, we are going to continue to develop concentrated local populations where the industries are, and where the work happens to exist. Surely the hon. Minister knows that. Yet he seems to be hanging on to this idea that if you have an acre of land near a city like Cape Town, for example, and you think that is convenient and suitable because it happens to be reasonably near the industrial area of the city, and because transport is available, you must then proceed to provide, say, 20 houses on that acre of land. This is eventually going to catch up with the Department of Housing whether the Minister is prepared to recognize it or not.</p>

<p>I am very surprised that in view of the fact the Minister visited, according to the Press reports, Britain and Europe, including Greece, Italy, West Germany and the Netherlands, he did not see for himself that these things I have urged upon him last year and the year before, are certainly worth some serious consideration. I do not know whether he went to the City of Bremen, for example, in Germany. I do not know whether he saw a housing scheme there of which I have the description here. I also happen to have seen it, not only at the time when it was built. The authorities refer to it as&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Europe&#x2019;s largest contiguous housing project, the Neue Vahr suburb in Bremen, has been completed. Approximately 35,000 people live in the 10,000 flats and row houses of this most modern suburb in Bremen.</block>

<p>And I can vouch for its modernity and for its accessibility to the city of Bremen&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Officially the satellite city of the City of Bremen has been opened on 12 August 1962.</block>

<p>Then they go on to explain that it cost approximately R60,000,000 in our currency, and that 40,000 fiats were provided through the German counterpart of our National Housing Commission; that it is situate on approximately 22,000,000 square feet of meadow land, which is about 550 acres of ground.</p>

<p><span class="col_5337-5338" refersTo="page_1361"/>Here is a case where, because of the fact that the ground is used to the greatest advantage by the concentration of dwellings, it is possible to provide the type of amenities which our Housing Commission, up to now, has hardly been able to consider providing. We do not build the kind of housing projects they build in Europe or America, Sir; we just build houses, as a rule. We do not build those housing projects because not enough ground is available&#x2014;let alone the capital. In this satellite city they have provided not only for two water courses and a 1,200 feet long artificial lake, but they have landscaped the area into several spacious parks and they have provided a modern shopping centre; there is a building where doctors have their consulting rooms. They have done all these things, Sir, and I maintain they have done it at a lower cost per dwelling unit than the National Housing Commission is going to build houses at Bosmansdam. Where is the difficulty&#x003F;</p>

<p>Well, I could read the <i>Burger</i>&#x2014;that would be even worse. It says&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; where it would put up the houses and also put lots at the disposal of people for building on 90 per cent loans.</block>

<p>I maintain that whether it was a case of plots, lots, houses of dwelling units, the Minister is going to use this accessible area of land, accessible to the industrial areas of the Cape Peninsula, to put up houses. It says nothing about any multi-storey housing. I again say that in the long run, perhaps in the next ten or 15 years, it will be found that this land has not been put to the best advantage. If the hon. the Minister is going to put up any multistorey accommodation there, then surely he is entitled to say so. I have not prevented or discouraged him from saying so. Why I raise this&#x2014;I did it last year and the year before&#x2014;is in order to get a reaction from the hon. the Minister. But he goes to Europe, according to this report, sees the very things that I, for one&#x2014;and I am not the only one&#x2014;have urged upon him in 1961, 1962, 1963 and again in 1964, and he is not prepared to comment on it! So I have to tell him that the kind of housing development we are indulging in today is completely <i>pass&#x00E9;;</i> he knows it. He can come with all the &#x201C;prefabs&#x201D; in the world, but he is misusing a limited area of land near an industrial area because of his insistence on houses, separate from one another, each one on its individual plot. If the Minister did not see for himself that this was the position in Europe, then I can only say that I am blessed if I know what he did look at in Europe!</p>

<p>Germany, having a growing economy, as we claim to have here, had to develop very rapidly after the war, and of all the European countries Germany had the best opportunity to ascertain what was the best use to which land could be put in regard to the provision of housing. You have the city of Kiel which, as the northern part of West Germany. They followed the example of Bremen. On a base the Minister will know if he visited it, is in area of approximately five square kilometres a new suburb for 40,000 inhabitants is being built there to-day. In fact, I think it is completed. Many suggestions for the project were taken from this very satellite city of Neue Vahr near Bremen. Furthermore&#x2014;and the Minister may confirm this if he went to Sweden&#x2014;we find the same thing in the Swedish &#x201C;experimental city&#x201D; of Farsta outside Stockholm where, for example, they provide for eight residential districts of 1,000 to 2,000 dwelling units each. All these districts will be given shopping centres, day-nursery homes, parks and so forth. I want the Minister to <span class="col_5339-5340" refersTo="page_1362"/>stand up in this debate, or when he replies, and say that these are the facilities that are being provided, in addition to the houses that are being planned now, whether at Bosmansdam or anywhere else. At Farsta they provide, in addition to what I have already mentioned, playgrounds for children, sport facilities and park areas, departmental stores. Every kind of facility is provided that town planners do provide if they try to create something which will be functional as well as pleasant to live in, rather than the kind of housing that, I am afraid to say, we provide in South Africa. The fact of the matter is that we provide housing in this country as an emergency. We do it out of sheer desperation, either because we have to clear a slum, and accommodation has to be provided in place of the accommodation demolished, or because we have a wave of immigration and something has to be provided for the immigrants&#x2014;that is a measure of desperation. There are different ways of approaching this question of housing. A house is eventually a home for somebody. With a certain given amount of money and a certain limited area of ground, it is possible&#x2014;and this has been demonstrated in a dozen of European countries and elsewhere&#x2014;to provide more than a collection of 200 or 300 houses. Surely that is the objective the Department should be aiming at.</p>

<p>I can give the Minister evidence of this, and evidence from my own observations&#x2014; evidence I can support with facts; so could he, firstly, if he had seen some of these projects, as he must have done, and secondly, if he had an open mind about it. I say that whatever this Bill may do it will not shift the emphasis which the Minister seeks to place on the singleunit type of accommodation which I say is uneconomical and completely out of keeping with the needs of a growing country which has concentrations of population like South Africa has.</p>

<speech by="#gorsihel">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">GORSIHEL</person>:</from>

<p>I am prepared to deal with that, Sir. There are many things lacking there, but the fact is that the people who live in Hillbrow can get into the central part of Johannesburg where they work within five minutes. They would refuse to go and live 16 miles outside at Bosmansdam. That is why you cannot easily get a flat in Hillbrow, to this day.</p>

<p>I want to deal very briefly with the Bill. Clause 1 says &#x201C;section one of the Housing Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as the principal Act) &#x2026; This caused me some considerable trouble. I had not read the rubric, so I spent a long time looking for the Housing Act of 1959. Of course, the Minister would have told me I was na&#x00EF;ve, because the Housing Act was passed in 1957! But nevertheless it says in the first line &#x201C;the Housing Act. 1959&#x201D;.</p>

<p>As far as Clause 2 is concerned, I want to say that it is a good thing that now a town planner may be placed on the National Housing Commission&#x2014;but it is not a good thing that where there was provision for one woman, at least, the Minister may in future appoint or not appoint a woman. I think the women of South Africa will not take kindly to this view as I hope to indicate in the Committee Stage. I say furthermore that it is a good thing that the Bantu Housing Board, too, will apparently in the future have the services of a town planner at its disposal, as a member of the board.</p>

<p>In regard to Clause 9, which undoubtedly facilitates home ownership through the medium of the utility company, I doubt whether there will be any dispute about that approach to the need of providing housing. But, of course, in regard to Clauses 4 and 13, I am afraid that we on this side of the House are going to differ very seriously and very strongly from the hon. Minister&#x2014;because among other things he divests the local authority of several of its powers. It constitutes, at least in Clause 13, an interference with a local authority and an intrusion, what is more, by a neighbouring or other local authority which is quite unnecessary; and what is perhaps worse from the point of view of hon. members on that side of the House than on ours is that in many cases the Administrator of the province concerned is side-tracked. The Bill furthermore in at least two clauses has the, shall I say, unfortunate feature of retrospectivity, which I have always been led to believe is not a good thing in legislation. Whereas, as has already been said by my colleagues who spoke before me, we support the Bill and its objects, we differ on certain aspects of it and I, for one, would ask the hon. the Minister when he replies to the debate to try and explain just where his objection is to the provision of multi-storey accommodation through the National Housing Commission, and in this way make the maximum use of such ground as is still available&#x2014; and the hon. Minister says that very little is available&#x2014;in or near a town, an industrial area, or a place where people have to go to work, and to earn the money for the rent!</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down raised the question of providing housing in the form of single units or multi-storey units. I do not know when I ever said I was not in favour of multi-storey units. What I do emphasize, and what I have emphasized repeatedly since my visit to Europe, is that where at all possible, ideal form of housing is the house with a piece of land attached to it. That is accepted throughout the world. That was all I said. In the past the National Housing Commission has made money available for multi-storey units where it was necessary to erect blocks of flats. They still do so and at the moment multi-storey units are planned for the important centres in the country. I do not know, therefore, what the point was the hon. member <span class="col_5341-5342" refersTo="page_1363"/>tried to make. If his argument is that I am opposed to multi-storey units I can tell him that I am not opposed to it where circumstances demand it, such as where an area is being replanned because a slum area has been demolished, where the area is limited and you have to build in the sky. In those circumstances our policy is to build in the sky. I can provide the hon. member with evidence that we make money available for that purpose and that we have done so in the past. But what we say is this, and this was confirmed during my recent visit to Europe, that where you have to construct units of more than one storey, you must not construct such concrete forests in the sky that they will in years to come turn into slum areas on a large scale, areas in which the people will not have room to move. I visited cities in Europe where they are providing this type of housing on a large scale and those people are busy creating future slum areas on a large scale. We do not want that in South Africa. It depends of course for which section of the population you construct housing in the sky. In the case of those for whom you have to provide sub-economic housing you cannot go too high in the sky. If you have to provide housing for the less privileged Coloured people, for example, you cannot go too high in the sky, otherwise you will be creating social evils which you will not be able to control. That is why the commission adapts itself to the circumstances. The commission is not wedded to one definite type of housing. But we say, and this the hon. member cannot deny, that the single unit on the ground, whether it be a unit for letting or selling purposes, remains the most desirable type of housing if you want to maintain western standards. That is our only line of approach. So there is actually no difference. But we must not exaggerate these things and where we still have land in South Africa we must not commit the crime of building too much in the sky. Naturally you bear in mind such problems as transport and others, but if it is at all possible we try to give each family a piece of land.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi (Mr. Lewis) told me he would not be here this afternoon. I just want to deal briefly with the few points raised by him. The hon. member referred in the first instance to the question of a woman on the National Housing Commission. He expressed the hope that this Bill would not mean that a woman would no longer serve on the commission. I can assure him that that is not the intention. If that is not clear from the clause, and it does not appear to me to be so, we shall have to take steps in the Committee Stage to make it clear that one woman at least will serve on the commission. I agree with that 100 per cent. When Mrs. Zerilda Steyn died, her presence on the commission was greatly appreciated, the vacancy was immediately filled by the appointment of Professor Erica Theron. That proves that we continually want to have a woman member on the commission.</p>

<p>Why have (c) then&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_housing">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>I wanted to have another definite profession represented on the commission but as I have said I shall explain in the Committee Stage that one of the members of the commission must be a woman. I want hon. members to know that we regard it as important to have a woman on the commission. After I recently obtained permission from the Government to appoint Professor Erica Theron to replace Mrs. Steyn, we came to an agreement with Professor Theron that she would go further than previous women members of the commission and that she would be available to meet women institutions and to address them on the problem of housing. We are at the moment arranging with the most important women institutions in South Africa for Professor Theron to attend their congresses or their head committee conferences where she can discuss housing problems with them. I think everybody will agree with me that Professor Theron is pre-eminently suitable for this.</p>

<p>The hon. member said he had certain doubts about Clause 7. He said he was a little worried about the fact that the actions and decisions of the regional committees would in future be subject to the final approval of the Housing Commission. I think we must leave it at that because the National Housing Commission is after all the watchdog who guards this huge National Housing Fund. Hon. members are perhaps losing sight of the fact that this fund is a revolving fund which is getting stronger and stronger and that we shall gradually reach the position where the fund will carry itself and that we shall in all probability in the foreseeable future be able to ask this House for less money because the funds will be able to finance housing with its own money. That is only one of the reasons but then we must not lessen the control of the National Housing Commission. It must continue to have control over the regional committees. The National Housing Commission must be in the position beforehand, and in consultation with the Secretary of the Department and with the Minister, to lay down the broad direction the regional committees must follow. They must be told: You can make decisions within this framework, but when you want to go outside this framework you must refer back to the National Housing Commission.</p>

<p>The hon. member&#x2019;s third point was his concern about Clause 13. He said the Minister now wanted one local authority to interfere with the affairs of another local authority as far as the provision of services in one area was concerned. I stated implicitly in my introductory speech that these measures would be applied very sparingly and only in cases where it was absolutely necessary to do so. I also warned members not to interpret this clause incorrectly. Let me give two examples which are self-explanatory. You have divisional councils and municipalities in the Cape <span class="col_5343-5344" refersTo="page_1364"/>Province. You may have a position where a housing programme has to be carried out in an area falling under the jurisdiction of the one while the other authority is really the stronger one which can provide the services. That is what is envisaged here. You get a second example of this nature in the Transvaal where you have the Peri-Urban Board and local authorities and municipalities. It is in these circumstances that we intend stepping in, if necessary, in order to provide the necessary services.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Umlazi also raised another matter which should rather have been raised under my Vote. However, I wish to reply to it now because I do not want the wrong impression to be created. He spoke about the transfer of the Group Areas Development Board to the Department of Housing. This reorganization took place in the closest co-operation with the Public Service Commission, after Cabinet approval had been obtained. The obvious reason is that administratively that will not only facilitate the work, because you now have both bodies concerned with housing and development under one Department, but secondly, because the modern tendency throughout the world is not to have your instruments of development spread over a number of bodies. That was the reason why we took that step. The hon. member was a little unfriendly towards the Development Board and said, <i>inter alia,</i> that the Development Board had so far been a failure. That is not true. I do not know whether the hon. member has ever been to Bosmond in Johannesburg, but if he were to go there I am sure he would not again tell me the Development Board had been a failure.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>That was one of their first attempts and it was a great success. You have Duiwefontein here in Cape Town and I do not think anybody who has seen Duiwefontein will tell me that the Development Board has made a failure of that. Chattsworth in Durban is a result of the interference of the Development Board. The local authority eventually stepped in but the Development Board took the initiative. But apart from these and other schemes, I just want to tell the hon. member that from 1 August 1961 to 31 December 1963 a little over two years, the Development Board was responsible for the conversion of 11,000 properties from disqualified to qualified properties. I do not think it is correct to say the Development Board has been a failure. I have full confidence in the Development Board and its ability and I think where it has been restricted to some extent in the past because of the previous arrangements it will in future be able to undertake developmental work much more effectively in co-operation with the National Housing Commission as organs of the Department of Housing. The hon. member also raised the question of the exercise of the right of pre-emption but I think that is a question the hon. member must please raise under my Vote, because that is purely a matter of policy and does not affect this legislation.</p>

<p>The hon. member and various other hon. members pointed out a few matters which flow from this legislation. They referred, <i>inter alia,</i> to wooden houses and industrialized products such as concrete blocks and other prefabricated material and in the same breath hon. members spoke rather deprecatingly about the standard of the sub-economic housing which is being provided. They spoke, <i>inter alia,</i> about concrete-block and cement-block houses which they alleged were no good and had all sort of defects. I want to avail myself of this opportunity of saying a few words in that connection and I hope we shall hear nothing further about that, because wherever we deal with sub-economic housing there are always a few complaints. The first complaint is that the standard is not high enough and the two-roomed house is then immediately given as an example. But surely that is not fair. The fact of the matter is that the two-roomed house is the basic unit which is made available throughout to the lower income group. It depends on the size of the family and that has on numerous occasions been explained to local authorities by way of circular letters. The interesting thing in this connection is that I discussed this subject of sub-economic housing for a whole morning with the Doxiades Institute. Not only did Doxiades lecture us but we were shown illustrations of the sub-economic housing which was being erected in South America and in the neighbouring East. After they had shown us their standards and we had shown them ours they admitted that the minimum standards for sub-economic housing applied in South Africa were much higher than the sub-economic standards applied elsewhere. I do not know whether the hon. member knows who Doxiades is. He is regarded as the greatest expert on housing and planning in the world. He has his institute in Athens. He is the person who builds cities in various parts of the world. We spent a whole morning with him and he told us our minimum standards were far higher than those applied in most other countries in the world. I therefore hope that our sub-economic housing and our basic housing unit will no longer be belittled in South Africa.</p>

<p>The hon. member who is so worried because I regard the standards applied in South Africa as being higher than those applied in the rest of the world must remember that the vice-president of the Doxiades Institute was born in South Africa. I do not know why the hon. member is so worried when I give South Africa a testimonial.</p>

<p>The third complaint was that the material was not good. But what happens&#x003F; The building research institute of the C.S.I.R., in co-operation with the technical division of the Department of Housing, lay down the standards; they lay down the standards in respect of all the material, but once we have granted a loan we cannot play the role of an inspector in order to determine whether those houses are built in conformity with the standards prescribed by the building research institute of the C.S.I.R. and our technical division. The local authorities have to see to that. Only last week I had a case where a local authority complained but they did not have an inspector of works when the building contractor carried out the scheme. To-day they come to us and complain whereas it was the building contractor who had cheated them most shamefully. Now they are trying to pin the blame on to the Department and the building research institute. I hope where local authorities carry out schemes they will see to it that proper work is done.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Florida (Mr. Miller) said we should not take these powers because the position was no worse than it was in 1945. Is that a reason why we should not improve the legislation, Sir&#x003F; If experience throughout the world and in South Africa shows that you can improve the Housing Act and that the methods can be improved by amending the Act must you adhere to the position as it obtained in 1945&#x003F;</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member that before we decided on certain improvements we had had the benefit of the wise counsel of the Netherlands Ministry of Housing, amongst others, who had submitted a White Paper to their Parliament as to how their old laws ought to be improved left and right in order to eliminate all the delays and stumbling blocks and so that action would be taken much quicker. We studied the methods employed in other countries and we decided that our Act should also be modernized. What is wrong with that&#x003F;</p>

<p>I am coming to that. The hon. member went further and said the Minister had been asleep. He said I ought to have known that my colleague would bring in immigrants and that I ought to have known the Government would bring about a great economic upsurge &#x2014;he admits that to-day. But is it true that I have been asleep, Sir&#x003F; I find that as far back as 29 November 1962 I sent a circular letter to all local authorities in which I advised them that we not only had the Department of Housing but that we had established seven regional committees by means of which they could contact the Department more quickly. We stated further at the time that we were going to appoint a special liaison officer whom they could meet and who could enlighten them on matters which were not clear to them. We furthermore asked them please to be on their toes as far as housing was concerned and that it was absolutely essential that we all gave joint attention to the question of housing. That was on 29 November 1962. We sent those circular letters out, appointed a liaison officer and opened regional offices. What is more the Government decided that the Minister, accompanied by his officials, should study the most modern methods in Europe. In what respect were we asleep&#x003F; The third complaint of the hon. member was that &#x201C;the Minister is emasculating the powers of the local authorities&#x201D;. But when you look at Clause 1, Sir, you will see that the very thing we are doing is to assist local authorities further. You will notice that in the agreements I have entered into with the Administrators and in the amendments of which I have already given notice, provision is made that it will not only be the Housing Commission that will have the privilege of erecting building schemes in accordance with the latest methods but that the local authorities will also be asked to do so. When I introduced this Bill I said the following&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">I also wish to say that I have the greatest appreciation for the part local authorities can play and the majority of them do play in rendering the service of housing to their citizens.</block>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF HOUSING</person>:</from>

<p>I appointed that committee, not the commission, and the City Council of Johannesburg subsequently expressed their appreciation of the assistance we had given them.</p>

<p>There is one other reply I wish to give in this connection. I wish to quote to hon. members what the mayor of Durban said in connection with my Department. There are also people on the Durban City Council who talks like hon. members opposite. There is a certain Mr. McManus who made a vehement attack on the Government and its policy in connection with the provision of housing. The mayor then replied and said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The fact was that there was a serious shortage of flats for ordinary working men and the Government was doing its best to alleviate this situation.</block>

<p>That is also my reply to the hon. member for Hospital&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Leaving politics aside, this Government has done a magnificent job in assisting Durban to provide houses for Whites and non-Whites. I deplore criticism being levelled at the Department of Housing, which is doing its best to meet the present challenge.</block>

<p>That is my reply to them through the mayor of Durban. But Durban, of course, has a mayor who co-operates, and that is why we do not kill him; we help him and that is why he expresses his appreciation of the assistance he gets. [Interjections.]</p>

<p>There is also objection to Clause 6. We take the power under Clause 6 to let the commission itself carry out a scheme in certain circumstances and then to hand the scheme over to the local authority. Hon. members are dissatisfied because I am taking that step. They say I should have left it as it was, namely, that I first had to obtain the permission of the Administrator. But the Administrator is not the person who has to cope with the housing problem in this country. He is not in a position to know where the Government wants the housing to be modernized or expedited. It is impossible for him at all times to undertake this task, particularly where quick action has to be taken. That is why we are changing the law so that it will be after consultation with him but that we shall in any case have the power, if deemed necessary, to hand the scheme over and to give that local authority the necessary assistance, even if it is not in a position to borrow sufficient money to develop the scheme.</p>

<p>The final point to which I want to return is the question of new material raised by various hon. members. The hon. member for Karoo (Mr. Eden) referred to that in particular. He started off by saying that in the city he wanted to defend against me you had an example of what was being done in order to build a new city. I agree with him but had it not been for the legislation passed by this Government, legislation which forced Kimberley to plan, forced them to clear up the Malay camp, for instance, the heart of Kimberley would still have been a slum area today. But the action of this Government has turned the heart of Kimberley into something to be proud of.</p>

<p>In the second place the hon. member referred to new materials. We do not only want to build wooden houses to expedite this programme. I have also announced the appointment of a committee under Professor Tobie Louw from Pretoria, who is a member of the National Housing Commission. It is hoped that the committee will submit a detailed report towards the end of May on the use of prefabricated materials for housing purposes. I may tell hon. members that our assistant housing engineer is in Europe at the moment in order to make an intensive study of prefabricated material and housing methods. His report will also be taken into account as far as it is practically possible to do so, as well as the decisions in regard to the provision of wooden houses.</p>

<p>In conclusion I want to thank hon. members for approving of the Bill in principle but I hope that the powers we required in order to expedite the provision of housing will not be emasculated in the Committee Stage.</p>

<p>Motion put and agreed to.</p>

<p>[Debate on motion by the Minister of the Interior, adjourned on 16 April, resumed.]</p>

<speech by="#kotz&#x00E9;">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">S. F. KOTZ&#x00C9;</person>:</from>

<p>When the debate was adjourned I was pointing out that it would be unrealistic to believe that these new amendments to the postal vote system would remove all the shortcomings in the system itself. I referred amongst other things to one of the problems in connection with this system in the past&#x2014;the large number of postal votes, and expressed my concern at the fact that as a result of these amendments, the number of postal votes might possibly increase in the future instead of decreasing. But one thing is certain and that is that this new system will make great demands of the State machine, particularly in the case of magistrates, police, stationmasters and postmasters, people who in the normal course of events already have their hands full with their normal duties. It will be necessary for the presiding officers for absent votes to be available at all time and it is therefore obvious that these people will have to be readily available, particularly during the three weeks immediately preceding elections and that they will also have to be properly remunerated and that they should have adequate staff available. I am optimistic as to the success of this system but if these requirements are not complied with I have my doubts as to the smooth running of the machine.</p>

<p>There are two matters to which I want to draw the attention of the hon. the Minister. The one is the question of the ten mile provision which is being inserted in the principal Act by Clauses 6 and 7. I am pleased that the hon. the Minister has already indicated that we can discuss this matter with him and that he has an open mind in this regard. The Act is now being amended by Clauses 6 and 7 to provide that people who apply for postal votes because they live more than ten miles from the nearest polling station may also not be within the area of a municipality any portion of the boundary of which is within ten miles by the nearest practicable route from the nearest polling station in that division. This new provision gives effect to the recommendation of the commission set out in paragraphs 112 and 113. The commission was faced with a problem that a person living in or near an urban area can indicate on his application for a postal vote that he will be in Cape Town on election day. But then the returning officer will not know precisely where that person will be and will not be able to ascertain that person&#x2019;s whereabouts. This problem is experienced particularly in a constituency like North-West Rand which lies between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and also to a lesser extent in other constituencies. The commission made this recommendation as a result of this fact, a recommendation which I think is unnecessary at this stage because the difficulty with which the commission was faced no longer exists. My reason for saying this is that it is now being provided in Clause 7 (b) that a voter who applies for a postal vote because of the fact that he will be ten miles away from the nearest polling station must give his residential address, the address where he will be, and it is physically impossible for any returning officer, if he so desires, or if any objection is lodged, to ascertain that that voter is more than ten miles away from the nearest polling station. There is also the further provision that the applicant personally has to initial the reason for his application, his address and the fact that he will be more than ten miles away from the nearest polling station. The objection therefore falls away and it now simply remains a discriminatory provision in regard to voters living in and around the large cities. It is going to present us with problems, examples of which I shall give the House now. Any voter from the Malmesbury constituency and living 40 to 60 miles away from the nearest polling station, or a voter from Riebeek Kasteel living, for example, in Kalk Bay, will not be able to vote by post because there will be a polling station at Blouberg Strand which is within ten miles of the Cape Town municipal boundary. The same thing holds good for Stellenbosch. No voter from Fransch Hoek, Mulders Vlei, Stellenbosch or Somerset-West living in Kalk Bay will be able to vote by post because Brackenfell is within ten miles of the Cape Town municipal boundary. The same thing holds good for False Bay, the Strand, Goodwood and Parow. We already have to deal with thickly populated polling districts in the urban areas where within 12 hours from 6,000 to 8,000 voters have to vote at one polling station. This presents a political organization with a great problem. We all know that the people from Malmesbury living in the city and who will now have to vote at Blouberg will not come along and vote of their own accord; in most cases they will have to be provided with transport. Many are working people who, on arriving home from work in the evening, are not too enthusiastic about going to the nearest polling station if they <span class="col_5351-5352" refersTo="page_1368"/>have to make use of public transport to get there. That is the problem. I feel that there is no longer any justification for this provision because the objections of the commission have now been met. There is another matter that I want to raise. I refer to Clause 24 and the provision in connection with tendered ballot papers. I want to advocate a new principle in this regard. I want to ask that tendered ballot papers should under certain circumstances be accepted and counted. This has never been done in the past. In the past a tendered ballot paper was a fake vote or a consolation vote which was never counted, except if there was a court case, and as far as I know there has never been a court case in regard to a matter of this nature.</p>

<p>When does one make use of a tendered ballot paper&#x003F; A person makes use of a tendered ballot paper if he arrives at the polling station and somebody has either already voted in his name or has taken out a postal vote in his name. He can then ask for a tendered ballot paper. I want to suggest that if a person arrives at a polling station and asks for a tendered ballot paper because somebody has already voted on his name, that tendered ballot paper should not be counted; but in the second case, a person may arrive at a polling station and find that a postal vote has been issued in his name. A tendered ballot paper will then be issued to him. In the counting of votes afterwards, when it has been ascertained that that postal vote which was issued has not been returned, I feel that tendered ballot paper should also be counted. I do not know what objection there can be to this suggestion. The person&#x2019;s identity is ascertained when he arrives at the polling station and asks for a ballot paper. Such a person cannot vote twice. If he has used the postal vote originally issued to him, this fact will be discovered when the votes are counted, just as in the case of declaration votes. The envelope containing the tendered ballot paper reflects that person&#x2019;s name and voting number. All that one has to ascertain is whether his postal vote has been returned. If it has not been returned, then I do not see why his tendered ballot paper should not be counted. I have good reasons for making this suggestion.</p>

<p>My first reason is because, in the past, we had a number of cases in which postal votes were issued but never ever reached their destinations. A man would turn up at the polling station on election day and say that he had applied for a postal vote to be sent to Beaufort West but that it had not arrived the previous day nor had it arrived that day and so he had hitch-hiked to the polling station and he wanted to vote. The presiding officer would then give him a pink paper, the tendered ballot paper, and console or fool him in this way, and that man would then think he had voted, but he would not have voted because that tendered ballot paper meant nothing. The principle which we all accept is that every man who is entitled to vote should have the opportunity to do so. But there is another provision in this Bill which makes it necessary for us to consider counting these tendered ballot papers. The presiding officer for absent votes may perhaps not have been successful in tracing a certain person and in terms of Section 26 of the principal Act he holds back the postal vote that has not been claimed until 4 o&#x2019;clock on the day before polling day and then he has to send it back to the returning officer by whom it was issued. We may have the case in which the presiding officer has not been successful in tracing the voter who has made application. The vote is therefore not claimed before 4 o&#x2019;clock on the day immediately preceding polling day, and by the time the applicant for that postal vote arrives, the postal vote will already have been returned in terms of the new provision. It will already be on its way back to the returning officer but nobody will be able to lay his hand on it because it will be in the post, and the man who has applied for it wants to vote. It is easy for a man in this position, e.g. living at Worcester to reach the polling station in Cape Town within that time. He arrives at the polling station and is given a tendered ballot paper, which does not count. I want to ask that we accept this principle&#x2014; that when a man is given a tendered ballot paper because a postal vote has been taken out in his name, when that man has not voted and when it is ascertained when the postal votes are counted that that postal vote has not been returned, that tendered ballot paper must be accepted. I say that the principle which is accepted by all of us is that every man who is entitled to vote must be able to vote if he so desires. Indeed, this is also the reason why we have postal votes&#x2014;to make it possible for everyone to vote. That is why I hope that the hon. the Minister will consider the matter from this point of view and move an amendment accordingly.</p>

<speech by="#hickman">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HICKMAN</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;) raised a few interesting points and I agree with him in regard to at least two of the points he raised. The first is the question of the State machine, the public servants who will to a large extent be responsible for the smooth running of this machine. This is a good thing and we should be pleased that the State has taken a larger share of the burden in this regard upon its <span class="col_5353-5354" refersTo="page_1369"/>own shoulders. The hon. the Minister will have to ensure that his officials are remunerated accordingly but it is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Then there is the question of the provisions of Clause 7. Here too I think that one should support what has been said by the hon. member. He sketched the background to the clause and described the practical circumstances of the case to us and I think that the hon. the Minister will do well to reconsider this clause in the light of what the hon. member has said.</p>

<p>I do not feel too happy about the question of tendered ballot papers. It appears to me as though the suggestion of the hon. member for Parow may possibly lead to malpractices and I should like to say that before the hon. the Minister accepts his suggestion, he give the matter further consideration.</p>

<p>When the hon. the Minister introduced this Bill he made it very clear that the Bill was not the product of public servants, of the hon. the Minister himself or of political parties, but was the product of a commission&#x2014;first committee and then a commission&#x2014;consisting of State officials and representatives of political parties. It is strange to consider that although the parties are so often at loggerheads with one another in regard to many matters there is a great deal of unanimity in this regard. I think that this is due to the fact not that the parties have done their duty but rather to the sincere desire that existed on both sides to place the election machine beyond question. If there is one piece of legislation which should be placed beyond suspicion it is our Electoral Act. Apart from the fact that the Electoral Act sets up the machinery in terms of which this Parliament functions, it is also a fact that the provisions of the Electoral Act are put into top gear just at the time when public emotions are running high. One finds at that stage that the smallest irregularity is blown up to extraordinary proportions and it is said that a party has been acting outrageously. But on closer inspection, one finds that this is not so. I can remember cases in which some people considered it to be quite an accomplishment to take the wind out of the sails of an opposing party. But the strange part about it is this: That although we have had so many tales about possible suspicion and malpractices, the fact remains that if one goes through this report and reads the evidence that has been given, one realizes that the incidence of malpractices that actually take place is very slight. I should like to quote paragraph 92 of the report. I think that it is of very great importance. It reads (translation)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">By far the majority of the evidence expressed the opinion that the alleged scope of the irregularities which took place was greatly exaggerated.</block>

<p>Of course, I am the last one to try to condone malpractices, no matter how slight their incidence, but the fact remains that the incidence of these malpractices is far slighter than one is given to realize.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is true that the postal vote system as such is actually the system which has been the cause of most of the suspicion. Although this Bill makes a large number of improvements, I think that we will be making a mistake if we imagine that we will now succeed in putting a stop to all irregularities or that we have found the perfect solution to our problems. Even an improved system will have its crop of problems, problems which will have to be solved by that wise teacher, experience. Personally I believe that basically the problem can only be solved if we can succeed in limiting postal votes to a minimum. I do not mean that certain people should be disfranchised, but I believe that the registration system should be improved to such an extent that a person will only be able to vote in the constituency in which he lives. To my mind there are a few important principles embodied in these electoral laws. The first is the question of secrecy, and secondly, that no pressure can be brought to bear on a voter and that he should be free to cast his vote as he thinks fit. Thirdly, there is the fact that every person who has the right to vote, ought to be able to vote; but this principle is subject to a condition which is just as important and that is that a person who has the right to vote should only be able to exercise that right in a specific area. I think that if we consider the postal vote system, we will find that it is the source of most of our problems. It appears to be quite wrong to my mind that a person living in constituency A should be permitted in terms of the postal vote system to vote in constituency B, where he has no interest. His interests lie in the constituency in which he lives. Nevertheless, he is permitted to cancel out the vote of a person living in that person&#x2019;s own constituency, and to that extent I feel that this practice should not be allowed. When we look at the postal vote figures, we find that the figures are highest in those constituencies where there is the hardest fight. It is in these constituencies that the highest number of votes of people who actually do not belong in those constituencies are cast, thus neutralizing the votes of those who have every right to vote in those constituencies. We find that this principle is recognized in other countries. There are certain states in the U.S.A. in <span class="col_5355-5356" refersTo="page_1370"/>which the Vtoers&#x2019; Roll is prepared only just before an election. It is prepared exclusively for the election with the result that every person living in a particular area can vote at that election. I realize that circumstances in South Africa may not permit of our applying a system of this nature, but I do feel that the system which we now have does not do very much towards reducing the number of postal votes. I believe that these amendments to the Electoral Act constitute an important step in the right direction. They may not provide us with the final answer but I think that the commission which the hon. the Minister appointed and which consisted of members of both parties did a great deal towards eliminating the suspicions that did exist in connection with the Electoral Act. I honestly believe that all political parties&#x2014;and they are the ones to ensure that the Electoral Act operates smoothly&#x2014;which want the Electoral Act to operate in the spirit in which the commission investigated the matter, will agree that these amendments to the Electoral Act will contribute in no small way towards establishing efficient electoral machinery for the future.</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>I want to associate myself with the spirit in which the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman) approached this matter. It is true that this Bill really represents the joint effort of the two main parties in our country which were represented on the commission. After the fine spirit revealed by the hon. the Minister as well as by his Department in regard to these two aspects, namely, the registration system and the postal voting system, we could set out to look for the best system that it was possible for us to devise for this country. I think that it is a good thing that everybody concerned revealed such a fine spirit and that we could reach this measure of agreement with a view to producing the best system as far as the postal voting system is concerned and the change which is now being introduced&#x2014;the new setup that we are creating here&#x2014;I have a few minor misgivings, but I am prepared to say that I think that we should first give this new system an opportunity to withstand the test at the forthcoming provincial election. If I remember correctly, the hon. the Minister also told us that he would be the first person to come forward to ensure that the necessary changes were made if any difficulties were experienced. But as far as the registration system is concerned, I can say in all sincerity as a practical politician and as one who, like the hon. member for Maitland, has to deal with this sort of thing every day, that we have undoubtedly succeeded in introducing the best system that I at any rate can think of. I want to congratulate the hon. the Minister and his Department in this regard. Amending legislation to change our registration system has been introduced repeatedly since 1918 but I am convinced that in practice the system which we are now introducing will prove to be the best we have ever had in South Africa. In the first instance there are three points that I want to mention. The two political parties, will now have an opportunity to play watchdog over each other in keeping the Voters&#x2019; Rolls accurate and up to date. Moreover, the returning officer in the particular area will have an important role to play as arbitrator. Secondly, I think we will eliminate the loading of the Voters&#x2019; Roll. Sir, to realize how a Voters&#x2019; Roll can be loaded, one need only look at the Queenstown Voters&#x2019; Roll as it stood before the last election. And it is a perfectly natural thing to do so. A political party which under the old system within the rules was unable to load a Voters&#x2019; Roll, was not worth its salt, and that is what we did at Queenstown; the system allowed us to do so. The two political parties simply acted within the then existing rules. We took full advantage of the rules. But this new system will now make it possible for the two parties to play watchdog over each other in keeping the Voters&#x2019; Rolls as accurate and as up to date as possible. I think this registration system will help to reduce the number of postal votes. But there is one aspect that I want to mention to the hon. the Minister in regard to these regulations. The State is prepared to assume far more responsibility in the future as far as the handling of postal votes is concerned. The handling of these postal votes was a heavy burden which rested upon the various political parties. The State will be prepared to make a far more important contribution in this respect in the future, both financially and otherwise. But if we want to make this registration system of ours the very best system that South Africa has ever known, then I should like to suggest to the hon. the Minister that the State should also give much more assistance and accept far more responsibility at a general registration of voters. Sir, I want to say with a full sense of responsibility&#x2014;I think the hon. member for Maitland will agree with me&#x2014;that the last general registration was probably one of the most unsatisfactory we have ever had. I am sorry to have to say it but it is true. The results of these two interim mediate registrations have proved this to be true and the registration which is in progress at the moment will prove that the last general registration was the most unsatisfactory ever undertaken by the State. If the State is prepared to accept greater responsibility at a general registration then I do not have the slightest doubt that we will be able to introduce the best possible system. I should like to make a few suggestions in this regard. Do you know, Mr. Speaker, that the position during the last general registration, not merely in a few polling districts but in numbers of polling districts in the Cape, was that not one single voter was registered by the State in those polling districts because this work was so badly done&#x003F; There were other places in which there were signs of absolute negligence on the part of people who did this work on behalf of the State. Here I have in <span class="col_5357-5358" refersTo="page_1371"/>mind, the centres in which there are large concentrations of students. This is the sort of thing that happened: The enumerator arrives at a hostel and simply hands over a number of cards to the primarius of the hostel who then has to do the work for him. Or otherwise he walks down the street and comes to a certain house. When he knocks at the door, nobody answers. He then simply assumes that the only people living there are Oom Jan and Tant Sannie; he then takes two registration cards and pushes them under the door. It never enters his head that there may be children or lodgers living in that house as well. Sir, I can mention numerous examples to you to show what approach was adopted to this question of a general registration. I should like to make a few suggestions in this connection. The first is in regard to the enumerators themselves. During the last general registration there was a tendency when enumerators were appointed not to appoint party workers. In certain complexes particularly the attitude was deliberately adopted that party workers should not be appointed as enumerators because they belonged to certain political parties. Sir, one can make an analysis of what happened in the Cape. In complexes where the approach was just the opposite, where the persons concerned, the returning officers, tried to find people who were connected with the various political parties, persons who had the necessary background and knowledge, this general registration was done on a completely different basis to the way in which it was done in those areas where attempts were made to exclude party workers as enumerators. Then there is the question of the remuneration paid to these people. Sir, I really do think, to use a striking Afrikaans term, that these people are paid &#x201C;kafferlone&#x201D; (kaffir wages).</p>

<speech by="#marais">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">P. S. MARAIS</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, perhaps I should say &#x201C;Bantu wages&#x201D;. The remuneration is so poor that any man who is really capable of doing this work well is simply not interested. People who in the past have been prepared to assist the State in a general registration simply say: &#x201C;It does not pay me; I shall never do it again.&#x201D; The result is that one is only able to obtain the services of people of an inferior calibre to do this work. I think we must adopt a completely different approach to this matter. The State must be prepared to get the best people to do this work and to pay them decent remuneration; the State should also make use of the services of party workers. The third point that I want to mention is the co-operation that should exist during a general registration between what I would call a triumvirate&#x2014;in the first instance, the Press and the radio; secondly, the two political parties, and thirdly, the electoral office itself. These organizations form a triumvirate during a general registration and they must co-operate with one another. For example, in the last registration campaign, efforts were made to make use of the radio. But, Mr. Speaker, this was done in a most unimaginative manner. For example, a few talks were given on how to fill in the R.V.3 form. Sir, I think the necessary co-operation can be obtained and I think we should make use of modern methods. Here I think, for example, of the Decimal Dan method that was used over the radio. This is the way in which the radio can be utilized during a general registration. The two political parties may feel inclined to pay this fellow Fanus Rautenbach a small retainer, if necessary, so that when we have a general registration, he can introduce this sort of thing in his early morning programme which at the moment is very popular. We must show far more imagination during a general registration campaign in order to obtain greater co-operation between the Press and the radio on the one hand, and the electoral offices and various political parties on the other. I think that we will then achieve far more success.</p>

<p>One never knows. There is another point which I want to mention here and that is in regard to the sending out of the R.V.3 form. Once people have completed registration cards in a general registration, the cards are returned to the electoral office. An acknowledgment card is then sent to the people who sent in their registration cards. If we can obtain the co-operation of the radio in the way that I have just mentioned here, it can be announced over the radio or in the Press that these acknowledgment cards or R.V.3 cards will be sent out on a particular day. The entire public will then know that after they have sent in their registration card they can expect an acknowledgment from the State to inform them that their names now appear on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. Oom Jan and Tant Sannie will then know that if they do not receive that card within two or three days from the date announced, they should make an effort to ensure that their names do appear on the Voters&#x2019; Roll. They will then know that their names were not taken down during the general registration, either in error or for some other reason.</p>

<p>My last point, Mr. Speaker, is in connection with the availability of these registration cards. I took the trouble this morning to telephone a few magistrates&#x2019; offices and a few police offices in the Peninsula&#x2014;I telephoned nine of them&#x2014;and I found that there was not one single registration card available at any of the offices where those cards are supposed to be available to the public&#x2014;unless the people who spoke to me did not know what was going on in their offices. What is the actual position&#x003F; Take a person moving to an area like Bellville. He is prepared to take the trouble to register; he is a new-comer <span class="col_5359-5360" refersTo="page_1372"/>to that area; he does not know the contacts of the various political parties, and he wants to obtain a registration card. Do you know, Sir, what he has to do&#x003F; He has to come in from Bellville to obtain a registration card from the office in Cape Town. As a rule, the ordinary voter refuses to do that. It is too much trouble. Is it not possible for the hon. the Minister to make some arrangement with the post office whereby these registration cards will be available at every post office&#x003F; There are post offices everywhere and any person who walks into a post office to buy a stamp or to fill in a telegram form can then obtain a registration card there together with the envelope in which the card can be returned. If a person wants to take the trouble to fill in a registration form, all he need do is to walk into the post office and complete the registration form. I think, Mr. Speaker, that this is a practical suggestion and that we should make use of our post offices; the ordinary citizen will then know that the post office is one of the places at which he will be able to complete a registration card if he wants to take the trouble to register as a voter. In any case, I hope that we will eventually reach the stage in South Africa under our present population registration system when we will be able to do away with a Voters&#x2019; Roll completely. I do not know whether the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s Department is working along these lines but I think that it can be done. We must have a new approach; we must find a new system and we have our population registration system which we can use as a basis. I want to conclude, Mr. Speaker, by once again conveying my gratitude to the hon. the Minister. He is also a man who in his day was concerned with the practical aspects of politics. I have been impressed by the devoted and enthusiastic way in which he has tried to help us to find a new electoral system for South Africa and on behalf particularly of this side of the House I want to convey our hearty thanks to him for his devoted efforts to find the best system for South Africa.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>I want to thank hon. members who have taken part in this debate very heartily for their contributions. What they have said here is clear proof not only to this House but to the whole country that the report which was brought out by the Commission of Inquiry truly reflects the views of both political parties represented in this House. I want to say at once that I agree with the hon. member for Maitland and also with the report that the stories that we hear about so-called malpractices and offences committed in connection with postal voting are hopelessly exaggerated. I still believe in the incorruptibility and honesty of people. I feel, however, that any system which lends itself to malpractices puts too much temptation in the way of people; that the fault lies with the Legislature and that it is the duty of the Legislature to close the loopholes.</p>

<p>I want to underline that because I think the erroneous impression may be created in the outside world that we are very worried about our electoral system, that we believe that it is so corrupt and so wrong that we have now at last entered into a compromise to make it less corrupt. I do not think that that correctly reflects the facts.</p>

<p>Sir, I want to express my hearty thanks to the main speaker on the other side, who was also a member of the Commission of Inquiry, the hon. member for Durban (Point) (Mr. Raw) for his lucid exposition and for the intensive study which he made of the Bill which is now before the House. He has shown that he really studied this Bill in detail. He has raised certain matters here that we can discuss very fruitfully in the Committee Stage. I can say to the hon. member that many of the points raised by him&#x2014;this is not the time to go into details&#x2014;will receive my very sympathetic consideration because it is clear to me, in the case of many of the points that he mentioned, that his only object is to bring about greater clarity with a view to implementing the recommendations of this Commission, that his intentoin is to close loopholes which may still possibly exist. There are one or two of his proposals, of course, which unfortunately I shall not be able to accept&#x2014;I still do not have the details&#x2014;but the hon. member can move his amendments in the Committee Stage and we shall then discuss them with the greatest frankness. The hon. member has also put forward the proposition that the information that we can obtain from the municipalities in respect of changes of address will prove inadequate. I want to assure the hon. member that this whole matter, including the reliability of the information available from different sources, not only from municipalities, will be thoroughly investigated by a team of O. &#x0026; M. officials. We must first investigate this whole matter thoroughly; we cannot simply accept that the data that we can get from the municipalities will in fact contain all the information that we ought to have in our possession. We must investigate all sources of information, and indeed, as I said in the second reading debate, if it will help us to bring the Voters&#x2019; Rolls up to date I am in favour of making use of that system. The hon. member for Pinelands (Mr. Thompson) raised two questions and posed two problems here, which were enlarged upon by the hon. member for Moorreesburg (Mr. P. S. Marais). The first concerns the role which the political parties play in a general registration. I want to admit at once that I felt very unhappy indeed about the general registration which was held in August last year. I agree with hon. members that it was a poor general registration; it is no true reflection of the number of voters in the various constituencies&#x2014;with a few exceptions where the enumerators set about things in the right way. Various suggestions have been made as to how we can rectify the position. The hon. member for Pinelands, for example, asked whether the time had not <span class="col_5361-5362" refersTo="page_1373"/>come for us to think of giving a certain amount of financial compensation to the political parties whose task it is to follow up the general registration. According to the principles of our Electoral Laws, of course, the onus rests on the voter to register himself. It is his duty to register himself. The State assists him by bearing the cost of the registration to a certain extent. The political parties have a very great interest in seeing to it that the name of the negligent voter who does not register himself is in fact put on the roll. As the hon. member for Moorreesburg has said, this task really rests on the shoulders of a triumvirate. I think we would be going a little too far if we started compensating political parties for the costs incurred by them in registering voters because they have the same task to-day really as far as the collection of applications for postal votes is concerned. It is in thejr own interests to do so, and the existing sections in the Act which make provision for the political parties to collect the applications for postal votes remain unchanged. While I am on this subject I may as well deal at once also with the second difficulty of the hon. member for Pinelands. The hon. member asked whether we should not allow absent voters to complete their application for a postal vote before nomination day. I want to tell him that we would be placing the political parties in a completely untenable position if we did that. When does one find out that a voter is absent&#x003F; One finds that out for the first time when one has the complete roll and when one checks the names; it is only then that one discovers that this person is ill, that that person is bedridden, etc. There are others who tell one in advance, &#x201C;I should like to come and vote on election day but I shall be away on holiday.&#x201D; The hon. member wants us to wait until just before nomination day.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>One cannot wait until just before nomination day because at that stage one still does not know precisely who the candidates are going to be. Since the declaration which has to accompany the application has to be initialled by the applicant personally, the possibility of manufacturing large numbers of postal votes is ruled out. I think we should leave the political parties a certain amount of freedom because their organization is becoming more and more difficult. One has to get canvassers to go through one&#x2019;s constituency two or three times to encourage voters to come and vote. We know all the problems. Sir, the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) put forward another suggestion. I want to dispose first of the suggestions which seem to me to be impracticable. He suggested as far as justices of the peace are concerned that they should only be able to act as enumerators in the wards in which they have jurisdiction.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>Yes, but not too far away. I do not know why he put forward that proposal but I have an idea that his reason is that the voters are not well known to justices of the peace because they only move in a certain circle. But what about public servants&#x003F; Do they know the people any better&#x003F; I do not feel that any distinction should be drawn between the functions of a justice of the peace and the functions of a public servant. The hon. member for Durban (Point) has put forward the idea that we should find a justice of the peace to act as presiding officer. I am not in favour of that for the simple reason that the financial position and the daily work of such a justice of the peace may be such that he is unable to do this work at the present rate of remuneration. In the case of the public servant, however, a responsibility rests on his shoulders to do this work, and, moreover, he receives additional remuneration for it. I do not feel therefore that we should lay down that a justice of the peace must necessarily be the presiding officer.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Parow (Mr. S. F. Kotz&#x00E9;), as well as the hon. member for Maitland (Mr. Hickman), stated that there would be an increase in the number of postal votes; they want to limit it. I too would like to limit it in this sense that there should be no unnecessary postal voting, but as long as the votes are genuine postal votes I hope my hon. friends do not object to an increase in the number of postal votes. To me it makes no difference whether a voter votes on polling day at a polling booth or whether he casts his vote before polling day in the presence of a presiding office for absent votes. I think we should accept the principle that every man is entitled to cast his vote; we should not therefore place restrictions upon him. The two hon. members in question also agreed that we were expecting a great deal from the public servants. They seem to harbour a secret fear that public servants will not be able to do this work. Let me just say this to them: If this provincial election shows that their fear is well-founded or that there are still other loopholes, there will be time enough to rectify the position, but for the moment I think we should leave it at that. The public servants who have to do this work will be properly I compensated; they will be looked after properly <span class="col_5363-5364" refersTo="page_1374"/>and this work will be entrusted to them as part of their duties. An adequate number of persons will be appointed so that they will be able to do this work properly. The hon. member put forward two ideas here: As far as the 10-mile limitation is concerned I want to say at once that in my opinion he made out a very good case, and he will be able to raise this matter in the Committee Stage again. His case was strengthened considerably by the support he received from the hon. member for Maitland. We must only guard against making it more difficult for people to cast their votes. Our whole idea is to make it possible and easy for people to vote. If there are members on either side of the House who hold different views, then we can settle this matter in the Committee Stage. I just want to say to him that I will ask my Department to prepare such an amendment so that after having tested the feelings of members who have a knowledge of both the platteland and the city, we can see whether we cannot arrive at an unanimous decision.</p>

<p>I cannot agree with the hon. member&#x2019;s remarks in connection with tendered votes. I think the hon. member loses sight of the fact that when a person tenders his postal vote he has to produce his identity card. We know what used to happen in the past. Somebody applies for a postal vote; he is not the person, however, whose name has been registered; the postal vote is then sent to a certain address; that postal vote is never tendered and on election day, when the right person turns up, he is told that a ballot paper has been issued to him as an absent voter, a ballot paper which he never received. We have now closed every loophole because the person who wishes to vote has to produce his identity card or some other form of identification. In other words, his application for a postal vote will be a genuine application.</p>

<p>May I put a question to the hon. the Minister: I was referring to the case where a ballot paper to vote through the post has been issued and where the person admits that he applied for it but where it did not reach him or where it was sent back by the postal official before it was claimed. What happens then&#x003F;</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_the_interior">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR</person>:</from>

<p>That is correct. What I am saying is that there are so many watertight provisions in this Bill that that person must be very negligent indeed if he does not complain to the electoral officer that he has not yet received his ballot paper to vote through the post, and if the political party in question is unable to trace that ballot paper, then its organization must be very poor indeed because the moment a ballot paper is issued for postal voting purposes the organizations of both parties are notified that a ballot paper has been issued to Mr. A to vote through the post and they are also given his address. These watertight provisions have never existed before. The Government is presenting the party organizations with all this information on a platter. I think if the hon. member thinks again and again studies all the provisions, not only this one, he will realize that his proposal that tendered votes should be counted, if we accept it, might lead to very serious malpractices under certain circumstances; it would just open another loophole again. It would also be wrong in principle to differentiate between the tendered vote which is issued because somebody has already voted in the person&#x2019;s name and the tendered vote which is issued because a postal vote has already been issued in the name of that voter. You will either have to count both or ignore both; you cannot differentiate between the two.</p>

<p>I want to thank the hon. member for Moorreesburg very heartily for what he said in connection with our registration system. He put forward certain suggestions which all relate to administrative matters. I have made a note of all of them and I want to assure him that we will take notice of them and that as far as possible we will apply them administratively. As far as his last suggestion is concerned that we must eventually use the population register as a Voters&#x2019; Roll, I can only say that we are already thinking along those lines. Once the population register is complete it will eliminate a tremendous number of problems. However, I do not want to discuss it at this stage; it is not relevant here; I mention it just in passing. Hon. members on the other side were very much opposed to the population register, and still are, for different reasons, but eventually &#x2026;</p>

I want to thank all hon. members very heartily once again. This Bill can best be dealt with in the Committee Stage. I want to make an appeal to hon. members to submit their amendments as soon as possible. This is not a case where amendments can be formulated in a hurry in the Committee Stage; the Act has too many implications. We are dealing here with five electoral laws, and it is very difficult to fit in everything. We must see to it that the wording is right. The law advisers will have to have at least a whole day to study the amendments to make sure that they are correct. I appeal to hon. members to let us have their amendments as soon as possible therefore.</p>
