<heading>Cost of Telephone Calls from Coin-Box Offices</heading>

<question by="#malan" to="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<num>*I.</num>

<from>Mr. E. G. MALAN</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) Whether a decision has been made to change the minimum rate for telephone calls from coin-box call offices; if so,(a) when was the decision made, (b) what is the new minimum rate to be and (c) when is it expected that the change will take effect; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he will reconsider the retention of the present minimum rate; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs" to="#malan">

<from>The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1) No, but Telephone Regulations introduced during October, 1962, make provision for increasing the minimum call rate to 5c when an electronic coin operated call office is converted into variable time interval metering. The latter method of metering is already in operation on a restricted basis in coin operated call offices at Bethlehem and Virginia.</li>

<li>(2) Falls away.</li>

</ol>

</answer>

<question by="#malan" to="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*Mr. E. G. MALAN:</from>

<p>Arising from the hon. the Minister&#x2019;s reply, has a decision been taken to extend that system which he says is now being operated in Welkom, to other areas in the Republic?</p>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs" to="#malan">

<from>*The MINISTER OF POSTS AND TELEGRAPHS:</from>

<p>It applies only where these special coin operated call offices are in use.</p>

</answer>

<question by="#malan" to="#minister_of_posts_and_telegraphs">

<from>*Mr. E. G. MALAN:</from>

<p>Is the Minister aware that the Postmaster-General stated in his evidence before the Select Committee on the Coinage System that such a decision had indeed been taken?</p>

<heading>Incidence of Smallpox in the Republic</heading>

<question by="#oldfield" to="#minister_of_health">

<num>*II.</num>

<from>Mr. OLDFIELD</from>

<p>asked the Minister of Health:</p>

<ol>

<li>(1) (a) How many cases of smallpox in the Republic have been reported since 1 January 1964, and (b) in which areas have they occurred; and</li>

<li>(2) whether he has given consideration to a general immunization campaign throughout the Republic; if so, what steps have been taken or are contemplated; if not, why not.</li>

</ol>

</question>

<answer by="#minister_of_health" to="#oldfield">

<from>The MINISTER OF HEALTH:</from>

<ol>

<li>(1)

<ol>

<li>(a) 120.</li>

<li>(b) Alexandria, Benoni, Duiwelskloof, Durban, Grahamstown, Humansdorp, Johannesburg, Letaba, Louis <span class="col_8627-8628" refersTo="page_0648"/>Trichardt, Middelburg, Nongoma, Pilgrims Rest, Port Elizabeth, Piet Retief, Pretoria, Soekmekaar, Tzaneen, Uitenhage. Wakkerstroom, Walmer, White River.</li>

</ol></li>

<li>(2) facilities for vaccination against smallpox free of charge are available and have been available for many years to the whole population throughout the country. The fact that the community is not adequately protected against the disease in all areas is due not to lack of the necessary facilities or publicity but to the inadequate response on the part of the public. This is illustrated by the fact that even in an outbreak, when of course special facilities are made available, it is sometimes necessary to resort to house to house searches to discover and vaccinate individuals, many of whom have deliberately avoided vaccination on religious or other grounds.</li>

</ol>

<p>In order to stimulate a more satisfactory response the Department has already taken special steps to see that the annual vaccination tours by district surgeons which take place each winter, are again reviewed so as to ensure that they provide as convenient a service as possible. Steps will be taken to prosecute persons who have not been vaccinated after the vaccination tours have been completed.</p>

<p>It is the intention of the Department to bring to the notice of the public of all races, through the medium of the press and the radio, the fact that such vaccination facilities are available, the need for vaccination and the Department&#x2019;s intention to institute proceedings against persons who do not comply with the requirements of the Public Health Act in this connection.</p>

<p>In addition, the Department has already obtained the co-operation of the various education departments to ensure the vaccination of school children and, through the children, to make known to their families the need for vaccination. The co-operation of the other Government Departments concerned such as Bantu Administration and Development, Interior, Coloured Affairs, Justice and Prisons have also been obtained. Moreover the Department is approaching all local authorities, the medical profession and all district nurses with a view to obtaining their active support in bringing home to the public the need for vaccination.</p>

<p>It must also be remembered that vaccination against smallpox does not provide life long immunity and therefore the measures taken by the Department each year are more appropriate than a single campaign as suggested.</p>

<p>On new Clause to follow Clause 5,</p>

<speech by="#ross">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">ROSS</person>:</from>

<p>I move as an amendment&#x2014;</p>

<p>That the following be a new clause to follow Clause 5 of the Bill:</p>

<p>6. Section 6 of the principal Act is hereby amended&#x2014;</p>

<ol>

<li>(a) by the substitution in paragraph (a) of sub-section (1) for the word &#x201C;sixty-two&#x201D; of the word &#x201C;seventy-five&#x201D;;</li>

<li>(b) by the substitution in paragraph (c) of that sub-section for the word &#x201C;thirty-four&#x201D; of the word &#x201C;fifty&#x201D; and for the word &#x201C;thirty-nine&#x201D; of the word &#x201C;seventy-five&#x201D;; and</li>

<li>(c) by the addition of the following paragraph to that sub-section:<br/>&#x201C;(g) in respect of any married woman whose income from her employment is included by her husband in his return of income as taxpayer under sub-section (1) of Section 68 a sum not exceeding a sum equal to 40 per cent of such woman&#x2019;s income but subject to a maximum deduction of R600.&#x201D;</li>

</ol>

<p>This amendment asks for increases in the rebates for married taxpayers, increases in the rebates for children and a rebate of 40 per cent of a wife&#x2019;s earned income. This is something which I know will stir the emotions of most of the people in this country, particularly as the request is so just and fair. You see, Sir, nothing or practically nothing has been given to the medium and lower income groups this year, notwithstanding the unreasonably large surplus which the hon. the Minister has. A surplus following in the wake of several surpluses in previous years, and amounting so far this year to R 128,000,000, which will probably finish up at R 150,000,000. The Minister&#x2019;s plaintive and almost tearful plea in his closing speech on the Appropriation Bill to approach this matter of this vast surplus in a sympathetic manner&#x2014;sympathetic to him, that is&#x2014; leaves me cold. The one who should get sympathy is the married man. His rebate was R62 in 1948 and it dropped to R52 in 1952-3 and was increased back to R62 the following year and has remained so ever since, and that is many years now. And remember that our currency was depreciated by 40 per cent during that period, but the purchasing power of our money dropped by well over 50 per cent and the cost of living has gone up some 76 per cent, but the ret&#x00ED;ate of the married man is still R62. I suppose the Minister at some stage will mutter something about two living as cheaply as one and refuse to do anything about this matter, but he will then hear much more about this rebate in the days to come, especially from the women.</p>

<p>Let us look at the child&#x2019;s rebate. At present it is R34 each for the first two children and R39 each for those who come thereafter. In 1948 this rebate was R20 per child and it rose by miserable steps to R24 in 1955. R28 in 1956. R30 in 1959 and R34 in 1960. I said that this increase came by miserable steps, and I mean it. This Minister will go down in history as the man with the Midas touch and the heart of stone.</p>

<p>I am asking for the marriage rebate to be increased from R62 to R75, a mere R13 per year. The hon. the Minister has one particular amount of R20,000,000 salted away and he could easily grant this. I think I am being far too modest in asking for this small increase, in view of the fact that while this rebate has been static the purchasing power of our money has declined ever since this Government came into power until it is less than half of what it was in 1948.</p>

<p>Now I want to turn to the children&#x2019;s rebate. I have given the figures of the miserly increase from R20 in 1948 to R34 in 1964. Sir, you know, the habits of small boys have not changed. Every tin and every stone that is kickable is kicked. Shoes must constantly be renewed. Boys wrestle and fight and play and tear their clothes, and always will. A few days ago I checked with a well-known firm in Cape Town the rise in the price of certain items of clothing in recent years. The price of shoes has gone up from R3.50 in 1955 to R5.50 now, i.e. R2 up; a shirt is 90c up from R1.75 to R2.65. Shorts are up 65c from R2.85 to R3.50, and a blazer from R8.35 to R 12,50, an increase of no less than R4.15. These prices are for the same quality articles, as nearly as possible, and on these four articles of clothing alone the increase in cost to the unfortunate parents since 1955 is R7.70, 70c more than the miserable increase in the child&#x2019;s allowance since 1948, and that does not include stockings, underclothes or caps. It is not even a full outfit. What boy or girl can get through a year with only one complete set of clothing? It is impossible. What about all the other things a child needs, an overcoat, mackintosh, food, holidays, schoolbooks and medical care? Has this Minister no heart? How can he leave this rebate and the married rebate at the present level while cynically assuring the House that he really was giving the first R88,000,000 of this surplus back to the people? When he said that the tears started running down my face. I shall be very interested to see how his party votes on this <span class="col_8641-8642" refersTo="page_0655"/>matter. He has much to answer for. As I said, he will go down as the Minister with the Midas touch&#x2014;or rather, grasp, and the heart of stone. I think that is really a wrong metaphor because he touches the people but they do not turn to gold; they turn into moneyless people. I am asking for the children&#x2019;s rebate to be increased from R34 to R50 for the first two children, and from R39 to R75 for any further children. This is not much to ask, and I ask the Minister please not to tell the House in reply that if the struggling parent has enough money left over to buy Johnny an extra pair of shoes when his soles are worn through, and an extra shirt and shorts, that this will ruin the country by its inflationary effect. Every time he talks about his surplus he talks about inflation. That won&#x2019;t wash. I hope he will do something about it.</p>

<p>The total number of married taxpayers in the year 1960-1 was 438,000 odd, and with their children that amounts to over a million votes, and the few million rand needed to meet these much needed increased abatements won&#x2019;t even dent the Minister&#x2019;s surplus. So let him grant them. Let him accept the amendment, thus showing that he has some regard for the man in the street, for the middle and lower income groups, who seem to get only increases in the cost of living; and don&#x2019;t hold it up and give it to them just before the next election. It is needed now, and nothing is stopping him from doing so. Does he not want them to have children? He seems to be trying to prevent an increased birth-rate. In case the Minister claims, as he claimed yesterday, that he now allows a child&#x2019;s rebate in regard to university students over the age of 18, let me point out to him that university fees were increased in 1951 and again six months ago and are now up by more than 30 per cent since 1951, so he granted no terrific favour when he gave that increase in the rebate. I see in the Press that rail fares are going up. Many children go to school by train, so that is another increase in expense. I will not say anything more. If I have not softened his heart then nothing will.</p>

<p>There is a third leg to this amendment dealing with a rebate of 40 per cent on any earned income of a wife. This proposal has equal demand for sympathetic treatment. I understood from what the Minister said yesterday that he agrees something must be done, but I do not think he should leave it over to after the recess. He now has a golden opportunity and he should take it. Opportunity taken at the flood leads on to fortune. I will not expand on this subject because certain other colleagues of mine will deal with it and my own time is short.</p>

<speech by="#durrant">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to support the amendment moved by the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross). I want to approach the heart of the Minister from quite another angle. The Minister is well aware that we have raised this matter now for the past two years. We raised it in regard to various aspects, particularly the need for higher education for the White population, and particularly for the lower income groups. I want to ask why originally these rebates for children were granted.</p>

<p>The original idea of giving a tax rebate by way of children&#x2019;s allowances was in order to give a facility to the lower income group, because they benefit more by these allowances than the higher income group. Originally the idea of giving a children&#x2019;s allowance and a marriage allowance was to assist the growth of the White population so that men could get married earlier and have larger families. When we raised this matter with the Minister last year he indicated that it was not the purpose of the Income Tax Act that it should be used for social purposes. I should like to quote his exact words. He said&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">But I think it is contrary to the very nature of the principle of the Income Tax to use it to ensure that various schemes of social reform are assisted through the medium of income tax.</block>

<p>At that time I thought it was the most amazing argument on the part of the Minister, because to my knowledge the Minister in various budgets gave tax relief either as an incentive to industry or to assist education by allowing tax-free donations, etc., and obviously the Act was being used for these very social purposes. I have taken the trouble to look up the position from the social aspect of the effect of the children&#x2019;s and married allowances. I want to give an example in respect of the average income group of the present effect of these allowances. I refer particularly to those employed in the mining industry. I have certain figures here that the Minister will find interesting. There are at present something like 43,350 members of the Mineworkers&#x2019; Union, with something like 56,000 odd children, and of these members 31,000 odd are married people with 55,533 children. There are 2,281 widows with 89 children. In other words, this works out to an average of 1.7 children per married family, and the contention is that this number of children is quite insufficient to meet the normal replacement required in this particular industry, or as far as the normal population growth is concerned. As far as widows are concerned it works out at .4 child per woman. Then there are, 1,102 fathers caring for 1,410 children without the assistance of a spouse, and there are 138 mothers out of this total caring for 204 children. There are 1,115 broken homes which have produced 1,614 children, still maintaining the same average of 1.4 child per marriage. Out of the total of 43,000 families employed in this industry there are no fewer than 9,032 who have produced no children. These statistics show that&#x2014;and I quote&#x2014;&#x201C;the South African way of life is threatened by economic conditions.&#x201D; In other words because of the increasing cost of living and because of the difficulties of maintaining a decent standard of living through inadequate taxation rebates and because of the burden placed on the little man, there is not the normal increase that <span class="col_8643-8644" refersTo="page_0656"/>there should be in our White working population. It is clear that if the Minister increases the rebate in respect of children he will be helping the lower-income group in South Africa.</p>

<p>Sir, the hon. member for Somerset East (Mrs. Vosloo) is a rich sheep farmer. Let him go and ask the White workers of the Witwatersrand what will be the use of this; let him go and ask the average man who has to pay income-tax what the use would be of increasing the rebate. If the rebate were increased, he would escape the little bit of taxation that he has to pay and he would be able to provide a little extra for his family, something which he cannot do to-day because of the hard-heartedness of the hon. the Minister. The hon. member does not seem to appreciate that we are pleading here for some part of this tremendous surplus to be used to relieve the burden of a cost of living on the little man, and the hon. member seems to overlook the social advantages that would accrue to the White population of South Africa as the result of such an increase in rebate. Then there is also the educational aspect of which we must not lose sight. The Minister says that a tremendous concession has already been made in raising the age limit from 18 to 24 years. We know for a fact that it is mainly those who fall in the higher income groups who are able to afford to send their children to university, but there are many talented children whose parents fall in the lower income group and who cannot afford to send them to university. That is a factor which hon. members on the Government benches overlook; they overlook the fact that there is a tremendous waste of talent in South Africa as a result of the fact that talented children in the lower income groups cannot afford to go to university. The reason is not that the parents cannot afford to pay the university fees, but they simply cannot afford to maintain the child while the child is attending university. In order to be able to maintain a reasonable standard of living they have to send the child out to work. The result is that all that talent is completely lost to this country, and the contribution that those children could have made to the future development of our country is completely lost. Sir, it is a little thing that we are asking, and what we are askins is some relief for the little man of South Africa who has received little or nothing from the Government out of this Budget.</p>

<p>Sir, a remarkable thing is happening here this morning. Hon. members of the Opposition now come along with an entirely new proposal on the last day on which financial measures are under consideration. We have been dealing with financial matters here since March. We first had the Budget debate; thereafter we were in Committee of Ways and Means, and hon. members often had the opportunity to raise matters of this kind, but in not one of those debates did they ever put forward the request which is contained in this amendment. But I want to go a little further into some of the arguments advanced here by hon. members. What they are trying to do is to create the impression that they want to assist the poor man, but we know what happened in the days when the United Party was in power. The hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) says that the poor man cannot afford the cost of education for his children. Does he think that if he increases the rebate per child from R34 to R50 he is going to enable that parent to send his child to university?</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Precisely. I just want to point out that hon. members opposite have a completely erroneous idea as to how this system works. We all have the greatest sympathy for these people in the lower-income groups, but surely the Opposition cannot come here with a proposal such as this when they cannot even tell us what it would cost to give effect to it. How many families in this country pay income-tax? If their request were complied with, then in the first place every family with children would be affected but every family without children would also benefit. Have hon. members opposite any idea what it would cost to give effect to their proposal? If they wanted to put forward a proposal such as this they should have investigated the cost first; they would then have been able to tell us whether this scheme will cost R 10,000,000 or R20.000.000.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>There was R40.000,000 available last year, not this year. What the hon. member wants to do is to spend last year&#x2019;s surplus in advance. That surplus of R40.000.000 is not a surplus in respect of the current financial year. This only goes to show how illogical hon. members opposite are. Take the case of a person who has a taxable income of less than R3.000 and who has a wife and three children. What benefit will he derive from the proposal of hon. members opposite? If he has a taxable income of R3.000, his basic taxation will be R176 per annum plus 8 per cent on any amount exceeding R2.400. From that amount he will then deduct R62, which is the basic rebate; he will then deduct R34 per child in respect of his first two children and R39 in respect of his third child, a <span class="col_8645-8646" refersTo="page_0657"/>total of R169, leaving a tax liability of R7. But he can also make a further deduction in respect of insurance premiums paid by him and in respect of contributions made by him to pension funds, and in addition to that he can deduct R200 from his taxable income for medical and dental expenses. In the normal course of events therefore, such a person with a wife and three children would pay no income-tax. What hon. members are doing here therefore is to plead for the rich man.</p>

<speech by="#van_den_heever">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VAN DEN HEEVER</person>:</from>

<p>Under the old system a rebate was allowed to taxpayers in respect of children on the following basis: The State allowed you to deduct &#x00A3;200 or &#x00A3;300 in respect of each child from your total income; actually the figure was a good deal lower but I merely mention the principle that the taxpayer was allowed to deduct a few hundred pounds in respect of each child, and he was then assessed on the balance as though he had no children. The present system, which replaced that old system, benefits families in the lower income groups; it does not benefit the rich man: the rich man pays much more to-day. The taxpayer who pays 60c or 80c on every R2 of his income now receives a much smaller benefit per child than the person who pays anything up to 30c per R2. That is where hon. members opposite are mistaken; the individual who pays a higher percentage of his income in income-tax because he has a higher income receives very little benefit from the present method of tax assessment as far as rebates in respect of children are concerned. The person with a smaller income, who pays a small percentage of his income in income-tax, derives much more benefit from the present system of rebates than the person with a large income. That is the principle on which we work, and that is the reason why this new formula was substituted for the old formula. The person who introduced this new system was Mr. Hofmeyr; he introduced it during the war years and in doing so he did a fine piece of work. I think it was introduced in 1941.</p>

The point that I want to bring home to hon. members opposite is that their proposal will only benefit the rich man. The person who earns R3.000 or less and who has three children would derive no benefit at all from their proposal, but what they want to do is to go and make propaganda amongst the people earning less than R3.000 and say to them. &#x201C;Look, we wanted to save you R15 or R20 per annum in income-tax but the Government would not agree.&#x201D; I say that such an allegation would be untrue. This proposal is no more than an attempt at political huckstering on the part of the Opposition with a view to the forthcoming provincial elections.</p>

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">EMDIN</person>:</from>

<p>But where are the proposals from the Government side, including the hon. member for Pretoria (Central), to help the poor man? We have been waiting for them to put forward such proposals ever since the Budget was produced four months ago but we have heard nothing from them, and every time we introduce a proposal to help the poor man the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) finds a reason why the proposal is not acceptable and yet he has no alternative to offer. Sir, what has that hon. member suggested this year that will bring some benefit to the poor and the underprivileged people of this country. He has suggested nothing at all. All he has done has been to get up in this House and to criticize proposals that we have put forward from this side.</p>

<p>I do not think there is really any need for me to deal with paragraphs (a) and (b) of the amendment on the Order Paper. After the elequent plea made by the hon. member for Benoni (Mr. Ross) to the hon. the Minister to give effect to the modest request contained in this amendment there is very little more to be said. I would like to deal very briefly with paragraph (c). The hon. the Minister was good enough to say in the second reading that he would give some consideration to the question of the taxation of married women. There are just one or two matters that I would like to bring to his notice to assist him to come to a decision in considering our amendment. The hon. the Minister will know that in the United Kingdom, in terms of Section 210 of the Income Tax Act of 1952, provision is made to give some relief to a married woman in resoect of her earned income. Two-ninths of her salary is not taxable, and on seven-ninths of the balance she gets relief up to a maximum of &#x00A3;200, so if a woman in England earns &#x00A3;900 per annum she is given relief to the extent of &#x00A3;400. Sir, it is interesting to note how the English Act describes it; it is regarded as a direct allowance on the joint income of her husband and the wife. It is a special allowance which is granted to compensate the woman for the fact that she is working herself. Sir, we said yesterday afternoon that the economic unit in this country was the husband and the wife. That brings certain problems with it as far as the <span class="col_8647-8648" refersTo="page_0658"/>woman is concerned. Because both husband and wife work, that family unit has to make provision for certain things which they do not have to provide for when the husband only is working. There is the question of servants, there is the question of somebody to look after the children; there is the question of fetching the children from school, etc. Whatever social aspects may be involved in the question as to whether a wife should work or not, those aspects do not come into the picture; the wife is forced by economic circumstances to work and it is our duty to give that family some relief. There also seems to be a certain amount of unfairness in the present basis of taxation. Let us take the case where the husband alone is working and where his income is X and the tax is Y. Then take the case where both husband and wife are working and where the joint income is X through the efforts of the husband and the wife; in that case the tax is still Y, but here you have two people expending their efforts for the same amount of income and still having to pay the same amount of tax. In other words, in the one family the wife is a lady of leisure and in the other family the wife is a working woman, and yet the two families pay exactly the same amount in taxation. It seems to me that the time has come when some adjustment is called for. It is true&#x2014;and one must accept&#x2014;that there can be abuses if the taxpayer is allowed a certain amount of relief on the income earned by his wife. The hon. the Minister told us yesterday about people who spend their lives scheming how to avoid the payment of income-tax. and we acknowledge the fact that there will be abuses but they will be minor abuses. You will have the situation where the husband has a business in which his wife ostensibly works and where he pays her a salary. Well, let us benefit the many families where the wives are working rather than take too much notice of abuses which may take place in a few instances. Sir, I hope that the hon. the Minister will accept this amendment. It is a very simple one. I hope he will accept the principle inherent in this amendment and that next year, when he has had an opportunity of examining all the implications of the proposal, he will come forward with additional proposals.</p>

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">VOSLOO</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member who has just sat down and the hon. member for Turffontein (Mr. Durrant) have come along with the argument that the Income Tax Act makes no provision for the alleviation of the taxation burden resting on the poor man. Sir, we were in Committee of Supply for 100 hours, and now for the first time, at this late stase of the Session, hon. members of the Opposition come along with these proposals and with the reproach, voiced here by the hon. member for Brakpan (Mr. Emdin), that no proposals have been put forward by the Government to help the poor man. We are constantly told by the Opposition that the State must set the example by increasing salaries and wages of the workers. In this connection I just want to remind hon. members of the fact that provision is made in these Estimates for an amount of R34,087,661 for increased salaries, wages and allowances. Then we come to Social Welfare and Pensions. Sir, you will not allow us to conduct the Budget debate all over again but I just want to point out that under the Social Welfare and Pensions Vote provision is made for an additional amount of R3,708,640; and so we can take all the various items to show how much more the State is spending this year to alleviate the position of the wageearner and the salaried man. But in spite of these improvements, the Opposition come along here this morning with this particular amendment. With what object? They come along with this amendment at this late stage of the Session, just before the prorogation of Parliament and just before the first shots will be fired in the forthcoming provincial election, in order to create the impression that the Party which has pleaded here for the poor man is the Opposition Party and that this Government has a heart of granite and refuses to make any concessions. That is the only reason for the plea which was made here this morning by that side of the House. We know that when the hon. the Minister announced this year that the tax rebate would again be 5 per cent as it was last year, hon. members of the Opposition urged that the rebate should be 10 per cent. They allegedly want to reduce the burden of taxation on the poor man. We have heard that same story <i>ad nauseam</i>during this Session from the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) who is now leaving the Chamber. Sir, I mentioned certain figures here in the previous debate to show that the poor man will derive no benefit from the Opposition&#x2019;s proposal to increase the rebate in respect of children. The poor man with three children who earns R300 or less per annum will derive no benefit from it. It is only the taxpayers in the higher income-tax brackets who will derive any benefit, and I take it that those are not the people for whom the Opposition are pleading here. I take it that like us they are concerned&#x2014;or at any rate they ought to be&#x2014;about the lot of the pensioner and the lot of those persons who do not even fall in the category of income-taxpayers, and we have shown already that those people will derive no benefit from the Opposition&#x2019;s proposal. The hon. member for Turffontein referred here to the birth rate and tried to suggest that if the amendment of the Opposition were accepted the birth rate would increase but that, of course, is so much nonsense. If the argument of the hon. member is correct then the population group earning the highest wages in South Africa must be the Bantu; but what is the true position? Although the vast majority of the Bantu do not pay income-tax one finds that the highest birth rate is in fact amongst the Bantu.</p>

I raised it again last year and the Minister then said that he had investigated it but he turned it down. I then put forward certain alternative propositions. The Minister knows that I suggested a sliding scale, as far as these allowances are concerned, or alternatively an increased allowance, but last year the Minister turned down that suggestion. In view of the fact that this year part of a large surplus is being tucked away by the Government, we now come along with a positive amendment in which we proposed that the Act be amended so that the necessary relief can be granted to people in the lower and middle income groups.</p>

Surely the hon. member knows that a large portion of this R3,000,000 odd is to cover the additional administrative costs of institutions. But where is relief being given to the little man? The hon. member will find that the amount appropriated in respect of allowances and gratuities is R237,000 less this year than it was last year. Why does he not look at the amount provided for war veterans, old-age and blind persons&#x2019; benefits? There he will find that there is a reduction of R225,000 in comparison with the figure voted last year. Sir, I could quote other examples.

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">DURRANT</person>:</from>

<p>Sir, the plea that I want to make to the hon. the Minister is that every inducement should be given in every possible direction to the South African taxpayers to increase our population, particularly in these days of high living costs. Necessary though an immigration scheme is, I put it to the hon. the Minister that he can do more than the Minister of Immigration, and at a lower cost, to increase our own South African population <span class="col_8651-8652" refersTo="page_0660"/>by offering the necessary inducement to parents to have larger families. The plain fact of the matter is that the birth rate among the working classes of South Africa is declining, and I put it to the Minister that it is a very serious situation when the average number of children per family is only 1.7. Looking at the matter in that light, I think the hon. the Minister should accept the amendment moved by my hon. colleague, because he will then at least be giving some relief to those families in need of relief. Obviously the bigger the family the greater the tax relief will be on the basis of the amendment moved by my colleague. Sir, I plead with the hon. the Minister not to allow himself to be misled by the arguments advanced here by the hon. member for Somerset East.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>It seems to me that the Budget debate which started in March is taking a very long time indeed to come to an end; every now and again we get a fresh instalment, and we have again had a further instalment here to-day. I do not agree with the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) that this amendment is only an afterthought on the part of the Opposition; I think it is a deliberate attempt to make propaganda with a view to the forthcoming elections. Sir, this attempt is so transparent that one is amazed that the Opposition saw fit to move such an amendment here. Do they really think that this amendment will deceive a single person in the group for whom they now suddenly plead here?</p>

<p>Sir, there are one or two basic facts that we must take into account. The first is that this rebate in respect of children was increased in the days when the United Party was in power. At that time the rebate was R15 per child. Since then it has practically been doubled. The rebate in the case of married persons was R44; to-day it is R62. The increase has more than kept pace with the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>Then there is a second fact of which hon. members on the other side lose sight and that is the difference between a rebate and an abatement. That is perfectly clear from the proposal contained in (c) as well as the proposal contained in (a) and (b). As far as the R34 per child is concerned it does not mean that the taxpayer is only allowed R34 per child. The position is that that R34 which is deducted from his income-tax is equivalent to a deduction of R425 from his taxable income. The rebate of R39 for the third child is equivalent to R480 of his income. This increase has more than kept pace with the increase in the cost of living.</p>

<p>There is a third fact that I can mention if the Opposition are looking for ammunition for the election. This proposal of theirs, if accepted, would not benefit the people who are really poor; it would only benefit those people who are taxpayers. My complaint against the use of the income-tax formula for social reforms is the fact that its range is so limited. Let me just show hon. members which people will not benefit, not only from the proposal which has been put forward here to-day but under any proposal which seeks to use the taxation formula as an instrument for social reform: I have said time and again in this House that that principle has been generally adopted but that I regard it as a wrong principle. Before I agreed to extend it, therefore, the whole position would have to be very carefully examined. It is much better to make available specific sums of money for social services because then the money is spent where the need is greatest. If hon. members look at these Estimates they will see that 38.5 per cent of the entire appropriation goes towards social services. The bulk of that 38.5 per cent will be spent on the poor because we know that in every country of the world the poor outnumber the rich.</p>

<p>We are told that we must encourage children to go to university. The granting of a bursary is not the only way in which the State encourages children to go to university. Do hon. members know that 71 per cent of the costs of every university is contributed by the State? That amount is contributed by the State not only for the benefit of people who pay income-tax; the lad who is poor derives as much benefit from it as anybody else. That is something which hon. members overlook.</p>

<p>Then there is a further fact that I want to give hon. members on the other side to take along with them when they fight the forthcoming election. Under this system of rebates a married couple with one child only start paying income-tax if they have an income of R 1,402; if they have two children they only start paying when they have an income of R 1.826; if they have three children they start paying when they have an income of R2,314; if they have four children they start paying on an income of R2,802. None of these people with four, three or two children or with one child and with the incomes which I have mentioned here would benefit by the proposal put forward by the Opposition. Hon. members have no idea what they are asking for. And that is my objection to the use of the taxation formula for the purpose of bringing about social reforms.</p>

<p>May I ask a question?</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#minister_of_finance">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">MINISTER OF FINANCE</person>:</from>

<p>The hon. member has spoken often already, and I am afraid that if his question is going to be of the same quality as his speeches it will not be worthwhile replying to it.</p>

<p>I want to make a further point. The hon. member for Parktown (Mr. Emdin), after pointing out that the hon. member for Pretoria (Central) (Mr. van den Heever) had said that this proposal would not help the poor man, then asked what we were doing for the poor man. My reply to that is to be found in what I have already said in connection with the 38.5 per cent which is spread over the <span class="col_8653-8654" refersTo="page_0661"/>whole of the Estimates. I gave the House certain figures the other day to prove that, on a <i>per capita</i>basis and in terms of the real value of money, there has been a more rapid increase in pensions than there has been in the nation income. In other words, those people have had more than their share of the prosperity that we have been enjoying in this country.</p>

<p>In conclusion I just want to ask hon. members whether they realize what the cost of these proposals would be&#x2014;proposals which, in any event, would not benefit the man who is really poor. I asked my Department to work out the cost. To give effect to proposals (a) and (b) would cost R21,323,457. Hon. members are asking me just to give away a sum of that order. The question that I ask myself is whether, if it is possible for us, in the fiscal and economic position in which we find ourselves, to give away R21,000,000 at this stage, there are not other ways, with equally praiseworthy objects, in which that money can be given away. Must we give it away in this fashion and exclude the groups I have just mentioned? Sir, in saying what they did the hon. members for Pretoria (Central) and Somerset East (Mr. Vosloo) were not anticipating me; they were merely using their common sense.</p>

<p>I now come to proposal (c) in this amendment. Again it seems to me that members are confused about the difference between a rebate and an abatement. The hon. member wants to add a new sub-section (g) to Clause 6 which deals with rebates. In terms of this new subsection (g) the hon. member wants me to deduct &#x201C;a sum not exceeding a sum equal to 40 per cent of such woman&#x2019;s income but subject to a maximum deduction of R600&#x201D; from the tax payable. This suggestion is totally misplaced here; its effect is rather ludicrous. This is a simple amendment but not in the sense the hon. member for Parktown said it was. I agree; it is simple because what does it amount to? Let me tell hon members: As the position is at the moment a man with an income of R 1.500 and with no children has to pay R42 in normal tax. If his wife earns R600 the tax on their combined income of R2,100 would be R90. If a rebate of 40 per cent, as suggested in this amendment, on the wife&#x2019;s income were to be allowed you would have to subtract 40 per cent of R600 from the R90. That shows you, Sir, that the hon. member has not really worked this out.</p>

<p>As I told the House yesterday this matter has already received my attention. Before this matter was raised in this House I instructed my Department to go into the whole question of married women generally, not only those who were working. I do not think any purpose will be served if we argue about the details at this stage. I cannot therefore accept the amendment.</p>

<p>I am pleased that the Minister has confirmed what he said yesterday about the question of taxing married women&#x2019;s income. I am very pleased about that and we shall not press that matter further at this stage.</p>

<p>I want to ask the Minister which of his statements is correct in regard to the first two portions of this amendment? In the one breath he says the proposals will benefit nobody and in the next breath he says it will cost R20,000,000 odd. Well, if it is going to cost R20,000,000, is nobody going to gain anything by that? He has R150,000,000 towards that amount so he will have a considerable sum over even if his figure of R20,000,000 is correct which I contest.</p>

<p>I wish to move the amendment standing in the name of the hon. member for Pinetown (Mr. Hopewell)&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">To insert the following as a paragraph (a) after &#x201C;amended&#x201D; in line 19:<br/>(a) by the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (d):<br/>(d) <i>bis</i>expenditure actually incurred by the owner or occupier of any place or area referred to in sub-section (3) of Section 18 of the General Law Amendment Act, 1963 (Act No. 37 of 1963), in complying with an order of the Minister referred to in that sub-section;&#x201D;.</block>

<p>I want to read the sub-section he refers to in his amendment in order to clarify the position. Sub-section (1) of Section 18 of the General Law Amendment Act, No. 37 of 1963, reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">Whenever the Minister of Justice considers it to be in the public interest or in the interest of the safety of the State to prevent unauthorized persons from being within any place or area, he may by notice published in the <i>Gazette</i>or made known in any other manner which he considers sufficient in the circumstances declare such place or area to be a protected place or area.</block>

<p>Sub-section (3) reads&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The said Minister may by notice in writing order the owner or occupier of any place or area which has so been declared to be a protected place or area, at his own expense and within such period as may be specified in the notice, to take such precautionary measures (including the erection of fencing works) for safeguarding such place or area and to erect such warning notices as may be so specified.</block>

<p>Under our Act as it stands at present such expenditure will not be allowed as a deduction from the revenue of the company; it would be regarded as capital expenditure. In terms of our Act the essence of expenditure is that it must be incurred in the production of income. There is no shadow of doubt that under the Act, as it stands at the moment, the Revenue Department will have to add back any expenditure incurred under this section. It does not seem fair to us that the company or person should be forced to take these precautionary measures, in the interests of the company or himself, and not be allowed to deduct it for income-tax purposes. It is for the purpose of arranging that that will be allowed as a deduction that this amendment is moved.</p>

<p>I hope that as far as this amendment is concerned the hon. the Minister will not find himself in the same dilemma in which he found himself in regard to all the other amendments. On each occasion we have moved amendments in which we have pleaded for a slightly larger slice of the rapidly increasing national cake for the lower income groups the Minister has been so afraid that he may be accused of playing politics if he accepted them that he turned them down.</p>

<p>As far as this amendment is concerned, I am sure the hon. the Minister cannot have the same reticence about accepting it. I realize, of course, that this is not expenditure to produce income, but we already have a parallel in our Income Tax Act. The type of expenditure that will be incurred will be largely in connection with the erection of walls and fences. The Act already provides that farmers can deduct all expenditure in connection with the fencing of their farms. It is true that, from a legal point of view, it is capital expenditure and not expenditure to produce income. But if you look at it from the point of view of the manufacturer who has to undertake these security measures, on the instructions of the Minister, it is not really capital expenditure. A manufacturer incurs capital expenditure so that he can produce more efficiently and step up his production. But this expenditure has nothing to do with the production of the factory. It is expenditure incurred on a purely security measure. So it is unfair to treat it as capital expenditure from the manufacturer&#x2019;s point of view. I think the hon. the Minister can easily allow this as a special type of deduction. He has the added advantage that he cannot possibly accuse us of playing politics in this instance.</p>

<p>The only merit of this amendment is that it is not blatant political propaganda, and I am thankful for that. I think we have had enough of the other type of amendment. It is quite clear that any expenditure which is not of a capital nature can be deducted under Section 11 (a). That would include the wages paid to a watchman for instance. Whether expenditure incurred for security reasons is also deductible under 11 (a) is a matter which the hon. member can argue with the secretary. I do not know.</p>

<p>Well, that is really what he wants to do and not to have it on the basis of 11 (a), which is applicable to all expenditure falling within that class.

I cannot accept this amendment because, first of all, it runs directly counter to the principle of Section 11 (a), and not only Section 11 (a), but also counter to the principle of the whole Income Tax Act, which states very clearly that you can only deduct expenditure incurred for the earning of your income.</p>

<p>For many years under the old regulations owners have been called upon from time to time to effect structural alterations to their buildings, although they have never been allowed to deduct the cost of such structural alterations, alterations which they had to make under an order from a competent authority, from their taxable income. My third objection to this amendment is that it contains a principle which is grossly unfair. The man who voluntarily takes steps for the safeguarding of his property will not be able to get it, but will have to wait until he gets an order from the Minister to take those security measures. It is, after all, the protection of his own property and of the community of which he is a part. Now, if he does this voluntarily he will not, in terms of this amendment, have any benefit from it in so far as income-tax is concerned. If the amendment is accepted, therefore, nobody will do it voluntarily, but will wait until they get an order from the Minister. Therefore this amendment is unfair. It will, moreover, create a dangerous precedent, and will run counter to the whole idea of the Income Tax Act. On &#x2019; these grounds I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.</p>

He has had to take over this Department at a time when P.A.Y.E. was just introduced, and he had to pilot this scheme through the dangerous waters. He had to see to the application of it, to attend to its teething troubles and see it on its way. Well, let me say that Mr. Ingram left behind a very good record indeed in this respect. [Hear, hear!] He was courteous and at all times approachable. The service is losing from his retirement.</p>

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Chairman, I want to refer to the question of repayment dealt with in this clause. It is true that we accepted the principle embodied in this clause last night by adopting the second reading of this Bill. According to the wording of the clause, the Minister of Finance shall determine on what basis these loans must be repaid. We take the view that the Minister of Finance should do that but only after consultation with the Minister of Education, Arts and Science. Now, hon. members will say that that is axiomatic, i.e., that there will be collaboration between two Ministers sitting in the same Cabinet. But we on this side of the House are slightly doubtful about that, not because we are afraid that there is no collaboration amongst members of the Cabinet but because of the background to this question of loans and bursaries, a question which has for so many years been neglected by this Government. Therefore, we consider that there should be an additional safeguard in connection with this matter. Before the Minister of Finance makes his Budget allocations each year every Minister in the Cabinet is running after him for more money so as to be able to run his own particular Department more efficiently. In the cir <span class="col_8659-8660" refersTo="page_0664"/>cumstances we consider that it should be stated clearly in this Bill that the Minister of Finance, in consultation with the Minister of Education, Arts and Science, shall determine the basis of these repayments. The Minister of Education is, after all, the best person to decide how much money is needed for the allocations he has to make. We are not going to move any formal amendment at this stage. Therefore, I put this point to the Minister for consideration. If accepted, it would give the Minister a greater opportunity of bringing pressure to bear upon his colleagues in the Cabinet.</p>

I can give the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylqr) the assurance that we have up to the present always been blessed with a reasonable Minister of Finance.

<speech by="#taylor">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>I raised the question of the personnel who are to serve on the advisory committee last night. The Minister in his reply stated, in effect, that if he were to add three more members to this committee&#x2014;the National Study Loans and Bursary Committee &#x2014;it would result in that committee becoming top-heavy. But I find this argument singularly invalid in the present circumstances. With only seven members on the committee, as it stands, to add three more people would hardly have the effect the Minister foresees. It is, after all, a very important committee, which will have to decide on the allocation of loans and bursaries for students in higher educational institutions throughout the length and breadth of the country. With this in mind, I regret to say that I do not see much substance in the Minister&#x2019;s argument. This committee will have an extremely vital task. The one body in the country which, one would think, should be represented on it is the National Education Advisory Council. The hon. the Deputy Minister said last night that the Secretary for Education could represent that council quite adequately, in addition to representing the Joint Matriculation Board and the Manpower Research and Planning Committee. With great respect to the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science, I do not think it is possible for him adequately to represent these three very important educational bodies. Though he will have their reports submitted to him he will not necessarily have sat in on all the discussions of these three major educational bodies. I consider that to have someone on this bursary committee, who is conversant with the situation in the schools, is absolutely fundamental. In any event, not all matriculation students fall under the Department of Education, Arts and Science. The vast majority of these students, as the hon. the Minister knows, fall under the provinces. We consider it to be fundamental that the Joint Matriculation Board should be represented by someone who is conversant with the position of matriculants, as well as with the position of Stds. VIII and IX pupils and pupils at technical colleges and other institutions. After all, the task of this bursary committee will be to allocate bursaries and loans to deserving pupils. Sir, the people I have mentioned will know much more about this subject than anyone else. And the new proposed Manpower Research and Planning Committee, which the Minister intends setting up in terms of the National Education Advisory Council Act, will be in a position to inform this bursary committee how many scientific students we need to train, how many for the professions, how many as teachers, nurses, doctors, technicians or technologists.</p>

<p>I know it is the end of the Session and that we are not in a position to move amendments. This has made our position very difficult at this stage. But for the Minister to say that the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science can adequately represent all these bodies is something we are not prepared to accept. I should like to ask the Minister to turn his attention to this aspect of the matter during the recess and to reconsider his standpoint. If necessary, he could then come with an amendment next year.</p>

<p>Clause 5 (1) (b) provides that three persons appointed by the Minister shall represent donors on this National Study Loan and Bursary Committee. One&#x2019;s natural inclination is to move for the appointment of a donors&#x2019; committee who shall appoint these three representatives. But it is too late now to move an amendment to that effect. However, I should like to suggest to the hon. the Deputy Minister that the three persons to be appointed by the Minister to represent donors on the Bursary Committee should be appointed by the Minister asking the donors to set up <span class="col_8661-8662" refersTo="page_0665"/>an <i>ad hoc</i>donors&#x2019; committee for the purpose of nominating three members with alternates.

<p>The suggestion made by the hon. member for Kensington (Mr. Moore) will be kept in mind. The difficulty in regard to the appointment of representatives of donors is the fact that donors are scattered throughout the country. That is why provision is being made here for their appointment by the Minister as is already being done in regard to the University Council of the University of South Africa. But the suggestion which the hon. member has made will be borne in mind.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) asked that the three bodies which she mentioned should each have direct representation on the Bursaries Committee. Here again we come up against the old problem that when one gives representation to certain bodies, three will always be others who will claim the same right but which cannot be given that right. But I do admit that the three bodies mentioned by the hon. member are bodies whose opinions one would like to hear. Nevertheless, I ask hon. members to give this measure an opportunity to be applied in its present form. If it appears at a later stage that we also need the assistance of these three bodies we will not hesitate to effect the necessary amendment to the Act.</p>

<p>I want to be sure that as much attention will be paid for instance to Std. 8 and 9 pupils going to technical colleges as to those who want to go to universities. I do not want the Minister to think in terms of a rigid scale&#x2014;that this type of student will get this, another type that, and so on. We should like the Minister&#x2019;s approach to be flexible in this regard and to know that he is prepared to consider all the different categories of students, and the various courses they will follow.</p>

<p>I make this point for one very good reason. In the United Kingdom for instance they have tried out this system and for many years they had a rigid scale, at least prior to 1958. Then the Anderson Committee was appointed to go into the whole matter of bursaries, grants and loans and that committee recommended that there should be more flexibility and that every type of student should be treated on the basis of merit and differing circumstances. In other words, the approach should be as flexible as possible. This is what I had in mind when I spoke about equality of treatment.</p>

<p>The hon. member has obviously not read the Bill. Clause 8 provides for the granting of study loans and bursaries to &#x201C;students&#x201D;. When one looks at the definition of &#x201C;student&#x201D; one notes that a student is a person who is in possession of the matriculation certificate. Therefore, these bursaries will not be available to Standard 8 and 9 pupils. They do not qualify for them at all and so the hon. member&#x2019;s argument falls away.</p>

<p>I do not quite agree with the attitude adopted by the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder). The hon. member for Wynberg asked the hon. the Minister to give us some more information in regard to the basis on which these bursaries and loans will be granted. I think it is necessary for us to have further information in this regard particularly as far as students at universities are concerned. Is it the intention to make money available to universities for this purpose on the basis of numbers, according to the hostels? What will the standard be which will be applied? I think we are entitled to ask the hon. the Minister to give us an indication of what will more or less be the basis on which these loans and bursaries will be made available. Will it be on the basis of the need in our country for technologists, scientists and others, or will more emphasis be placed upon the training of teachers? I think the hon. the Minister ought to tell us. After all, this is an important provision in this Bill.</p>

<p>I do not accept that the interpretation of the hon. member for Randfontein of this clause is correct. A &#x201C;student&#x201D; according to the definition means <i>inter alia&#x2014;</i></p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any person &#x2026; who intends continuing his studies at any university for a degree, diploma or certificate or at any declared institution or vocational school for a diploma or certificate which, in the opinion of the Minister, is superior to such matriculation certificate.</block>

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">TAYLOR</person>:</from>

<p>Of course it is. But I ask the hon. the Deputy Minister to clarify this matter. As I see it, the whole purpose of this Bill is to assist young people who cannot afford to remain at school up to matriculation, but who have great potential abilities and can be trained at technical colleges and other institutions where they do not have to have matriculation. To my mind, it is definite that the people we want to assist here are not only those going to universities, but also those thousands of youngsters who leave school at the age of 16 and before they have reached Std. 8 and who possess the ability to go further, but cannot afford to do so. As a matter of fact, that is what the Minister said last night, i.e. that the purpose is to assist underprivileged people, people who cannot afford to study further. I do not think the hon. member for Randfontein is correct in saying that the whole of this Bill is based upon pupils who have matriculated or attained an equivalent standard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I want to put the matter clearly for the purposes of the record. Let us read again the definition of &#x201C;student&#x201D; in Clause 1, so that we will all know what that definition is:</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; any person who has obtained the matriculation certificate issued by a joint matriculation board referred to in Section 15 of the Universities Act, 1955, or any other certificate which, in the opinion of the Minister, is equivalent to such matriculation certificate &#x2026;</block>

<p>The first condition is therefore that a student must obtain this certificate. If he does not obtain it, the remaining portion of the definition falls away, which is&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; and who intends continuing his studies at any university for a degree, diploma or certificate or at any declared institution or vocational school for a diploma or certificate which, in the opinion of the Minister, is superior to such matriculation certificate.</block>

<p>It is clear therefore that only certificates which are of a higher standard than a matriculation certificate are envisaged here. The hon. member referred to vocational schools. A vocational school&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">&#x2026; means any school established or deemed to have been established under the Vocational Education Act, 1955.</block>

<p>All technical institutions for higher education, all technical colleges where people are trained as teachers or as domestic science teachers and so forth are in terms of this definition classified as vocational schools. I think I am right in saying that the definition of &#x201C;student&#x201D; as it stands here does not cover pupils below matriculation standard.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#deputy_minister_of_education_arts_and_science">

<from>*The <person refersTo="hansard_za">DEPUTY MINISTER OF EDUCATION, ARTS AND SCIENCE</person>:</from>

<p>The interpretation which the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) has given to this clause is in conformity with our intention in regard to this matter. It appears to me that the confusion in this regard is due to the fact that there are many students at technical colleges who are doing post-matriculation work. We have this post-matriculation work being done at all the large technical colleges. This legislation is actually intended to assist those people who possess a matriculation or an equivalent certificate and who want to study in a technological direction, to become qualified as technicians or as technical or commerce teachers.</p>

<p>I want to give the hon. member for Wynberg (Mrs. Taylor) the assurance that we will approach this legislation with a very open mind, which is what she wants. I agree with her point of view that the basis determined must not be too narrow. On the contrary; it must be flexible and be applied in a fair way in respect of these persons whether they are at a technical college or at a university.</p>

<p>As far as the basis upon which assistance will be determined is concerned, I want to point out that it is already provided in this legislation that that basis will be worked out by the Loans and Bursaries Committee. One idea which the Secretary for Education, Arts and Science will submit to the Committee is that in working out that basis the Committee should emphasize the number of students living at hostels. The main purpose of this measure is to assist the needy student, and this need exists most on the part of those students who have to pay hostel fees. That is why we feel that if this measure is to fulfil its purpose, these hostel fees must play a very important part in the determination of this basis. But this is not something that is being prescribed; it is only an idea which will be submitted to the Committee for its consideration.</p>

<p>This is my last word on the subject. My point is simply, after the Minister&#x2019;s explanation, that it is a matter of <span class="col_8665-8666" refersTo="page_0667"/>great disappointment to many of us to hear that these loans and bursaries are only to be allocated to people who have achieved matriculation or its equivalent, because that immediately excludes thousands of potentially able and deserving young South Africans who are in need of training in the commercial and vocational schools provided by the Government after the Std. VIII level of education has been reached. I think that those people need assistance more than anyone else. We know that those who want to go to the university need help also, but there are masses of children in South Africa to-day just over the age of 16 with a Std. VIII qualification who need assistance. I think they need it more than anybody else. We need skilled artisans and technicians very badly. They form the broad mass of the working population of South Africa, and it is important that the level of education of those people should be raised at the same time as we seek to raise the level of the academically trained people. [Interjection.] The hon. member says he agrees, but the hon. the Minister says, in effect, that only people with matric or its equivalent can receive assistance in terms of this Bill, and we, on this side of the House, regret that very much indeed.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#streicher">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">STREICHER</person>:</from>

<p>As we said during the second-reading debate, we on this side are not in complete agreement with some of the principles of this Bill. The main principle of the Bill is, indeed, a good one. It is to enable a fund to be established, a fund which will assist students, who cannot themselves afford it, to receive higher education after matriculation. This Bill now gives the business and industrial world the opportunity to make a greater contribution towards education in this country; in other words, in effect to invest in education. In earlier years considerable numbers of grants and donations were made by private individuals to our universities, but for some reason or other those institutions are apparently no longer obtaining as much money from that source to-day, with the result that the State has had to play a steadily increasing role in this regard. We find that in a country like America a fantastic amount of money is donated to the universities by private industries and businesses. I can sum up the reason for this by quoting from an article which was written by Professor de Kiewiet in <i>Optima</i>a few years ago. This is what he had to say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">An American attitude which seems especially needful in South Africa is the conviction that a strong system of higher education is everybody&#x2019;s business. It is not the business of Government alone. Spokesmen for higher education have been especially insistent that business and industry are themselves so much the beneficiaries of university education that they are obliged to give it their financial support. What is more, some of the keenest leaders in business and industry have expressed their agreement with this principle. &#x2026; It is of practical importance to recognize that many business leaders in America no longer support higher education out of charity or a spirit of good citizenship. They tend increasingly to support universities because it is sound business practice to do so.</block>

<p>If we on this side can do anything to influence the industrial and business world to do their share by contributing to the fund, we shall not hesitate to do so. We shall give them every encouragement, which is the case to-day in many other countries.</p>

<p>The background to this legislation is, of course, that we all realize how many potential students there are in the country who do not have the money to enable them to receive university training. This legislation proves that we all realize this fact. But we believe that the main aim of this legislation is to alleviate the fantastic shortage which we have in respect of artisans, managers and scientists. This legislation will relieve that position, and that is why we support it. But it is a pity that the responsibility of Parliament and the Government in this matter is so limited. It is tragic that we should at this stage have to fall back upon the business world in order to have the position rectified. I think that it is a pity that the State has been hesitant to accept the responsibility which it ought to accept. The position is that the State is relying more upon the business world to rectify this matter. I do not want to give the impression that the State has done absolutely nothing in this connection. The latest estimates are an example in this regard. When one considers what the provincial authorities and other State Departments are doing, one cannot say that the State has <span class="col_8667-8668" refersTo="page_0668"/>done nothing. But one would have expected, under the circumstances in which we are living to-day, that the State would have accepted a far larger measure of responsibility in this regard.</p>

<p>A last point I wish to make is that the hon. the Minister of Education, Arts and Science told us in this House on a previous occasion that he considered absolutely free bursaries to have a demoralizing effect upon our nation. The committee can recommend the allocation of bursaries and study loans in terms of this Bill and, with a view to the background to this matter which the hon. the Minister gave us some time ago, I really want to request the hon. the Deputy Minister to put the position very clearly to us in regard to what the State actually means by bursaries and loans. We understand what is meant by loans, but I think that it was a generally accepted idea that if a person was given a bursary, that bursary was not repayable. When the parents of a student are not in the position to pay for his studies, one feels that if that student is given a bursary, he should not have to repay that money. But a man who is at all in a better position can make use of a loan which he will have to repay. I think that we must make our meaning in regard to bursaries and loans very clear. I should like a bursary to be regarded as something which is given free simply because the student to whom it is given is an outstanding student, but is not in the financial position of being able to further his studies. In cases such as this we think that that money should not be repayable. I should like the hon. the Deputy Minister to give us clarity in regard to this point. Apart from this, we support this legislation wholeheartedly.</p>

</speech>

<speech by="#smit">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">SMIT</person>:</from>

<p>I think that we all agree that this is a very timely and useful measure. We realize the possibilities of this measure&#x2014; that it can be developed into a sort of snowball, particularly for the training of needy students. But because the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) (Mr. Streicher) has now given us to understand that there has been an &#x201C;unfortunate hesitancy&#x201D; on the part of the State to take a share in the training of our needy students, I want to refer him to the speech which the hon. the Minister made this year in regard to this matter and the amounts which have been voted for bursary and loan purposes over the past few years, since 1956, since the report of the Holloway Commission. I also want to remind him further that this legislation gives effect to the positive contribution of the State because the money which will now be deducted from private industries in the form of donations which can be deducted from their taxable incomes, is income which the State is forfeiting. In other words, there is an encouragement on the part of the State to commerce and industry to take an interest in the education of needy students. At the same time this Bill contains a principle to the effect that these students must themselves assume responsibility for these bursaries or loans.</p>

<p>The hon. member asked what is meant by bursaries and loans. Because we are dealing specifically here with the question of needy students, I want to say that I personally feel that bursaries which will in the normal course of events not be repayable, will be made available, as far as hostel fees are concerned, to needy students particularly, because there is a particular need for this. But besides this I want to say that I feel that a very large percentage of the money which is made available for needy students from this fund must be in the form of loans which will also be used to cover class fees. I feel that this must be so because the student himself must also accept a responsibility in this regard and must feel obliged to repay this money. I feel that the loans should be interest-free for the period of study but that the student must accept responsibility for repaying that money at a later stage so that the money can again be used for other needy students.</p>

<p>I am grateful that the legislation makes provision for a general aim in connection with our needy students and does not simply cover the position which exists and which we have had up to the present in which businesses and certain State Departments and semi-State undertakings have made bursaries available to students on the specific understanding that those students have to bind themselves to those undertakings for a certain number of years. The disadvantage in regard to this system is that such student may feel inclined at the end of his period of study for his Batchelor&#x2019;s degree to continue his studies in order to obtain his Master&#x2019;s degree, but he is bound contractually and cannot study any further; or, after he has obtained his degree, he may perhaps feel that he wants to study at another institution but he is also prevented from doing so, with the result that he becomes frustrated. In this connection it is interesting to see what the recent Cilliers Commission has to say in regard to this type of bursary which binds students to certain undertakings. They say&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">The above types of scholarship and loan schemes are not primarily concerned with the identification, encouragement and reward of talent but with the attraction of an adequate supply of trained personnel. As such these schemes for the diversion and canalization of student choice along lines they would not otherwise have followed, to the detriment of other lines of study, is undeniably a reflection on the conditions of service in these sectors of the Public Service, especially in respect of salary scales.</block>

<block name="quote"> Attracting needy students by the doubtful device of offering comparatively lavish scholarships and loans may be a profitable temporary expedient to relieve a critical staff situation, but the real and permanent remedy lies rather in steady and open competition for the freely given services of the gifted and the trained&#x2026; Scholarship and loan systems of assistance should therefore seek to achieve lasting results by adhering to this <span class="col_8669-8670" refersTo="page_0669"/>basic principle, in preference to the fleeting success achieved by circumventing or ignoring it.</block>

<p>I feel convinced of the fact that this legislation makes provision whereby we shall be able to overcome this problem. It will also enable us to make use of the talent of our young people on a larger scale.</p>

<speech by="#barnett">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">BARNETT</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to raise just one matter with the Minister. I notice that the committee will include one person appointed by the Minister representing university colleges, and Clause 8 refers to consultation with the committee as to the basis on which bursaries shall be made available. I hope that this Bill will erase an anomaly which exists. I will just tell the Minister briefly what the position is and then he can tell me whether his Bill can ameliorate that position.</p>

<p>The position to-day is that we have the University of Cape Town and the University College at Bellville, but in terms of the Government&#x2019;s policy exemption can be granted to a Coloured student to go to the University of Cape Town if he wants to take a course which is not available at Bellville. But that student cannot get a bursary except from private associations because the Coloured Affairs Department only deals with bursaries for Coloured students to go to the University College, and the Public Service Commission, I am told, only deals with bursaries for Whites, and therefore the Coloured man who goes to the University of Cape Town to study, e.g., medicine, under an exemption cannot get any bursary. I sincerely hope that under this Bill that anomaly will be erased, and I ask the Minister to give that assurance so that the Coloured people may benefit under this Bill.</p>

<speech by="#mulder">

<from>*Dr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">MULDER</person>:</from>

<p>I want in a few brief words to welcome this measure in its final form. The Government has by means of this measure once again proved that it is a Government of action and deeds and not simply of words. The Government is making an amount of R500.000 available for this laudable purpose and this is something which in my opinion merits great praise. The position of South Africa is such that we have to take the only deals with bursaries for Whites, and there- have the manpower and leaders in the various spheres in order to fill these positions. This legislation is being passed timeously to enable us to utilize the cream of the crop of our students every year, students who can be assisted to complete their study careers without any difficulty. I feel that too strong pressure must not be brought to bear to provide that these bursaries should be free. I do not say that a man must pay while he is studying; I think that the money he receives can be made available to him interest-free while he is studying. But the fact that the student knows that he has to repay those loans has a very high educational value: it also stimulates the student. It is an excellent educational principle which we must continue to maintain. I also want to say that if these loans are repaid, the fund will continue to be strengthened. One group of students assists the next group in this way. I want to mention one last thought and that is the question of education in South Africa. I want to say that we have a position here in which the less wealthy student who has the necessary aptitude for further study has to go out to work and cannot continue his studies because of a lack of finance. I welcome this measure heartily.</p>

<speech by="#weiss">

<from>Mrs. <person refersTo="hansard_za">WEISS</person>:</from>

<p>Together with other members on this side of the House, I welcome this Bill. This Bill is the first step, which we on this side have advocated for years, to alleviate the shortage of trained manpower through bursary funds being allocated for needy students who wish to go to university. I feel that this is an important step in the right direction, but that the approach is wrong. Both the Minister of Education and the Minister of Finance have admitted that much larger sums were needed for the support of university students and while I fully support the establishment of this National Study and Bursary Fund, the Minister of Finance has passed the responsibility for financing this fund on to commerce and industry. I wish to make two points and I feel that in making them I shall be answering something that the hon. member for Stellenbosch (Mr. Smit) and the hon. member for Randfontein (Dr. Mulder) said earlier in connection with bursaries.</p>

<p>The Bill provides that companies can make donations to the fund up to a maximum of 1 per cent of their income and it was estimated that this will provide some R500.000, which will be available as study loans and bursaries. I must say that I have objections to this type of financing on two points. In the first place I feel that the full R500.000 should have been made available by the Government itself, and my second point is that this sum of R500,000 is entirely dependent on the benevolence of the companies. The principle of establishing this fund has been established, but I want to draw the Minister&#x2019;s attention to the fact that this is a small amount. We know that the fund will be approximately R 500.000, and here I would like to support the suggestion made by the hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) that certain other methods should be considered and employed in order to consider first of all more private donations to universities for bursaries such as is done in America. It is at the moment not easy for the private sector to contribute money for bursaries and universities. Only companies can claim tax deductions for such a donation and I feel that the private sector should be encouraged to support this fund if they are given, as they are in the U.S.A., a margin of up to 20 per cent of gross and not taxable income, and if that is deducted for tax purposes. The Minister should explore the American system.</p>

<p>The second point I wish to make is the fact that the Minister of Education himself, on <span class="col_8671-8672" refersTo="page_0670"/>his Vote, in connection with this very Bill, said that it was demoralizing for students to receive free bursaries. He said that at least part of the money should be provided to the student by way of a loan which he should repay when he starts working. The hon. member for Port Elizabeth (West) has already referred to this, and I wish to support what he said, in that loans to students very often tax his meagre financial resources when he has to repay them. But I take exception to the statement that bursaries are demoralizing to the student. I trust that when loans and bursaries are considered for these students, the Deputy Minister will take into consideration what this side of the House feels. There is a very real need for bursaries. I have come across cases of students whose work has been adversely affected when they know that they have to repay the loan and I am sure the Minister will agree with me that that is not what this Bill envisages. If the Deputy Minister wants to carry out the policy that part of the bursary must be in the form of a loan, much of the good work which this Bill can do will be nullified. I cannot believe that the Deputy Minister would willingly handicap the success of this Bill by the rigid application of the principle that part of bursaries in the form of loans should be repaid. It is not charity or poor relief that we wish to give to these students. We wish to alleviate the shortage of manpower, and we trust that the proper application of this Bill will do iust that.</p>

<p>There is general agreement on both sides of the House that this Bill, which has already been read a second time, is an excellent Bill, but it happens so often that when one gives this Government something good to handle it makes a mess of it; it is almost like giving a baby a box of chalk and then allowing it to scratch the wall. There is one difficult task that the hon. the Minister will have once this Bill has been passed, and that will be to frame regulations under this Bill. There is one thing against which he will have to guard; he will have to see to it that there is no partiality and that no improper influence is used in connection with the granting of these bursaries. I know that he will not make himself guilty of this, and I do not believe that there are members of his Department who would make themselves guilty of this, but I have evidence here which goes to show that there are certain forces which might well exercise improper influence in that direction, and I want to ask the hon. the Minister to bear that in mind when the regulations are framed. I have an extract here, which I should like to bring to the notice of the hon. the Minister briefly, from a secret document issued by a certain secret organization. I do not want to mention the name of that organization; It is not the Freemasons, nor is it the Sons of England nor is it Anglo-American. This secret circular letter reads as follows&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote"><i>Study bursaries&#x2019;.</i>Divisions (of this secret organization) are requested to furnish us as soon as practicable with the names and addresses of promising Afrikaans students, with matriculation mathematics, who would like to study engineering or who are already studying engineering and who need bursary loans. Friends who are connected with the granting of Government and other bursary loans would like to have this information.</block>

<p>In other words, this secret organization sends out a circular letter in which divisions are asked &#x201C;to submit the names of promising Afrikaans students because we know somebody who is connected with the granting of Government and other bursary loans.&#x201D; Sir, one can read a great deal into this. The hon. the Minister will not make himself guilty of anything of this kind, but I think before these regulations are drawn up it will be his duty to investigate this matter. If he wants a copy I shall try to get him a photostatic copy of this particular document.</p>

<p>Then just one further point: I am very pleased that the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) made a plea here for the granting of bursaries to Coloured students. Sir, the Coloured representatives, as we have seen throughout this Session, have done their duty towards the Coloureds.</p>

To give everything to students free, gratis and for nothing, is not in accordance with the point of view we adopt&#x2014;that we want persons who receive bursaries or loans to retain a feeling of self-respect. I do not think that it is necessary to argue that matter here again at this late stage.</p>

<p>I just want to tell the hon. member for Boland (Mr. Barnett) that this fund will be used for the benefit of White, Coloured, Indian and Bantu students. It will be the task of the Committee to work out a fair basis of allocation. I do not doubt for one moment that these bursaries will be granted on a fair basis.</p>

<p>The hon. member for Johannesburg (North) (Mrs. Weiss) said that the Minister was offloading his responsibility on to the industrialists. I just want to tell her that the Minister is actually giving the industrialists the opportunity to contribute to this fund. It will also be to their advantage to make use of this opportunity because we will be able to strengthen our manpower position by means of this fund. Industrialists will therefore also eventually benefit thereby, as will the whole of the country.</p>

<block name="quote">That the Bill be now read a second time.</block>

<p>Very briefly, Sir, the effect of this Bill is to bring the Natal divorce laws, so far as they concern divorce on the ground of malicious desertion, into line with the laws of the Republic. The Bill is brought forward, not with the intention of making it possible to obtain divorces more quickly or more easily in Natal, but in the interests of the administration of justice, because it is felt that all our divorce laws should be the same. I want to say that the Bar of Natal, the Durban Legal Association, i.e. the attorneys&#x2019; profession&#x2019;s association in Durban, and the Department of Justice in its latest report all agree with and support this measure. An amendment will be moved in the Committee Stage so as to exclude Section 10 of the Act which is here being repealed because Section 10 provides for property rights and need not be repealed in this regard. Sir, I want to give one example to indicate how ludicrous the position is at the moment: If you live in Volksrust but work in Charlestown, two towns very close to each other, but the one being in the Transvaal and the other in Natal, you can get your divorce on the grounds of malicious desertion without waiting any specified period. If you live in Charlestown, but work in Volksrust, then you have to wait 18 months before you can get a divorce on the ground of malicious desertion.</p>

<p><i>Motion of Appreciation of DistinguishedServices</i></p>

<speech by="#de_villiers_graaff">

<from>Sir <person refersTo="hanzard_za">DE VILLIERS GRAAFF</person>:</from>

<p>I wish to move as an unopposed motion&#x2014;</p>

<block name="quote">That this House places on record its appreciation of the distinguished services rendered to Parliament by the Hon. P. O. Sauer, Minister of Lands, of Forestry and of Public Works, in his capacity as Leader of the House of Assembly.</block>

<p>In so doing, I want to start by expressing my appreciation to you. Sir, for the wide manner in which you have interpreted the Rules of Parliament to make this motion possible. I think, in the spirit of the man of whom I am speaking, you have taken the view that rules are only made to be broken.</p>

<p>The object of this motion is to express our appreciation and good wishes to our friend&#x2014; not the hon. the Minister&#x2014;Paul Sauer in his capacity as Leader of this House. Sir, you will agree that in moving a motion of this kind I have to deal with a character with many facets and rather an unusual man. It has been my privilege to know Paul Sauer since I was a small boy. He probably does not remember, but I remember him as the most famous raconteur I have ever met. In fact, I am sure Hans Andersen was put in the shade by some of the stories I heard from Paul Sauer. His father and my father served in the same Cabinet, and I believe there was a great friendship between the families. It has always been a source of regret to me that Paul Sauer strayed so far that he and I have not been able to belong to the same party. (Laughter.) It is natural that I should be tempted to make this tribute a personal one, but my tribute to-day is to him in my capacity as Leader of the Opposition and of those members who sit with me on this side of the House.</p>

<p>We have seen and known him as a great Parliamentarian, a man guided at all times by a sincere love and affection for the institution of Parliament. Because he loved Parliament, he has graced Parliament, and he still graces Parliament, and I know he will continue to do so in future. We have learnt to know and respect him as a hard man, taking every ounce of advantage which he could obtain legitimately for his side, but the emphasis was always on the word &#x201C;legitimately&#x201D;. Paul Sauer drove us hard, but never unfairly or without regard for the rules and the chivalry of Parliament as we have learnt to know it in this House.</p>

<p>I think perhaps the greatest tribute to him are the new rules under which we now operate. I think after his tremendous experience of 35 years in Parliament as a member, many years as Chief Whip and now as Leader of the House, he has brought a wisdom and an understanding to the formulation of those new rules which are of inestimable value to the House and to future Parliaments. I think the result has been a very happy one and very successful from the point of view of every member during this Session who operated under what we regarded as an experiment, but a most successful one. Since last he was here his health has given him trouble. We are more than gratified to see that he is now over that hurdle. But I think that he has triumphed in an unusual way. Who, Sir, would have believed, when he left us, that he would have returned after having taken the extremely wise step of having remarried? (Hear, hear!) I believe that the felicity in his <span class="col_8677-8678" refersTo="page_0673"/>home will make his contribution in future ever greater. Next session he will return to us, he says, as an ordinary member. Sir, Paul Sauer can never be ordinary, not even in the technical sense. I think our wish to him is a long and happy life and a long stay with us still as an ordinary Member of Parliament. Winston Churchill was able to say: &#x201C;I am a child of the House of Commons&#x201D;, but I think Paul Sauer can say: &#x201C;I am a child of the House of Assembly.&#x201D; I think we would say he has been one of the fathers of our House and we owe him a very great debt of gratitude.</p>

<from>*The <person refersTo="hanzard_za">PRIME MINISTER</person>:</from>

<p>It gives me very great pleasure to second the motion moved by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition. This is the first time, in my personal experience, and perhaps the first time in the history of this House, that such a thing has ever happened. I want to express a special word of thanks to the Leader of the Opposition and his party for the fact that they saw fit to take the initiative in connection with this tribute. We appreciate it very much indeed. Other opportunities would have presented themselves on which we on this side of the House could have paid tribute to our colleague and friend and expressed our thanks to him. The fact that the Opposition took the opportunity to do so in this House is in itself an unusual occurrence and bears eloquent testimony to the fine spirit which prevails in the House of Assembly. I want to thank them very sincerely for having taken the initiative in this matter.</p>

<p>On behalf of my friend and colleague I also want to express his gratitude for the tributes which have already been paid to him and which will certainly still follow; I do so because I do not know whether he will heed the instructions of his medical advisers not to make a speech himself to-day. In an attempt to assist him I therefore take it upon myself to thank all members very cordially on his behalf for what has been said here.</p>

<p>In addition to that I want to add my own tribute on behalf of members on this side of the House. We are particularly indebted to him in this sense that our colleague and friend has probably sat in this House as a Nationalist longer than any one of us. He therefore deserves to be thought of in the first place not as the oldest person in this House in terms of years but probably as the oldest member of this Parliament. He became a member many, many years ago and he remained a member throughout many eventful years, a privilege accorded to very few people and one which was undoubtedly accorded to him because of the special qualities residing in him.</p>

<p>But, in the second place, we as a Parliament owe him a debt of gratitude because he served not only as a member of the House but as Opposition Whip when we sat on the other side and as Leader of the House after we came into power. He has rendered special services to this House therefore. In co-operation with the Opposition, he has always participated in the efforts to ensure the smooth functioning of the business of the House, a task in which he has succeeded brilliantly, as shown by the tributes paid to him here to-day.</p>

<p>But, in the third place, I want to pay tribute to him as a person who served his country as a member of the Cabinet. He served as a member of the Cabinet under what one might call three generations of Prime Ministers, first under Dr. Malan, who was like a father to him, under Advocate Strijdom, his contemporary and friend, and under me, a younger person, who was later called upon to serve in this capacity. To all three generations&#x2014; father, contemporary and younger person&#x2014; he gave his loyalty and co-operation and revealed a magnanimous spirit and, above all, a willingness to serve. It was his own desire to leave the Cabinet. To me his resignation from the Cabinet is a loss and it is a loss as far as the business of this House is concerned. I hope that he and his wife and his family will have the joy of greater rest in the future and that at the same time he will still be able to continue to serve his nation and his country.</p>

<speech by="#higgerty">

<from>Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">HIGGERTY</person>:</from>

<p>Mr. Speaker, as one of those who has been intimately connected with Mr. Sauer and his activities as a Whip and later as Leader of this House, I should like to say a word of appreciation, more particularly on behalf of the Whips on this side of the House. It was said a little earlier that Mr. Sauer might call himself a child of this Assembly. If I may be permitted to say so, I found him to be a very old-fashioned child, because it was at his feet that I learnt a great deal about Parliament when I was a Whip on the Government side and he was a Whip on the Opposition side. As has been emphasized, he legitimately indulged in all the contrivances, to put it that way, of the Opposition within the rules of the House and I had to learn my job very quickly. I am grateful to him. I believe he was overheard to say very recently that he and I know more about each other than either of us would care to say. In that long association I think an understanding has grown up as to how we approach the matters in regard to the arrangement of the business of the House, and the difficulties and problems that arise. I should like to pay this tribute to Mr. Sauer as Leader of the House that he has always been fair and just in the decisions and the arrangements that have been made, and if an arrangement was made and an agreement arrived at and we found that it was not working according to the understanding of our agreement, he was always prepared to meet the situation and adjust it according to the original intention. I think that shows great attributes and it has contributed very largely to the smooth working of the House.</p>

<p>It is said that Mr. Sauer has, as Leader of the House, left behind him the accomplishment of having achieved a major alteration in <span class="col_8679-8680" refersTo="page_0674"/>the Rules of the House, work that no predecessor was able to accomplish. There were attempts in the past to have these rules altered considerably, but there were such deep differences between the two main parties that it became impossible and there was more or less a deadlock, or if the alteration was made, it was made at the behest of the one side, which is not a very happy position. As Chairman of that Select Committee, Mr. Sauer was able to get away from that position, and with entire and unanimous agreement to alter the Rules of the House to everybody&#x2019;s satisfaction.</p>

<p>We have known Mr. Sauer in many facets. We looked upon him on occasions as an interjector. We also know him as an able negotiator in his office when he holds the meetings of Whips. I think the greatest attribute he has is almost an instinct for doing the right thing from the point of view of Parliament as a whole. His years of experience have given him this wisdom, and almost instinctively he knows what the right thing is to do. It therefore makes him a great Parliamentarian. He has in his bones the essence and spirit of Parliament, and he has worked not for party entirely but for the good of Parliament in his capacity as Leader of the House. I think that, if I may say so, is one of his greatest attributes, and as Whips and as members on this side of the House we add our sincere tribute to the tributes paid him here this afternoon.</p>

<speech by="#potgieter">

<from>*Mr. <person refersTo="hansard_za">J. E. POTGIETER</person>:</from>

<p>After hearing both sides of the House pay such high tribute to the outstanding and admirable qualities of the hon. the Leader of the House, the Minister of Lands, the question which I ask myself is this: What qualities have made him such a popular, such a valued and such an honoured Leader of this House? I think the answer lies in the fact that he has introduced into this House an attitude of mind, a parliamentary disposition, which is indispensable to the smooth functioning of the business of this House. We on this side of the House know that Minister Sauer has always acted in such a way that he has carried along with him not only the Whips on this side of the House but also the Whips on the other side of the House. He has always been assured of the co-operation of the Whips on both sides of the House. As the Chief Whip of the Opposition has correctly said, whenever Minister Sauer has had to take a decision he has always done so in a very judicious way. Sir, I appreciate the fact that the hon. the Leader of the Opposition moved this motion here to-day; it shows that we as members of this House also realize that an honourable person deserves to be honoured. I think the attitude which has always been adopted by our Parliamentary leader, Minister Sauer, is that the most honourable Parliamentarian is the Parliamentarian who is prepared to honour others and who acts in such a way that he never gives offence to other members. I think it is this fine Parliamentary spirit which has contributed so much to the excellent co-operation between the Opposition Whips and myself.</p>

<p>Reference has been made here to-day by hon. members on both sides to the new rules of Parliament. Sir, with the switch-over from the old to the new set-up in an attempt to bring our Parliamentary rules up to date, the hon. the Minister of Lands availed himself of the opportunity to modernize the rules of the House. This modernization of our rules has led to greater effectiveness and to the saving of valuable time. Not only did Minister Sauer apply this principle of saving valuable time in the political sphere, but a few days ago he also applied it in the sphere of romance!</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, you need not become perturbed; it is not my intention to propose a toast, but I want to say that in this sphere too the hon. the Leader of the House set an example to many older members and to younger members, particularly to the hon. member for Witbank (Mr. Mostert).</p>

<p>Mr. Speaker, the hon. the Minister of Lands has always said the parliamentary machine is highly specialized, intricate and delicate. The oil which is needed to make the parliamentary machine function is this fine parliamentary spirit which is so indispensable, and it is in this respect that the hon. the Leader of the House has set us such a fine example.</p>

<p>The Chief Whip of the Opposition has made reference to the spontaneous interjections made by the Leader of the House. In this connection may I just tell hon. members this little story: In 1944, a little more than 20 years ago when I came here. Minister Sauer was Chief Whip. One of the new members on the Government side stood up and made a fine maiden speech; nobody interrupted him, and just a few hours later he was on his feet again but on this occasion there were interjections. He practically lost his temper, became disconcerted and said to Mr. Speaker, who was then Mr. van Coller, &#x201C;Mr. Speaker, look how Opposition members are behaving; look how the Nationalists are behaving. I went along to rail some pigs (varke) the other day; the pigs ran away and the Nationalists stood there laughing at me; they refused to help me&#x201D;. Mr. Sauer, with his head resting on his bench, exclaimed, &#x201C;Ja, Oom Hans, ons het lankal gesien jy het van jou varkies verloor&#x201D; (Yes. Oom Hans, we realized long ago that you had a few screws loose). I mention this instance just as an example of his gift for spontaneous interjection and his brilliant sense of humour. Sir, I do not want to enlarge upon this. I just want to say to the Leader of the House that we wish him everything that is fine and good and we hope that the road ahead of him will be smooth and even.</p>

<p>I wish to say on behalf of the Coloured Representatives that it gives me very great pleasure indeed to associate myself with the praise showered upon and the high tributes paid to Mr. Paul Sauer this afternoon by the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and the hon. the Prime Minister. They are very <span class="col_8681-8682" refersTo="page_0675"/>well deserved tributes, Sir, Sir, I am a junior Whip, and I had quite a time with Mr. Sauer at the Whips&#x2019; meeting, but he managed me very well. If he could manage a man like Potty, then he can manage me, and he did so very well. I want to thank Mr. Sauer personally for his patience with me and for the help and guidance he has given me from time to time. What impressed me most about our friend, Mr. Paul Sauer, was his great impartiality at Whips&#x2019; meetings. It was not always very easy, and in saying this I am not giving away any secrets. Our friend, the Chief Whip on the Government side, sometimes comes to the House after having had a bad night before perhaps. Mr. Higgerty, the Chief Whip on this side, was always anxious to see that the rights of the Opposition were preserved and we found that Mr. Sauer then had to come to the rescue, and he always did. What Mr. Higgerty said here, namely that Mr. Sauer assisted more than anybody else to ensure the smooth working of this Parliament, is perfectly correct. He has always been an able man at the Whips&#x2019; meetings and he has always helped us, and we owe a debt of gratitude to him. I join with those who have wished him well. May he have very many years of good health and happiness in the future. Sir, in Mr. Sauer we have an able and outstanding parliamentarian. We know that, notwithstanding the fact that he will be vacating the position which he now occupies with such great distinction and honour, we will always be able to turn to him for kindly and fatherly advice. We wish you well, Mr. Sauer, and great joy and happiness together with your new wife.</p>

<p>In view of the conditions laid down by my medical advisers I feel that I should say no more than a few words. I must say that this is the first time in my career in this House that such a motion has been moved before the death of a member! I am not quite sure whether I am here or whether I am looking down from a higher sphere, where I hope to be one day&#x2014;because hope maketh not ashamed&#x2014;on what is taking place down here in the House of Assembly!</p>

<p>I want to express my sincere thanks in just a few words to the hon. the Leader of the Opposition and to the hon. the Prime Minister (the mover and the seconder of this motion) and to the other members who have spoken here. They do not realize how much I appreciate what they have said here. I appreciate it very much indeed. I just want to say too that if I succeeded perhaps in making the business of the House function more smoothly than it would have functioned otherwise, then it is due to the assistance that I received from the Whips of the various parties.</p>

<p>As far as the new rules are concerned, I may perhaps be called the father of the new rules, but a father usually has very little to do with the rearing of a child; his duties are soon over. (Laughter.) The greatest contribution came from the members of the Table of the House after I had set the ball in motion, if I may put it that way. They did most of the work after I had done the preparatory work, and it was the spirit which prevailed in the Select Committee which sat last year and again this year that made it possible for us to introduce these new rules. I think the new rules are proving a success. I am pleased that my last task as Leader of the House was to set in motion the work in connection with the framing of the new rules and I am pleased to see that they are proving a success. I think this was a fine job, one of which all of us who had something to do with can well be proud.</p>

<p>I should like once again to thank everybody very sincerely for the spirit underlying this motion and say to hon. members that they have no idea how much I appreciate it.</p>
